===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Cummins Incorporated First Quarter Earnings Release. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like the turn the call over to your host, Mr. Chris Clulow, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the first quarter of 2025. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that, some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation is available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I'll turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from our press release and earnings material, we delivered very strong results in the first quarter, led by record performance in our Power Systems segment. We are entering unchartered territory as the trade tariffs start to have a more significant impact beginning in the second quarter. The breadth and changing nature of the tariffs have introduced a great degree of uncertainty and mean that at this time, we are unable to predict with confidence our expected performance for the year. It is important to note that we serve many different end markets, some with long backlogs and clear secular themes in our Power Systems business, some less sensitive to short-term economic sentiment such as our Aftermarket business and other markets where customers tend to flex demand more quickly when business confidence weakens. The duration of uncertainty and extent of tariffs will influence how much and for how long demand is impacted. Cummins is in a strong position, strategically and financially, with an experienced leadership team, well-versed in navigating through periods of uncertainty. We look forward to restoring our guidance when we have more stability in the outlook. Now I will move on to some of our highlights from our first quarter. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will then provide an update on how uncertainties in our current environment may impact our end markets. Mark will then take you through more details of our first quarter financial performance. In the first quarter, we continued to make progress in the execution of our Destination Zero strategy. In our Engine segment, we introduced the much anticipated X10 as a part of our Cummins HELM platforms. This engine replaces both the L9 and X12 engine platforms and will deliver a new level of performance, durability and efficiency for heavy and medium-duty customers. Alongside the X15 and B Series, the X10 provides customers with the power solution to meet their unique operational requirements while maintaining the performance and reliability for which Cummins is known. In addition, we unveiled the new Cummins B7.2 diesel engine that brings the latest technology and advancements to one our most proven platforms. The new engine will feature a slightly higher displacement and is designed to be a global platform, which creates flexibility for different applications and duty cycles. Both the B7.2 and X10 engines will be manufactured at Rocky Mount Engine Plant in North Carolina and will go into production in North America in 2027. In our Power Systems segment, we announced the acquisition of assets of First Mode, a leader in retrofit hybrid solutions for mining and rail operations. This technology represents the first commercially available retrofit hybrid system for mining equipment, significantly reducing total cost of ownership while advancing decarbonization and operations. This acquisition reinforces Cummins' commitment to providing innovative and effective decarbonization solutions while meeting the needs of our customers on their transition to a lower carbon future. Lastly, our Accelera by Cummins segment announced a supply of 100 megawatts proton exchange membrane or PEM electrolyzer system for bp's Lingen green hydrogen project in Germany. The hydrogen generation system will be the largest electrolyzer system assembled by Accelera to date and will be manufactured in Accelera new electrolyzer plant in Spain. Once fully commissioned in 2027, the 100-megawatt electrolyzer system will produce up to 11,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2025 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions, offset by softening in the North America truck market. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.2 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2024. EBITDA was $1.5 billion or 17.9% compared with $2.6 billion or 30.6% a year ago. First quarter 2024 results included a gain net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture and $29 million of restructuring expenses. Excluding the 1x gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as restructuring expenses, EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2024. This improvement in profitability was driven by the benefit of higher power generation and aftermarket volumes, pricing and operational efficiency, which more than exceeded the impact of lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus. For our Power Systems business, in particular, we had record performance in both EBITDA dollars and percentage in the first quarter as we continue to benefit from operational improvements and strong end markets. Our first quarter revenues in North America decreased by 1% compared to 2024. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks for the first quarter was 63,000 units, down 18% from 2024 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were down 21,000 or 21% from 2024. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 32,000 units in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 21%, while our unit sales were 31,000, down 14% from 2024. We shipped 29,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their ramp pickups in the first quarter of 2025, down 25% from 2024 level. Revenues for North America power generation increased by 12%, driven primarily by continued strong data center demand. Our international revenues decreased by 5% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.8 billion, an increase of 9% as accelerating data center demand and high domestic infrastructure demand more than offset lower export demand. Industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China was 294,000 units, a decrease of 4% from last year. Our sales in units, including joint ventures, were 42,000, an increase of 6%. Industry demand for excavators in China in the first quarter was 61,000 units, an increase of 23% from 2024 levels. Our units sold were 11,000, an increase of 19%. The increase in the China market size is primarily due to domestic cyclical replacement demand, rural development and farmland renovation demand. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 68% in the first quarter due to accelerating data center demand. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $725 million, a decrease of 14% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production was flat with 2024. Power generation revenues decreased by 11% in the first quarter as the prior year included a pre buy ahead of emissions regulations change. To summarize, we achieved impressive results in the first quarter with record financial performance in our Power Systems business. Looking ahead, there's heightened uncertainty about the pace of growth in the global economy due to tariffs, which could negatively impact demand for capital goods. Absent more clarity about the likely duration of elevated tariffs, we are not able to provide a reliable forecast for the remainder of this year. As a large U.S. headquartered company with significant manufacturing in the U.S, we appreciate the administration support for American manufacturing. This support is crucial as we invest more than $1 billion in our engine and power systems manufacturing operations in the U.S. over the next few years, employing people in nearly every state through our manufacturing plants and sales and service branches. As we evaluate our current manufacturing footprint and our exposure to tariff regulations, we believe we are well-positioned because we primarily produce engines and gensets in the markets where we sell them. For instance, our medium duty, heavy duty and high horsepower engines, as well as power generation products for U.S. customers, are manufactured in our plants located in Indiana, North Carolina, New York and Minnesota. However, like much of our industry, our component and supplier manufacturing would be affected by current tariff regulations, which could disrupt the global economy and ultimately lead to higher costs for consumers. In addition to trade and economic uncertainty, there is also uncertainty in North America emissions regulations for 2027. We continue to expect New NOx regulation to go in place in 2027 and are focused on launching our products on schedule, while also working with the administration as they explore options to lower the cost of existing regulations. While we believe our product plan is well-positioned, the uncertainty in regulation along with economic uncertainties have led to a weaker than anticipated recent order and also has made pre buy for the second half of the year unlikely. In summary, we had a strong first quarter and continued our progress in improving EBITDA margins as we shared in our Analyst Day almost a year ago, with tariffs not a significant factor in our results. The economic environment has changed significantly over the past three months. We have an experienced leadership team that has demonstrated capability in managing through periods of uncertainty, and we will maintain focus on our customers, our employees and shareholders. We enter this period of heightened uncertainty in a position of strength and look forward to reinstating our guidance when some of the uncertainty has subsided. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith : Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong revenue and profitability in the first quarter. First quarter revenues were $8.2 billion, down 3% from a year ago. Sales in North America decreased 1%, while international revenues declined 5%. The separation of Atmus in mid-March and the prior year resulted in year over year sales decline of around 4% to the total consolidated sales, meaning that we were close to flat on an underlying basis. EBITDA was $1.5 billion or 17.9% of sales for the quarter compared to $2.6 billion or 30.6% of sales a year ago, which of course included a 1x gain on the divestiture of the Atmus business of $1.3 billion net of transaction costs. Also a year ago, we incurred $29 million of restructuring expenses. To provide clarity on operational performance and allow comparison to the prior year, I'm excluding the 1x gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus and the restructuring expenses in my following comments. EBITDA was $1.5 billion or 17.9% of sales for the quarter compared to adjusted $1.3 billion or 15.5% of sales a year ago. The higher EBITDA was driven by higher power generation and aftermarket volumes, positive price cost driven by operational improvements, partially offset by lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus. Now let's look at each line item a little more. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 26.4% of sales, up from $2.1 billion or 24.5% last year. The improved margins were driven by favorable pricing, higher aftermarket and operational improvements, especially in Power Systems. Selling, administrative and research expenses were $1.1 billion or 13.6% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 13.8% of sales a year ago. Joint venture income of $131 million, increased $8 million from the prior year, primarily driven by higher technology fees within our engine business and higher volumes in our Cummins Chongqing joint venture within Power Systems. Other income was $23 million, compared to $21 million from the prior year, as gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance more than offset the negative impact of foreign currency revaluation. Interest expense was $77 million, a decrease of $12 million from the prior year, primarily driven by a lower average debt balance, as a result of the separation of Atmus and lower weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.9%, including $7 million or $0.05 per diluted share of favorable discrete tax items. All-in, net earnings for the quarter were $824 million or $5.96 per diluted share compared to $2 billion or $14.03 per diluted share a year ago, which includes the net gain on the separation of Atmus, which was $1.3 billion or $9.08 per diluted share and restructuring expenses of $29 million or $0.15 per diluted share. But hopefully, we've now lapped all of those exclusions and adjustments and look forward to having less words around those in future quarters. All-in operating cash flow was an outflow of $3 million compared to an inflow of $276 million a year ago, primarily driven by higher working capital. Now let me comment a little more on segment performance. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were $2.8 billion a decrease of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA was 16.5%, up from 14.1% a year even on the lower truck volumes. The Engine business benefited from pricing related to the launch of updated products in our Light Duty segment, stronger aftermarket volumes, operational efficiencies, good cost control and a modest increase in joint venture income. Components segment revenue was $2.7 billion a decrease of 20%, while EBITDA, excluding costs related to the separation of Atmus decreased to 14.3% from 14.8% a year ago, as lower on highway demand in North America and Europe and the diluted impact of Atmus separation were partially offset by the benefit from operational efficiencies. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to $2.9 billion. EBITDA also increased as a percent of sales to 12.9% compared to 11.6% of sales a year ago, driven by higher power generation volumes, higher aftermarket and favorable pricing. In the Power Systems segment, revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 19%. And EBITDA was a record increasing from 17.1% to 23.6% of sales, driven by strong volume, particularly in data center applications and rebuilds, favorable pricing and continued focus on operational improvement. Accelera revenues increased 11% to $103 million, driven by increased e-mobility sales and electrolyzer installations arising from prior period orders. Our EBITDA loss was $86 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $101 million a year ago, as we lowered costs in existing operations, partially offset by additional losses in the Amplify Cell joint venture as it advances its operations. In summary, we delivered impressive profitability for the first quarter even as demand in North America truck markets declined. Uncertainty has increased due to trade tariffs, resulting in a slowdown in the global movement of goods, particularly between China and the U.S. It remains to be seen how long the tariffs remain in place and the impact that they have on business confidence and the demand for capital goods. Cummins is in a strong financial position to navigate through uncertainty. With our industry leading portfolio of products and our global network, we are well placed to support our customers. We look forward to reinstating our outlook when the economic conditions become clearer, along with hopefully a return to growth and greater prosperity here in the U.S. and in the global economy. In the meantime, we'll continue to focus on areas we can control in managing costs and optimizing working capital, while meeting our customer commitments. We'll stay focused on our strategic priorities in what is likely to be a more complex operating environment in the coming months as the full impact of the current tariff levels has not yet been felt in our opinion. I want to close my prepared remarks by thanking Chris Clulow for his leadership in Investor Relations. He's moving to a new finance leadership role in operations and supply chain and will remain a key advisor to me and our business leaders as we navigate through the current challenges. Congratulations to Nick Arens in assuming the Investor Relations role. Nick and I look forward to meeting with investors and analysts in person in the coming weeks and months. We're very fortunate to have such a strong finance team at Cummins. Now, let me turn it back over to Chris.
Chris Clulow : Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Cook with Truist Securities.
Jamie Cook: Hi. Good morning and nice quarter. I guess just my first question, understanding you're not providing guidance, but based on what's been announced so far, is there any way you can sort of help us quantify the gross or net tariff cost, you know what I mean, that would impact your business and which segments are impacted the most? And then, I guess my second question, just trying to understand, which businesses have the most visibility like where your backlog sits today, and just how you're handling pricing, just concerned with some of the businesses that have greater backlog, perhaps there's pricing risk associated with tariffs?
Mark Smith: Thanks, Jamie. I'll answer the first question and pass it on to, Jen. We're not -- it's a very uncertain set of circumstances given the changing and evolving nature of the tariffs, so we're not going to quantify that today. Quite frankly, the bigger concern is the broader impact on the overall economic level environment. We've taken the steps without knowing what the tariffs were going to be. We've taken what steps we could to try and mitigate the impact. But beyond that, to the extent that we incur tariffs, we're going to have to pass those on. We will, of course, as we get into actual results, share what the impact of tariffs is going to be. There's inevitably going to be some lag between cost and recovery, and we'll provide more color going forwards.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. And in terms of what we're seeing in different markets, as I noted, we do have some different markets that we expect to be impacted in different ways by uncertainty in the economy. So we have a multi-year order board in our Power Generation business and where there are customers that want to cancel or push out builds, we're able to reallocate those to other customers. So for the foreseeable future, we're feeling pretty confident in that part of the business. Aftermarket, of course, as customers may delay purchase decisions that can drive aftermarket business for us. And the real market that is very sensitive is in the Engine business and Components, some of those on highway markets and we're seeing that, right? You saw that on Friday with the heavy duty truck orders for April where customers are waiting to see what happens and pausing in many cases on placing orders for new trucks. And so it's a little bit varied in different parts of our business with a big question of what will happen over the next couple of months. As Mark said, we're looking at passing on tariff costs where we can't mitigate those and continuing to invest in our new products and price for value that we're able to offer through those.
Mark Smith: It's certainly not a case that we're seeing a widespread change in short-term momentum. There are obviously pockets where uncertainty seems to be more evident and if that lack of clarity let us to believe that right thing to do right now is withdraw guidance versus constantly tweaking it for every latest change in momentum. So we didn't do that lightly. It's not we're not trying to foreshadow anything other than that the uncertainty is high, but it's very much varied, and hopefully there's going to be a change and we'll be happy to reinstate that guidance as quickly as we can.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning everyone and Chris and Nick, congratulations. I want to ask in Power Systems, really fantastic performance from [Indiscernible] basis and also relative to the Analyst Day targets sitting here today, obviously, got some volatility on cost over next year. But can you talk about where we should be thinking about margins moving forward for this business is the level of performance that we saw in this quarter, should we be thinking about that as the run rate going forward as we think about what incremental volumes could look like over the next couple of years once we do get through this low visibility spot, Mark, that you spoke to?
Mark Smith : Yes. First, thanks and good morning, Jerry. What I'd say is there are no significant one-off items in those results, so those are pure operating results. Of course, they're going to depend to some extent on the ebbs and flows of demand in individual segments. The only thing I'd point to in those results is that the aftermarket sales were very high. They're probably higher than we would have anticipated three months ago. So that right now, that's the only thing that I would say looks, yes, probably higher than we expected. But other than that, the business has made tremendous improvement and it's continued to improve quarter-on-quarter. I would say the results were a little bit better than we expected, but mostly down to the strength in aftermarket, not the underlying performance of the business. So again, as long as the demand trends continue, then it will be continuing a push to maintain very strong margins and improve where we can.
Jerry Revich: Super. And then separately, you mentioned, Jennifer, in the prepared remarks, just the uncertainty around EPA27. In the scenario that EPA27 doesn't move forward, can you just talk about Cummins' response in that environment because obviously you folks have invested a lot in the next engine family and how should we think about potential contract renegotiations 27 plus if we don't get a changeover with your large customers on highway?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, great. Thanks, Jerry. Our current view is likely we'll see revision and a rulemaking process around greenhouse gas Phase 3. And so those regulations will change from what we have currently on the books and those go into effect, of course, starting in 2030. We still anticipate a NOx regulation in 2027. We're actively working with EPA on their work to look at opportunities to lower cost and impact of those. And probably one likely thing that will be looked at is this requirement for a longer emissions warranty that customers purchase. So today customers have the option when they buy a new vehicle to purchase an extended warranty. Some of them do in particular in heavy duty, but the regulations as they are today would require everybody to purchase that. So we're continuing to invest in bringing these new platforms to market with that 27 regulation. It's difficult for me to speculate beyond that on other changes. But of course, if there are further changes, we'll look at revisiting what we're launching. But we intend to continue to launch as planned currently.
Mark Smith: Right. And that's the same question for all engine manufacturers, right? The whole industry has been investing in new products that we're all wondering, hoping for clarity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley.
Angel Castillo: Thank you for taking my question. Listen, I know it's incredibly a lot of or a lot of uncertainty out there, incredible amount of uncertainty and just very wide range of outcomes. But I was wondering if you could perhaps talk a little bit more about one specific scenario for 2Q, meaning, there's tariffs that are already in place today that you have a little bit more visibility to. So if we just kind of put aside maybe some of the reciprocal or areas that are paused, can you just talk to what is the impact or kind of margin and sales volume that you kind of see, based on orders backlog in terms of paying today for 2Q? Just want to get a better sense kind of directionally what that implies very near-term accepting that you're in term there might be more?
Mark Smith: What I will say is, the impact of tariffs on our financial results in Q1 was immaterial. So those results that you saw, which were very strong, had essentially close to zero financial impact. So that's going to change, right. It's going to change and it's probably -- it's going to change month-to-month as we certainly as we start to go through the second quarter, probably it's contributing to the biggest degree of uncertainty for the second half of the year in terms of the demand outlook. There's uncertainty now, but the visibility into the second half is, we're not going to -- we will give the impacts of the tariffs as we go along in our financial results. Needless to say, I would say, it's going to build over the next few months. There will be some lag inevitably between ordering, incurring, mitigating and recovering all of those costs. So I would say, the second half, it will going to see the fullest impact, assuming the tariffs remain as they are, which is a big assumption. Hopefully it's not a good assumption, but if we make it as an assumption, then you're going to start to see the fuller impact on consumers of equipment, and suppliers in the second half of the year. So we will update you as we go along, but there's a lot of work going on, a lot of moving parts. I know everyone wants to do these calculations. I will just step back and say, our broader concern is on the demand of the economic environment and the overall level of demand. The tariffs will be significant for Cummins on cost basis based on where they are right now. We've got plans to manage through that and we'll provide that to you going forward. But as we said at the start, we've taken steps to mitigate where we incur them, we'll be looking to pass them on. There'll be some lag impact.
Angel Castillo: Understood. That's very helpful. And maybe just a little bit of a bigger picture question. Just the Power Systems, you talked about some of the -- if I heard correctly, just some of the aftermarket strength and particularly on the datacenter side, I tend to think about this kind of large backup generators as not really having a lot of aftermarket in the first place and again in that data center piece. So could you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of what's driving the aftermarket parts demand growth in Power Systems? And to the extent that you're seeing maybe more purchases of aftermarket related to maybe the data centers, what does that tell you about how your assets are being run? If it's -- is there some kind of maybe substituting for prime power wherever there is sort of a more of a shortage or any other factors that might impact how your assets are being used?
Mark Smith: Yes, I appreciate the question. I think what's happening with Power Systems, which is I understand why I'm not being critical, like the lens is all zoned in on data centers. What you see in aftermarket parts is the use of all of the applications, mining, oil and gas, marine, gen power gen for the broader economy, rebuild activity, all those things are contributing and in fact some price increases and aftermarket are all contributing to the strong revenue. It is not a data center driven phenomenon in the moment. Eventually, there will be some parts consumption on this, but it will be nothing like a mining engine or a frac rig. So I just wanted to clear that up. And I would just take this opportunity to remind people, the performance improvement in the Power Systems business is not driven by fair wins in the data center, right. There's been a broad based improvement. We're very appreciative of the opportunity to serve the data center customers and that's positive for our business. But the Power Systems leadership team has done a great job in driving margins in most parts of what they do below the surface. So I just want to make sure we're enthusiastic about data center demand. We're not changing that enthusiasm. But this is a much bigger story, the improvement, and the aftermarket really relates to what's gone on in years before. I hope that helped him.
Jennifer Rumsey : And maybe just one other reminder as we think about the Power Systems business and its markets is there's a strong partnership between Power Systems and our distribution business. So just in PowerGen, about half of the revenue shows up in Power Systems, the other half in the distribution business similar in aftermarket, the distribution business plays an important role in the service that's provided to those customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Thein with Raymond James.
Tim Thein: Thank you. Good morning. And Mark, it was nice of Chris to cook up these new snazzy slides on his way. So it was good.
Mark Smith: They told me I was very old fashioned.
Tim Thein: Yeah. Not used to this, new look. Just on Mark on the business, maybe we can dig a bit more on the margin performance there and specifically on, you mentioned aftermarket being a contributor, so maybe just a comment in terms of your expectation for parts as we look forward. And then, I guess related to that on the JV income, I know those technology fees can move around a bit, but that was a nice tailwind. What just as the think about kind of the balance of the year, if you're still expecting this is not just the engine business, but JV income to be a headwind to profits for the year, is that still the expectation just given some of the uptick in China? So thank you. Those are my two part question.
Mark Smith: Engine business, yeah. So engine business margins were up, right? And we've been of course, we set out our stall for improving margins. In the current quarter, relative to the prior year, JV income, as you said, improved from some of the tech fleets. They're going to be lumpy, probably won't continue at that rate. China, haven't been seeing any dramatic changes in demand for some time. Past looking comment, not a forward-looking comment. It's been pretty steady. So yes, probably a little could be a little bit lower going forward. Product coverage or warranty, as many people refer to it, has been an enormous success story over multiple years, of which the engine is the biggest driver of that. That really helped in the second quarter. For the company, our product coverage costs were 1.9% in the quarter. Normally, we'd be looking in the 2% to 2.5% range, so that was a real positive. We saw strong parts demand, it remains to be -- we hope parts demand will remain resilient as we work through this period of uncertainty, but we don't know. We've got some additional pricing where we launched products in the light duty part of the business. So, there were many ingredients to the engine business improvement, but, of course, the full year -- so we can say we're off to a good start. We of course were expecting, like others, some accelerating truck demand in the second half of the year. And right now, the momentum, you've seen the truck orders, you don't need me to tell you the momentum has been going in the wrong way, so we'll have to see. But overall, yes, at a good start, there are a number of factors, some of which may continue, some of which may fade. Volume is going to be the big question, I think from here.
Jennifer Rumsey: And I just want to remind you, as you look at overall really strong performance in Q1, even with softening in North America truck, we remain focused on the key areas we've been talking to you about, including in our last Analyst Day, even as we manage through uncertainty and tariffs and work to mitigate tariffs. So improving gross margin in the business, we have growing aftermarket population that allows that aftermarket market revenue to continue to grow over time, and we're still investing in critical areas. We continue to invest in capacity expansion in the Power Systems business and these next-generation engine platforms, while also monitoring pace of decarbonization and regulation and pacing investment in other areas. And so, we continue to be focused on that even as we navigate through this uncertain time.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI.
David Raso: Hi, thank you. The comment earlier about more worried about demand destruction, just curious, a very understandable view just from a broad macro view, I can appreciate that. But I'm just curious, are these comments based off of already communicating maybe what your cost increases would need to be and a pushback from your truck customers, or is it even the end user of the truck saying, ''Hey, at that price increase, we'll cancel backlog?'' I'm just curious how much is this a ready sort of floated price increase that would be needed to cover your cost that's getting that reaction, or, again, is it more just a broad and again understandable, just a broad macro view of course these tariffs can hurt the economy?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. David, what I'd say it's really uncertainty and a broader thing. I was at ACT Expo a week ago today, talked to many both OEM and fleet customers. They just don't know, right? They're just waiting, because there's huge amount of uncertainty on what's going to happen both economically and with tariffs. And so, that's really it. It's the wait-and-see.
David Raso: And that said, I know you don't want to go into a real exact quantification, but just to level set everybody, can you help us with your greatest exposures to cost, be it 6%, 7% of global COGS is Mexico and China, something like that so we can at least quantify it? And at the same time, hopefully, if the tariffs come down, quantify in a positive way? And also, what mitigating factors have already been put in place, or at least are imminent based off the tariffs of today?
Mark Smith: Yes, I'm just going to be honest and say I'm not going to answer all of those questions for some of the reasons I said earlier. What I can say is, our U.S. on highway engine plants, our MCA complied, right. So in the terms of the operations that we do for our on highway markets, which is the largest proportion of our business, we're in many markets, but that's the largest proportion. We are MCA compliant for all of those large engine plants. It's really what happens here from these tariffs. Yes, there's some exposure to China. Yes, there's some exposure to Mexico. Yes, there's some exposure to all some of the other countries as well. But we're going to quantify that on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We're working through all of that with suppliers, with customers, and we'll provide an update as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, good morning. It was a remarkable quarter on margin on a lot of fronts and I understand the comments within Power System on all the work you've done. Nonetheless, I do have a data center question. You mentioned China, I wonder if you'd be willing to sort of talk about for one, I don't not 100% sure how you serve data centers there, whether it's direct or through JV? And two, I wonder if you could provide any context or color around size geographically in the data center market or momentum et cetera? Is this largely a U.S. phenomenon or are there other areas that are importantly big?
Jennifer Rumsey: Well, the trends that are driving data center growth are global trends, right, increasing use of AI, data storage going into cloud digitization. And so those underlying trends are global trends. Our market we have global markets, but in particular, U.S. and China have been areas where we've seen a lot of growth. And like we serve the U.S. market through our U.S. plants, we primarily serve the China market through plants in China including joint venture plants that we have there.
Chris Clulow : Yeah, just to add on that Rob, the primary backup gensets in China are run with the 60 liter engines, which are made in our Cummins Chongqing engine plant there. So, that's the primary source.
Mark Smith : Yeah. And like other major markets, we are one of the very leading players, right? It's a very select group of companies that are relied upon in this industry for backup power.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kyle Menges with Citigroup.
Kyle Menges: Thank you. Jen, I wanted to touch on the comment you made just about the PowerGen business and you had just mentioned about cancellations and push-outs and being able to reallocate those orders. Hypothetical or is that something that you're seeing today?
Jennifer Rumsey : We're not seeing significant changes, but it's not atypical for some of that to happen, which we have seen. And as I said, we have when it happens and expect that we continue to be able to reallocate. We have a lot of customers that would like us to deliver some of these products sooner, than is currently scheduled. And so I wouldn't describe it as a broad trend, but a limited one that we're seeing.
Mark Smith: And another one, it's the business with the least visibility to any changing economic sentiment overall so far.
Kyle Menges: Right. Makes sense. And then could you guys just touch on a little bit any sort of tariff mitigation actions you've taken already? And then just any mitigation steps you're exploring? And can you remind us, is there any sort of tariff pass through baked into any of your contracts? That would also be helpful.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So, of course, mitigating when there's a high degree of uncertainty is a little bit tricky because we're waiting to have a little bit more clarity on what where tariffs will go over time. What I would say is we have done some mitigation through inventory strategies, where we anticipated we would see higher tariffs and we have dual sourcing in some of our supply base. So that's -- there's some no regrets moves that we're taking now. And then as we continue to have more clarity on what tariffs will look like, we may make changes in the dual sourcing. There's places where there are other options, but it will take time to develop alternatives. So it's really a bit of a mix. But as you can imagine, we have an extensive strategy and work underway looking at options and determining when we action those.
Mark Smith: And as we said, we're working through all of this, which I think if you're not in the business, it'd be hard to appreciate how much work it is for supply chain and other groups. Yes, we're working through all of that with suppliers and customers right now. So we're not going to comment anymore.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. My first question is on price cost. Are you able to share what price cost was in the first quarter?
Mark Smith: Yes. So we had about 2% well, almost exactly 2% gross margin improvement year-over-year, of which we had about 3% of price cost improvement and 1% of negative volume impacts. That price cost impact varies quite a lot between segment and you can figure that out from some of the improvements we've driven over time. And costs includes many things including the improved warranty cost over time. But that's the macro picture.
Tami Zakaria: Understood. That's very helpful. And then the second question is, I understand Cummins engines are primarily made in the U.S. for the U.S., which is great news long term, given all that's going on. But for the distribution and component segments, are those primarily made in the U.S. as well or what's the mix of imports that serve the U.S. market for those two segments?
Mark Smith: The distribution business is really just reselling parts from the rest of the company. So it depends on the different applications. Components, we've got manufacturing facilities in the after treatment systems in Wisconsin, turbo-chargers that are made in Charleston, but it's the supply base and some of the suppliers that we use that bring more of that exposure, if we want to use that word. So that's where the complexity comes in from the tariffs. It's not -- I mean, that's what I would say.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS.
Steven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning and impressive quarter. I think you said that you are on-track with the timing of your product launches. Can you just clarify kind of some of the timing of those launches that you had in mind, particularly around the 2027 engine and then how the outcome of these NOx rules may impact the timing there?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. As I said, right now, we have not changed our launch plans on any of those products. We are planning to launch the new 10 liter and the B7.2 in 2027 as those regulations go in place. And we plan to launch the X15 diesel version in the 2026 timeframe. We'll have a kind of a split strategy across the year with the current X15 and the new one. Remember, we already have launched the natural gas variant of that new platform. And the diesel version is going to bring significant fuel efficiency improvement, so value to the customer that we believe is worth bringing into the market early. So that's our plan.
Steven Fisher: Terrific. And then just in terms of the guidance, curious kind of what do you think you need to see in order to actually reinstate the guidance? Is it actual kind of signed trade agreements? Or what degree of certainty do you think you need to be able to bring that guidance back?
Mark Smith : What I would say is few more data points would be helpful, right? I mean the April truck orders I would describe as disappointing. So is that something that can move back to a normal trend level? What do we see I mean these tariffs are designed to be disruptive to trade, right? I mean that's what tariffs are designed to be disruptive to trade, right? I mean that's what they're designed for and we've seen that significant slowing certainly of freight activity into the West Coast that directly impacts ultimately road freight here in the U.S. And then what -- even as things -- let's hope they stabilize, improve, we've caused a slowing of the global supply chain. That's what happens. Things are queuing up at ports and then it just takes a long time to write that momentum. And I think if you're not in the industry that may be underappreciated. And so the less time the uncertainty is in place, then the more quickly I think we'll have greater clarity and confidence. And the longer it's in place then it'll just make it more difficult. Ultimately, we're not going to continue forever without guidance, but we'll get a sense of where purchases of capital goods, whether their confidence is shaken or whether it's a temporary pause and we get back on and we actually start to see more positive economic activity. Right now there's not in the again, we're not trying to comment on the whole of the global economy or even the whole of the U.S. economy, we're just commenting on the slices that we see and uncertainty has gone up. So we want to see a few more data points on the broader economy, specific certainly to on Highway as a ranking, but those would be helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein.
Chad Dillard: Hey, good morning, guys. So totally appreciate that it's difficult to quantify the impact of tariffs, but I was hoping you could lay out a time line for that impact on the P&L. So how much component inventory did you pull forward? When does it run out? When will you need to raise price to offset the cost? And then if you could share the percentage of U.S. COGS that are imports?
Mark Smith : Yeah, way too many things to give because there's way too many variables. What I'll say is, just to remind you, no impact really in the first quarter given the pause in some of the tariffs and the escalation and some mitigation actions, we're going to start to see creeping and growing impact even yet as the second quarter unfolds here. There's inevitably going to be some lags between what we see, what we anticipate, what actually happens and then all the work that's going on with customers and suppliers. So that's the reason why. But we will when we get to the second quarter results and going forward to tell you what the impact is and hopefully we've got more clarity then, but we'll certainly tell you what the impact was in the second quarter and what we think is going to happen to that run rate as we go through the rest of the year. But I think what -- nobody has absolute certainty on the direct flow of every single widget, right through the supply chain, so that's still evolving. And we're not alone, right? We're not the only manufacturer of engines, powertrains and power systems in our markets.
Chad Dillard: Got it. Okay. So just one more. So just on Section 232, assuming that does eventually get applied, how does that impact your relative positioning? And from your perspective, like, would you consider it good, bad, or neutral versus the status quo of what we are right now?
Jennifer Rumsey: So for those that maybe haven't been paying attention, maybe you've all been paying attention maybe 232, the U.S. Commerce Department launched 232 investigation two weeks ago on foreign production of medium and heavy duty trucks and parts. And so, that has the potential to result in additional tariffs on trucks and parts that come from outside the U.S. Of course, we've seen an announcement of we're in the middle of the public comment period and we'll be providing comments of course as a part of that and just emphasizing the U.S. manufacturing that we make and advocating for exemptions on imports to U.S. manufacturing through a robust exemption process and ensuring that we reflect the impact that any tariffs could have on the underlying U.S. economy. So stay tuned there, but that's the potential with 232 investigation.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Kauffman: Thank you and thank you for signing me in here and Chris, it's been great working with you and Nick look forward to getting to know you. Mark, thank you for all the detail that you were able to give. I have one on currency. Given that so much of your business occurs outside the U.S., was currency translation a good guy, a bad guy? Can you give us an idea of magnitude? And then, you explain the price increase on the light duty engines well with the new product at Stellantis. Can we talk a little bit more about the ASP increase on the Power Systems side? Was that also new products, product mix, larger products? You did mentioned aftermarket, just kind of understand what's driving that increase as well.
Mark Smith: Sorry, you caught my attention with the pricing. Repeat the first part.
Jeff Kauffman: Currency.
Mark Smith: Yes, currency. So the answer is, generally, if we could choose and we didn't deploy hedging techniques, then a weaker dollar except against the pound would be our perfect choice of combinations. But we do deploy we have natural hedges from the way we're globally organized, and then we do use some very simple vanilla derivatives. So the net impact is, no. If you ask any individual business leader, distribution in particular are more exposed to a strengthening dollar, but the net result is very, very modest to the P&L, like less than $10 million when you look at all the impacts that are the hedges. And that's generally been the case for a long time. Sharp shifts where we get caught is when there's like capital constraints and currency revaluations like Nigeria, Argentina is a common topic of conversation about what to do there. But net-net, Jeff, for the company, we're fortunate that we're close to neutral.
Chris Clulow : And on your second question, Jeff, on the ASP for on the Power Systems Power Generation product, that's it's a tough one to gauge. That's really kind of a bit of a red herring because the size is so different across that portfolio. You could we have lower demand in the small stuffs, think RVs or power or backup gensets at home versus strong growth in data centers. So that can flex quite a bit and it's usually not a really great indicator. But we continue to see strength, I guess through the first quarter in that big stuff and that drives a higher ASP.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Chris Clulow for closing comments.
Chris Clulow : Great. Thank you everybody for joining and thanks. It's been a pleasure working with you all over the last couple of years. That concludes our teleconference for the day. We will be available as an Investor Relations team for the remainder of the day should you have any follow-ups. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 10:52:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Cummins Inc. Q4 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. We ask that you please ask one question, one follow-up, then return to the queue. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Joining us today are Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey; Vice President and CFO, Mark Smith; and Chris Clulow, Vice President, Investor Relations. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow. Please go ahead, sir.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I'll turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to start us off.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of 2024, discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2025. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. As I reflect back on 2024, I am pleased to share that we delivered strong financial results with records in several parts of the business while also making significant progress in the execution of our Destination Zero strategy. I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders, and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on advancing our strategy and executing our financial commitments as we lead the energy transition. It continues to be clear that our multi-solution Destination Zero strategy that leverages advancements and solutions from both our core and Accelera by Cummins businesses will continue to position us to succeed. We demonstrated this in 2024 as we further strengthened our position through evolving our portfolio and expanding and establishing relationships with new and longstanding key stakeholders and partners. Most notably for our core business in 2024, we introduced the Cummins HELM engine platform. Applied across Cummins' legendary B, X10, and X15 series engine portfolios, the HELM platforms provide customers with the option to choose the fuel type, either advanced diesel or alternate fuels like natural gas and hydrogen, that best suits their business needs and offers the power and performance customers expect while also reducing emissions. Cummins began full production of the X15N natural gas engine at the Jamestown Engine Plant earlier this year. And we are actively engaged with some of North America's largest and most demanding heavy-duty fleets as they look to reduce their carbon footprint. Additionally, in our core business, we introduced four new generator sets to the award-winning Centum Series, two each powered by Cummins' QSK50 and QSK78 engines. In response to high market demand, these new models have been engineered specifically for the most critical applications such as data centers. In order to further raise our capacity to meet rising power generation demand, we also intend to invest $200 million across our U.S., England, and India manufacturing sites. As you will see in our full year financial performance details and 2025 guidance, we are excited about the continued impressive performance and growth potential for our Power Systems business. Cummins also successfully completed the separation of our Filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies. Cummins will continue its focus on advancing innovative power solutions while Atmus is now well positioned to pursue its own plans for profitable growth. The separation of Atmus resulted in the tax-free exchange of shares, which reduced Cummins' shares outstanding by approximately 5.6 million in the first quarter. In our Accelera business, we completed the formation of our joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies with Daimler Trucks & Buses PACCAR, and EVE Energy to localize battery cell production and the battery cell supply chain in the United States. This strategic collaboration will advance zero emissions technology for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications. Amplify began construction this year of a 21-gigawatt hour factory in Mississippi with potential for future expansion as demand grows and is targeting start of production in 2027. Lastly, as we navigate this long and messy transition for our customers, we remain committed to pacing and refocusing our investments on the most promising paths as the adoption of zero-emission solutions slows in some regions around the world. As you can see in our fourth quarter results, we recorded charges related to the reorganization of our Accelera business segment as we underwent a strategic review to streamline the business while also ensuring we are set up for long-term success. We remain committed to Accelera and its mission, and this business continues to play an important role in our Destination Zero strategy. Now I will comment on overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remained strong across many of our key markets and regions, offsetting the softening in the North America heavy-duty truck market. Revenues for the quarter totaled $8.4 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to 2023 as lower North America heavy-duty and pickup truck volumes and the reduction in sales from the separation of Atmus were partially offset by continued high demand in our global power generation markets, stronger aftermarket, and North America medium-duty truck volumes as well as improved pricing. EBITDA was $1 billion or 12.1% compared to a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2024 results included 312 million of charges related to the strategic reorganization of our Accelera business segment. This compares to the fourth quarter 2023 results, which included $2 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to our voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.8% compared to $1.2 billion or 14.4% a year ago. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volume, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus. 2024 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, essentially flat with 2023 despite the decline in North America heavy-duty truck demand in the second half of the year and reduction of sales from the Atmus separation. EBITDA was a record $6.3 billion or 18.6% of sales compared to $3 billion or 8.9% of sales in 2023. 2024 results include a gain, net of transaction costs and other expenses, of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture, $312 million of charges related to the Accelera reorganization, and $29 million of first quarter restructuring expenses. This compares to the 2023 results that included $2 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, $100 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus, and $42 million of costs related to the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Excluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.4 billion or 15.7% of sales for 2024 compared to $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded lower second half North America truck volumes and the reduction in margin from the Atmus separation. EBITDA dollars were a record in Power Systems, Distribution, and Engine segments. Our Power Systems business, in particular, finished 2024 with a record full year EBITDA of 18.4% of sales, up from 14.7% in 2023. I'm very pleased with the performance across our core business segments, and you will see from our guidance that we are excited to continue to build on this momentum. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2025 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2025 to be down 2% to up 3% compared to 2024, and EBITDA to be 16.2% to 17.2% of sales, up from 15.7% in 2024. While we expect weaker first half demand in our North America on-highway truck markets, we expect many of our markets, particularly power generation to remain strong throughout the year. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 260,000 to 290,000 units in 2025, flat to down 10% year-over-year. We anticipate weaker first half demand. And while we do expect a prebuy in the second half of the year, the uncertainty on the exact timing and extent is driving our wider guidance range. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 140,000 to 155,000 units, down 5% to 15% compared to 2024, primarily driven by weaker-than-expected recent net orders and a depleting backlog. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 130,000 to 140,000 in 2025, flat to up 5% year-over-year. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 5% in 2025. We are projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy and medium-duty truck demand in China. While export demand is expected to decline slightly, we are hopeful that the recent NS4 scrapping policy and other stimulus actions may lead to domestic demand growth. We have not, however, seen a meaningful recovery thus far. While there is still uncertainty around the China truck market for 2025, we expect strength in other markets, particularly power generation, where demand is expected to remain high as data center momentum continues. In India, we project total revenue, including joint venture to increase 10% in 2024, primarily driven by stronger power generation demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be down 5% to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect flat to down 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2025. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5% to 15%, driven by continued high demand in the data center market. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%. For aftermarket, we expect revenue improvement with a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2025. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $400 million to $450 million compared to $414 million in 2024. In summary, 2024 was a record year for revenues, net income, EBITDA, and earnings per share. In 2025, we anticipate that demand will be slightly weaker in the North America on-highway truck markets, particularly in the first half of the year but offset by continued strength in the power generation market and resiliency in our Distribution business, given our strong aftermarket presence. Despite a relatively flat revenue forecast, we are expecting to improve profitability and cash flow. We remain committed to our multi-solution approach that is proving to be the right strategy for our customers, for the environment, and for the continued growth of Cummins while also returning cash to investors. Now let me turn it over to Mark who will discuss our financial results in more detail.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong operational results in the fourth quarter, which resulted in revenue achieving the top end of our prior guidance and EBITDA margins exceeding our projections. 2024 was a record year for revenues, EBITDA, and earnings per share, reflecting the strong demand for our products and the strong hard work of our employees. Now let me go into more details on Q4 and the full year performance. There were some notable non-routine transactions in '24 and 2023, and I'll quantify those and describe our underlying results to give a better understanding of the performance from regular operations. Fourth quarter reported revenues were $8.4 billion, and EBITDA was $1 billion or 12.1% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we underwent a strategic review of our Accelera segment, which resulted in charges of $312 million, of which $305 million were non-cash. Excluding this charge, we delivered EBITDA of $1.3 billion or 15.8% of sales. In the fourth quarter of '23, we reported sales of $8.4 billion and an EBITDA loss of $878 million. Excluding the regulatory settlement, Atmus separation costs, and voluntary retirement and separation program costs in Q4 2023, EBITDA was positive $1.2 billion or 14.4%. I know that's a lot to digest. In summary, on an underlying basis, EBITDA improved by 140 basis points on slightly lower sales, excluding those charges I just described. Fourth quarter revenues decreased by 1% from a year ago as organic growth was more than offset by the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America were flat while international revenues decreased 3%. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by less than 1%. The EBITDA improvement of 140 basis points was primarily due to higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency, partially offset by lower North America truck volumes and the separation of Atmus. Now let me summarize some of the impacts by line item in the income statement. Gross margin was $2.1 billion or 25.4% of sales compared to $2 billion or 23.7% last year. The improved margins were driven by stronger power generation aftermarket demand, favorable pricing, particularly in Power Systems and Distribution and improved operational efficiency. Selling, administrative, and research expenses were $1.1 billion or 13.6% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 14.2% last year due to lower research and development costs. Joint venture income of $87 million decreased $26 million primarily driven by lower technology fees from some of our international partnerships and costs incurred in the ramp-up of the Amplify Cell Technology battery joint venture here in the U.S., which was formed in the second quarter of '24. Other income was negative $25 million, a decrease of $75 million from a year ago, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on investments related to company-owned life insurance. Interest expense was $89 million, a decrease of $3 million from a prior year, driven by lower weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 32.8%, principally due to non-deductible costs related to the Accelera reorganization. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $418 million or $3.02 per diluted share, which includes $312 million or $2.14 per diluted share of Accelera reorganization charges. Excluding the Accelera charges, EPS was $5.16 per diluted share. Operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.4 billion, just $37 million lower than the level we saw in the first quarter last year. For the full year 2024, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, slightly above a year ago and reflecting 4% growth if we exclude Atmus from both 2023 and '24. EBITDA in '24 was $6.3 billion or 18.6%. Excluding the gain in costs associated with the separation of Atmus, the Accelera charge in the fourth quarter, and first quarter restructuring expenses, EBITDA in 2024 was $5.4 billion or 15.7%. 2023 EBITDA was $3 billion or $5.2 billion and 15.3% excluding the regulatory settlement, Atmus separation costs, and voluntary retirement and separation programs. The increase in the EBITDA percent was primarily driven by higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiencies, more than offsetting the impact of lower North American heavy-duty truck volumes and the reduction in margin from the Atmus separation. All-in net earnings were $3.9 billion or $28.37 per diluted share compared to $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share a year ago. 2024 results included the gain related to the separation of Atmus, net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion or $9.28 per diluted share, charges related to Accelera reorganization of $2.12 per diluted share, and first quarter restructuring costs of $0.16 per diluted share. Capital expenditures in 2024 were $1.2 billion, flat compared to 2023 as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the HELM platforms within our core business in North America. Our long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And over the past five years, we've returned 54% in the form of share repurchase and dividends even while we absorbed the significant acquisition in the form of Meritor. In 2024, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments, dividend growth, and returning $969 million to shareholders via the cash dividend and debt reduction. We also reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 5.6 million shares from the tax-free Atmus separation share exchange. I will now summarize the 2024 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2025. And thankfully for you and for me, I'm going to exclude all those nonroutine items in the following pages, and thanks for staying with me as I work through that. For the Engine segment 2024 revenues were a record $11.7 billion or up $28 million compared to last year. EBITDA was 14.1% of sales, flat compared to a year ago. In 2025, we project revenues for the Engine business will be down 2% to up 3% due to expected weakness in the North American truck market, particularly in the first half of the year, slightly offset by improved demand in pickup and some international markets. 2024 EBITDA is expected to improve with projections in the range of 14.2% to 15.2%. Components segment revenues were $11.7 billion in 2024, 13% lower than the prior year, and EBITDA was 13.8% of sales compared to 14.4% in '23. There were a lot of work done to improve existing operations but that was offset in the year-over-year comparisons due to the separation of Atmus. For 2025, we expect total revenue for the Components business to range from down 5% to flat as 2024 included Atmus in the first quarter through March 18. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 13.8% and 14.8%. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 11% in '24 compared to 2023 and were a record $11.4 billion. EBITDA was 12.1% compared to 11.8% a year ago, driven by higher power generation volumes and pricing. We expect 2025 distribution revenues to increase 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 12% to 13%. In the Power Systems segment, revenues were a record $6.4 billion, up 13% over 2023 driven primarily by power generation demand, especially data center applications. EBITDA was 18.4% or 370 basis points higher than 2023, driven by stronger volume, favorable pricing, and a continued focus on operational performance and cost reduction. In 2025, we expect Power Systems revenues to be at 2% to 7% and EBITDA to improve again and be in the range of 19% to 20%. Accelera revenues increased to $414 million in 2024 with a net operating loss of $452 million as we lowered costs in existing operations, partially offset by additional losses in the Amplify cell joint venture as it advances its operations. In 2025, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million and net losses to reduce to $385 million to $415 million as we continue to make targeted investments aligned with market demand whilst reducing cost. We currently project 2025 company revenues to be down 2% to 3%. Company EBITDA margins are projected to be approximately 16.2% to 17.2% compared to an equivalent 15.7% in 2024. Our effective tax rate this year is expected to be 24.5%, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth. To summarize, we delivered record sales and profitability in 2024, including strong results in the second half of the year even as demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined. Cash generation has been and will continue to be a focus as we enter 2025, enabling us to continue investing in new products for new and existing markets, returning cash to shareholders, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Last May, we laid out our updated financial targets through 2030. Our strong performance in 2024 represented encouraging progress towards those targets. And despite a relatively flat revenue forecast and expected weakness in North American heavy-duty truck, we expect to further improve profitability and cash flow in 2025. Thanks for joining us today, and let me turn it back over to Chris.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please re-join the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Angel Castillo from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Angel Castillo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another strong quarter here. Just wanted to unpack the power generation guide of 5% to 15% a little bit more. Could you just split that out between kind of price and volume? And then maybe just tying into that, I think you mentioned a new investment of 200 million in power gen. Can you just talk about maybe what's entailed in that? I thought, I guess there was already an expansion of doubling capacity so what is kind of the incremental being done?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So as you said, we're currently in the midst of a $200 million investment across our plants in and see more Minnesota, UK, and India to ramp up capacity to meet what is a growing demand for power generation products. And so you're seeing in that guide and expectation that we have been able to take up capacity. We're continuing to look at strategic pricing and where we can bring value to the customer so you've got some price in there as well. But really, it's about capacity ramp-up and continued sales of larger engines. In the power generation and data center market, it's really the 50 to 60 liter, the 78 and the 95 liters so these are large engines as we're able to bring more capacity online in our supply chain and our plants, you see that flowing through in revenue. And we expect that trend to continue over time. And so we're tracking on plan or even slightly ahead of plan to double our capacity by end of this year and looking forward to being able to meet what is a really strong demand from those customers.
Angel Castillo: That's very helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, just on separate on the trucks. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on EPA27? It sounds like you're still assuming some prebuy in the second half. But just given, I guess, what we've seen from the administration so far, any thoughts on the likelihood of any kind of challenges to the EPA27 rule?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, our current view is that we expect the EPA27 regulations will stay in place. Many companies, including us, have been investing over multiple years in those products to bring those products to market, and we're looking forward to having a nationwide standard again in '27. And with that, we are still anticipating some -- both economic recovery and prebuy happening in the North America trucking market that helped bring higher revenue in the second half this year and into next year. We do anticipate there'll be more discussion and potential challenge over the greenhouse gas regulations that we see out into the 2030 and beyond time frame.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Stephen Volkmann: Great. Good morning, everyone. Maybe starting off, can you just talk a little bit more about the Accelera restructuring? And how have you changed the focus of that business? And what are you doing less of or more of or just some color around that?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, I'll start and then Mark can add if he wants to share more detail. But really, this business has all along been about remaining agile and investing as we see technology advancing and markets starting to move in these zero emissions technologies. And we formed it through a number of acquisitions as well. So what that meant was we had kind of a distributed footprint and investment coming from those different acquisitions, and so we really looked at where we see market moving. We expect that battery electric vehicles will be important in some of our commercial vehicle and industrial applications, and we feel well positioned with the battery cell joint venture and some of the wins that we have with customers as that market develops so we're continuing to invest there. We're continuing to invest but pace investment in electrolyzers as we've seen some slowing in customer demand and uncertainty around incentives there, and then being selective in fuel cells and some of the other technologies where adoption continues to push out. But we think we're well positioned. Frankly, the slower and messier this goes, my view is the better it is strategically for Cummins. And so we're positioning ourselves in the places where we see that market and technology beginning to increase.
Stephen Volkmann: Okay, good. Sorry, I thought Mark was going to add something. Can I ask -- well, you've been talking a lot as it is. Hopefully, you'll be doing less of that this year on all these adjustments. Can I just follow up -- can I follow up on the HELM platform? Do you have targets relative to the types of unit volumes you might expect either on the nat gas side or on any of the other engine -- sorry, any of the other fuel options that you can use with that platform?
Jennifer Rumsey: We've got -- the rate of -- the beauty of the HELM platform is it's got that fuel flexibility. And so the reality is we're still going to sell a lot of the diesel version of that, and it will be a higher efficiency version, which means lower CO2 and lower fuel costs for our customers. We've set a goal of getting to 8% on the natural gas version of that. We're starting to see customers adopt. PACCAR has launched it. Daimler Trucks will launch that 15-liter natural gas this year. Fleets are testing it. I was with a big customer last week. They're finishing their field testing. They feel good about the product, and they're looking to start to increase penetration, but it really depends on diesel fuel prices and regulation and customer CO2 goals. And so it's hard to give specific numbers on the rate of natural gas or hydrogen adoption because of that dependency on infrastructure cost and regulation.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. In Power Systems, you had a really excellent 30% year-over-year growth in revenue per unit in the quarter, so the ramp in the supply base was progressing nicely. I'm wondering if you could just update us on how much more throughput you expect to get out of the supply base in 2025 for those large products. And I appreciate there could be a wide range of outcomes but would love to get your updated views on that?
Jennifer Rumsey: Well, I think it's important to remember that the revenue growth, in particular, for 2024 was also about launching those new Centum products, so we're seeing new products coming online that serve the market in addition to ramping up capacity. And for this year, it really is focused on continuing to max out our capacity capability that we have when we're making the investment and more capacity across that range of products. And the team has done a really phenomenal job of doing that, improving operating efficiency, working with the supply base to try to get as much out of what we have. But there's some major investments that need to happen by the end of this year to really get to the full doubling of capacity.
Mark Smith: So unfortunately, Jerry, units are not a great indicator just because the size of the generator set we've been selling is going up. The average selling price has gone up a lot over and above pricing, just the size of the set that we're selling. So the revenue has outgrown the units significant.
Jerry Revich: Nice problem to have. And separately on the China truck market, as you mentioned in the prepared remarks, there is some optimism in the market about potentially stronger demand. Can you just calibrate us, I believe, including the JV and wholly-owned business, China truck profits are maybe 10% of total company profits at this point. And given we're at the trough of the cycle, is it fair to think about pretty attractive incremental margins if demand does indeed surprise the upside?
Mark Smith: Yes on the latter. I mean, China in total, maybe on a more normal run rate would be in the range of 15% to 20% of our earnings. And yes, on-highway would typically be more than half of that so you're in the ballpark, Jerry, yes. And there's no massive structural investments going on there in the current year. So if we get more volume, we'd expect to convert that into more profits. There's also just some lumpiness around tech fees and other things. But I think the underlying operational business is well set as it's done in prior cycles when demand improves, we see that. And I think that just reinforces how well the Engine business and Components did in '24. Not just did we have weakening heavy-duty truck in the second half of the year but we had weaker China throughout the year. So hopefully, at some point, confident China is going to turn. We don't have a lot of visibility into that right now. Hopefully, that's another leg to come.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tim Thein from Raymond James. Your line is now live.
TimThein: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe I'll ask 1 to start on components, Mark. Just as you think about the margin outlook for '25 on flat to down revenues, a pretty nice improvement. I'm wondering how much of that is -- is it maybe a benefit from lapping the Atmus spin or separation? Or is there -- obviously, there's more to it than that. So maybe just a line or two in terms of what you're projecting there for Components.
Mark Smith: I think when you look across the company, we've done a lot on cost reduction. It hasn't been enormous in any given quarter, but we've been working at it really since the fourth quarter of 2023 when we announced voluntary separation package. We did a lot of work internally during 2024 to look at how we weighted the amount of resources we put between lines of business, functions, regional structures. And a lot of this work has paid off in terms of improving our cost structure and focus. And so yes, the Components business is going to benefit from some of that. We're not breaking it out separately but what was formerly known as Meritor, Drivetrain, and Braking Systems business, results have continued to improve their underlying. So I think there are a number of things. We are working incredibly hard on a flattish revenue environment to drive cost and efficiency where we can.
TimThein: Okay. And then Mark, on the Accelera, just in light of the restructuring and given what's -- how the global backdrop is changing or has changed, the expectation to get that business to EBITDA breakeven by '27, is that still in the cards or you're thinking that maybe is a tougher one to hit?
Mark Smith: Yes. I think overall, relative to our 2030 targets for the total company, we feel like we've had a really good start in 2024 and on track. And we're doing a bit better on the core business and headwinds have come more frequently and more severely to Accelera. So we are committed to significant loss reduction. But right now, we are not on track towards that breakeven, but we do feel we're very much on track for the overall company targets. And that's really the reason why we took more pronounced actions or the Accelera team did in the fourth quarter, recognizing that we're not going to get enormous help from demand here in the near term, Tim. So we're managing what we can and in the context of overall company results, we feel confident, but we are not, right now, on track to get to breakeven as we sit here today.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Kyle Menges from Citi. Your line is now live.
Kyle Menges: Thank you. I was hoping if you could just comment on how you're thinking about R&D spend in 2025 versus 2024, maybe more specifically within Engine and Components. And then just beyond 2025, how you're thinking about that and how we should be thinking?
Mark Smith: Yes, good question. So I think beyond 2025 is where we should see more momentum to the downside on Engine expense. We did see some improvement through the year in the Engine business. We've got a lot of new product launches, both in Engines and Components in 2025. But after we get through those launches and through 2027, that's definitely part of our margin expansion story in those two businesses, but not a dramatic shift this year, some puts and takes between Engines and Components.
Kyle Menges: Thanks. That's helpful. And then just could you comment a little bit on how you're thinking about the parts outlook for 2025?
Mark Smith: Yes, Parts held up pretty well, in fact, pretty a little bit better than expected in the fourth quarter across our businesses, and so we think in the range of flat to up 5%. Probably some pricing baked in there. So yes, growing in line with the economy, I would say, at least on par with the economy with what we know today.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jamie Cook from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.
Jamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. I guess similar question that Tim asked on, I think it was the Components business. Just the margins mark in Power Systems are very good despite sort of what I would call a muted top line forecast. So is that just pricing in some of the new products? And then I guess, how do you think about margin targets relative to the ones you just gave us, I guess, last year? Is it looking conservative? And then my second question obviously, lots of puts and takes around tariffs and who knows what happens. But are there any changes in your -- how your terms and conditions or contracts with your customers that if we do get into an environment where tariffs and that causes price increases, that we're able to absorb costs or increase price more frequently relative to last time within Engines, I guess?
Mark Smith: Great. So yes, Power Systems doing well. I think continuing to focus on supply chain efficient output. They did a great job last year so I don't want to sound like we're dissatisfied. Quite the opposite, very impressed, but still think there's more to come on raising volume, raising productivity, and a little bit on pricing Power Systems. So all of those things contribute towards raising the margin guidance for the year and quite a bit above the fourth quarter levels. And I guess if we really had a robust U.S. economy, we could see growth in some of the smaller generator sets. We have high market share in some of the consumer segments that are particularly robust. So I guess that -- we don't see signs of that, but if we want to get on to the bullish side and saw more strength in the U.S. economy, that could be another leg to help. On tariffs, by and large, our strategy is to make most of our products in the market in which they're sold. But of course, we do have a global supply chain and we -- of course, nobody knows exactly what the tariff situation is going to be. But to the extent that we do incur them, then we think it's important that the market feels those and we'll look to pass those on. Let's hope that's not significant for everybody involved. But really, we're just focused on controlling what we can control. And I think, yes, we've got secular tailwinds in Power Systems, but the biggest driver is being able to scale growth effectively and pushing out cost. And then you don't see it on the inside but the work we've done inside to try and simplify our structure, improve the speed of decision-making, all of those things help and have helped kind of raise the bar in 2024.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Raso from Evercore. Your line is now live.
David Raso: Hi, thank you. I'm trying to better understand the margin expansion in Engines and really, for that matter, of Components. First, the D&A, the growth in the D&A, is that mostly in Engines or Components? It's just the margin improvement is impressive but I'm just wondering it drives it down a little bit because there's more D&A than it is operational, but if you can…?
Mark Smith: Well, there is an increase in D&A because that's where we're investing most of the capital in North America, particularly in the Engine business over the last couple of years.
David Raso: So of the 100 D&A increase, is it 50 Engines, 25 Components? Just some sense so I can get a better sense of the underlying operation.
Mark Smith: Yes, I mean, it won't be significantly in distribution. Power Systems, whilst we're increasing investment is still modest relative to those 2 segments. And so on an incremental basis, most of it is going to go through Engines and Components, a little bit in corporate, which ends up mostly in Engines and Components, yes.
David Raso: Okay, that's helpful. And then even with that, it looks like there still is some slight operating, let's say, non-D&A margin improvement in Engines. What's driving that? Is it a little bit of mix? Is it -- I'm just trying to think about maybe the new medium engines you're outperforming the market. How to think about those margins versus heavy? Because it's all wrapped in the idea of trying to figure out where do you think Engine margins are as we sort of move out of '25 and people start to pontificate about earnings power in '26 with the prebuy in the Engine division.
Mark Smith: Yes, I think those are all really important questions and will be big contributors to the long-term performance. In the near term, I think we'll continue to expect to do well in the aftermarket side, of which the Engine business is our biggest single driver. So that's probably where there's still some pricing opportunity into 2025. And then yes, the engineering starts coming down enormously, but I think we've come down off the peak there, Components probably going up a little bit. But those would be the main drivers. And as you can see, we haven't factored a lot in from China yet so really, it's cost control and aftermarket in the near term.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Avi Jaroslawicz from UBS. Your line is now live.
AviJaroslawicz: Hi, good morning, guys. I guess in terms of your guidance for the market outlook for North America heavy-duty trucks this year, it sounds like if, for whatever reason, you don't do a pre-buy materialized this year that you'd expect retail demand may be still to be negative in the second half. So I guess, one, am I interpreting that correctly? And can you just discuss how you're thinking about it?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, I think if you look at the underlying performance in the heavy-duty market, spot rates dropped early in '23, so truckload carriers have really had challenges now for two years, and I think there's a very real chance that we'll see improvement in that over the course of this year, just depending on what the underlying economy and interest rates do. So there's some potential upside in the second half for that in addition to this prebuy phenomenon that we would anticipate would lead to a stronger second half versus first half. The range is quite wide because how high that goes is really dependent on the prebuy and when that starts.
AviJaroslawicz: Got it, okay. And then in terms of medium-duty, just breaking down kind of market share gains versus market growth for 2024. How did those net against each other? And then in terms of your sales guidance for this year within Engines, are we thinking about further share gains this year or not as much?
Mark Smith: I think really, I think we're talking about following the market in 2025. There's been a long track record of significant market share gains in that market. Our engine is clearly the leader in that market and there were some share gains. But going forwards, it's very much primarily going to be truck in the market, but there can be some modest changes around that from where we are now.
Jennifer Rumsey: There is a buy down for the year, it’s reflective of what we've seen in order made in backlog.
Mark Smith: Yes. It's industry -- the industry orders, we will feel that, yes.
Jennifer Rumsey: From a product perspective, we continue to feel really positive about how our products are performing in the market and our position across medium and heavy duty.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.
RobWertheimer: Thank you. I had two questions around Power Systems, if I may. And one is, as this data center market continues to develop, historically at least, I suppose, the selling an engine is one thing and then servicing is another. And if you have backup power, it doesn't get turned on that much and it's not as profitable. But obviously, there's a high uptime, high criticality kind of operations. Do you see any opportunity to change that profit algorithm, such that you'll be making more recurring revenue or otherwise on that massive build-out of engines that you're going to do? And then secondly, if I can just wrap it in. You've had excellent results in Power Systems. I'm not sure if all of it's really this surge in data center or maybe the stuff you've touched on a couple of times on the call already, operational improvements. I wonder if you could just expand on how you've made that business better.
Jennifer Rumsey: Sure. So first on the data center market, so with power generation and data centers, we have engine, gen sets, and then a good portion of that business also flows through the distribution business. So the strong performance you see in the distribution business last year and the outlook is reflecting the strength in power generation as well as aftermarket. But as you noted, they don't, today, run a lot for backup power. So typically, Parts revenue is relatively low as we look at shortage of power availability, and how do you meet power demand in the U.S. and around the world. There's a potential for some shift in that. And so strategically, we're considering how we think about our role in that, which was part of the discussion on micro-grids and what we do there today, but today, still very much heavily backup power and because of the high reliability demand for those applications. In terms of the Power Systems performance, we undertook now, two years ago, focused effort to really look at operating performance structure, how we made sure, we were investing in the right products, and getting returns on the investments we were making for our customers, and working through some of the supply challenges that have built up through the pandemic, and then the rebound in the market after that. And so that really has come together at exactly the time when this data center trend has also happened. And so we really had strong underlying operating structure and performance in the business that we continue to drive improvement in, as we're also taking up volumes. And so both of those are contributing to really the remarkable profitability improvement that you've seen in Power Systems.
Mark Smith: Just to add, Rob, the distribution, of course, adds that extra slice of revenue on data centers. And in fact, it's fundamental to winning and supporting this data center business around the world. I think that's one of the strengths we have and a few others have, and that's why you see that the market demand is concentrated amongst a couple of large engine manufacturers like us because of that service capability. But just to underline what you said, Rob, and your intuition, it would be very wrong to attribute Power Systems improvement just to data centers. That's a journey that's still got legs left but tide -- the performance level has been elevated across that segment, including in the alternator business, which supplies across -- really across that supply chain. So we're incredibly pleased with the way that business has improved.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. So the distribution segment guide, the 2% to 7%, it seems quite healthy. Given the underlying truck market outlook, are you able to comment on the core distribution outlook versus the power generation-related services? The reason I ask, if power generation demand holds at these levels, it seems like distribution could see another double-digit growth year in 2025. So any comments there would be helpful.
Mark Smith: Yes. I think you're typically seeing Parts growth maybe slightly above the rate of economic growth. And then in this cycle, you're right, the power generation demand in data centers and in some other applications has really provided that extra leg. So I would say in the short run, yes, power gen will be the main swing factor. I would say that some of the other segments, mining, oil and gas, if we look beyond this year, we'd expect to see more growth in the future. There's not enormous momentum in those businesses, but they're also important end markets for distribution. One of the reasons that we like distribution; it generates a lot of cash. It's less volatile than other parts of the business and have that really strong aftermarket piece, which doesn't get the extraordinary growth rates that underpins the kind of year-to-year level of performance. So yes, distribution is doing well. And hopefully, the global economy strengthens and then all of our businesses will do well.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful. And then one follow-up question on that comment that you expect some pre-buy in the back half, but the timing is uncertain. I'm curious what pre-buy lift is embedded in the current heavy-duty and medium-duty outlook for North America? I'm just trying to understand what the market could look like, let's see, if there is no pre-buy.
Mark Smith: There are so many factors at play, but that's one of the factors we believe can help. We're going to start off at a fairly modest level in the first quarter. Although orders here yet in the fourth quarter of '24 were a little better than expected, I would say, but it's really, we're anticipating that strength in the second half to come somewhat from demand ahead of the regulations and understanding of how flexible the supply chain is for that industry. Again, I think we've all got fairly consistent views of the market at this point and we'll see how it plays out. A big factor, of course, is going to be the strength of the U.S. economy and spot rates and freight activity. All these factors weigh in. The main thing to know is we've got a stronger second half in heavy-duty truck built into our forecasts. Q1, yes, is going to probably be the low point of the year with what we expect right now. The question is, will we get the improvement in the second half?
Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, everyone, for joining our teleconference today. That concludes the question-and-answer session. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Q3 2024 Cummins Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Christopher Clulow: Thanks, Julian. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the third quarter of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. I will now turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter accomplishments and financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our financial performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the third quarter. In September, we started full production of our X15N natural gas engine at our Jamestown Engine plan, which is the first version of our 15-liter helm platform to launch in the U.S. the X15N delivers performance, durability and power required in a variety of applications and is an excellent alternative for fleet looking to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. This is an important milestone in the execution of our Destination Zero strategy as we work to reduce the impact of our products today while investing in cleaner power solutions for the future. Some of North America's largest and most demanding heavy-duty fleets are actively engaged with Cummins, following their own tests of the natural gas engine in the field. For example, UPS has purchased 250 Kenworth X15N powered trucks in a move the company highlights as an important part of decarbonizing its ground fleet. Cummins had the opportunity to further showcase our Destination Zero strategy in action through our diverse portfolio of power solutions at the recent IAA transportation event in Hannover, Germany. At this event, we displayed our fully integrated powertrain concept featuring our helm engine platforms and e-components. I also personally had an opportunity to hear feedback from Cummins' customers on the challenges they are experiencing with their decarbonization strategies. Common remains confident that our customers' needs will not be met with a single solution. And this event was a great opportunity to further demonstrate that Cummins and Accelera have the right components in our portfolio to provide the necessary solutions for our customers and their needs as they evolve over time. In addition, in October, Accelera by Cummins celebrated the opening of its electrolyzer manufacturing plant in Spain. The plant has a capacity to produce 500 megawatts of electrolyzers per year, scalable to more than 1 gigawatt per year in the future. The sustainably designed facility is expected to create 150 highly skilled jobs in the region with the potential to reach 200 jobs as production grows, and will help scale up development, manufacturing and adoption of zero emissions technologies in Europe. Lastly, I'd like to express that our hearts are with those who were impacted and are still recovering from Hurricanes Helene and Milton here in the U.S. We are grateful that our employees in the impacted areas are all accounted for and safe. While we did see minor impacts in our third quarter financial results, I'm proud of how our Cummins employees rallied together to help impacted employees, communities and facilities, and respond to this tragedy while minimizing disruption in our industry. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remains strong across many of our key markets and regions, offset by softening in the North America heavy-duty truck market that was in line with our expectations. Sales for the quarter were $8.5 billion, flat compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by continued high demand in our global power generation markets and improved pricing. This was offset by lower North America heavy-duty truck volumes and the reduction in sales from the separation of Atmus. EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 16.4% compared to $1.2 billion or 14.6% a year ago. Third quarter 2023 results included $26 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the third quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded the reduction in margin from the Atmos separation. Our third quarter revenues in North America declined 1% to $5.2 billion as a softening heavy-duty market, lower light-duty volumes and a reduction in sales from the Atmos separation were mostly offset by strong demand in the medium-duty truck and power generation markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 68,000 units, down 10% from 2023 levels, while [indiscernible] unit sales were $25,000, down 14% from a year ago. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 12% from 2023 levels, while our unit sales were 38,000, up 18%. We shipped 28,000 engines Vistalantis for use in the RAM pickups in the third quarter of 2024, down 31% from 2023. Revenues in North America Power generation increased by 18%, driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. The impressive power generation performance in North America and across the globe helped us achieve record sales and profitability in the Power Systems segment. Our third quarter international revenues increased by 2% compared to last year. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 4% as weaker domestic truck and construction volumes were partially offset with higher data center demand. Industry demand for medium heavy-duty trucks in China was 207,000 units, a decrease of 15% from last year. Demand in the China truck market continues to run at low levels with continued weak domestic diesel market and now softening natural gas orders as the diesel gas price differential narrows. The light-duty market in China was down 4% from 2023 levels at 424,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 30,000, an increase of 14%. Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter was 44,000 units, an increase of 10% from 2023 levels. Our units sold were 8,000 units, an increase of 14% as a result of QSM 15 penetration of both new and existing OEM partners and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China roughly doubled in the third quarter, primarily driven by continued growth in data center demand. Third quarter revenue in India, including joint ventures, was $641 million, a decrease of 12% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 12%, while our shipments decreased by 18%, driven by a slowdown in manufacturing and government infrastructure spending. Power generation's revenues increased 49% year-on-year, driven by prebuy demand for stationary power out of the CPCB4 emissions regulation changes as well as increased data center demand. Now let me provide our outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Our revenue outlook for 2024 remains consistent with our prior guidance of down 3% to flat. We are improving our overall EBITDA guidance for the year to be approximately 15.5%, the top end of our prior guide of 15% to 15.5%. We now expect higher revenue and stronger profitability in our Power Systems and Distribution segments, offsetting lower revenue and profitability expected in our Components segment. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024. In the third quarter, we saw industry demand softening in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect further softening in the fourth quarter. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are also maintaining our forecast to be 150,000 to 160,000 units, flat to up 5% from 2023 as we continue to benefit from an elevated backlog and strength of vocational orders. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 units in 2024, with the planned model year changeover likely to drive sharp, but temporary production decline in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to decrease 4% in 2024 as a continued weak domestic diesel truck market is partially offset by higher power generation demand. While we have not yet seen a material impact from the recent stimulus actions, we are encouraged that the emphasis on demand side policies is a positive step forward to build economic momentum in China. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 1% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation demand, which is offsetting lower on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be down 5% to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance due to weaker demand in China. We are maintaining our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 15% to 20%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, also consistent with our prior guidance. For aftermarket, our guidance remains at flat to up 5% for 2024, with some softening in rebuild demand expected in the fourth quarter. In summary, we are maintaining our guidance on sales of down 3% to flat and improving our EBITDA guidance to be approximately 15.5%. Our performance in the third quarter, particularly in our Power Systems and Distribution segments resulted in strong profitability despite a softening North America heavy-duty truck market. While we do expect continued softening in several of our key markets in the fourth quarter, we are committed to delivering strong financial performance and returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. I continue to be grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world who are delivering for our customers while also achieving strong financial performance. Our impressive third quarter results and improved full year guidance continue to demonstrate that we remain well positioned to invest in our future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and improve financial performance cycle over cycle. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong revenue and profitability in the third quarter. Given the strength, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance and have increased our expectations for EBITDA percent to be at the top end of our prior guidance range. Third quarter revenues were $8.5 billion, flat from a year ago as organic growth offset the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America decreased 1%, while international revenues gained 2%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 16.4% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.2 billion or 14.6% of sales a year ago. That those year ago numbers included $26 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. The benefits of pricing, strong operational efficiency and the absence of the Atmus separation costs were the primary drivers behind the improved profitability. Now let's look at each line item in a bit more detail. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 25.7% of sales compared to $2.1 billion or 24.6% last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing, which varied across our different segments, and operational improvements. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 13.8% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 14.3% last year, which included costs related to the separation of Atmus. Joint venture income of $99 million decreased $19 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower technology fees in our engine business, costs incurred in the start-up of the AMPLIFY Cell Technologies, our battery cell joint venture, which is reported within Accelera and was formed last quarter. Other income was $22 million, an increase of $29 million from a year ago or improvement, driven by mark-to-market gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance. Interest expense was $83 million, a decrease of $14 million from prior year, primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19.2%, including $36 million or $0.26 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $809 million or $5.86 per diluted share compared to $656 million or $4.59 per diluted share in 2023. EPS benefited from the increased earnings and also a lower share count resulting from the tax-free share exchange associated with the separation of Atmus that was completed in the first quarter. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $640 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow was an inflow of $65 million, which included $1.9 billion of payments required by the previously disclosed settlement agreement with the regulatory agencies. Excluding the settlement, third quarter year-to-date operating cash flow was $2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first 9 months of last year. The lower operating cash flow this year is primarily due to higher inventory. We do expect to see stronger operating cash flow in the fourth quarter this year. I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, guidance for 2024 includes the operations of Atmus in our consolidated results up until the full separation, which occurred on March 18. Components revenue was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 16% from the prior year, while EBITDA decreased from 13.6% of sales to 12.9%, driven primarily by the dilutive impact of the Atmus separation and a weaker heavy-duty truck market in North America. Several facilities within our Drivetrain and Braking Systems business in North Carolina were impacted by Hurricane Helene at the end of Q3, disrupting production and causing us to record some costs in our third quarter results. Our employees have shown incredible resilience in extremely challenging circumstances and are working very hard to raise production levels. For Components, we expect 2024 full year revenues to decrease 12% to 15%, a decrease of 2% from the prior guidance at the midpoint, and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.3% to 13.8%, lowering the range from our previous guide of 13.7% to 14.2%. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 1% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.7%, an increase from 13.5% a year ago due to operational improvements and positive pricing, including a retroactive pricing agreement in our light-duty business that was finalized within the third quarter. The benefits from pricing and lower operating costs more than offset weaker North American heavy-duty truck volumes. In 2024, we project revenues for the Engine business to be down 2% to [ 1% ], narrowing the range of the prior guidance, and EBITDA to be in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, consistent with our communication last quarter. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 16% from a year ago to a record $3 billion, driven by increased demand for power generation products particularly for data center applications. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales 12.5% compared to 12.1% a year ago, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing. We now expect 2024 Distribution revenues to be up 8% to 11%, an increase of 2% at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to stronger power generation markets. EBITDA margins are now expected in the range of 11.5% to 12%, also up from our previous guide of 11.3% to 11.8%. Results for the Power Systems segment set another new quarterly record. Revenues were $1.7 billion, an increase of 17%, and EBITDA increased from 16.2% to 19.4% of sales, driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and other operational improvements. In 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be 8% to 11%, an increase of 4% at the midpoint from our prior guide. EBITDA expectations have also increased to approximately 18.3% to 18.8%, up from 17.75% at the midpoint of the prior guide. Accelera revenues increased 7% to $110 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $115 million compared to a loss of $114 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support those parts of the business where strong growth is expected while reducing costs in areas where we assess the prospects for growth have extended into the future. In 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million, both unchanged from last quarter. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the third quarter particularly in Power Systems and Distribution, we're improving the full year company guidance for profitability. We still project 2024 company revenues to be down 3% to flat. Company EBITDA margins are now expected -- projected to be approximately 15.5%, which is at the top end of our prior guidance range. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5% for the full year 2024, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items, and down from our prior guidance of an expected tax rate of [ 24 ]. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. In summary, we delivered strong sales and record profitability in the third quarter of 2024. We will experience moderation in some markets in the fourth quarter, most notably North America heavy-duty truck. We have updated our projection for EBITDA to the high end of the prior guidance range due to strong execution, particularly the projected record full year EBITDA in Power Systems and Distribution. We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forwards, leaving us well positioned to navigate any further economic cyclicality. We are on track to continue our trend of raising performance cycle over cycle whilst continuing to invest in the future. And that's encouraging given that this is projected to be a down year for North American heavy-duty truck production. Our priorities for the remainder of this year for capital allocation remains to reinvest for profitable growth, pay out our strong cash dividends and support our strong credit rating. Thanks for your interest today. Now let me turn it back to Chris.
Christopher Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Now we'll begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steven Fisher, UBS.
Steven Fisher: Congrats on the beat and raise. It's hard to find those in machinery world these days. Nevertheless, I think there were some investors that were a little concerned that maybe the Q4 guidance looks a little conservative after the strong Q3. I don't know how much of that is related to the storm impact in Components. But I guess the bigger picture question here is, even though it's maybe a little early, do you think there are enough positives to offset the rest of the downturn that we have in the heavy-duty truck market, however long that may last to keep EBITDA growing over the next year?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So let me just comment first, Steve. Thanks. Great to hear from you. Let me comment a little bit on the fourth quarter and what we expect. There's really 3 factors that I'd point to in the revenue guide for fourth quarter. We expect further softening in the heavy-duty market. I talked about the product changeover with [indiscernible] that will drive further volume reduction in that pickup truck business. And then just working days with year-end will be fewer, and we see across many of our markets, fewer working days associated with the holidays and normal maintenance and [indiscernible] during that period of time. So those are really the factors. As you can see, we're -- the team has done a great job of continuing to focus on profitability across the business, delivering strong decremental margins where we've seen reductions in heavy-duty, which takes a lot of effort. I just want to acknowledge the great work of the team and then leveraging some of the places that we have strength with really strong performance, of course, power gen that impacted Power Systems and DB. And we expect that to continue as we go into next year.
Steven Fisher: Okay. And maybe just building on that last part there, I mean, how would you describe the momentum in Power Gen right now? I mean, is that new record revenues in the quarter? You're sold out on the 95 liters. Where are you on the capacity utilization on 50 and 78? What's driving the further upside from here? Is it mainly pricing? Or can you kind of push out more volumes?
Jennifer Rumsey: It's really both. So over the course of this year, we've worked on strategic pricing and offsetting some of the inflationary costs that we've seen and pricing for value in that business. And we've been working on capacity in the supply base and our own operational improvements and launching the new [indiscernible] product. So all of those things have given us improvement over the course of the year. 95-liter is at capacity, but we've been able to increase capacity through these improvements by about 30% on that product in '24 of the new products. And then as we talked about previously, we are investing right now to double capacity in the 95-liter. That will come online late next year as we go into '26. We don't see any end in sight in terms of demand in that market. We're the rebuilds up on the 95-liter out the [ '27 ]. So really focused on how do we leverage the capacity we have now, investment we have now while we're bringing more online late next year.
Mark Smith: And I think, Steve, the only thing I'd add to your first question is, we're not -- we're building our plans with a relatively modest start on heavy-duty truck to the first half of next year with what we see right now. So hear your comments and questions, and we're very focused on kind of managing through the cycle.
Jennifer Rumsey: I will say, I mean, in terms of the impact of Helene and Milton, we're back to regular operation in that business and trying to just work through some of the backlog that built up during the period that we were most severely impacted, but it's been a really tremendous effort by the team there. We have multiple facilities in the Western North Carolina region within Cummins Drivetrain and breaking systems that have been dealing with the impact of that working.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angel Castillo, Morgan Stanley.
Angel Castillo Malpica: Congrats on a strong quarter. Just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into some of the dynamics that are maybe impacting the next couple of years. I saw some headlines around maybe the California Omnibus low NOx regulation, and some states maybe delaying the kind of model year '25 to maybe model year '26 type enforcement. Just any comments or maybe read-throughs to what maybe that tells you about the underlying kind of enforcement of those regulations and the potential for kind of prebuy into '25, just any broader read-through to maybe or just industry demand for your engines?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean what we've seen, of course, this year is the [indiscernible] bus regulations have gone into place. As we get into '27, we see commonization again between EPA and CARB, which we believe is a positive for the industry. What happens between now and then in terms of different states following those CARB regulations, as you noted some have pushed out, it's a little bit difficult to predict. But certainly, you see lower volumes this year in CARB even with some of the flexibilities that they've put in place to sell 200-milligram NOx product and strong demand nationwide. And so we're watching that space closely. I would say, overall, as Mark noted, we're projecting softening as we go into next year in the heavy-duty truck market and then still anticipating, depending on economic conditions, the prebuy likely starting at some point during '25 ahead of the '27 regulations.
Angel Castillo Malpica: That's very helpful. And then just wanted to circle back on the prior question around 2025 for power generation. I think you indicated you kind of see growth in power systems and momentum continuing there. Just curious, it seems like your power generation guide of 15% to 20% was unchanged despite continued strong performance there. Can you talk about 2025, just early indications based on your backlog? Should we anticipate kind of that 15% to 20% type growth to persist into next year? Or how do you kind of see that based on kind of pricing and backlog indications today?
Jennifer Rumsey: I mean, really that demand in that market is going to remain strong. So it's all about what we can do in terms of capacity and managing our supply base.
Mark Smith: And that's one of the factors that gives us confidence going at the start of the year, that strong backlog and then, of course, distribution should be -- continue to be pretty resilient absent a big economic shock.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kyle Menges, City.
Kyle Menges: I was hoping I noticed within Power Systems, the Industrial portion actually pretty strong growth in the quarter despite certainly some competitors not showing great results in mining this quarter. So just would love to hear kind of what's driving that reacceleration and growth in that industrial portion and just how you're thinking about that into 4Q and into 2025?
Jennifer Rumsey: I mean, overall, our guidance is pretty flat in the mining market. We've seen some rebuilds demand that you're seeing in those results, but really not significant shifts in that market right now.
Christopher Clulow: Yes. I think overall, Kyle, I'd just add, yes, the mining is really the key market for us in the industrial side, as you know, and that has remained pretty resilient from our perspective, where it's moved a little down the world. We've maintained a pretty good both in the first-fit side as well as in the aftermarket, which drives the rebuild.
Mark Smith: Don't overread in one quarter it.
Kyle Menges: Got it. And then just a follow-up on Power Systems. -- looks like with the new guidance going to be doing incrementals of about 60% in 2024. So it would be helpful if you could frame just how we might think about incremental margins in that segment and in 2025? And I guess why wouldn't it be kind of close to 40% to 60% again? And what factors maybe could cause weaker incrementals next year for that...
Mark Smith: I do get a use of pushing the Power Systems business a bit hard, so I'll probably stay off the 40% to 60%, but here's what I'd say. Part of the improvement was really a reprioritization and cost kind of reset at the start of this journey, which has really been going on for a couple of years now. So you get that benefit early on, and then there's been a lot more focus on pricing capacity and efficient capacity improvements. So yes, we still think there is more to come on the top line and the bottom line. I don't think we can continue to expect 40% to 60% incremental margins. We will provide specific updates here in February. But with what we know today, we would expect more improvement going into next year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you folks can just expand on the margin performance in engine, really outstanding results in the third quarter. The guidance implies margin expansion in the fourth quarter on lower sales. You mentioned operating efficiencies in the prepared remarks. Can you just expand on where those efficiencies are versus pre-COVID levels? And it feels like there's momentum into '25 even if demand is softer, just given where the exit rate looks to be in the fourth quarter versus the cost structure in the first. But I'm wondering if you could just expand around those points, if you don't mind?
Mark Smith: Yes. I think there's been a lot of improvement pre-COVID, no doubt about that, but we're still not all the way back to those kind of 2019 operating levels. So I still think there's more room to come on operational efficiencies. And then we've talked about kind of being at the peak part of this investment cycle. Of course, the strong medium-duty demand has really helped in this environment and our positions continue to strengthen there. So that's really helped. And whilst we have flagged, and it is going to happen, there is going to be short, but sharp reduction in pickup truck engine production in the fourth quarter, we view that as largely temporary. And I think that with all the information we have today that that's going to resume. So I think the top line will face some first half year pressure on heavy duty relative to the first half of this year, but yes, continuing to focus on operating costs. I mentioned briefly in my remarks that we've really been making adjustments to our organization structure and costs since for the fourth quarter of last year. And whilst that hasn't been dramatic in any period, I think that helps set us up well going into next year. Just so you didn't miss it, I did point out not to make a huge deal, but we did get some extra pricing, which helped in the third quarter that was retroactive back to the start of the year. So we won't get all of that again in the fourth quarter, but nevertheless, I think the cost base, the operational efficiencies, maybe not in the short term, but maybe in the medium term, we get some boost from China as well because our earnings are okay, but far from what the full potential of China is in the engine business. So I think there's a lot to look forward to, but the exact timing of earnings accelerating the engine business isn't clear yet. So we've kind of got to focus on the cost and efficiency certainly through the next 9 months.
Jerry Revich: Super. And can I shift gears and ask about the natural gas engine demand now that you've opened up a full rate production. Can you just update us on your expectations of natural gas share in the market 6 to 12 months out based on the demand and the performance of the production ramp that you alluded to in the prepared remarks, please?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean we've said that we think we could get up to a -- potentially 8% share in the market with the natural gas product. We had several big fleets that we're testing it during development. And I noted the [indiscernible] UPS has played. So how they start to ramp up volume, get increasing confidence in the strong performance and efficiency. Fundamentally, in most places, it can provide, not only a reduction in CO2 for fleets that want to lower the CO2 footprint, but also reductions in operating costs because of the fuel price differential between natural gas and diesel. And so fleets that are interested in pursuing that, I think over time, we'll ramp up a target for me to exactly predict because it also depends on some of the economic conditions that are impacting [indiscernible] today of what that will be over 12 months. But we're excited to have that product out now with Kenworth and Daimler will be launched as well in '25. So they'll be positioned with that in the market also.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jamie Cook, Truist Securities.
Jamie Cook: Nice quarter. I guess my first question, you guys have talked about adding capacity on the large engine side. One of your peers came out last quarter and talked about adding even additional capacity in large engines because of demand. So I'm wondering if you're making any changes to your capacity increase that you've talked about historically? And then to what degree do -- how much incremental capacity are you adding that could potentially benefit 2025? And then my follow-up question, Mark. Again, I know someone asked the questions on Q4 versus Q3 margins, and there's an implied step down, but how much was that repricing that you talked about that helped the engine business that maybe we view as onetime? And then within Components, how much of an impact was the hurricanes?
Jennifer Rumsey: Thanks, Jamie. I'll take the first one and let Mark take the second one. So over the course of this year, what you've seen is new products for power generation, capacity within the constraints of the equipment and our supply chain that we have today going up about 30% on the 95-liter. And so that, of course, is going to carry over into next year. And the mantra and power systems right now is just one more, and how do we continue to squeeze every shift, every day, one more out of what we have within our current constraints. And so we'll continue to focus on that and then, of course, working to try to get that doubling of capacity for the 95 by next year. We're continuing to look at it. We want to be smart about where we can make reasonable investments to take capacity up further where we see strong market conditions. So nothing really specific to say right now, but just that we're continuing to look at our footprint and where there may be opportunities.
Mark Smith: On the second part, the first thing I said, we're going to get natural -- I will answer the specific questions you Jamie. I just want to share that we're going to get natural variations from quarter-to-quarter, but I just want to remind that we're very focused on the cost side, on the efficiency side, of course, getting value for the products, which are helping our customers be successful is also important. So yes, the the kind of retroactive element of the pricing was about 50 basis points ballpark for the company in the quarter. There is a go-forward benefit just not as much as that. And then the costs you're talking you're talking low tens of millions of dollars between components and the elimination segment where we incurred some costs for the impacts of Hurricane Helene. So there are puts and takes. There are some positives, there are some negatives in the results. I think the revenue guide, you can see we haven't changed because we are very clear the heavy, medium and pickup truck production and the way that the very well-run customers like to work is to have predictability around the production level. So I think the revenue is well pinned. And I think the key for us is maintaining this strong cost and efficiency discipline as we go into next year and continue to focus on preparing ourselves for more demand and growth in the future and raising these margins as we set out at the Analyst Day and generating more cash, that's a big focus.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tami Zakaria, JP Morgan.
Tami Zakaria: Good morning. Thank you so much. So I sort of adding one more question on incremental margin because I think it's really the start of your performance in recent quarters. So when I look at your incremental margin in the third quarter, it's almost 50% ex the filtration separation, which is quite impressive versus a long-term target of over [ 25 ]. So do you believe your incremental margin target can move up for the long term given the pargeneration product success, engines are seeing some retroactive pricing as well it seems and you have a lot of new products coming in, in the next couple of years. So would you consider revisiting your long-term incremental EBITDA margin target as you begin next year?
Mark Smith: I don't think -- I think we'll give guidance just for the year, and then we'll see how we do. There's a lot of moving parts to our portfolio. Of course, we're feeling like we've done a pretty good job in our core business. Since we had our Analyst Day, incrementally, there have been more headwinds to the Accelera side of the business. But overall, we're pleased with this year. Let's focus on finishing strong for this year. We'll give you our full guidance with all its technicolor when we get to February. So I appreciate the question, but today, we're not going to talk about longer-term targets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer, Melius Research.
Robert Wertheimer: Just a clarification. On the retroactive pricing, I wonder if you can describe what that is or how much continues? And more fundamentally, whether that indicates that you have any enhanced pricing power through engines, if that was something new and different and then I have a more substantial question after that.
Mark Smith: I don't think we should read anything into it other than it's been a protracted discussion. It's back to January 1 Rob. So that's just sometimes things take a while to resolve.
Christopher Clulow: Yes. As a reminder, Rob, that's in our light-duty space. So it was more localized there.
Robert Wertheimer: Perfect. Okay. That helps a lot. Just more fundamentally, obviously, you and largest competitor in large engines are seeing a lot of demand, and your customers must be telling you that you have a big role to play years and years ahead. Is it very clear that even the biggest hyperscale data centers will use RESIP engines on backup. I wonder if you can just talk about what your customers are telling you about the changing sort of design and scope and scale of data centers and where you fit in for the next decade to come?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, I think at this point in the next decade, we think reciprocating engines are going to be the solution for backup power. Of course, they're looking at different potential options for prime power and evaluating what that looks like, but other technologies that we might use from from a lead time cost, reliability, it's hard to match what a diesel gen set can do for backup power. So we really think that's going to be a solution for some time.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Raso, Evercore.
David Raso: Back to the prebuy question, I know we're sitting here on election day, so curious to get your thoughts if anything around the election could alter your thoughts around...
Jennifer Rumsey: I'm surprised you made it this far without that question, David.
David Raso: Make sure if you could answer the timing of your introduction of a '27-compliant engine, can you take us through your thoughts around that, the idea of maybe introducing that early, building some credits? Obviously, the nat gas engines already are providing some credits as well. Can you just take us through how you're thinking about the timing of your introductions? And obviously, woven within that, anything you want to comment on on whoever wins the White House and Congress how that impacts your thoughts?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, at the end of the day, Cummins is going to do what we've always done. We're going to work across party lines and engage on issues that are important for our business and our industry, and we'll do that. We've done that with the bid administration of the pass administration will do with the next administration. And what's really important to us and our industry is having that regulatory and legislative stability. And we do not expect any change regardless of the outcome of the election on the [ '27 ] regulations for our industry. So as we have in the past, we're really -- we have a history of being first into the market with products that comply with new regulations and deliver increased value to our customers, and we're always focusing on the landscape, what's the right product at the right time, how do we take -- consider regulatory flexibility and credits as a part of that strategy. And given all that, we do intend to launch the diesel version of the 15-liter helm platform in '26 ahead of the '37 regulation. And with that launch, not only deliver a lower NOx product into the market, but also one that had significant improvement in fuel efficiency and operating costs to decline to 7% efficiency improvement in that product that will deliver value to our customers and then looking to how do we further strengthen our position in that market through these regulatory changes. And this is really consistent with our past strategy, and what's worked well for Cummins over the years is delivering value to our customers through these regulatory changes and strengthening our position in the market. So that's our intention. We've got the 15-liter natural gas out now. We'll add a diesel version of that in '26 and then launch our midrange products at the start of '27.
David Raso: The early introduction of the I assume you were thinking first quarter '26 with the new model years. Can you help us though, it appears in the channel there is some sense that there might be a prebuy of your engines in 25 to get in front of that early '26 introduction. Can you help us a bit, a, is that maybe helping some of the truck orders we're seeing in the industry? I mean you are 40% of the trucks out there. So prebuying cummins would impact total industry numbers pretty meaningfully. And the cost of the new '27 engine coming out early in '26, can you give us some sense of the cost to the customer? And the follow-up will be, how much is the warranty versus the components? I'm just trying to get a sense how much you're bring all '27 costs into '26. It's a case of...
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So let me try to frame it to hope you're thinking that, of course, the specifics on pricing, we're still discussing that with customers, the exact timing and transition between the current and the next-generation 15-liter in '26, we're still in discussions with our customers. So I'm not going to give exact answers there. What I will say is that we are adding meaningful engine and aftertreatment content and technology to both comply with the lower NOx regulation as well as deliver better fuel efficiency and operating cost and value to our customers. And that will be added as we launch this new product in '26. The requirement for a longer emissions warranty does not take effect until '27. So customers that buy this this new high-efficiency market-leading products in '26 will not be [indiscernible].
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye, Oppenheimer.
Noah Kaye: And related to this transition, I guess, is probably one of the biggest R&D investments the company has ever made. So as we start to kind of get past that. Can you maybe think -- help us think about the direction of R&D spend? It seems like maybe an obvious place to get leverage on future growth. But you did $1.5 billion of spend in '23, going to be around that range for '24. How should we think about that level of spending going forward?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean you've got it. We're investing at a record level, high level with these new platforms that we're bringing into the market. We think those will position us well for the future. And so you'll see some normalization of that. Now the exact shape of that is going to depend, frankly, on how regulations evolve and what the -- what I call the bridge period of technology looks like and how that transitions to zero emissions. But we'll see that coming off of our peak as we get past the '27 product launches, and we'll continue to be investing in R&D to create differentiation and value in the market to grow the business over the long term.
Noah Kaye: So if you're launching next -- late next year -- or sorry, I think you said '26, then implies we'll start to back down on those peaks.
Jennifer Rumsey: [indiscernible]
Noah Kaye: Okay. And then just sort of switching gears -- can you characterize the durability of strength in medium duty. I think the 6 and 7 classes have done pretty well. There's still some backlog there. but just talk about the demand you're seeing now in the market and whether that kind of continues into next year. You already kind of commented on some of your expectations for heavy duty. So medium-duty color would be helpful.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, for the year, we're seeing medium -- North America medium-duty up a little bit, flat to up 5%. We're continuing to see pretty strong demand. I mean you've seen a little bit of inventory and normalization of backlog, but we continue to see really strong demand. And with future regulations on that horizon, we expect that's likely to continue into next year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tim  Thein, Raymond James.
Timothy Thein: The first question is just on the Distribution business. And I'm curious what, if any, mix impact, there could be given the -- if you look at the strength that we've seen and you're projecting to continue for some time in power gen, that's now running at, call it, 10 points higher as a percentage of distribution revenues from a couple of years ago. And while some of that's coming as we've seen parts come down. So maybe in historical terms, that's a mix negative, just as the whole goods grows as a percentage of revenues, but maybe just given the strength in demand and tightness in supply, that's not the case. So maybe just your thoughts on just the mix within distribution and how to think about that going forward?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, as you noted, that typically whole goods is mix margin negative compared to aftermarket for us. If you just step back and look at the business in total, you've got to consider what we've done around inflationary pricing and operational efficiencies have tried to flex up to higher volume, and we're going to continue to focus on those operational efficiencies. But power generation gross revenue mix compared to aftermarket will be negative on the margin line.
Timothy Thein: Got it. Okay. And then maybe 1...
Mark Smith: Tim, that's where we continue to drive on those operational efficiencies and other areas and, of course, continue to drive as much of the parts business as we can underline. But the most important thing is we're meeting customer expectations and growing earnings in an efficient way.
Timothy Thein: Got it. And then, Mark, just on the gross margin color that you gave earlier, was the -- you highlighted pricing several times. Was there -- was that -- was all of that from this retroactive deal you had in the light duty? Or was there maybe just...
Mark Smith: I mean year-over-year, there's other pricing, it just -- it was appropriate for the engine to note for the engine business that that was a particular fact. But no, there was other pricing and the overall expectations haven't significantly changed for the rest of the business. Quite frankly, this other pricing we'd expect it to get it at the start of the year and it's just taking time. The most important thing is it's been reset. It's more of a timing issue and a concentration in Q3, we always anticipated something in our full year numbers. So on a full year basis, there's not much to say, but it just came in a more lumpy fashion because of the catch-up nature.
Operator: Thank you for our last question. I would now like to turn the floor back to Chris Clulow for closing remarks.
Christopher Clulow: Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate everyone joining today. That concludes our teleconference. I appreciate your participation and continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call.
Operator: We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 10:00:00) =====

Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today’s webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris and good morning. I'm excited to be with all of you today as I celebrate my two-year anniversary of becoming CEO of Cummins. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the second quarter. At our recent Analyst Day, I shared that we are raising our long-term financial targets as a result of our of our strengthening portfolio and continued execution our Destination Zero strategy. The strong partnerships that we have with customers and stakeholders are key to driving our strategy and growth profile forward. In this quarter, we strengthened those partnerships even further. In May, we announced with Isuzu Motors Limited the launch of a new 6.7-liter engine designed for use in Isuzu medium-duty truck lineup. This engine will power on-highway truck applications for the Japan market and will be available for Asia-Pacific markets and other global markets later this year. We also announced plans to launch a battery electric powertrain for Isuzu's F-Series in North America. Availability of the medium-duty truck is expected in 2026 and will include Accelera's next-generation lithium-ion phosphate or LFP battery technology. These advancements mark an important milestone for both Cummins and Isuzu as Cummins enters the Japan on-highway market for the first time in our history. We are proud of the partnership our two companies have built, and I'm excited to leverage our collective strength and scale to deliver profitable growth for both partners. Also this quarter, we further progressed our partnership with Daimler Trucks and buses and PACCAR as we completed the formation of joint venture now known as Amplify Cell Technologies, to localize battery cell production in the in the battery supply chain the United States. This included naming the Chief Executive Officer of joint venture and breaking ground at a new manufacturing plant in Marshall County, Mississippi. Amplify Cell Technologies will enable Accelera by Cummins and our partners to advance battery cells focused on commercial and industrial applications in North America and serve our customers' evolving needs. This is a significant step forward as we continue leading our industry into the next era of smarter, cleaner power. And in July, Accelera was awarded $75 million from the Department of Energy to convert approximately 360,000 square feet of existing manufacturing space at our Columbus, Indiana engine plant for zero emissions components, including battery packs and electric powertrain systems. The $75 million grant is the largest federal grant ever awarded solely to Cummins and as part of the appropriations related to the inflation Reduction Act. The Columbus engine plant is also where we manufacture blocks and heads for our current and next-generation engine-based solutions, further showcasing our Destination Zero strategy in action. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues the second quarter of 2024. Sales for the quarter were $8.8 billion, an increase of 2% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by continued high demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago. Second quarter 2023 results included $23 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded supply chain cost increases and offset the impact of the Atmus separation. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 4% to $5.5 billion, driven by the strong demand in our core markets more than offsetting the impact of the separation of Atmus. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter were 75,000 units, up 1% from 2023 levels. While our heavy-duty unit sales were 31,000, up 7% from a year ago. The second quarter marked record production volume for our heavy-duty engines at the Jamestown Engine plant. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels, while our unit sales were 38,000, up 13% and also outpacing the market growth. We shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for using the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2024, up 8% from 2023. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 23% and driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. The impressive power generation performance in North America and across the globe helped us achieve record sales and profitability in the Power Systems segment. Our second quarter international revenues decreased 2% compared to last year. Second quarter in China, including joint venture, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 2% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with higher data center demand. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 270,000 units, a decrease of 3% from last year. Demand in the China truck market continues to run at low levels with higher orders for natural gas engines and strong exports offsetting weak domestic diesel demand. In light-duty market in China, we were up 4% from 2023 levels at 480,000 units while our units sold, including joint ventures, were $33,000, an increase of 18%. The industry demand for excavators in China in the second quarter was 53,000 units, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels. Our units sold were 10,000 units, an increase of 19% as a result of QSM15 penetration at both new and existing OEM partners and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 36% in the second quarter, primarily driven by accelerating demand in data centers. This helped drive impressive financial performance at our Cummins Chongqing joint venture within our Power Systems business. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint venture, were $649 million, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 11% and while our shipments increased by 5%. Power Generation revenues decreased by 17% year-on-year as the second quarter of 2023 benefited from pre-buy demand ahead of emissions regulation changes. Now, let me provide our outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our expectations for 2024, while still anticipating the second half to be weaker than the first half, primarily in the North America heavy-duty truck market. We are increasing our revenue guidance to down 3% to flat compared to our prior guidance of down 2% to down 5%. We are also increasing our EBITDA guide to be 15% to 15.5%, compared to our prior guide of 14.5% to 15.5%. We now expect higher revenue in our Engine, Power Systems and Distribution segments, offsetting slightly lower revenue expectations for the Accelera business. We also expect stronger profitability in our Engine and Power Systems segments, driving most of the improvement in EBITDA. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 as we still expect softening in the second half of the year. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are raising our forecast to be 150,000 to 160,000 units, flat to up 5% from 2023. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units as we continue to benefit from an elevated backlog and strength in vocational orders. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, with a planned model year changeover likely to drive a temporary dip in production in the second half. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 8% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect slightly weaker property investment and slowing export demand in China. We are raising our guidance for the global power generation market to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 10% to 15%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. For aftermarket, we have improved our guidance to flat to up 5% for 2024, raising the bottom end of our previous guidance of a decline of 5%, with demand holding up better than expected in on- and off-highway markets. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $400 million to $450 million, a reduction of $50 million from the prior guide. As we noted at our Analyst Day, the energy transition is progressing more slowly, impacting both our e-mobility and electrolyzer revenues. In summary, coming off a strong first half of the year, we are raising our guidance on sales to down 3% to flat and raising our EBITDA guidance to 15% to 15.5%. While we anticipate softening in the North America heavy-duty market in the second half of the year, demand in several of our core markets remain strong. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash shareholders. In July, we announced an 8.3% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.68 to $1.82 per share, the 15th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. During the quarter, we returned $230 million to shareholders in the form of dividends consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Our diluted earnings per share benefited from a lower number of shares outstanding with the impact of the Atmus split more fully reflected in the weighted average share count in the second quarter. In summary, we had a strong performance in the first half of 2024, driven by record demand for Cummins products in our core markets. It is exciting to see our business grow with long-established customers in existing markets and to see newer partnerships yield additional opportunities in previously untapped markets for Cummins. I'm grateful for our employees who continue to execute on our strategy and deliver solutions that help our customers win wherever they operate. Our results reflect our dedication to delivering strong financial performance while also investing in our future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. As we discussed at Analyst Day, there is a lot to be excited about in our future. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter. Given the strength of those results and our improved outlook, we've raised the midpoint of our full year expectations for 2024. Second quarter revenues were $8.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago, as organic growth more than offset the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America increased 4%, while international revenues decreased 2%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago. The year ago numbers included $23 million of costs related to the separation of apps. The benefits of higher volumes and pricing as well as the absence of the separation costs were the primary drivers behind the improved profitability. Now I'll go into a little more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.19 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $2.15 billion or also 24.9% a year ago. Flat margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, offset by the removal of Atmus and higher compensation expenses. Selling, admin, and research expenses were $1.21 billion or 13.7% of sales compared to $1.26 billion or 14.6% last year. Joint venture income of $103 million decreased $30 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower technology fees and the weak domestic truck market in China. Other income was negative $3 million, a decrease of $27 million a year ago. Interest expense was $109 million, an increase of $10 million from prior year, primarily driven by higher weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%, including $9 million or $0.07 per diluted share of favorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $726 million or $5.26 per diluted share compared to $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share in Q2 last year. The second quarter reflected the lower weighted average share count as a result of the tax-free share exchange that there was the final separation of Atmus was completed in the first quarter. All-in, operating cash flow was an outflow of $851 million compared to an inflow of $483 million in the second quarter last year, and the decrease was driven mainly by the $1.9 billion payment required by the previously disclosed settlement agreements with the regulatory agencies. Excluding the settlement, operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.1 billion, more than double the cash generated in the second quarter last year. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, guidance for 2024 includes the operations Atmus in our consolidated results up until the full separation that occurred on March 18th. Components segment revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of 13% from the prior year, while EBITDA decreased from 14.2% of sales to 13.6%, with both sales and EBITDA primarily impacted by the Atmus separation. For Components, we expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14%, consistent with our prior projections and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, narrowing the range from our previous guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were a record $3.2 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a slight decrease from 14.2% a year ago. As the benefit from pricing and record on-highway volumes in North America was offset by higher research costs and lower joint venture income, primarily in China. In 2024, we now project 2024, we now project -- for the full year sorry, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 3% to up 2%, an increase of 2% from the prior midpoint, driven by a revised outlook in the North American medium-duty truck market. Full year Engine EBITDA is projected to be in the range of $13.7 million to $14.2 million, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint from our prior projections due to higher volumes and ongoing operational efficiencies. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 9% from a year ago to a record $2.8 billion. EBITDA as a percent of sales decreased to 11.1% compared to 11.4% a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses and a higher mix of power generation sales, which are positive for the company overall, but have a dilutive impact on the Distribution segment margins. We now expect 2024 Distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10%, an increase of 5% from the prior midpoint, mainly due to stronger power generation markets. And we've revised our EBITDA margin expectations to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.8%, down a little from our prior range of 11.5% to 12.5%. Results for the Power Systems segment set a new quarterly record. Revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 9% and EBITDA increased from 13.8% and to 18.9%, driven by higher volumes, particularly in power generation markets, improved pricing and other operational improvements and cost reduction. For 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be up 3% to 8%, an increase of 3% from the prior year guide. EBITDA is now projected to be approximately 17.5% to 18% and up from the previous projections of 16% to 17%. Accelera revenues increased 31% to $111 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $117 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $114 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support those parts of the business where strong growth is expected, whilst reducing costs in areas where we accept the prospects for growth have extended into the future. In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, down $50 million from our prior guide. Net losses are still expected to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the second quarter and the revised outlook in our key region end markets, we have raised our full year company guidance. We now expect revenues to be down 3% to flat, which is better than our previous guidance of down 2% to down 5%. EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 15% to 15.5%, narrowing the range and increasing the midpoint 25 basis points from our prior guide. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from three months ago, as we continue make critical investments in new products and capacity expansion to support future growth. In summary, we delivered record sales and solid profitability in the second quarter of 2024. We still do expect some moderation in some key markets in the second half of the year, especially North American heavy-duty truck, as we pointed out at our recent Analyst Day also. We've taken some cost to reduce -- we took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward, leaving us well-positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality that we may experience. We continue to deliver strong financial results raising our performance cycle over cycle while still investing for future growth. Our priorities for this year for capital allocation remain to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend, and reduce debt. Overall, a very strong quarter. Thanks for your time today. Now, let me turn it back over to Chris.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: Thank you. Our comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. Just on China truck, you didn't change your expectations there. Wondering how you're thinking about some of the new incentives that the government put in place there to support the second half of the year. Is that a potential point of conservatism in your outlook? Or do you think it may not materialize in there?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Thanks for the question, Steven. Good morning. We've seen pretty consistent performance out of China and the economic conditions over the last 18 to 24 months, and there's been previous indications of actions the government may take, none of which has really translated into any meaningful change in our industry. So, really, we're seeing the strong performance still with natural gas product an export and a relatively weak domestic diesel market and are not anticipating that changing in the near-term.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Cook: Hi, congratulations on a nice and clean quarter. I guess two questions. One, Mark, the margins in Power Systems are quite remarkable on a pretty muted sales growth assumption for 2024. So, if you could just help us understand what's going on there, sort of what's structural versus -- and do you see the opportunity for margins to improve from these levels in the out years given you're already assuming a close to 18% margin this year? And then my second question, Jen, just -- I know you don't want to give a guide for 2025, but how you're thinking about the markets? Is there -- as you think about the U.S. with the potential -- with the election and the overruling of Chevron, are you more conservative about a potential pre-buy? Do you think that gets pushed out? I guess the two positives would be China comes back and then the power system. So, I'm wondering, ultimately, is the incremental margin potential better in 2025 with those assumptions on a muted 2025 pre-buy with better mix from Power Systems in China? Thanks.
Mark Smith: Okay. Good questions. We'll try and fit in our answers with the time available for us this evening. On Power Systems, there's really three elements to the margins. And to answer the last part of your question, yes, we do expect there's still more to come. So, the team there is doing a fantastic job, started with some cost reduction, reprioritizing where we're where we're investing, investing less, strong pricing environment on the Power Systems side and then yes, there's more to do on the operational efficiency. So really, it's several strings to the bow in terms of what's been driving the results and still more to come. So we're really, really excited. Hopefully, you felt the confidence from Jenny Bush and to the team from the Analyst Day and have continued to deliver here in the second quarter, and we're bullish on that segment. That's -- those are really the main drivers on Power Systems.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. On the market outlook, what I would say is in the power gen market, the continued growth that we see there, in particular the data center, I don't see that letting up anytime soon, and where we have strong demand, high backlog. And as you know, we talked about in May, making some capacity investments to take advantage of the growing market there. In US on-highway, the medium-duty truck has continued to be strong. We see strong backlog and demand and don't see that letting up in the foreseeable future. and heavy duty, we do see build rates coming down, projecting about 10% down in the third quarter and 20% overall for the second half of year. And the question is what will happen next year with the broader economic environment because well stabilized spot rates and these truck prices are at a lower level than they've been historically, and that's impacted some of our customers demand. And so how that comes together with a pre-buy. The Supreme Court overturning of the Chevron deference, we don't anticipate any impacting regulations in the near-term. We believe that 2027 regulations will continue to move forward. And probably the bigger question is what we see with Phase 3 greenhouse gas in the 2030 time frame. And so we still anticipate some amount of pre-buy ahead of that emissions changeover. But the industry has also demonstrated there's capacity constraints that we've seen in the last couple of years. So how large that pre-buy will be, I think is still question, but we're preparing to have strong demand as we go into the 2027 regulation change.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Steve Volkmann: Great. Thank you, guys. Mark, I think you mentioned maybe both of your pricing being positive. It sounds like it was positive in truck. It sounds like its positive in Power Gen. Can you just double-click on that for us a little bit? I mean how much pricing are you seeing? And sort of how should we think about that for the rest of the year?
Mark Smith: Yes. Great questions. So on average, across the company, very, very much by segment, but 2.5% for the year, and that really hasn't changed. That's not changed in the results, but it definitely has been an important driver of the Power Systems results. And I don't think it's going to vary a lot that year-over-year increase should mostly hold across all the quarters.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. And Jennifer, Happy Anniversary.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you.
Jerry Revich: I wanted to ask on the medium-duty engine platforms globally, right? So you folks are picking up Daimler's business, now you're picking up Isuzu business in Japan. Can you just expand and talk to us about how many more medium-duty engines, you folks expect to ship globally 2026 versus, I don't know, call it, two or three years ago, given the timing of the transition? And if you could just comment on Japan, is it -- help place to import product into given the currency. Can you just talk about how you folks are able to do that economically? Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, sure. So you've seen this trend and some of the announcement that we made over the last few years playing out now as regulations start to occur. So we're seeing growing medium-duty demand in the US, of course, with Daimler transitioning to us and us as well as some other customers like keno here in the US. So we're growing our position in the medium-duty market here. We've now launched the medium-duty product in India with Daimler. So we'll start to see some volume there. Their strategy is really driven by regulation change. So when you see regulation change in Europe and Brazil will continue to grow volume with Daimler. On the Isuzu business, we are building that new B6.7 and their Tohoku plant in Japan. So we're not importing that engine. We're building it in the market. First time we've been on-highway market, we've been in the off-highway market there, of course, for many years. And so we'll see some slow volume growth there in Japan. And then as I noted, they'll then launch that truck into other Asia Pacific and global markets later this year. So you're just going to see steady growth, I would say, from Cummins year-over-year in the medium-duty space as these new customer partnerships grow and emissions regulations change and ads.
Mark Smith: In India and Brazil to the later 2027.
Jennifer Rumsey: 2027 through 2029. Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Angel Castillo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong quarter. I was hoping we could just unpack a little bit more the engine segment. You raised the outlook there on margins, and you've been talking about medium duty, but just as we think about your second half that is expected to decelerate on the heavy-duty side, can you talk about the components driving your margin improvement there? And just helping us kind of quantify what's ultimately driving that and how are you thinking about kind of 2025 margin improvement?
Mark Smith: Yeah. So we've got a little bit of help. We've improved the parts outlook. So that certainly helps overall -- we've been taking some measured actions across the company since the second half of fourth quarter of last year into the fourth quarter -- into the first quarter of this year, those should help with some lower costs in the second half of the year. And then we've got a stronger outlook in medium-duty truck. So those are really the three key elements. We're not going to get into breaking down the profitability by us. Those are really the three things that have helped improve. Yeah, and I think the conversion on the volume and the second quarter showed us there's still more room for improvement just in general operating efficiencies. No real change in -- in pricing most of the segments.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
David Raso: Hi. Thank you my question is on the guide. One area little skeptical on -- one area where it seems like you have some upside. The engine business, the second half of the year, you're guiding the revenues down only 3% year-over-year. And I'm just trying to go through heavy truck builds down double digit or the parts business mutes that. The light duty has the soft fourth quarter on the model change. Off-highway, comp fees, China a little better but big declines in Ag and some in construction. So I'm trying to understand why the revenue going down 3%? Or is it there's enough new penetration of customers that can push against all that, and at the same time, the engine margins only go down 30 bps sequentially on lower revs. And then the upside is PowerGen revenue growth less than 5% year-over-year in the second half, you're up over 6% in the first half. And the margins are down sequentially, I mean I understand the industrial piece within power can be down, but at least there are comp fees. So I'm just trying to understand, I assume PowerGen has a little more focus, a little more capacity, right, being pushed at minimum, good pricing. So again, why the -- or maybe it's just conservative, conservative on PowerGen, and if you can make us more comfortable on that engine? Thank you.
Mark Smith: Thanks, David. Good question. So I think on Power Systems, I don't think there's any fundamental changes. So it's really a key like how much do we -- how much product do we deliver to our customers and the conversion. We've given a range of outcomes for the margin. The business is performing well. And quite frankly, we're raising capacity. So I don't think the sales will go a lot above, but yet we're leaning on the profitability strongly, the business is really doing well. So I don't think there's much to be concerned about there, and we've raised the outlook. On the engine business, I think what's helping mitigate the margins, which is, I guess, the most important part is really some of the cost reduction actions that we've taken during the year, slightly better outlook for parts. And then there's just some of the puts and takes on the revenue. But those are the reasons why the margins at those revenue levels, we expect to hold up. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Very nice quarter. I have two quick clarification questions. One is on the distribution segment. I think margins were lower, but sales were great. So is that margin guide prudently conservative? Or is this a function of the mix headwind from PowerGen? Or is there anything I need to be aware of for that? And then the other question is on price costs. I think you just said price still you expect 2.5% at the enterprise level. Since some of the raw material prices are coming down, do you expect some improvement in price cost for the year?
Mark Smith: So to the latter, not significantly, we've probably got about 50 basis points of cost headwind across all the different categories, varies by business and segment. And then on distribution, you're right to point out the margins. So there's really -- yes, for distribution, PowerGen is a little bit dilutive relative to the rest of the segment, even though obviously within Power Systems, its very accretive. So that's true. We've called that out. Also in the first and the second quarter, there was some modest individual charges that didn't merit to be called out in the overall results. So I don't merit a lot of commentary, but just say they've trimmed the margins a little bit. And, therefore, we're really just reflecting where we are for the year. We do believe distribution margins have still got significant potential to improve over time, so that’s what’s going on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Thein: Hi. Good morning. I'll maybe combine these before I get the hook. Actually both pertaining to the North America heavy-duty segment. And the first part is just around market shares, Mark. Obviously, those can and do shift around quarter-to-quarter. And I'm just thinking big picture as we get in a softer back half of the year where the sleeper segment likely is disproportionately impacted from a production standpoint at the expense of vocational. I would imagine that favors Cummins from a share perspective, just absent any kind of specific OEM programs and other factors. So, maybe just your thoughts on that. And then the second part is just on the parts business, obviously, has been kind of a choppy past few quarters, but the commentary seems to be more positive, whereas some of the dealers and OEMs that have reported recently have flagged softness there. So I'm just curious, is that just kind of an absence of customer destocking that you went through last year or better just fleet utilization? What's driving that? If you can things. Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. And as you noted, I mean, we work to create customer pull for the heavy-duty product across different segments. But generally, as you said, for the vocational segment, we have stronger customer pull compared to the truckload, and that's the portion of the market that's been stronger right now. But of course, our goal is always to have the best product and create demand for Cummins products. But as you see that shift between the different segments of market and what OEMs are doing around incentives that could -- as well as capacity that can shift around a little bit over time. On the parts, it's somewhat demand driven and also this inventory destocking was a pretty big factor. There was a focused effort last year to reduce some of the inventory levels that have been carried because of the disruptions that we were all seeing and coming back down to more normal inventory levels. It was a little bit hard to separate between destocking and demand in the market. And so now you see us settling into what we see as pretty steady and solid demand in both our on- and off-highway markets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Noah Kaye: Thanks. Maybe hoping to get an update on demand in the order books for the X15? And how is it looking for the back half? How is it tracking the expectations and basically what's the response so far from the OEs?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. No, we are launching that product this month. with PACCAR excited to get it out in the market and then we'll launch it next year with DTNA, so have more offering there. We've got some early demand from some of the big fleet customers that have sustainability goals in the market, and we'll see how that develops over time, really with those fleet and other customers. And so we've projected we could get up to about 8% in the market, but I think it's going to take some time for us to get up to that. that level and for that market to develop in these operating costs and sustainability goals to drive demand up.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the engine slowdown that you're projecting for the second half of the year and maybe try and carry this into early 2025 because I think there's a perception that we're weak for a quarter or two and then the pre-buy kicks in and we're off to the races. When do you believe we start to show positive comparisons potentially in North American engines? And then we have an election this November, and I don't really know which way it's going, but just any thoughts on how a Republican victory or a Democratic victory might change the outlook for engines or new power?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So in terms of the heavy-duty demand, we all wish we had a crystal ball that could project how this is going to play out. This cycle has been very different than past cycles because of the pent-up demand that we had seen and then, of course, getting into pre-buy expectations. So it's really difficult to predict at what point next year we'll start to see improvement and economic conditions will certainly play a role in that. So I'm not going to project exactly when, but I think at some point in next year, we'll see recovery. And we've taken the steps to be prepared for that softening over the next few quarters. In terms of the election, again, I'm not going to make a prediction on that one either. What I will say is, as always, we worked in the past with the Trump administration, and we worked with the Biden administration. We worked across party lines to make sure that the opportunities and the challenges in our industry are understood and that regulation and policy reflects appropriately what those are. We will continue to do that in particular with the regulations that are in front of us. and our destination strategy at its core is about recognizing the economic importance of commercial and industrial applications and a need to decarbonize that industry over time and how do you take the appropriate steps to regulation and incentives to do that. So we're going to continue advocate for that. And some of the money that has come out of the inflation production Act has been allocated and is flowing into the market and creating jobs across the United States. So we'll continue to do that [indiscernible] those points and the opportunities and challenges that we're facing and how we navigate the energy transition. I think Cummins is really well positioned, regardless of how that plays out, but the industry, of course, is making investments in preparing for that. And so we want to make sure that we have stability and regulation, most importantly.
Mark Smith: And I just -- I know there's a lot of questions about heavy duty. But as we mentioned earlier, the demand for medium duty is getting stronger. We're actually investing to raise capacity over time, partly because of the strength of the market part because of the new business we've won. So right now, the expectation is that less volatility and a sustained high demand is what we're being told right now. Things can change based on the economy. But there's more question marks about heavy. Clearly, it's going down in the near-term and a lot less questions about medium duty for now.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Kyle Menges with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Kyle Menges: Thank you. I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the power systems and really focus on the unit outlook and how to think about capacity for the remainder of the year and then how you think about you could exit the year from a capacity standpoint or just doing the math, it seems like. And assuming you're running pretty hot from a capacity standpoint, it seems like unit shipments capacity for the year would be around 20,000 or so units. I'm curious what that might look like the capacity on an annualized basis exiting the year and looking into 2025 with some of the investments you're making?
Mark Smith: Well, there's a lot of there, unfortunately, in that business, there's more variation, right? There's just such a wide range of engines and applications. And so it's not a -- unfortunately, it's not a simple explanation as it would be, say, for on-highway markets where there's a narrower range of products across the market. I don't think there's going to be dramatic capacity increases this year, but we're working towards, obviously, supporting the one key global secular theme, which is the data center capacity, Jenny Bush talked about at Analyst Day. That's the one. It varies by segment, some of our more consumer-facing segments demand has dropped over the last 18 months. So there's some more capacity there. So it very much depends by end market. But the general theme is some investment in capacity, some reorganizing where we make product around the world. We feel confident about the revenue guide for this year. We feel confident we can support through our production revenue going into next year. But unfortunately, I just because of the variation in the products, the pricing, the applications that like a rule of thumb on the unit isn't quite as applicable in that segment.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah. The only thing I'll add to Mark's comments, which are absolutely accurate is, in particular, the data center market. What you've seen happen in the first half of the year was we worked really hard on our supply base and production and the 95 liter, which is running now at capacity, and then we launched the Symptoms product, which adds -- adds additional platforms, including a 78-liter that's able to run at this 3-megawatt key data center point. And so helped us the supply chain improvement as well as the new product launches helped us increased revenue and what we're selling into the market. But we're continuing to run into capacity constraints on some of the platforms in that data center market, in particular, which is why we're making some modest investments to be able to take up capacity over the next couple of years.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clulow for any closing remarks.
Chris Clulow: Thanks, everybody, for participating today. That concludes it for today. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions further after the call and throughout the rest of the week. Thank you. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Q1 2024 Cummins Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Chris. You may begin. 
Christopher Clulow: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. 
 Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future.  
 Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  
 During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, and then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter.
 In March, Cummins successfully completed the separation of our Filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies. Cummins will continue its focus on advancing innovative power solutions, while Atmus is now well positioned to pursue its own plans for profitable growth. We are proud of our employees' hard work and all who were involved to ensure successful separation, and we are excited to see what the future holds for both Cummins and Atmus. The final step in the separation of Atmus resulted in a tax-free exchange of shares, which reduced Cummins shares outstanding by 5.6 million.  
 In addition, we reintroduced our fuel-agnostic platforms with the name that captures the innovation that powers us forward, Cummins HELM platform. With higher efficiency, lower emissions and multiple fuels, the Cummins HELM platforms give our customers control of how they navigate their own journeys as part of the energy transition.  
 As the next product in the Cummins HELM 15-liter platform, we announced we will launch the next-generation diesel X15 in North America for the heavy duty on-highway market, which will be compliant with the U.S. EPA and CARB 2027 aligned regulations at launch. 
 Lastly, in April, Cummins Power Generation introduced 4 new generator sets to the award-winning Centum Series, powered by Cummins QSK50 and QSK78 engines. These new models have been engineered specifically for the most critical applications such as data centers, health care facilities and wastewater treatment plant.  
 I was excited to attend the launch event with our customers and hear about the growing demand for these critical applications and high interest in our genset products, which build on decades of experience meeting our customers' needs and deliver a step change improvement in power density, assured reliability, sustainability and low emissions. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets.  
 Demand for our products remained strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.4 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% compared to $1.4 billion or 16.1% a year ago. 
 First quarter 2024 results include a gain net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture and $29 million of restructuring expenses as we continue to work to simplify our operating structure and improve the efficiency of our business for the long term.  
 This compares to the first quarter 2023 results, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses, EBITDA percentage decreased by 80 basis points as improved pricing partially offset lower volumes and higher research and development expenses as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future.  
 Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2023 as the benefits of pricing more than offset the impact of lower volumes and supply chain cost increases.
 Our first quarter revenues in North America were flat with 2023. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 73,000 units, down 5% from 2023 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, down 7% from 2023. 
 Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 8%, while our unit sales were 36,000, up 22% from 2023. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the Ram pickups in the first quarter of 2024, down 2% from the 2023 levels. 
 Revenues for North America power generation increased by 21%, driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. Our international revenues decreased by 1% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a year ago. 
 First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with the accelerating data center demand. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 305,000 units, an increase of 14% from last year. However, shifts in the market share during the first quarter led to a decline in our volumes year-over-year. 
 The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2023 levels at 486,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 37,000, an increase of 3%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 50,000 units, a decrease of 13% from 2023 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weak property investment, high equipment population and slowing export demand. Our units sold were 9,000 units, an increase of 10% as a result of the QSM15 penetration and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 7% in the first quarter as accelerating data center demand was offset by softening in other markets.  
 First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $758 million, an increase of 1% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 7%, while our shipments decreased by 5% as the market slowed ahead of elections in April. Power generation revenues increased by 37% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. Now let me provide an outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets.  
 Our full year guidance now excludes Atmus from the March 18 separation date onwards and also include -- excludes the first quarter gain related to the divestiture. The guidance provided previously included Atmus for the full year as it preceded the transaction announcement. We are happy to share that our expectations for 2024 have improved from our initial guidance issued in February. Our forecast for total company revenue in 2024 remains the same at down 2% to 5%, which implies higher base business revenues of approximately $1.3 billion compared to our prior guidance as Atmus is now excluded from future quarters.  
 We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 compared to our prior guide of 245,000 to 265,000 units, though We do still expect softening in the second half of the year. 
 In North America, medium-duty truck market, we maintain our prior guidance of 140,000 to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat from 2023, consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, down 5% to 10% from 2023 as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance.  
 We project a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in the light-duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be in the range -- to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and potentially slower export demand. 
 The short-term shifts in the market share that I noted earlier are expected to normalize as we progress through the remainder of the year. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand, consistent with our prior guidance.  
 We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, up from our previous guidance of down 5% to 15%. We continue to expect weak property investment and slowing export demand in China. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024.  
 We are raising our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 10% to 15% compared to our prior guidance of about 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. 
 Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. While a smaller market for us, we continue to anticipate demand for oil and gas engines to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America.  
 For aftermarket, we've maintained our guidance of down 5% to up 5% for 2024, as we are through the inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. 
 In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $450 million to $500 million compared to $354 million in 2023, consistent with our prior guidance. We are ramping up electrolyzer manufacturing capacity and capability to deliver orders to our customers as well as expect continued growth in electrified components.  
 In summary, coming off a strong first quarter, we are maintaining our sales growth outlook for the year of down 2% to 5% as stronger demand in our base business has offset the removal of Atmus for future quarters from our guidance. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% compared to our previous guidance of 14.4% to 15.4%, reflecting stronger North America heavy-duty truck and power generation markets, which more than offsets the loss of profitability of Atmus.  
 In addition, we are taking steps to reduce cost, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. During the quarter, we returned $239 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.  
 In addition, we reduced the overall Cummins share count by 5.6 million as we completed the Atmus share exchange, which will be more fully reflected in the average share count in the second quarter and beyond. 
 I am impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world for delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in the future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect our planet for future generations and returning cash to our shareholders.  
 I look forward to discussing our long-term strategy further in our upcoming Analyst Day on May 16 and now let me turn it over to Mark. 
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid first quarter revenue and profitability and generated positive operating cash flow. Given the strength of first quarter results and our improved outlook, we've raised our full year expectations for 2024 after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. First quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, down 1% from a year ago. The separation of Atmus in mid-March resulted in a year-over-year sales decline of around 1% to our -- to Cummins consolidated sales.
 Our underlying revenues increased in North America and Latin America and were offset by weaker demand in China and Europe. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% of sales for the quarter. We completed the tax-free full separation of Atmus in March, which resulted in a onetime gain on the divestiture of $1.3 billion, net of transaction costs and other expenses. First quarter results also included $29 million of restructuring expenses. This compares to first quarter of 2023, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. 
 To provide clarity on operational performance and allow comparison to prior year, I am excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses in my following comments. Financial results of Atmus through March 18 are included in our first quarter consolidated sales and EBITDA. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.5% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.4 billion or 16.3% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percentage was driven by investment in new products and capabilities and lower sales volumes. 
 Now let's look into more detailed by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.5% of sales compared to $2 billion or 24% even last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, especially in the Power Systems business. Selling, administrative and research expenses increased by $72 million, driven by higher research costs as we continue to bring to market new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly the development of the HELM product line within the Engine business. 
 Joint venture income of $123 million increased $4 million from the prior year, primarily due to increased earnings in the Power Systems segment. Other income was $21 million, a decrease of $50 million from a year ago. The decrease in other income is driven by the relative negative impact of foreign currency revaluation and lower gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance compared to a year ago. Interest expense was $89 million, an increase of $2 million from the prior year, driven by higher outstanding, long-term borrowings related to the bond issuance we completed in February. 
 The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, mainly due to the tax-free gain on the separation of Atmus. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $2 billion or $14.03 per diluted share, which includes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus of $1.3 billion or $9.08 per diluted share and restructuring expenses of $29 million or $0.15 per share. 
 Just to reinforce what Jen said, full impact of the lower share count from the Atmus separation will be seen in future quarters since the diluted share counts counted on a weighted average basis. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $276 million compared to an inflow of $495 million in the first quarter last year. Now let me comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. 
 As a reminder, prior guidance for 2024 assume that the operations of Atmus would be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Components segment revenue was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 6%, while EBITDA, excluding costs related to the separation of Atmus, increased from 14.6% of sales to 14.8% driven primarily by improved performance within Cummins [indiscernible]. For Components, we've updated the guidance for the segment following the separation of Atmus and expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14% and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. 
 Our latest guidance reflects an increase in both revenues and EBITDA margins after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 2% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a decrease from 15.3% a year ago as the benefit of pricing offset by lower volumes and higher research costs. 2024, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 5% to flat, an improvement of 2% at the midpoint from our prior year projections, reflecting a revised outlook in the North American truck markets and stronger-than-expected demand from our construction customers. 
 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.7%, an increase of 20 basis points at the midpoint due to higher volumes. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 5% from a year ago to $2.5 billion. EBITDA decreased as a percent of sales to 11.6% compared to 13.9% of sales a year ago as aftermarket sales, particularly to industrial customers declined from the record levels that we experienced a year ago. 
 We expect 2024 distribution revenues to be flat to up 5% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, an increase from the prior guide of 3% for revenues and a modest improvement to margins for the full year. Power Systems segment revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 3% and EBITDA increased from 16.3% to 17.1% of sales driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and operating improvements, all of which contributed to a strong trend of improving performance in that segment. 
 2024, we now expect Power Systems revenues to be flat to 5%, up 3% at the midpoint and EBITDA has also increased to be approximately 16% to 17%, up 80 basis points from our previous guide. Accelera revenues increased 9% to $93 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $101 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $94 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support future growth. 
 In 2024, our guidance is unchanged. We expect revenues to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $433 million consistent with our prior guide. 
 As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions, end markets, we are adjusting the full year company guidance, and we project company revenue -- consolidated company revenues to be down 2% to 5%, consistent with the prior year guidance despite the separation of Atmus. 
 Company EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 14.5% to 15.5%, up 10 basis points from prior guidance, all of which excludes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus and the restructuring expenses. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 24%, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from our outlook 3 months ago as we continue to make critical investments in new products, capacity expansion to support future growth. 
 In summary, we delivered solid sales, profitability and positive cash flow in the first quarter. We do still expect moderation in some of our key markets in the second half of 2024, but we have raised our expectations of our own performance relative to our prior guide. We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward leaving us well positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality and continue investing and delivering strong financial performance. 
 Our priorities in 2024 for capital allocation are unchanged. We will reinvest for growth, plan to raise the dividend and reduce debt. Thank you for your interest today, and I look forward to seeing some of you in person in New York at our upcoming Analyst Day. 
 Now let me turn it over to Chris. 
Christopher Clulow: Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for our first question. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Volkum (sic) [ Steve Volkmann ] with Jefferies. 
Stephen Volkmann: I think I'd like to start off with power gen, if we could. That business seems to be going well. So sort of 2 things I'm curious to hear about exactly kind of what you think your position is in the data center market. How much of your business is data centers? 
 And then how are you thinking about increasing capacity over the next, whatever, few quarters or years, however, that's going to play out? What should we be thinking about in terms of capacity additions and your ability to kind of grow that business over time? 
Jennifer Rumsey: Great. Thanks, Steve. And as you heard in the guidance, we're projecting the power gen business to be up 10% to 15% for the year, and data center, mission-critical is really the driver of that. And we've had a very strong demand from data center customers, have had historically a strong position in that market, and that market is obviously growing. We're sold out on our 95-liter through 2025 right now. And I mentioned the launch of the new Centum product, which uses our 50 and 78-liter engine. So that's providing additional solution to those customers. And then, of course, we're continuing to look at capacity of the 95-liter and how we plan to support what we think will be continuing strong and growing market. 
Stephen Volkmann: So sorry, do you have any concrete plans to increase capacity of 95 yet? Or is that still in process? 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, we do have concrete plans to increase the capacity that we have in place to-date for the 95-liter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich: I wonder if I just ask the cadence of earnings over the course of this year, nice to see an upwards revision to both top line and margins. Mark, can you just talk about where the quarter came in versus your expectations because obviously, the quarter was light versus where the consensus was set up, and I'm just wondering how the quarter developed versus your internal plan. And what's the cadence of the acceleration that you folks are seeing to raise the guidance higher? 
Mark Smith: Yes. I think to be fair to everyone involved to all of you on that side of the fence and all of us here, there's a lot of moving parts with the separation of Atmus. So from my perspective, in total, we came in, in line with our expectations and when you adjust for the mid-quarter separation of Atmus, I think we're by and large in line. 
 I would say, as someone pointed out, the Distribution business margins a little bit lower, certainly lower than last year. We see those at the bottom end of the range in Q1 and improving from here, largely driven by what we've seen as a pullback on parts sales, particularly in the industrial off-highway applications. 
 So that's the 1 area. It's not new. It's been there for a couple of months, 2 quarters. But otherwise, I'd say we feel good about the gross margin improvement year-over-year. As you can see from our announcements and our comments, we're continuing to look at ways to streamline our organization, make us more efficient where we can. So overall, in line, Jerry, but expecting Distribution in particular to pick up in its margins going forward. 
 We've always expected -- probably we were expecting this a little bit last year, to be fair, and it didn't materialize. But we are expecting heavy-duty truck production to decline in the third quarter, in particular, and you've probably heard that from other industry participants. I think the Engine business and Components will feel some of that in Q3, probably Q4 Power Systems and Distribution shouldn't see any significant volatility in revenues. 
 And really, the momentum is to the up on Power Systems going forward and into next year, clearly. And Distribution. As you know, it's more than half parts and service and quite predictable and reliable. We just had a little bit of a mix shift with the lower parts, but we think that's temporary. 
Jerry Revich: Super. And can I just ask from a bigger picture standpoint, so new regulations 2027 will have embedded warranties essentially. What does that mean for your parts market share. Is that an opportunity when that field population increases for you folks to have higher engine parts market share because of that warranty dynamic on the new regulations, how significant is that opportunity? 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, as you noted, there's a requirement starting with the EPA 2027 regulations for longer emissions warranty for heavy-duty 10 years or 450,000 miles, most of that application is going to mile out. So it's essentially what our 5-year extended warranty that some customers are already purchasing. 
 And then that will mean that everybody will need that warranty that will be embedded into pricing on those engine systems and then, of course, we'll drive customers to genuine part throughout that period, which will provide some further benefit to us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. 
Nicole DeBlase: I'm going to ask mine together because they're related. So and they're both around Power Systems. So I think in the guidance, you guys are embedding full year margins below 1Q levels. I think it's a lumpy business, but if I look back historically, it's more common that the second half is higher. And then similar question on growth, the comps [ reduced ] slightly in the second half, but your full year growth guidance is, for an outcome less than the growth you saw in the first quarter. So if you could address both of those items. 
Mark Smith: We do tend to see some seasonality on revenue in the fourth quarter, a little bit in the second half. But I think the point of your question is essentially right, Nicole, there's positive momentum there. We've been raising the guidance as the performance is improving. 
 There is some modest variation depending on how the parts flow in that business. But overall, our messages, we're confident in the business and the improvements that we have Jenny Bush and her team have really worked hard on over the last 18 months. And if we get more revenue, we're confident we'll be able to turn that in higher earnings. But there's nothing dramatically structurally different. Going forward, we expect improvement over time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. 
David Raso: May 16, the meeting, can you just give us some expectations around the meeting? I think particularly around the margins. I think people are just trying to figure out the operating leverage in the company in the last couple of years, maybe not quite the margins people were expecting. Even the guide today, it was nice to see the power gen margin increase. But overall, the relative increase in earnings relative to the increase implicit in the sales guide. Still not that tremendous. So I'm just curious if you can sort of tee up a little bit what should we expect May 16. not trying to steal the thunder of the meeting but just to level set... 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Well, obviously, I won't tell you what we're going to tell you specifically, but certainly, you can expect us to talk about overall strategy for the company where we think we're at against some of the 2030 goals that we shared in our last Analyst Day and certainly talking about revenue and margin expectations and what the drivers for that will be within that. So I think you'll hear more about that for sure, David, at our Analyst Day. 
David Raso: Okay. And 1 quick one. The JV income in the first quarter was up year-over-year, but you're still guiding the year down. And I'm just trying to make sure we know why is it down? Is it China not continuing some of the improvement? Is there other parts of the royalty income? I know it's a pretty lumpy line item within the JV income. If you can help us with that would be great. 
Mark Smith: Yes. I think you're exactly right, David. There's really 2 moving parts of the operating performance, which generally tends to move in line or better than the market rate. And then we get very lumpy tech fees from the joint venture back to Cummins consolidated results as new products are launched and last year was a particularly strong period of new product launch, [indiscernible] certain development milestones. So the tech fees are going to be down, particularly in the Engine business primarily and that's offsetting any assumptions around the market growth. 
 I will say it's -- there was some truck OEM build increases in the Q1, but that was more on expectations or hopes about going forward, we're still waiting for clearer signs of momentum as China, as you know, is the biggest driver of the earnings there. But it's really lower tech fees, which were a big at last year -- a little bit in components, mostly in the Engine business. 
Christopher Clulow: One quick add there, David. And we also have built in our plan the launch of the battery joint venture later on this year post approval. So that will have some losses as well as that comes back online in the second half. 
Mark Smith: Which is embedded in Accelera. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, we're expecting that. We have final regulatory approval for that battery JV. So we're expecting that's going to start flowing in Q2. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. 
Angel Castillo Malpica: Just back to the Power Generation segment. I think you raised your guidance to 10% to 15% versus a 5% to 10% previously. Can you just talk about the price versus volume mix makeup of that versus prior expectations? Is this a matter of getting better production than you kind of anticipated? Or is pricing growing and just kind of what are you seeing from that perspective? 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So there's a couple of dynamics to keep in mind in that market. So first of all, as I articulated, the order board is pretty long. And so some of the work to improve price cost in response to inflation and performance of the business takes some time to play out. So we're starting to see stronger pricing leverage come into that market. And then we're continuing to, of course, drive improvements in the Power Systems business and efficiency in manufacturing and supply chain. And I noted the launch of the new products that we've also designed to be able to sell at some higher margins. So there are some favorable dynamics that have been happening in the power gen market compared to historically where we would have been in margin performance. 
Angel Castillo Malpica: That's very helpful. And along the lines of new products, just you talked about your X15 diesel engine that's coming out for kind of ahead of the emissions regulations. Can you give us a little bit more as to what you kind of expect in terms of guardrails around pricing and margin potential improvement. I know you typically run emission cycles when you get kind of the opportunity to reset and recover some of that margin. So as we think about maybe not necessarily specifically to any given year, but those projects -- or those products and kind of the implications to your price and margins as those get rolled out? 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So certainly, like in past emissions regulations, our goal is to deliver incremental value to the customer, to have margin improvement associated with that. You will see with the 27 EPA regulations, we already talked about the emissions warranty dynamic. You will also see added content, in particular, after-treatment system to meet those regulations has notable additional content. 
 And then you will also have the warranty dynamic that we always have as we launch new products where we began at least to launch to accrue at a higher rate from a warranty perspective until the product is out in the market, and we've demonstrated warranty. So those are the moving parts that you'll see. We have not yet shared specific numbers on what we expect around exact pricing for those products. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. 
Tami Zakaria: So I wanted to understand the margin guide a little better. It seems like excluding Atmus, which probably -- which was a headwind separating that out is becoming a headwind, but you sort of raised the full year guide by about 10 basis points, expecting better margins in Engines and Power Systems. So just to get a sense of what's really driving this improved margin expectation? Is it higher volumes? Or is it more cost savings? Or is it more price/cost? So any color there would be helpful. 
Mark Smith: Good question. You're right that the Atmus separation is a little bit dilutive to margins. So yes, good that you picked up on that. It's really volume and a little bit of cost reduction activity. Those are the 2 primary drivers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius research. 
Robert Wertheimer: My question is going to be around your competitive positioning in the 2027 EPA from what you can see today. There's a bunch of questions we get on whether there's a prebuy on what the cost increase would be and maybe the warranty should be stripped out of that, I'm not sure. 
 And there may also be more subtle things that you guys would understand better than most of us around how the standards can be met, whether having an additional nat gas where you guys do pretty well can offset other emissions and so forth. So that's the general question. Price increase, whether share gain and whether there's any subtleties around your mix in your early preparedness that will help you in 2027 transition? 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. And we are investing, as we've talked about in the new HELM engine platforms. And we're in a unique position because of our scale to continue to invest in what will be a market-leading engine solutions to meet those future regulations. 
 And so we expect that, that will provide some advantage for us as we go into those regulations. There will be a dynamic we think that's going to play out in the '25 and '26 time period as end customers anticipate a major regulation change and what that will mean to them. 
 And so we expect that's going to drive some things beyond the normal cycle in the U.S. truck market. And then as we go into 2017, there'll be some period of uptake, but we think we're well positioned. Obviously, our position in medium duty has continued to strengthen, and we'll have a next-generation 15-liter natural gas that will go into the market later this year that is of high interest to some of our customers that have sustainability ambitions and see this as the best way, most cost-effective and reliable way to meet those ambitions and then we'll have a new high-efficiency 15-liter platform and 10-liter platform as well. So we're excited about our position with those products and really focused on the execution of development and launching them into the market. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. 
Noah Kaye: Just sticking with the EPA 2027 for a minute here. If the final rules continue to provide nice crediting of hydrogen trucks. And just given your offerings in this space, wondering if you started to see more of a pickup for hydrogen fuel cell or whether most of sort of the Accelera inbounds at this point are primarily both. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So if you look beyond even the '27 into the EPA announced the Phase 3 greenhouse gas regulation, which is going to really start to shape the industry as we get into 2030 and beyond, no major surprises for us with that regulation, but it is really an unprecedented level of ambition and assumptions around 0 emissions vehicle penetration. And so the industry and the government is going to have to work really closely together for that to be successful.
 So to your question, one of the things -- there are a few things that we're pleased about in the regulation. One is it actually recognizes hydrogen engines as a zero-emission solution. So we believe that, that will create a space for hydrogen fueled engine that hydrogen fuel cells still are a good solution over time, but the adoption rate on that is likely to be -- take some time, I would say. And then the EPA also did commit to work to streamline hybrid powertrain certification. So hybrid engines, we think, may be an attractive solution because the infrastructure availability is going to be a challenge. 
 So that's another thing that we're looking at closely. So there's still some engine-based solutions. Yes, we're seeing an uptick today in more of the battery electric powertrain as I noted, and of course, electrolyzers, fuel cells are still at pretty low level. 
Noah Kaye: Yes, makes sense. And then you mentioned that you got regulatory approval for the JV. So just can you lay out for us kind of the game plan on how spending for the gigafactory should proceed over the next couple of years? And what you may be doing at this point in terms of lining up supply and demand for the factory, at least your [indiscernible] 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean the partners have been working together ahead of getting the final regulatory approval we announced that we selected a site earlier this year. So we'll be -- we're getting a site ready in Mississippi, just outside of Memphis to kind of see and really starting the work to prepare for supply chain and building the plant. We -- now that we have regulatory approval, we believe we'll be able to close and finalize the entity in this quarter. 
 And then we'll have phased investment as we build the plant and work towards start of production in 2027. And then we're, of course, sharing this investment of a 21-gigawatt hour plant across the partners and have this design that will allow us to phase in new lines and scale up the plant and production rates based on how we see the industry developing, and we're still feeling really good about how we're positioned in the market together with LFP cell that will be designed specifically for the commercial vehicle market and have the ability to leverage some of the incentive money that's available here to help enable adoption in our commercial vehicle market. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. 
Jamie Cook: So sorry, I'm managing through like 7 calls. I hope this hasn't been asked. But Mark, the question is to you, I guess, understanding you have your guys' Analyst Day coming up this month. I'm just looking at Cummins and thinking, okay, perhaps there's a cost story there, you have market share gains that should be helping you maybe less spend on Accelera. I'm just wondering, as you think about margins over the medium term, do you think there's an opportunity to structurally improve incremental margins? Or as you think about sort of the next couple of years, it is more so taking these actions to hit Cummins' historic targeted incremental margins? 
 And then my second question would be, and if this is addressed, I apologize. Can you just talk to the visibility you have across like in terms of backlog across your portfolio, in particular, for the engine side and the Power Systems side. 
Mark Smith: So I heard you we will explicitly address incremental margins in May. You will not miss that for all who are asking, very appropriate, at center of mind -- or top of mind for us clearly. So you will hear that very, very shortly, I guess. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. And Jamie, good to have you back. We're, of course, working and you're seeing the improvement in the Meritor business as we do the integration and Accelera as we ramp up. Revenue, we'll talk more about that. In terms of color on the market, we're seeing continued solid demand in the heavy-duty market because of the high backlogs that have been built up, still a lot of strength in the vocational market. 
 Truckload's been down for some time. And so we are still anticipating and hearing from our OEM customers that second half will have some weakening, and that's baked into our revised guidance, which is down, but not as far down as previous guidance. Power gen, I noted earlier, we've sold out the 95-liter through '25. We're looking at capacity there and how we can take that up as well as with the new Centum launch, being able to sell some of our other engines into that market as well. 
 So pretty -- really strong feeling very good about power gen, feeling good about medium-duty and vocational on-highway. It's really the -- it's the truckload, fleet customers in the heavy-duty market. That's the one that we're watching closely and still anticipating that it's going to soften before we enter the next uptick in their cycle. 
Mark Smith: Yes. And then what you heard maybe earlier was some industry consensus building about '25 and '26 ahead of 2027. So our baseline assumption today is that this is not as sharp or as steep as normal cyclical downturn. That's an assumption, not a fact, but that's what we've baked into our outlook for this year. China is the 1 where we're still -- we're waiting for more momentum probably. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. 
Jeffrey Kauffman: I was just curious your thoughts. It's apparent that the downturn, I think a lot of us feared in '24 on the heavy-duty engine side isn't going to be as bad as originally feared. I know ACT Research has taken up their forecast. You did mention some weakness beginning in 3Q, but are we taking from what would have been otherwise prebuy in '26 if we have a better '24? Or do you think the 2 are unrelated? 
Jennifer Rumsey: I'm not sure that they're related. I mean, we're really watching what's going on with production rates with backlog with some of the spot rate dynamics in the market. And if you look at some of the freight carriers out there, they've been challenged now for the last 18 months. 
 And so that's what's driving our outlook, but fair. I mean we -- because of the -- it's really the supply chain dynamic that has made this cycle so different and even unpredictable. It certainly held up better and longer than we had forecast, and we are still expecting to see some softening in the second half. 
Jeffrey Kauffman: Well, congratulations. 
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein Research. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Federico filling in for Chad. I would like to double click on the R&D intensity and how to think about this on the medium-term basis. 
Christopher Clulow: Sorry, can you repeat that? I don't think we got the first part. 
Unknown Analyst: Sorry. We would like to double-click on the R&D intensity and how to think about this on a medium term basis. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So we are -- as you know, we've taken up our R&D investments. We noted that in our comments because we're making investments, in particular in these new fuel-agnostic engine platform. So we're at an elevated level of R&D for those new platform investments. And those products are beginning to launch and really will launch through the '26 and '27 time period. And then, of course, we're at a period of investment in the Accelera business as we work to launch new products and ramp up revenue there as well. 
Operator: Thank you. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Chris Clulow for closing comments. 
Christopher Clulow: Thanks, everybody, for your participation today. That concludes our teleconference. Really appreciate the interest. And as always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Have a good day. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Look forward to seeing many of you in person in a couple of weeks. 
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Cummins Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Chris Clulow: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins’ results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.

With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of 2023 and discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and then I'll finish with the discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. As I reflect back on 2023, I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on being a global leader in clean energy technology and innovation. We made significant progress in achieving our Destination Zero strategy and it continues to be clear that this dual path approach to reducing greenhouse gas and air quality impacts of our products is the right approach to meet our customers' needs today and continue to grow our business and impact. We did this by advancing our core business as well as developing new zero emission solutions through Accelera by Cummins. Most notably, for our core business in 2023, we committed to investing more than $1 billion across our US engine manufacturing network to support the industry's first fuel-agnostic engine and platforms, as well as unveiled the X10 fuel-agnostic series launching in North America in 2026. Additionally, we initiated several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine, which will launch in North America this year and further enables our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. This is the industry's first natural gas engine design specifically for heavy duty and on-highway truck applications, offering customers the opportunity to realize reductions in nitrous oxide and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. We are continuing to see strong interest from both OEMs and end users ahead of the launch later this year. In our Accelera business, we announced a joint venture with Daimler Trucks and Buses, PACCAR, and EVE Energy to accelerate and localize battery self-production and the battery supply chain in the US. We further announced this quarter the selection of Marshall County, Mississippi for the 21-gigawatt-hour factory that is expected to create more than 2,000 US manufacturing jobs with production anticipated to begin in 2027. Accelera also reached a further milestone this year of electrolyzer order backlog, totalling over $500 million. In order to meet the growing electrolyzer demand, we began production at our first US manufacturing location for electrolyzers in the Cummins Power Generation Facility in Fridley, Minnesota. Lastly, we are resolute about the leading role we play in the energy transition, and emissions compliance continues to be a critical element of this work and central to our values. We were transparent about this in December when we announced that we reached an agreement and principle to resolve US regulatory claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines, primarily used in our pickup truck applications. After 4.5 years of working diligently with the regulators, reaching an agreement was the best way for us to achieve certainty on this matter and move forward with certifying our new products and advancing our Destination Zero strategy. We have expanded and strengthened our emissions compliance program to help ensure our products comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations around the world. Our product compliance and regulatory affairs organization, which we launched in 2019, has a reporting line directly to me and positions come as to meet global product compliance requirements and deliver solutions for our customers that are safe and lead to a cleaner environment. Now I will comment on overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for this quarter totalled $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% compared to 2022, driven by strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% compared to positive $1.1 billion or 14.2% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2023 results included $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to a voluntary retirement and separation program, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. This compares to the fourth quarter 2022 results, which included $19 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5%. EBITDA dollars increased from a year ago as increased pricing and higher volumes more than offset increased selling, administrative research and development expenses and inflation costs. Research and development expense increased in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the engine, components and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was very strong at $1.5 billion compared to $817 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on working capital management within the business. 2023 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, 21% higher than 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was $3 billion or 8.9% of sales compared to $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales in 2022. 2023 results include $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, the voluntary headcount reduction program I noted previously, and $100 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to our 2022 results, which included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and $81 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023 compared to $4 billion or 14.2% of sales for 2022, as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling, administrative, research and development and inflation costs. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in the distribution, components and power systems segments. Our Power Systems business in particular finished 2023 with a full year EBITDA of 14.7% of sales, up from 12.2% in 2022. This segment completed the first year of their focused business transformation effort, and the improvement in performance is encouraging. You will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. In addition to our segments, Meritor finished 2023 with full year EBITDA of 10.8% of sales, up from 7.4% in 2022, as our employees did a tremendous job of executing value capture opportunities across the business. I'm very pleased with the performance of Cummins Meritor to date as we continue our program to improve margins in that business and expand its global reach. In addition, operating cash flow for 2023 was a record of $4 billion, a significant increase from $2 billion in 2022. I'm proud of our leaders and employees efforts in 2023 as they helped deliver on one of our primary focus areas. Strong cash generation will continue to be a top priority moving forward. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2024 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2024 guidance continues to include Atmus for the full year, but excludes any costs or benefits associated with the planned separation of that business. We are forecasting total company revenue for 2024 to be down 2% to 5% compared to 2023, and EBITDA to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales, as we anticipate slowing demand in some of our key regions and markets, particularly North America heavy duty truck. Early in 2024, we expect the heavy duty market to continue at its current rate, which is slightly off the peak of the first half of 2023, with further softening in our forecast in the second half of the year. Industry production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2024, a 10% to 15% decline year-over-year. In medium duty truck market, we expect market size to be 140,000 units to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat compared to 2023. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 units to 145,000 units in 2024, a 5% to 10% decline year-over-year as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024. We're projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy duty and medium duty truck demand, and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in light duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and moderating export demand. Despite this slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we expect to see continued strong performance for the 15 liter natural gas engine as we achieved approximately 20% share for 2023 in the heavy duty market. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect a 5% to 15% decline year over year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. Revenues in the global power generation market are expected to increase 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, while the small market for us, demand for oil and gas engines, is expected to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. And for aftermarket, we expect a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2024, as we expect to be largely through inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $450 million to $500 million, compared to the $354 million in 2023. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to deliver over the course of the next 12 months to 18 months, as well as expect continued growth in electrified components. In summary, 2023 was a record year for revenues and operating cash flow, excluding the impacts related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims. 2023 was also a record year for EBITDA, net income, and earnings per share. While 2023 revenues were at the high end of our expectations, we anticipate moderating demand in North America truck production in the second half of 2024. We expect this moderating demand to be partially offset by a strong power generation market, resiliency in our distribution business, given the strong aftermarket presence, and improved Accelera sales. In addition, we are taking steps to reduce costs, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. As I close, I would like to officially announce that our Analyst Day is now scheduled for May 16 in New York City. I look forward to further discussing our strategy and expect invitations to be sent out shortly. Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark?
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. I will acknowledge I have a heavy cold this morning. So if I sound more dour than usual and a little rougher, please take that into consideration. We delivered solid operational results in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations for revenue and delivering EBITDA margins in line with our guidance. Compared to 2022, our full year sales grew 21% and our operating cash flow more than doubled to a record $4 billion, reflecting the strong focus of our employees on meeting customer demand and improving working capital. Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion and EBITDA was a net loss of $878 million, or negative 10.3% of sales. For the full year, we reported revenues of a record $34.1 billion and EBITDA was $3 billion, or 8.9% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we recorded a one-time charge of $2.04 billion in Q4 to settle the previously disclosed US regulatory claims. Fourth quarter results also included $42 million of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus were $33 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million for the full year, compares to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a total of $81 million in the previous year. Full year 2022 results also included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2023 full year operational performance of our business, I am now excluding the costs associated with the regulatory settlement, voluntary retirement separation programs, planned separation of Atmus and the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 8%, driven by improved pricing across multiple end markets and stronger demand for power generation products. International revenues increased 13%, driven by strong global power gen demand, particularly for data centers. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales for the quarter, compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5% of sales a year ago. Improved pricing was offset by higher compensation costs, increased investment and development, and capabilities in our Accelera segment. Higher variable compensation costs were driven primarily by stronger operating cash flow, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the full year. Now I'll go into each line item with a little bit more detail. Gross margin was $2 billion or 23.7% of sales, an increase of $201 million or 30 basis points from the prior year. The improved margins were driven by favourable pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher product coverage costs and compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $154 million or 15% as we continue to invest in the development of new products that will drive future growth and also due to higher variable compensation costs. Joint venture income increased $25 million due to slowly recovering demand in China from a low base in 2022. Other income was $50 million, an increase of $17 million from a year ago, primarily due to the recovery of technology fees from customers in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $92 million, an increase of $5 million from the prior year driven by higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt. The all in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was negative 13.3%, principally due to non-deductible costs associated with the regulatory settlement. All in net loss for the quarter was $1.4 billion or negative $10.01 per diluted share, which includes $2.04 billion or $13.76 per diluted share of costs associated with the regulatory settlement, $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million or $0.17 per diluted share of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.5 billion, $642 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven by strong earnings and a lower expansion of our working capital across the business. For the full year 2023, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, up 21% or $6 billion from a year ago, driven by the inclusion of a full year of Meritor results and strong organic growth. Sales in North America increased 22% and international sales increased 20%. Within those numbers, organic sales growth was 12%, driven by improved pricing, strong global demand for power generation products, continued strength in the North American truck market, and slowly improving economic conditions in China. EBITDA for the year was $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023, an increase of $1.2 billion or 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase in EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes, favourable pricing and logistics costs, and a modest and favourable mark-to-market impact from investments that underpin our company-owned life insurance plans, all of that partially offset by higher compensation expenses. All in-net earnings were $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share, compared to $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share a year ago. 2023 net earnings include $2.04 billion or $13.78 per diluted share of costs related to the regulatory settlement, $100 million or $0.54 per diluted share of costs related to the separation of Atmus, and $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs related to the voluntary separation programs that we implemented during the fourth quarter. Full-year cash from operations was a record inflow of $4 billion, doubling from a year ago as a result of higher operating income and much lower expansion of working capital across the company. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $1.2 billion, in line with our forecast, and an increase of $297 million from 2022, as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the fuel agnostic platforms within our core business. Our long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders, and over the past five years we've returned 56% of operating cash flow in the form of share purchases and dividends. In 2023, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments and dividend growth, returning $921 million to shareholders via the dividend, and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor. We currently expect that our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will mirror those of last year. I'll now summarise the 2023 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2024. If I need to say it again, I will, that the results that I'm going to discuss going forward exclude the costs related to the separation of Atmus, the cost associated with the voluntary retirement and separation, and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in 2022. Component segment revenues were a record $13.4 billion, 38% higher than the prior year. EBITDA was 14.4% of sales compared to 14.2%, an increase of $540 million, or 40%. For 2024, we expect total revenue for the components business to decrease 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.9%. For the Engine segment, 2023 revenues increased 7% to a record $11.7 billion and EBITDA was 14.1% of sales, compared to 14.3% a year ago. In dollar terms, EBITDA increased $74 million or 5%. In 2024, we project revenues for the engine business will decrease 2% to 7% due to expected moderation in the North American heavy-duty truck market, most likely in the second half, or most prominently in the second half of the year. 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. In the distribution segment revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $10.2 billion and EBITDA increased by 28% and improved as a percent of sales to 11.8% compared to 10.6% a year ago. We expect distribution revenues to be between down 3% and up 2% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.4% to 12.4% for the full year. In the power system segment, revenues were also a record at $5.7 billion or 13% higher than last year. EBITDA was 14.7% or 250 basis points higher than 2022 driven by favourable pricing, strong volume and certain cost reduction actions. In 2024 we expect Power Systems revenues to be down 3% to up 2% and EBITDA in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. Accelera revenues increased $354 million in 2023 with a net loss at the EBITDA level of $443 million. In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues and now we anticipate that Accelera revcenue will increase in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to reduce to between $400 million and $430 million as we continue to make targeted investments in future technologies, whilst improving the operating performance of our current products. We currently project 2024 company revenues to be down 2% to 5% and company EBITDA margins in the range of 14.4% to 15.4%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024 excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will likely be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth. To summarize, we delivered record sales and strong operating profits in 2023. Cash generation has been and will continue to be a strong focus as we enter 2024, enabling us to continue investing in new products even during times of economic uncertainty, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Jen indicated, we do expect moderation in several of our key markets in 2024, especially in the US truck market as reflected in our guidance. We have already taken actions to reduce costs in the business and are in a good situation to navigate the economic cycle and improve our cycle over cycle performance in 2024. Subject to our mark-to-market conditions, our intention is to split the remaining ownership in Atmus through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation as we seek to reposition our portfolio for the future. As part of the proposed exchange offer, common shareholders will have the choice to exchange all, some or none of their shares of Cummins' stock for shares of Atmus common stock subject to the terms of the offer. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as in the coming days. Our guidance for Cummins for this year assumes the inclusion of Atmus in our consolidated results for the entirety of 2024 and excludes any costs or benefits of the separation. The benefits to Cummins are expected to include a lower number of shares outstanding upon completion of the exchange. We will update our guidance as and when the separation is completed. Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. Jennifer, Mark, Chris, so normally when you folks have new engine regulations, we tend to see higher margins from you folks. I know we're a couple of years out from the 27 regulations, but can you just share some high-level thoughts? It looks like the average selling price of the engine could double given that embedded warranty increase and I'm wondering if you'd just comment on that and then broadly just talk about the parameters of how do you expect the dynamic to play out for your business compared to the margin expansion we've seen on prior emission cycles where you folks have increased your value add. Thanks.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, thanks for that question, Jerry. So as you've seen from us in the past, as we launch product with new emissions regulations, typically we see a content increase, of course, and then also look at creating value for our customers and have an opportunity to price accordingly with them. So we are looking to continue to do that as we launch new products, in particular, these fuel agnostic engine platforms. Of course, we also typically see a bump up in our warranty costs because we are beginning to accrue in at a high rate until we've demonstrated capability of that platform. So that's the other factor to watch as we launch those products, but what you see us doing right now is really focusing on improving operating performance of the business, as well as investing in the key platforms for the future that we believe will bring value to our customers and position the company for profitable growth.
Jerry Revich: Okay, super. And then can I ask separately, given the high logistics costs that the industry saw in 2023, can you comment on where your labor hours per unit stand today versus normal? And to what extent could that be a source of upside relative to the guide?
Chris Clulow: Yeah, Jerry, I think that has been, as we've progressed through 2023, continue to drive more and more efficiency. Some of the supply chain hiccups that we have experienced are beginning to iron out, we're getting better on time to delivery, and that does allow us to drive more efficiency in our plants. So I think we are continuing to see that as we progress through the latter half of the year. As we expect, as both Jen and Mark mentioned, volumes to particularly in the North America heavy duty truck space come down a bit and moderate a bit, we can continue to drive those efficiencies. So I think the cost per labor hour will continue to get better and I would say the overall costs on labor have somewhat levelled out. We went through, as you know, a long period of them rising and through the course of the last six months that has settled down and become much more of a flat.
Mark Smith: Yeah, I would say in the near term, there's a little bit of increased anxiety about events in the Middle East and some shipping delays and some reversing of the trend we've seen in logistics costs, which have been actually going down for us, Jerry. I don't want to overstate that, it's obviously is a little bit of a concern in the near term.
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Tim Thein: Maybe just one bit of a clarification, but on the comments on for engine shipments in North America for on highway, I think you said 140,000 down 5% to 10%. Is that -- was that relative to the total North heavy and medium duty market, or was that a comment just on heavy duty in terms of?
Mark Smith: Yeah, on the medium duty, Tim, we had a down, down 5% to flat, and that's 140,000 to 150,000. The heavy duty market, we have it down at 10% to 15% and that's our guide for the year.
Jennifer Rumsey: And I'll just give a little color. This has been an unusual cycle, I think, in the '21, '22 timeframe and supply constraints that prevented the industry from fully meeting customer demand and that has improved over the course of 2023. We saw the markets peak really in the second quarter and saw some slight drop off in the second half, but to the high end of our guide, it was not as much as we had forecast going into Q1. Backlogs look strong, in particular, feeling quite good about the medium duty market and continuing to watch what happens. We are still predicting a shallow cycle and further softening as we go into the second half of the year. So that, just some color behind those numbers is how I would describe that.
Tim Thein: Okay, I had a question on kind of what that implied in terms of the market share, but I can follow up with Chris after and then maybe the second one is just on the implied decrementals for the engine segment in '24 and obviously, the kind of a high 30% number, the JV income will certainly be a drag on that, but maybe with not to go through every single piece, but the parts headwind was pronounced in '23 for Cummins and I'm just curious for that piece, specifically, you outlined that the guidance for the off highway parts outlook, but for that and anything else that maybe you'd call out that's relevant to the year-over-year margin performance for engines? Thank you.
Mark Smith: Yeah, good, good question, Tim and the main thing that you didn't cover there was just our assumptions around product coverage. We're not expecting any significant change, but baked into our guidance is a little bit higher product coverage or warranty as a percent of sales in the engine business. We'll see how that plays out, but, that's the other factor that's in there that you didn't list.
Operator: Our next question is from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
David Raso: Hi, thank you. Just sort of a bigger picture question, I know there's been a lot of costs involved and you're right in the thick, of course, call it a decade long energy transition that there's a lot of expenses. I'm just curious, if you look out over the next year or two, is there an inflection point that you see your cost begin to recede and if not, is there a thought of maybe a larger cost out program? I recognize the separation program you discussed, but just something maybe more substantial size, just given relative to other names we look at, they've had a real strong run on profitability the last couple years and it's been a little more of a challenge for your margin. So just curious if you see something on the horizon that really changes that, be it cost inflection, or maybe an idea you've proactively taken, sorry, spend inflection coming down, or something on the cost side that maybe you can do. Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, David, thanks. Thanks for the question. And first, I'll say, I think you said decade long energy transition, I would just put an S on that decades long, right? It's going to take time. The reality is, if you look across our different markets and regions, it's going to take time for that transition to occur. We are in a period, though, of really peak investment in the engine business. As we invest in these fuel agnostic engine platforms, we've got a major investment in R&D and capital to do that. And we think that those engines are going to really position us well with high efficiency diesel products as customers have and continue to decide not to invest in their own platforms and to use Cummins and then also the fuel flexibility that will help customers as they begin to transition, whether its natural gas or hydrogen-based engine solutions. And so the next few years until we launch those platforms in the '26, '27 timeframe, we're seeing higher levels of R&D in those products and then, of course, we're also in a period where we've got somewhat lower revenue and higher investments in the accelerator business and we are pacing that investment based on how we see the market moving. We're looking at opportunities to share investments while having a leading solution, like you saw us do with the battery cell joint venture. As revenues grow, we improve parts of those businesses and electrified components. We've now delivered 1500 buses with Bluebird and ramping up the electrolyzer that will help improve margin performance of the business there. And then the last thing I'd say is, as Cummins has done, and we will continue to do, we're looking at how do we improve different parts of our business and so following the acquisition of the North America distribution business, we had a focused investment on improving margin there and you see that playing out in the distribution business performance and I talked about the focus last year that started in our power systems business. You see that playing out there, the Meritor integration, and we're continuing to look at places that we can improve operating performance of our business and then watch market demands and cost and so the voluntary reduction actions that we took last year help us as we see some reduction in revenue this year. So all those things come together to allow us to continue to improve our returns to investors while making sure we're investing in key products and technologies for the future. 
David Raso: All right, thank you. And just a minute real quick, and I'll hop off. The cadence of the declines in North America truck that you're looking to experience as the year goes on, can you give us a little sense of the cadence, maybe from an industry perspective, and would your declines, the cadence be any different? Just the idea of the lead lag between what's in inventory, how early you ship, just trying to get a sense for the cadence and how you relate to the industry cadence. Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, great. So, obviously, there's some lead that we have in supplying engines into truck build. So our engine build rates will slightly lead truck build rates, but as I said earlier, from a guide perspective, we think where we were running as we ended the year is going to hold pretty steady through the first part of the year and then we're forecasting some softening toward the end of second quarter and into the second half of the year.
Mark Smith: In a medium duty truck, there really isn't that much difference between the two, and market and hours and then heavy duty, that's where we see a little bit more vulnerability for the market and would largely expect us to move in line with the market.
Jennifer Rumsey: And then the last dynamic is in pickup, we've got the product changeover that'll drive Q4 volumes lower and pickup.
Operator: Our next question is from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Angel Castillo: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to unpack that cadence for the second half a little bit more. I think last quarter you had indicated aftermarket was an area that maybe was giving you a bit of a signal that there was a bit of a softening. And I think you indicated that things came in maybe the higher end of your expectations, and you kind of see that continuing into the first half. So as we kind of position that second half slowdown and now an expectation for aftermarket to actually pick up from the kind of flat to up 5% through the year, can you tell us, I guess, what you're seeing in terms of customer commentary and any kind of signs or what kind of gives you confidence in that second half slowdown as we think about the year?
Mark Smith: Yeah, I'll have a go -- first go at that question. First of all, I'll just say on aftermarket, we saw a very pronounced, I would say some element of de-stocking or lower production across our lower demand in parts in Q4, which we largely attribute to customer cash flow management. We don't expect that to be a continuing trend. We expect to recover from Q4 levels on parts and be pretty steady across the year. On the truck builds, well, of course, you've heard from most of our major customers. So we really don't have much more to say other than the backlog of trucks has been slowly edging down and then the thing that gives us the broader concern is the spot rates and the health of the truck fleet operators. That's our principal concern. It's not our OEM customers and right now that the backlog and the orders still continue at quite decent levels. It's what's happening to the underlying economics of freight activity. That's what's giving us the concern combined, which hasn't been moving in the right direction, combined with the slowly easing heavy duty backlog. So it isn't a kind of pronounced downturn we might have seen in prior cycles at this point, but those are the factors that are weighing into our consideration and I think our guidance isn't more conservative than anybody else's and we don't have any other observations beyond those really.
Angel Castillo: Got it. That's helpful and then maybe pivoting to Accelera, I just wanted to maybe unpack that a little bit in terms of curious what you're seeing in the backlog trends from 3Q to 4Q and as you kind of deliver on at least the electrolyzers over the next 12 months to 18 months, can you talk to us, I guess, about the cadence of the profitability of that business? We kind of exit 2024 and you start to have higher deliveries on those and maybe what you kind of foresee the exit rate will be in terms of that profitability?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, so we are in a period of still pretty heavy investment in Accelera businesses are really making both R&D and manufacturing investments to scale up the product and we're fortunate we have, existing plant and data that we can invest within to do that, to begin to produce electrolyzers and we continue to see growing demand and backlog is, as I noted, at a record level for electrolyzers. So that production rate is going to begin to grow and then you'll see margin performance in the electrolyzer portion of the business improving as the revenues grow and we deliver that backlog out into the market. Same thing in our electrified components business as we see revenue growth there. You'll see margin performance improving. One thing we have now included in our 2024 investment, of course, is beginning to invest in the battery cell joint venture and we believe that, that is a key investment that we're making together to ensure we have a leading cell for commercial vehicles here in the U.S. and domestic supply, which will both allow us and our customers to take advantage of incentives that are available and ensure security of supply over time into this market.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed.
Rob Wertheimer: Yeah, hi. I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on what's happening in the data center and large engine market. Obviously, it's very strong. I don't know how many years of visibility you have or what that market looks like. Your primary competitor announced a capacity expansion. I don't know where your capacity and your room to grow into that market if it is, a multiyear kind of curve. So I wonder if you could kind of give us an update on dynamics there.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, the data center market is an exciting growth market, has been for several years a trend with increasing cloud, data storage in the cloud and now with artificial intelligence and other investments. We continue to see very strong demand. We guided up 10% to 15%. Backlog for that market is very, very strong. We're looking at our capacity to make sure that we can meet the market demand and feeling good about the product offering that we have and of course, that business and the focus on improving underlying performance of that business will help us as that market grows.
Mark Smith: Probably the clearest secular trend over the next couple of years.
Jennifer Rumsey: I don't. Yeah, I think it will continue.
Rob Wertheimer: And then do you have room to grow in '25 and '26? Maybe not sure too much on your capacity, but it seems as though you're probably, you're probably being asked to quote or to think about, capacitor that far out, right.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, I will just say we expect that that trend of data center market growth will continue and we are and we'll continue to look at our capacity and how we position to meet that demand.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. Perfect. I'll stop there. If I can sneak one more in on medium duty, there's a bit of a narrative that as the COVID constrained production, the OEMs prioritized large class state over the medium duty and that's reflected somewhat in industry outlooks in your out. I'm just wondering if medium duty has more inherent demand than that being helped by interest rates or anything else, or if that's kind of where the market is kind of flattish? I'll stop there.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah. There were certainly the OEMs experienced a number of supply chain constraints and continued in '23 and even into the early part of this year, frame rails in particular. So we are, as you as you saw, really expect the medium duty market to continue to hold pretty flat to where it is now. It's quite strong. We, of course, have a strong position in that market and we're seeing continued demand and pent-up demand from some of the customers in that market for our product. So less often in there than heavy duty.
Operator: Our next question is from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I think you highlighted DV [ph] adoption scenarios at your last Analyst Day. As of today, I know you're hosting another Analyst Day this year, but as of today, which scenario, the fast versus slow, seems more likely? And how do you think that affects your Accelera target of $6 billion to $13 billion revenue by 2030? Any updates on that?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, as you said, we did a kind of a low and a high scenario for adoption at our last Analyst Day and you can expect that we're going to refresh our view of that as we go into the Analyst Day in May. What I would say is that, there are regulations and incentives that are helping to start to drive that adoption, maybe more towards the lower end of those scenarios is what we would think and we are continuing to look at pacing of investment to make sure that we're managing that in line with how we see adoption actually occurring.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. So if it's more leaning toward, let's say, the slower version, does that have a dampening or somewhat negative or slowing impact on the Accelera targets that you have out there?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, we're still within, it would still fall within the range that we gave in the Analyst Day, consistent with those range of scenarios that we suggested and recall that, a large portion of that revenue in 2030 for Accelera is in the growth of the electrolyzer business as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed.
Noah Kaye: Thanks so much. First off, a housekeeping question. I'm trying to understand cash flow dynamics as we exit the year and the leverage profile. Obviously the settlement impacts that a bit, but, you typically have a target to return 30% of cash flow to shareholders. How are we thinking about return to capital this year and where you're kind of aiming to end the year on leverage?
Mark Smith: Yeah, so morning, Noah. So we're going to start the year with the same stance as last year, invest in the business, dividend focus and some more de-levering. That's the way we start in the year. We'll continue to evaluate that with our board as we see how the cycle unfolds. At least that's our initial stance. Of course, part of our, in years where we've generated more cash than we've needed, then we've returned significantly more than the 50% in any given year, but anyway, we think this is the approach right now until we see a little bit more on the cycle.
Noah Kaye: All right. So you do expect to de-lever as we get to the end of the year.
Mark Smith: Yes.
Noah Kaye: Okay. And then just the guide for China truck seems a bit wide. Can you kind of talk us through the low end and the high end of the range in terms of the scenarios you're envisioning? Is it high end contingent on stimulus? Walk us through what you're seeing and assuming.
Chris Clulow: Yeah. That really reflects low visibility, right? So we've come off a very weak base, but there just isn't clear signals yet from the market as to what's actually going to happen. So we can build a case. It's hard for me to think of a case that's a lot lower than where we are today, but just the overall pace of the economy continues to be sluggish and so that upside really leaves room for something unexpected on the stimulus side, which has happened from time to time in China, but we don't have brilliant insight at this point in time. The outlook is cloudy and the conviction from OEMs is not quite there yet. We're doing well with our customers, launching more products. We're bullish on continuing to outgrow in the market in China, both consolidated revenues and in the performance of the JVs. We're all set to outperform. We just need a little bit of help from the market overall, but it's not as tangible as we'd like at the start of the year. Of course, we'll look at the same data points and provide you with an update. Hopefully, by the end of Q1, we tend to have a stronger view of the. And my voice is done for the rest of the morning.
Jennifer Rumsey: Chris and I will answer the rest of the questions.
Chris Clulow: We'll see how much it clears on China.
Operator: Our final question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Michael Feniger: Yeah. Thank you guys for squeezing me in. Just the share count's been kind of flat to slightly up. There's a comment in the release about a focus on debt reduction, payment of dividends. Can you just flesh out the priorities in 2024, because I know Mark mentioned with Atmus, I heard buybacks. Just maybe you can reiterate the framework of how we should kind of think about Atmus in 2024 as we move through the years, some of the puts and takes there.
Mark Smith: The main impacts of Atmus operation will be obviously, they'll set off on their own pursuing their growth strategy and as this final step, we will swap Cummins shares for -- investors will retire Cummins shares in exchange for Atmus shares. So our share count will go down if the exchange is successful. The reason our share count here in the past 18 months hasn't been changing or drifting up is because we stopped the share repurchase as well. We de-levered post the Meritor acquisition, which we've been telegraphing to investors. We've got a little bit more of deleveraging to go, and then we'll continue to evaluate whether we, what our opportunities are to generate the best returns for investors, either through organic growth or through more capital returns, but that's the basic way it's going to work. The share count will go down on the separation.
Michael Feniger: Fair enough. And Mark, I want to let you go and get better. Just quick question for you is just on Meritor, I think '23, I think there's revenue about $4.8 billion, maybe EBITDA a little bit above $500 million. Just when we think of the guide for '24 on components, anything you can help us unpack about how that Meritor in '23, how that kind of trends in '24 relative to your overall components guide? Thanks everyone.
Mark Smith: Got it. And I will say I'm feeling better than I sound, and that's largely because of the record cash flow. So please, as I said at the start, don't read into my breaking voice. Meritor achieved the goals we had for this year. It is not a segment on its own. We provided that data for the first full year for transparency purposes to make sure investors had a read on how we were doing after a little bit of a bumpy start when we first acquired Meritor. So that's all rolled into the guidance, but it's safe to say we've got further improvement in Meritor going into 2024 and we're really pleased with how the team is doing there, Ken Hogan and his team. So we're excited about that going forward. So thank you. Thanks everybody. Appreciate it.
Operator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris for closing comments.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, everybody. That concludes our teleconference for the day. I appreciate all of you participating and your continued interest. As always, our Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Cummins Incorporated. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.
Chris Clulow: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins’ results for the third quarter of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs, and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statements in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today’s webcast presentation, are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you Chris and good morning everyone. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details about our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details of our performance, I'm excited to first highlight a few major events from the third quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On September 6th, Accelerate by Cummins, Daimler Truck and Bus and PACCAR, along with EV Energy joined forces to accelerate and localize battery cell production and the battery cell supply chain in the United States. The planned joint venture will manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications, creating highly desirable manufacturing jobs in the United States in the growing clean technology sector. Total investment by the partners is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion for the 21 gigawatt hour factory with production expected to begin in 2027. We see this partnership as an opportunity to share investment with two long-standing partners while advancing a key technology solution for our customers and industry and collectively to accelerate the energy transition in the United States. In October, Cummins completed its acquisition of two Faurecia commercial vehicle manufacturing plants and their related activities, one in Columbus, Indiana and one in Roman Netherlands. This acquisition is a natural addition to the Cummins Emission Solutions business and will help ensure we meet current and future demand for low emission products. Lastly, Cummins announced several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Freightliner announced they are working with Cummins to offer the new X15 natural gas engine and its heavy-duty Freightliner Cascadia trucks. Also Cummins and Knight Transportation, Inc. announced that the industry's largest full truckload company has successfully tested Cummins new X15 engine in Southern California, using renewable natural gas to realize reductions in nitrous oxides and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. The X15 N, which will launch in North America in 2024 is the first natural gas engine to be designed specifically for the heavy duty on-highway truck application. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international market. Demand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2022 included two months of consolidated operations for Meritor following the completion of the acquisition on August 3rd of 2022. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% compared to $884 million or 12.1% a year ago. Third quarter 2023 results include $26 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to third quarter 2022 results, which included $77 million of costs related to the acquisition, integration and inventory valuation adjustments of Meritor and $16 [ph] million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 14.9% in the third quarter of 2023 represented an improvement from 13.3% we delivered in 2022. We as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling administrative, research and development expenses and inflation costs. Third quarter of 2020 also included a onetime employee recognition bonus of $56 million. Research and development expense increased in the third quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages for us in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components, and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 was a record inflow of $1.5 billion compared to the $382 million in the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on our working capital management within the business. I'm proud of our leaders and employees for their efforts in driving down costs and operational focus to achieve this record result for the quarter, and we will continue to focus on strong cash generation moving forward. Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 16% to $5.2 billion compared to last year, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 74,000 units, up 1% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 18% from last year, reflecting strong demand for our products. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 7% from 2022 levels, while our unit sales were 32,000, up 19% from 2022. We shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2023, flat with 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 8%, driven primarily by high inventory in the channel. Revenues in North America Power generation increased 15% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply constraints eased modestly. Our international revenues increased by 13% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, an increase of 24% as markets continue to recover compared to a very weak third quarter of 2022. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 243,000 units, an increase of 48% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 36%. In light-duty markets in China, we saw increase of 14% from 2022 levels at 442,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 26,000, an increase of 12%. Industry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 40,000 units, a decrease of 30% from 2022 levels. The decrease in market size is due to weaker activity in construction. Our units sold were 7,000 units flat with 2022 levels as increased penetration at new and existing customers offset the declining market. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by slight improvement in non-data center markets. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $730 million, an increase of 13% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 17%, while our shipments increased 23%. Power Generation revenues decreased by 16% due to the second quarter -- ahead of emissions regulation changes. Now, let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are raising full year 2023 revenue guidance to be up 18% to 21% versus last year. We are also narrowing our EBITDA guidance range to be 15.2% to 15.4%. We now expect higher full year revenues in our Components segment and higher profitability in our Power Systems segment, offset by decreased profitability in our engine business as a result of softening aftermarket and off-highway markets. We are raising our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 280,000 to 300,000 units in 2023 after a strong third quarter. Our current guidance forecast lower industry truck production in the quarter. While orders remain relatively strong, inventory management, truck component shortages, limiting our OEM production rates and fewer working days are all contributing to our view for the quarter. In North America medium-duty truck market, we're maintaining full year 2023 market size guidance of 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. While we continue to work to increase our production through rebalancing across our global plants and improving the supply base, industry production continues to be limited due to other supply chain constraints. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels in line with 2022. Additionally, we maintain our guidance for North America construction to be down 10% to flat, driven by high channel inventory and softening market conditions. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in light-duty truck market coming off the low market levels in 2022 and that's consistent with the prior guidance. Despite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the expanding fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas power by the end of 2023. In the short time since launching our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we expect momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. We look forward to launching the 15-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024. We expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10% in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, consistent with our prior forecast. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, consistent with our prior guide. Revenues in the global power generation markets are expected to increase 15% to 20%, consistent with our prior guide, with the strong performance driven primarily by improvement in the data center and mission-critical markets. For Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million and also maintain our EBITDA guidance of the expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023. Within components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11%. In summary, we are raising our guidance on sales of up 18% to 21% and narrowing our EBITDA guidance range from 15.2% to 15.4%. Our guidance for the full year implies weaker revenue in the fourth quarter. While demand remained strong in several markets, softening in the aftermarket demand, a continued weak outlook in China, continued industry supply constraints impacting North America truck production and inventory management efforts across many markets are some of the factors driving the lower fourth quarter run rate. In view of the lower forecasted revenues, we have initiated actions to reduce costs in our business, particularly in selling and administrative costs. In order to lower costs as we move into next year, we are offering voluntary retirement and a voluntary separation program in select regions and parts of our business for eligible exempt employees. We will continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further action while continuing to invest for our future. During the quarter, we returned $238 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. Our long-term strategic goal is to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. The strong execution from the second quarter of 2023 continued into the third quarter, driving record operating cash flow despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment. As we look forward to the opportunities ahead, we have a strong, capable leadership team who will help us successfully navigate an exciting and changing future. Today, I was also pleased to announce several promotions on my leadership team, which will be effective January 1 of next year. First, Srikanth Padmanabhan, currently Vice President and President of the Engine Business, will take on a newly created role of Executive Vice President and President of Operations. In this role, Srikanth will be an important work that will define and drive improvements in how we operate as a company through the energy transition and ensure our success of our operational priorities. Throughout his more than 30 years at Cummins, Srikanth has worked across many of Cummins businesses and regions, and consistently pushed the boundaries of customer-focused innovation to position Cummins as the leading powertrain supplier of choice in the transition to a net zero future. Srikanth is a result and people-driven leader and is the perfect choice to lead this work. Second, Brett Merritt, currently Vice President of On-Highway Engine Business and Strategic Customer Relations will assume the role of Vice President and President of the Engine Business, replacing Srikanth when he takes his new role. Brett has spent more than 25 years in the automotive and commercial vehicle industry and more than 14 at Cummins. The past 11 spent leading and growing On-Highway Business from 800,000 engines in 2012 to 1.2 million engines last year. Brett is an experienced business leader and a trusted partner to many of our key customers, and I'm excited for Brett to lead this segment. Bonnie Fetch, currently Vice President of Global Supply Chain, will assume the role of Vice President and President of our Distribution Business, replacing Tony Satterthwaite., who has been acting as Interim Head of DBU. Bonnie, who previously led supply chain for DBU has led for Cummins global supply chain and manufacturing organization, including Cummins new and ReCon parts business since early 2022, where she led her team in navigating the many complex supply chain challenges as well as improved operational and functional performance. For more than 30 years of experience, including 20 years at Caterpillar, before coming to Cummins, includes General Management, HR and Supply Chain Leadership and makes her uniquely qualified for this role. I'm excited for her to leverage her broad experience to run this segment. This is a period of change for our company, and it's also an exciting one. I want to end by thanking our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet our customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our some relationships and navigating continued supply chain challenges. Our results reflect our focus on delivering strong operating performance, investing in future growth and bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry, while returning cash to shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 16% and international revenues grew 13%. Organic sales growth was 10%, driven by improved pricing and strong demand for our On-Highway and power generation products. 5% of the total increase in sales was driven by the addition of Meritor. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% of sales for the quarter including $26 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 was $884 million or 12.1% of sales, including $16 million of costs associated with the planned set for [ph] Atmus. And $77 million of our integration and inventory valuation adjustments related to the acquisition of Meritor. Excluding the Atmus separation costs and Meritor adjustments, Underlying EBITDA third quarter was 14.9% compared to 13.3% a year ago. The higher EBITDA percentage was driven by favorable pricing to cover rising input costs and improved logistics costs, partially offset by higher variable compensation associated with the stronger overall company financial performance. In addition, we issued a onetime employee recognition bonus in the third quarter of last year, totaling $56 million. To provide clarity on operational performance in comparison to our guidance and excluding costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and the acquisition integration and inventory valuation stats related to the acquisition of Meritor in my following comments. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August of 2022, resulting in one additional month of operational performance in Q3 this year compared to last year. Now I'll go into more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.6% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 22.9% last year. Gross margin increased by 170 basis points, driven by favorable pricing and logistics costs and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.1% of sales compared to $997 million or 13.6% with the increase primarily driven by both higher variable compensation and higher engineering costs associated with new products across the company. Income from joint ventures was $118 million, $48 million higher than the previous year, driven by the receipt of technology fees and slowly improving demand in China, which boosted the operational results. Other income was a negative $7 million or $20 million lower than a year ago, driven by foreign currency translation. Also included in other income was $28 million of mark-to-market losses on investments. Interest expense increased by $36 million, primarily due to highest higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt. The all-in effective tax rate in the third quarter was 21.4%, including $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $656 million or $4.59 per diluted share, including $26 million or $0.14 per diluted share of costs associated with the separation of Atmus. All-in net earnings in the third quarter of last year were $400 million or $2.82 per diluted share, which included $16 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and $77 million of acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor. All-in operating cash flow was a record quarterly inflow of $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion higher than last year, driven by solid earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Generating strong operating cash flow remains a key focus area for the company, and we were pleased with the progress in the third quarter. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes a full year of operations for Meritor and Atmus and excludes any costs of benefit related to the separation of Atmus. Guidance also excludes the impact of any cost reduction activities within Cummins in the fourth quarter. As Jen mentioned, we're raising our revenue guidance for the company to 18% to 21%, up slightly from our previous guidance of 15% to 20%, driven by strong demand in North America. EBITDA is now expected to be 15.2% to 15.4% compared to our previous range of 15% to 15.7%. And we are also narrowing the EBITDA ranges for most of our business segments. Components segment revenue was $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. EBITDA was 14.2%. Back with the prior year, while EBITDA dollars increased from $384 million to $461 million. Meritor -- Cummins Meritor revenues in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, and EBITDA was $129 million or 11% of sales, a significant improvement from last year and in line with our expectations. For the Components Segment, we now expect total 2023 revenues to increase 35% to 40%, a 3% increase from our previous revenue guidance with EBITDA in the range of 14.2% to 14.7% compared to our previous range of 14.1% to 14.8%. Within Components, Meritor revenues are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, consistent with prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11% compared to our previous forecast of 10.3% to 11%. Lots of small changes in the individual segment guidance as we get closer to the end of the year. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA 13.5% compared to 13% in 2022 driven by operational improvements and the impact of the one-time employee bonus in the prior year. In 2023, we project revenues for the Engine business will increase 2% to 7% and consistent with our prior projection and EBITDA in the range of 13.6% to 14.1%, a slight decrease from our previous guide of 13.8% to 14.5% due to a continuing softening in our aftermarket revenues and some weaker demand in some off-highway markets. In the Distribution segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, 13% higher than last year. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 12.1% and compared to 10% of sales a year ago, driven by stronger volumes, improved pricing and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year. We expect distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15%, consistent with prior guidance and narrowing the expected EBITDA range to 11.9% to 12.4%. In the Power Systems business, revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 7%. And EBITDA increased from 14.3% to 16.2%, continuing a trend of last six quarters of improving margins driven by pricing, higher volumes, operational and cost reduction activities have all contributed to the continuing improving performance. In 2023, we expect revenues to be up 8% to 13%, consistent with the prior guidance. And we're raising the expected EBITDA to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.3%, up from our previous projection of 14.3% to 15%. Seller revenues more than doubled to $103 million, driven by electrolyzer project delivery, higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the addition of the Siemens Commercial Vehicle business electric powertrain portion of the --. Our EBITDA loss in the segment of $114 million will continue to support strong future growth. Our guidance for the topline and the bottom line [indiscernible] unchanged with revenues in the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses of $420 million to [Technical Difficulty]. Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Our outlook for capital investments is unchanged and expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to [indiscernible]. We will continue to focus on deploying cash to fund investments that drive profitable growth, debt reduction, and returning cash to shareholders through dividend this year. In summary, we delivered strong sales, solid profitability in the third quarter and record operating cash flow. We'll continue to focus on managing working capital delivering strong margins and investing in the products and technologies that will drive future growth. As we indicated last quarter, we see signs of softening aftermarket demand and weaker demand in some industrial parts. These, combined with less production days in the fourth quarter are expected to contribute to lower revenues and profitability. Have initiated some steps to the costs, as Jennifer outlined, and we'll continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further actions. Our priorities in 2023 for capital allocation, as I've said, to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend, and reduce debt. In July, we announced a 7% increase in the dividend, our 14th consecutive year of quarterly dividend growth. And through the end of the third quarter, we have reduced debt by $390 million. Furthermore, in October, we reduced debt by a further $650 million, consistent with our plans for the year. Thank you for your interest today. Now, let me turn it back over to Chris.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.
Mark Smith: Hey Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Jennifer, congratulations on the joint venture with PACCAR and Daimler. As we look forward to what that means for Cummins product availability and offering within EVs, can we just expand on that in terms of what's the opportunity to bundle it with e-Axles, battery management systems? And if you could just talk about, is there a plan use the plant to source batteries globally for your customers? Or is this strictly focused on the U.S. initially? Just would love your broader comments. Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So Jerry, I'll add a little bit more color to what we're doing with this partnership. As I said, this partnership is really focused on battery cell manufacturing. So, we have previously been investing and focusing on battery packs, e-Axles, motors, inverters, other key components and integrated powertrains for the electrified powertrain. And together with our partners saw the need to bring production of battery cells into the US and really design what we think is going to be a winning cell solution for commercial vehicles and industrial applications. So, this will be supplied into the battery packs that Cummins will produce. The cell will also go to PACCAR and to Daimler trucks here in North America for their battery cells, really is targeted at the US market. and having a domestic offering that we think will really do the market. And the chemistry here, for this, we will continue to offer battery packs around the world and chemistries, including LSP and NMC. But this one is focused on LFP technology, which, again, together, we think is going to be a winning commercial vehicle battery cell chemistry, lower cost, better durability, less dependency on some of these minerals that can be harder to source and also improve safety. So, really good opportunity for us and also to stay closely connected with those two partners as we're launching these electrified powertrains. Our intent is to offer that battery cell through our packs to other commercial vehicle and industrial applications here in the US as well.
Jerry Revich: Okay. It's super. And Mark, can I ask just a shorter-term question on the Engine segment, you folks had pretty solid performance in the quarter and for the year. The reduced margin rate at the midpoint seems like a big step down in profitability implied fourth quarter versus third quarter. Can you just talk about is that a significant production cut, China JV? Or is that just taking the midpoint of the range versus thinking about the broader, maybe higher end potential outcomes?
Mark Smith: Yes, I think it's not related to China. It is related to the fact that we're going to have less production days. That's consistent with the industry forecast for lower heavy-duty truck, which isn't a surprise, but that's what we've kind of been projecting for a couple of quarters. The thing that's really changed through the course of the year, Jerry, is the decline in the aftermarket, particularly running through the engine business. No doubt, some of that's related to customers rationalizing inventory. I don't, I think the underlying rate of decline is less than the headline rate because we've gone from a period of everybody trying to keep up with demand and now like ourselves, many companies are looking at inventory levels and trying to right-size. But just to give you a sense within the engine business between the first quarter of 2023 in the fourth quarter, parts revenues are down about 18%. So that's kind of been slipping each time we've looked at it. So that's the one changing trend. I don't think it's foretelling do. I just think it's mostly inventory adjustments. But that, combined with the lower production days, the lower absorption means that, yes, even though the revenues are holding up for the fourth quarter, it's going to be a little bit tougher. And that's one of the reasons, not the only reason why we've decided to initiate the actions that we discussed earlier. We're not predicting like a precipitous decline in our revenues at all. We don't have a visible clearly a leveling off or a slight decline in some areas, but we feel it's prudent both to do the cost reduction actions, continue our focus on cash flow and debt reduction the year that should leave us with the best chances of being very successful in 2024.
Chris Clulow: One quick to add, Jerry. It doesn't change our overall guide for engine business, but it is a difference between Q3 and Q4 is our JV income does step down because of license fees timing. So, we had a lot of that happened in the third quarter that steps down about 40 basis points for Engine business margin from Q3 to Q4. So hopefully, that helps.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
David Raso: Thank you. I'm curious, the cost-out decisions. How much is that related to what you're seeing on the horizon in 2024 and if you can give us any insight on what that is? And maybe margins in 2023 being maybe a little more of a, let's say, a heavier lift to expand margins than maybe we see across the machinery space broadly. Just curious how much is it sort of structural to what 2023 is playing out versus what you're seeing in 2024? And obviously, any sense of magnitude the cost outs would be really helpful. Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, David, I'll start and then Mark can add if he wants to add anything. So, as we said, we see that many of our markets have leveled off. We're seeing some drifting down in some of the markets, aftermarket, off-highway. And we are continuing to focus on ongoing improvement and profitability and performance of our business and using softening markets as a further opportunity to take costs out. So, we still see a lot of strength as we go into next year. We're not going to provide guidance for 2024. Today, what I will say is if you look at backlog and heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck continues to look quite strong as you go into the first half of the year. Power generation is very strong. And so we're not seeing any precipitous drop off, but we think it's wise to take some cost-cutting actions here in Q4 and then continue to monitor the situation. And if we need to take further action, of course, we would continue to do that.
Mark Smith: And we'll give you a fuller assessment on the next quarterly earnings call about the both the cost and the benefit impact. Of course, what we're announcing today is voluntary actions, so we don't know what the exact take-up is going to be and then our assessment of what is the kind of momentum in markets going forward. There will be some other smaller actions around facilities and other things. But we'll lay that out in detail in the next quarter when we've got a more holistic or hopefully, clearer view of the full year next year.
David Raso: That's helpful. Maybe you can educate me on something. I'm a little confused by the comment in the fourth quarter engine margin. And I appreciate Chris' comment about the JV income, how that will impact 3Q to 4Q, but you highlighted a lower parts impact benefit in the fourth quarter. But then when I see the Components business, which, obviously, has a lot of parts as well, it seems like you're implying a strong fourth quarter on margins for components. So, can you educate me on why the difference one division is getting hit on parts and really the parts division you would think for aftermarket, even more so components, is having a step-up in margins in the fourth quarter, at least appears to be…
Mark Smith: The size of the parts business in the engine business is significantly bigger than the size of the aftermarket business in the Components.
David Raso: Sure. I think difference one step down and one step up. And maybe I'm just doing the math right, but it seems like the component implied fourth quarter margins pretty strong?
Mark Smith: Yeah, I think it's pretty stable. I think that's just the dynamics we're seeing between the two different businesses right now.
Jennifer Rumsey: Well, both of those segments are anticipating lower volumes for North America, medium- and heavy-duty truck market in Q4 for the reasons that I outlined here. Frankly, there's a combination of focus on inventory reduction and supply constraints that are continuing to prevent OEMs from building to the full demand, and we expect to see that in Q4 impact our revenues for both of those segments.
David Raso: All right. Thank you very much.
Mark Smith: There can be some differing customer demand for Components and engines in any given short-term period, David. I think you're right in the longer run or medium over multiple quarters should correlate pretty well. But in this case, we're seeing a bit more pressure on the parts on the engine side. It's not all parts that are sourced directly from our Components business. That's the main part.
David Raso: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Wertheimer: Hey, I have two. One is just on the parts destock that you have mentioned and that makes sense. I'm just curious if you have any sense as to how much channel inventory people carry if you're all the way through that, half the way through. If you just quantify that potential if you're able to?
Mark Smith: It's a little hard to say would say what we tend to see more clearly on the Power Systems side is destocking almost every year into the fourth quarter. We are seeing some of that and some lower rebuilds, particularly in the slice of the oil and gas market that we supply, Rob. But I would say the engine -- on the engine side, the on-highway side, the seems to have been a more sustained multi-quarter approach. And I think part of that there was a focus on prioritizing OEM newbuilds, first-fit build as we started to ramp up through the cycle and wrestle through supply chain. And then the parts was in catch-up mode, and now we're finding truck utilization has leveled off. Everybody is trying to do a better job on the inventory management. It feels like it's -- we're getting towards the bottom of that right now. Of course, that always depends on what's the economic environment and what's the underlying level of truck utilization. So if you were to ask me today, do I think we're on a clear trend to have significantly lower parts in Q1? I'd say no. So it feels like this is the strongest step has been in the last three quarters with the information that we have right.
Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. And then if I can ask kind of a bigger picture question in China. It's obviously been very weak for a lot of industrials. Maybe it's bottomed in all your end markets maybe in some. I wonder if you could just give just your high-level view of what's going on in the economy there, whether fleet dynamics mean you have to be in recovery mode, whether that's true of trucks or power gen? Or just maybe give an overview of China, what you see in different parts of your business on the recovery? Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah. So when we look at the China market, I mean over economic activity has continued to be pretty weak there. We've seen improvements in 2023 compared to 2022 when they were heavily impacted by COVID lockdowns even more extreme weakness. So you've seen some improvement. We've seen the strong demand for natural gas heavy-duty engines because of the cost delta between natural gas and diesel there. We've kind of come through the emissions change over in an on-highway market. And so if we see recovery and continued recovery in the economy there, so I think that will continue to positively impact our business. And with the product investments that we've made, the emissions change, we'll have more content, and we think continuing to increase our penetration. So we'll watch and see if any of the government stimulus does start to drive positive momentum and the economic activity, but it's been relatively weak this year.
Mark Smith: Yeah. I mean just to give you a sense, I know we don't like talking about months, but July was like the lowest in a decade, right, in some of our JV production. It's crept up since there, but it has been tough. Again, it's not worse than we thought, but that just gives you a sense of how weak it was in the summer. Hopefully, there's upside from here, but we don't have good visibility to that.
Chris Clulow: Yeah, the RMB1 billion bond that's planned, I think that's encouraging to see the government moving that won't impact fourth quarter, but hopefully, it drives more infrastructure growth in next year. We'll wait and see that we're up.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. So I just wanted to ask about the Power Systems business. Margins came out really strong. Sales growth is strong as well. But when we look at the fourth quarter guide, it seems like you're guiding to a step down of almost 200 basis points sequentially. So just wanted to get a sense of what's driving that? Is this conservatism? Or is there something that we need to be aware of for the fourth quarter for the segment?
Mark Smith: Right. So the good news is they've been performing really well. So that's the underlying, and I think that's -- we expect that to be a continuing trend. As I mentioned earlier, typically, we see, particularly with the industrial side of that business that the customers really dropped down the purchase of parts in the fourth quarter. That's not new, but that that typically happens every Q4, and that's probably the main factor there -- the main negative factor. Otherwise, the underlying demand is strong. There's no major changes to pricing or the cost structure.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful. And the next question is R&D spend. The R&D spend over the last five years have stepped up notably. How should we think about that spend, let's say, in the next couple of years, and any color on that?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, Tami, as you noted in a period of increased R&D investment that we think will position Cummins well for the future. So in particular, now through the 2026, 2027 time frame when we launch these new fuel-agnostic engine platforms, we're making a major R&D and capital investments, and those are bringing new customer business to us and also will position us to have leading products through the energy transition. We've also been increasing our investment in the Accelera business as we ramp up the product investments for our electrolyzers and see growing demand for electrolyzer volume as well as in the electrified components. So that's really what you're seeing come through in the R&D line. And then we're continuing to really focus on improving underlying performance and efficiency in other areas so that we can continue to make the necessary R&D investments.
A – Mark Smith : Yes. And that's why we've had a big push on the SG&A and continue to do that. So well, on gross margin. So we can grow margins, grow investment, grow the bottom line and keep improving the cash. That's a simple formula that we're working to. We'd like to see the cash flow come up. The engineering is going to remain these higher levels for a little while yet. And it's also the new engine business platforms are contributing to the -- yes, CapEx being higher in dollar terms. It's in our expected range as a percent of sales. But for the next couple of years, we've got these renewal of these major platforms, which is important for our future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Thein: Thanks. Good morning. The first question is on Power Systems. And I'm just curious about kind of the visibility that you have looking into 2024. And backlog isn't something that we historically really talked about with Cummins, but just given the long lead times for large engines and just visibility you have from a rebuild perspective, can you just maybe speak to where you think you exit the year in terms of -- again, I know you're not giving 2024 guidance, but just any sort of help you can give in terms of what kind of revenue visibility you would expect to exit the year with in that business?
A – Mark Smith: Yes, you're right, Tim, that there is more visibility, but long lead times and the underlying demand. Certainly, I think we've got great visibility through the first half of the year. And of course, we're seeing -- we're anticipating more pressure on the on-highway side just because not a severe downturn, but generally, market participants are expecting some moderation in heavy-duty truck orders going into next year. So we would expect more revenue headwinds on the engines and components side. Distribution, as you know, is very heavily aftermarket-driven. So absent some massive crush in the economy, that should be more stable. And then Power Systems, certainly, very strong visibility through the first half of the year and some into the second half of the year. We haven't seen a dramatic shift in trajectory at this point in time.
Jennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean we're continuing to, as Mark said, to watch the Power Systems markets and in the industrial markets, we have seen a little bit of softening in oil and gas, which is a relatively small market for us that's kind of its inverse. And so that has softened a little bit. And then in Power Gen, you see a lot of growth this year. And I expect continued strong demand in the data center market for our business, and we're well positioned there.
A – Mark Smith: And it's encouraging that both Power Systems and distribution now are on multi-period margin expansion trends that serve us well going forward.
Tim Thein: Yes. Okay. And then just a lot of discussion here in terms of the on-highway parts business for you. And again, I know it's probably a bit of apples and oranges, but just listening to the commentary from your largest customer and kind of the outlook there they have for their own parts business. What do you think -- again, I know you don't want to speak for them, but what do you think is the -- you mentioned down 18%, I think from the beginning of the year. I think they're down like 2% or 3%. What do you think is driving that invariability between you come in to experience versus at least some of the OEMs? And yes, I know that the businesses don't align perfectly, but presumably, their impacted by a lot of the same dynamics. Just curious how beyond that.
A – Mark Smith: Generally, I think it's destocking, right? We've had -- we have -- there's obviously, we know returns levels and things like that from all parts of our channel have gone up as customers have been deep.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I think it's really important to note through this cycle, two very different dynamics because of the supply constraints than what you would previously see. So the aftermarket demand was really strong. And with the supply constraints, it was challenging for some of our customers to get parts. And so there was a lot of focus on building up inventory to try to buffer against those constraints and a focus, frankly, on addressing the gaps that resulted in an overbuild of inventory. So now that some of those supply challenges have eased this getting inventory back to appropriate levels has been a focus, and that's driven a drop-off beyond just the actual aftermarket demand in service. And then the same is true and happening on the first-fit build that we've had supply constraints that have limited our ability to meet industry demand and you see that resulting in the markets holding up longer than you would typically see and continue to see solid demand for first-fit trucks.
A – Mark Smith: And then if I just step back from the noise in this kind of correction period, Tim, clearly, our market share in North America on-highway markets has gone up noticeably so that should all go well for the parts that will inevitably be purchased through Cummins. I just think just in this correction period. I was just trying to provide that extra color this time to explain what I think a short-term margin influences, but not long-term market trends.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. Just curious about how much visibility you have to on-highway engine pricing going forward at this point into 2024. I guess to what extent is your pricing going to be dependent on the pricing of your OEM customers or how independent can that be?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, we were price cost favorable this year, as we've shared previously, and we have -- we're continuing to focus on pricing with new product launches and where we've seen inflationary costs coming through. So we're working to continue to maintain that positive price/cost ratio. And we're seeing some slowing of course, in pricing in the market, but we'll expect to continue to have some of that.
A – Mark Smith: Right. And again, when we give out for next year, then we'll, I'm sure you'll ask us about price cost. We'll be happy to share the dynamic.
Steven Fisher: Sure. Yes. Thank you. And then can you expand a little bit on your comments on the construction outlook? I think you cited inventory adjustments in North America, but maybe you can just talk about the broader global view of engine demand for construction applications and how you think the setup there is for 2024. Is there sort of a demand question or is it just sort of near-term inventory management?
A – Mark Smith: I think part of it can be the age of construction fleets, right? So we're seeing a drop off in engine demand. That doesn't necessarily mean a dramatic shift in North America construction activity. The three biggest markets both in North America, China and Europe, I think generally, it feels like the pace of economic growth in Europe is slowing. In China, it surprised us a little bit that the construction equipment demand hasn't fallen even further given some of the trails in the overall kind of financial health of construction sector in China, but it has come down some. But yes, no clear picture yet going into next year, I would say, that of all the markets, we still got some tire kick in to do, Steve, to figure out where we land for next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question will be from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Noah Kaye: Yeah. Thanks. You indicated some favorable testing around the X15 and coming to market next year. So just would love to get a little bit more color on your expectations for demand there, the extent to which this could be a driver of share gains and where you're hearing the sort of the strongest indicators of demand for that product?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah. So we'll launch the X15 here in North America next as you heard me say, it's performing well in China. We'll have a US version of that, of course, meeting the regulatory requirements here next year, and we'll have availability now through two of our OEMs. And we are seeing end customers testing and interested in that product will have the only heavy-duty natural gas product offered here in North America. So of course, that creates some opportunity for us as customers where they've got infrastructure, environmental goals or even operating cost benefits associated with natural gas will start to adopt that solution more. So there's some opportunity there for sure.
Noah Kaye: Okay. And then I think we'd love to get a catch-up on the electrolyzer backlog and quoting activity. Any change in the trajectory there? Anything you noticed during the quarter? And can you update us on where you're at in terms of building out capacity?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah. Really, on the same trajectory we've talked about previously with building up manufacturing capacity here in the US and Europe, continuing to have backlog growing. We are in the process of commissioning a 25-megawatt electrolyzer with Florida Power and Light over the course of this year. So another big project that we're delivering this year, and we continue to ramp up that business as we described previously.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Chris Clulow for any closing remarks.
Chris Clulow: Thank you very much for your interest today. And as always, the Investor Relations team will be available for calls and answer any further questions that you may have. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 10:00:00) =====

I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On April 3, United States President, Joe Biden, visited company facilities in Fridley, Minnesota to tour Accelera by Cummins, first U.S. manufacturing location for electrolyzers, a key technology to produce no-carbon hydrogen. Accelera is initially dedicating 89,000 square feet of the existing Cummins power generation facility in Fridley to electrolyzer production with the opportunity to expand to meet the growing demand. Accelera also reached a further milestone of electrolyzer order backlog totaling over $500 million at the end of the quarter. The Fridley facility will help address that growing demand, along with other capacity being added globally. Lastly, progress continues to be made on the separation of the Filtration business. On May 26, Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ATMU in connection with its initial public offering. Upon the completion of the IPO, Cummins retained approximately 80.5% of Atmus outstanding shares. The Atmus IPO generated $299 million of net proceeds and Atmus added $650 million of debt. Cummins realizes the benefit of the IPO proceedings and the debt issuance as Atmus will hold the debt at full separation. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter of 2023. Revenues for the quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 31% compared to the second quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% compared to $1.1 billion or 16% a year ago. Second quarter 2023 results include $23 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. This compares to second quarter 2022 results, which include $47 million in recovery of amounts reserved related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia, offset by $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 15.4% in the second quarter of 2023, represented a slight decline from the 15.7% we delivered in 2022, principally due to the addition of Meritor activity, which currently has a lower gross margin percentage than our other businesses and increased SG&A and development expenses. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volumes, pricing and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases. The strong EBITDA performance of the business in the first half drove an increase in selling and administrative expenses versus the prior year as we recorded higher accruals related to our variable compensation plans during the quarter. Research and development expenses also increased in the second quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components and Accelera segments. As we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.2 billion and EBITDA of 12.2%. The improvement in the profitability from the first quarter EBITDA margin of 9.4% was driven by pricing to cover inflation, operational improvements and cost reduction activities, which more than offset material cost increases that we expect to persist through the second half of the year. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 31% to $5.3 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 77,000 units, up 11% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, also up 11% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022 levels, while our unit sales were 34,000, up 27% from 2022. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the second quarter of 2023, flat with the 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 8%, driven primarily by positive net pricing. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 16% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints eased modestly. Our international revenues increased by 32% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago, with the addition of Meritor and a strong demand across most markets. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 37% and as markets began to recover compared to a very weak second quarter of 2022, which was impaired by COVID shutdowns in Shanghai and other regions. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 279,000 units, an increase of 61% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 63% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new products launched to meet the NS VI standard. The light-duty market in China was up 21% from 2022 levels at 460,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 28,000, an increase of 23%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 51,000 units, a decrease of 23% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weaker activity and construction. Our units sold were 8,000 units, an increase of 5%, driven by improved share with new and expanded customer relationships for both domestic and export usage. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 8% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a decline in the data center market. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $724 million, an increase of 22% from the second quarter of a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 2%, while our shipments increased 1%. Power generation revenues increased by 75% in the second quarter, driven by strong economic activity and customer demand ahead of a July 1 emissions regulation change. Now let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full-year 2023 revenue guidance of up 15% to 20% versus last year. EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.7%. We now expect stronger revenue and profitability in both our Power Systems and Distribution segments than we did three months ago, offset by increased cost in the Accelera business. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023. Supply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce and while end customer demand remains strong currently, our current guidance forecasts lower industry truck production in the fourth quarter. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are projecting the market size to be 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units. Similar to heavy-duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. However, through the rebalancing across our global plant efforts to improve the supply base, we have been able to increase our production, resulting in the improved outlook. The improvement in the medium-duty outlook was offset by decreases in our forecast for two other markets. North America construction is now expected to be down 10% to flat versus our previous guidance of flat to up 10%. Secondly, Brazil truck is expected to be down 30% to 40%, a decline from our prior guidance of down 10% to 20% as the market adjusts to Euro 6 equivalent emission standards. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be $140,000 to $150,000 in 2023. Volume levels in line with 2022. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increases. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the light-duty truck demand coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with prior guidance. Despite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for our products, including the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas powered by the end of 2023. In the short time since we launched our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we look forward to launching the 15-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024. We expect China construction volumes to be flat to down 10%, in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, an improvement from our previous forecast of about 1%, propelled by stronger power generation and on-highway sales. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horse power markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, an improvement from our previous guidance of down 5% to up 5%. Revenues in global power generation markets are now expected to increase 15% to 20%, up from our previous guidance of a 10% to 15% increase, driven by non-residential construction and improvement in the data center markets. For Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our previous guidance. As noted in my highlights, the electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum with our near-term focus on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand. As we scale up to serve the electrolyzer opportunity, continue to develop our products and support our customers in the field, costs are running higher than originally projected for the year. As a result, we have revised our EBITDA guidance for Accelera to an expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023 versus our prior guidance of $370 million to $390 million. Within components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance. In summary, coming off a very strong first half where we produced record revenues and record EBITDA while delivering for our customers, we are maintaining our guidance of sales up 15% to 20% and EBITDA of 15% to 15.7%. Demand in most of our core markets is strong, while we continue to closely monitor global economic indicators. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins will remain in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our shareholders. Our guidance for the full-year implies weaker revenue in the second half of the year. While demand remained strong in several markets, a weaker outlook in China versus the first half, an expected decrease in the North American heavy-duty truck production in the fourth quarter and the previously mentioned North America construction and Brazil truck decrease are some of the factors driving the lower second half run rate. In view of the lowered forecasted revenues in the second half of the year, we expect to manage our operating expenses below the second quarter levels. During the quarter, we returned $223 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Shortly after quarter end, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.57 to $1.68 per share, the 14th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. The strong execution from the first quarter of 2023 continued into the second, resulting in record sales and strong profitability despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment. I want to thank our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our customer relationships and navigating continued supply chain constraints. Our results reflect our focus on delivering strong operational performance, investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues were a record $8.6 billion, up 31% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 31% and international sales increased 32%. Our organic sales growth rate was 12%, driven by improved pricing and strong end market demand for our products globally, with a balance of 19% increase in sales driven by the addition of Meritor. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1% overall. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% of sales for the quarter, including $23 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2022 was $1.1 billion or 16% of sales, including a one-time $47 million benefit related to the adjustment of our reserves as we suspended our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Excluding the Atmus separation costs and the impact from Russia year ago, EBITDA in the second quarter of this year was 15.4% compared to 15.7% a year ago. Lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by the dilutive impact of Meritor, higher variable compensation costs, which showed up largely in our SG&A line and in higher development spending. To provide clarity on operational performance and comparison to guidance and excluding the costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and the impacts from Russia in my following comments. Now let's look in more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 25.6% last year. As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased by 70 basis points as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive impact of the Meritor acquisition and higher variable compensation expenses. Our Cummins Meritor business continued to show improvement in the second quarter and is performing in line with our expectations for the full-year. In fact, most of our businesses delivered gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.3% of sales compared to $892 million or 13.5% last year. The increase in expenses was driven by the addition of Meritor, net of realized synergies, higher variable compensation, higher development costs as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth. Income from our joint ventures was $133 million, up $38 million from a year ago due to a slow recovery in demand in China. Other income was $24 million, an improvement of $42 million from a year ago. In the second quarter last year, we incurred $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans, and those did not repeat this year, which largely explains the change in other income. Interest expense increased by $65 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and also rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 22.3%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share compared to $702 million or $4.94 a year ago. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $483 million, $116 million lower than the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher working capital associated with the higher sales. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor and assumes that the operations of Atmus will be included in our consolidated results for the full-year. Segment results and guidance exclude the costs and benefits related to the separation of the filtration business. Components revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 76%. EBITDA percent decreased from 18.2% to 14.7%, with EBITDA dollars growing from $355 million to $504 million, both the big driver of the growth in EBITDA dollars and the decline in the percent was the addition of the Meritor business, which added $1.2 billion in sales and $152 million or 12.2% of sales EBITDA. For the Components segment, we expect 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, in line with our previous guidance. Within components, Meritor revenues are expected to be between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion and EBITDA in the range of 10.3% to 11%, consistent with our previous guidance. In the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were $3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.2% compared to 15.2% in 2022 due to higher development spending and higher variable compensation costs linked to the stronger overall performance of Cummins year-over-year. In 2023, we project revenues for the engine business will increase 2% to 7% and EBITDA expected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5%, unchanged from our prior year guidance. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $2.6 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.5% compared to 11.2% a year ago. We now expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15% and EBITDA in the range of 11.7% to 12.4% with sales increasing 5% from our prior outlook and margins up 40 basis points, extending the track record of margin expansion in this business. In the Power Systems segment, revenues were a record $1.5 billion, an increase of 21% and EBITDA increased by 58%. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA rose from 10.6% to 13.8% of sales, driven by higher power generation volumes and improved pricing. We have an intense focus on improving the results of the Power Systems business, and this has yielded clear margin expansion over the past year, and we see much more potential for earnings growth going forward. Results for the second quarter include $18 million of costs associated with actions that we have taken to drive further improvement as we seek to transform the long-term earnings power of this business. In 2023, we expect revenues for Power Systems to be up 8% to 13%, an increase of 3% from our previous outlook. EBITDA is now projected to be 14.3% to 15%, an increase of 60 basis points from our last forecast. Accelera revenues more than doubled to $85 million, driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business. Our EBITDA loss was $114 million as we continue to invest in the product infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million, unchanged from our previous outlook. And loss is now expected to be in the range of $420 million to $440 million, an increase of $50 million in those losses as we increase the level of resources dedicated to successfully ramp up and meet growing electrolyzer demand. As Jen mentioned, our full-year outlook for the company is unchanged. We maintain our previous guidance with revenues expected to be up 15% to 20% and from last year and EBITDA margins in the range of 15% to 15.7%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior outlook. In 2023, we will continue to focus deploying cash to reinvest in our business, grow the dividend and reduce debt. In summary, we delivered record solid profitability in the second quarter of 2023 with a key feature being the improvement in the gross margins in most parts of our business. In the second half of the year, our focus remains the same, delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in lower carbon technologies. Our guidance does imply lower revenues in the second half of the year, and we will manage our operating expenses below second quarter levels accordingly. Thank you for your interest today. We delivered solid second quarter and continue to make good progress in executing our strategy. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question.
Operator: At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We are now ready to begin. Our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Jamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess two questions. One, the engine margin, I’m just trying to understand. They were a little weaker than I thought. I understand there’s some compensation and investment in there, but your JV income was really high as well and margins in the back half versus the first half were lower. So can you just help us understand what’s going on, on the engine margin side and how to think about, like, what’s required in investment over the longer-term? And does that continue to weigh on the engine margin? And then my second question, Jen, just bigger picture. I know you don’t want to guide to 2024 – for 2024, but I know you’re very close with your customers. So as you look out in 2024, given some of the industry forecasts that are out there, which markets are you more after this [indiscernible] markets that you’re getting a little more cautious that we could see declines? Thank you.
Mark Smith: Okay. I’ll go with the first question, Jamie. Thank you. Yes, so in the Engine business, there are really three themes to the numbers. One, we’ve raised the investment level in engineering, really to support all the additional business that we’ve won and meet future emissions and drive that profitable growth. Two, this is the business, more recently, it’s continued to face some continued inflation on material costs. We’re net pricing positive, but we’ve also continued to experience some increase in material costs. And then for the second half of the year, really, we’re expecting China JV earnings to weaken, which is typical having a weaker second half than the first half. And then yes, as you mentioned, the incentive compensation – we’ll describe it as an issue. It is a factor in our results across the company in that our performance is exceeding our internal plan and we trued up our accruals in the second quarter, which happens from time to time and also compares to a quarter a year ago when we were lowering them. But the business issues are really the increased investment and then the lower JV earnings in the second half of the year.
Jennifer Rumsey: And on your second question, Jamie, in terms of what we’re seeing in the market, the performance of our products continues to be very positive and strong. And what I would say is my conversations in the – in recent months have continued to have conversations with customers, in particular in the medium-duty space, and even in the electrolyzer space, there’s a lot of demand and interest in Cummins products. And I noted that we’ve made some shifts in our global plants to increase capacity and medium-duty for North America to meet that demand. So there’s still really strong demand in that market. And we’re cyclical business. We’re used to being a cyclical business, I think this is going to likely be a more gentle cycle across markets than what we’ve typically seen, but we do see some indications in certain markets, a little bit softening in aftermarket, some anticipated down days and our guidance implies heavy-duty a little bit lower in the fourth quarter, in particular, construction a little bit lower. And China, really not growing significantly, seasonally softer in the second half versus first half. So I still feel quite good about market outlook and how we’re performing. And yes, we think the Q2 is going to be our revenue peak and we’re – our guide reflects that and we’re taking actions to make sure we’re prioritizing the places we need to invest for the future while also managing headcount discretionary spending and just SG&A down for the second half of the year.
Jamie Cook: Thank you.
Mark Smith: Thanks Jamie.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Mark Smith: Hey, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Jennifer. Hi. I’m wondering if you could just talk about the interest that you’re seeing from your customers in alternative fuel technologies. Over the course of the quarter, we have the positive EPA mandate essentially for a landfill gas, given the changes in the RIN structure. I’m wondering if you could just talk about what you’re seeing from your customers on interest in the 15-liter engine in North America specifically for that product. And any other comments that you would add on internal combustion hydrogen or other moving pieces, based on the visibility on the regulatory side? Thanks.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, great. Thanks, Jerry. Yes, as you noted, I think there’s growing interest in what I call some of these bridge technologies, alternate fuels and engines, the natural gas product, we’re seeing growth in that in China. We’re going to launch that here. We expect to see some success in that market and looking at hydrogen engines where we’ve – we’re developing those and trying to figure out in which markets they’ll play a role. It’s slow going because of the infrastructure build out that’s required. And so we’re really focused on investing to have the right products, but at the right time. And so you’re still going to see a lot of demand for diesel in the next few years. One key thing that happened this quarter was progress with the car regulation and the alignment now to EPA in ‘27, which is a real positive. So we could focus on a nationwide solution and then some of these bridge and zero emission solutions to start to adopt and applications and places where the infrastructure exists.
Jerry Revich: Super. And Mark, can I ask within components, your EBITDA margins were up a touch sequentially 2Q versus 1Q, given just all the different piece in the portfolio between Meritor and Atmus. Can you just talk about how the different parts of business are performing?
Mark Smith: Yes. I think in that business, they’re all performing well. Obviously, the change in the mix has an impact, but clearly, Meritor results stepped up from the first quarter. So that was probably the biggest thing to change. I don’t want to talk about Atmus. They’re going to have their own earnings call shortly. But I would just say in general, the performance trends are strong across that portfolio.
Jerry Revich: I thought I’d try. Thanks.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jerry.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Tim Thein: Thank you. Good morning. The first one is on power systems. I’m just curious if maybe you could give an update there on anything of note within the order boards. I’m guessing that as you walk through some of the end markets, a lot of the revisions were to the upside. And yet, if you look at the second half revenue growth, there is a slight step down from the first. So I’m just curious, is that a capacity issue or has there been any changes in terms of, some of the individual end markets. Just curious, your thoughts on that.
Mark Smith: Hey, Tim, it’s Mark. Thanks for the question. I think the only market change, which isn’t new this quarter that’s been coming for a few months has really been a weakening order board on some of the consumer side, particularly the RV market where we’ve got a very strong presence, not surprising with interest rates where they are that overall market started to – the demand started to drift down. So I would say that’s the only one with some momentum change. I mean, oil and gas, there are different opinions at different points in time. That’s the one clear trend I would say right now. And then you’re right. The backlog is seeing us through this year. So we’re watching everything closely. But I would say, it’s stable outside of RV.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. And the thing we’ve been able to do, we had a lot of supply challenges in that business last year. So through the first half, we’ve been able to really produce at a better level. And we see strong demand in particular data center demand, the order board is out through next year for the data center market. We revised – you heard us revise mining up a little bit. So we’re seeing strength in parts of those markets. And then as Mark noted, it’s a little bit of softening in other parts of that market. But the situation there is really stabilized from where it was last year.
Mark Smith: And then, of course, we’re pleased with the step up in performance over the last year. And then you heard in my comments that we’ve taken yet more actions to keep boosting that profitability up. So we’re very pleased with the momentum in that business.
Tim Thein: Yes. Okay, good. And just – and then on distribution. So the – and maybe tying back to, Jen, to your comments on aftermarket activity. But if you look at parts had been in the kind of mid-40% as a percentage of distribution sales and it stepped down. I imagine there was some mix headwind associated with that, but – and maybe just is there an area worth calling out, typically that business can kind of be a good early warning signal? So maybe just a little bit more color on what you mentioned earlier in terms of that?
Jennifer Rumsey: No, I mean, the color I'll give there is, we were at incredibly high aftermarket levels because what was happening was customers couldn’t buy new trucks. So they were using trucks longer that drove more aftermarket demand. And so it’s still very healthy. We believe we’ve seen some – we’re seeing some inventory adjustment happening. And that the overall aftermarket demand has come down a little bit, but it’s still very, very healthy to your point, the aftermarket business for us from our margin perspective is a favorable one, but we still see it being healthy is what I would say.
Tim Thein: Got it.
Mark Smith: A bit more signs, it’s leveling off than accelerating, I would say, Tim.
Tim Thein: Yes, okay. Thanks for the time.
Mark Smith: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Raso: Hi, thank you. The comments about truck production in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little more color on that in the sense of magnitude? How much is this your perspective versus already been laid out by your customers? And how to think about sort of dovetailing that into conversations for pricing for 2024?
Mark Smith: So I would say, first of all, it’s a shorter quarter just because of the holiday periods. I think the industry has a lower build rate building at Q4, so that’s not coming specific. And then, yes, I think the rest is our assumption, David. It is not current outside of the shorter quarter. That’s not what we’re hearing from customers at this point in time. The question is really going to be what are the order momentum for the rest of this year and what’s sentiment as we get towards that end of the year? That’s how I would characterize what we’ve got embedded in our guidance and that doesn’t change. We’ve had that instance the start of the year.
David Raso: That’s what I was trying to figure out. Have you heard a tone change? Nothing to do with less production days. Just truly daily line rates being communicated. Hey, we’re taking it down in the fourth quarter or so just your view. I’m just trying to make sure we understand…
Jennifer Rumsey: It’s a tricky one. And as you can imagine, we are debating this a lot. So as I said, a little bit softer aftermarket is typically an indication that we’re going to see some softening in the market more down days in the fourth quarter. There’s just uncertainty from an economic perspective and the typical cyclical nature that we see in our markets that is causing us to anticipate in the fourth quarter. And as we look to next year that the market size is going to start to come down a little bit. As I said, I think it’s a softer cycle than we would typically see, but it just – it’s at a very high level right now. We – our Jamestown is producing as much as they can.
Mark Smith: Yes. We’re not trying to signal some Cummins specific issue here, David. It’s just assumption about the market activity at the end of the year.
David Raso: That’s fine. And the question on pricing?
Mark Smith: Can you repeat that, David, sorry. I don’t think I pick it up.
David Raso: The conversations for 2024 on pricing, and I know you have supply agreements, but just trying to get a sense of – and you might be able to take your costs down as much, but I think people are just trying to figure out, is there some price give back after the last 18 months or so very strong price increases. And I just want to see if you could provide some perspective on early conversations you’re having for your truck engine pricing?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, look, we’re – our goal is to continue to balance the price with the cost pressure that we’ve been seeing, which is stabilized. And then we’ll launch some new products next year as well. So that will allow us to continue to have those conversations with customers, but really nothing dramatic there.
David Raso: Okay. Thank you very much.
Mark Smith: Thanks, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Robert Wertheimer: Hi, I also had a question on price and then maybe just generally on the truck market and your market share and mix developments. So the first one is truck OEMs have had some really good success in margin as prices have gone up. I’m actually just a little bit curious mechanically, when a customer walks in to buy a truck, and they choose either Cummins Engine or the OEMs engine, you don’t control the price of that engine at retail, right? So, maybe, I guess, in effect, the truck OEM would be making margin on the increased price of the truck and engine. Is that the way to think about it? And do you still have catch up to come there?
Jennifer Rumsey: Correct. We don’t control the pricing that happens to the end customer. We have long-term agreements and we price our engine and powertrain solutions and options to the OEM. And we typically follow those long-term agreements with metal market adjustments and have done some inflationary adjustments with them over the last few years, but we don’t fundamentally dictate that pricing to the end customer. Our goal is to have a product offered to work with the end customers to create goal for our product through the performance of our powertrain compared to others in the market.
Mark Smith: We made a big shift away from influence in retail price 20 years ago.
Robert Wertheimer: Okay. No, I think that’s clear. And then just a big part...
Jennifer Rumsey: I was going to say, of course, in the heavy-duty space, a big factor and customer choices as fuel economy.
Robert Wertheimer: Got it. Second one is just trying to get up to date on mix shifts in North American truck and how it flows through for Cummins. So, if long haul truck declines in vocational/day cab come up and I guess medium-duty comes up. I’m just trying to sort out, which of those are market share/mix negative for you and not? So is your market share in long haul higher than your market share in vocational, or I guess your market share in medium-duty quite high? So I’m just trying to think about how the evolving mix in the truck market affects Cummins?
Mark Smith: Yes. I mean, the main delta in all those things is – whilst our share has gone up in heavy-duty over the last couple of years and it’s very strong. Medium-duty, it’s much stronger, right? That’s the main difference. And then I would say it’s a different kind of angle to your question, Rob, the larger fleets, we tend to have higher share with the larger fleets than we do with the overall – within heavy duty than the overall market itself because that’s where we’ve got those deeper, stronger relationships. So there’s a theme that’s been support as larger fleets are becoming more effective, more competitive. That’s been a trend that’s been helping us. But individual take and we’re really getting into splitting as the trend has been shared going up in heavy and in medium.
Robert Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. So, can you update us on your price realization and price cost assumptions for the year?
Mark Smith: Well, yes, we’ll be at about 3.5% to 3.75% plus on pricing. And on costs, we’ll be about 1.5% inflation.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. And on your full-year guide, I’m just trying to understand, the segment sales guide was raised for both distribution and power systems, but the full-year guide was unchanged. So can you help me bridge that?
Mark Smith: Yes, we really – well, Chris, why don’t you go?
Chris Clulow: Yes. So, yes, Tami, you’re right. We did raise in power systems and distributions. And as we looked at the overall guide, just given the uncertainty in the markets we elected not to change the overall, it probably would trend towards the higher end of that revenue guide is what we’re looking at right now, but we didn’t want to change it at this point.
Tami Zakaria: Okay got it. Thank you so much.
Mark Smith: I think construction, though, construction and Brazil truck were the two key areas. And then I would say parts, it’s not dramatically different, but it’s leveling out. Those are the three themes that are going – go in the other way or not improving.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the truck market messaging again. I have the sense that you guys were getting increasingly confident about the business for 2023 and thinking that 2024 might not be too much of a downturn, if at all. So has that thinking changed at all? And was that aftermarket trend you mentioned sort of, like, a catalyst for different thinking, or is it more just something in the macro that’s gotten your thinking changed, or is it not really changed at all?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, I don’t – it really hasn’t changed notably from the thinking before and that this idea that we’re going to see a gentle cycle. So, some downturn in the market, not dramatic and anticipating that, that happening. And it’s really dependent on some of these broader economic things and what really happens, how that plays out.
Mark Smith: I think it’s correct that the forecast for the industry are a lower Q4, right, just because of the number of the production days in the quarter. Part of it is just math for the remainder of the year, which is not. And then part of it is just history tells us if there is some erosion in confidence, which we haven’t seen in customer orders. Just to be clear, if there is, we tend to have a bigger fade into the December holiday period and a slow ramp up. So we just – we built that into our guidance at the start of the year. That’s simple as that.
Jennifer Rumsey: But in the meantime, layered on that, what you’re seeing is we’re improving gross margin across the business, right? The base business gross margin performance has been strong, Meritor has continued to improve quarter-over-quarter. And we think now is the time to start managing our operating costs, expecting that we’re going to see some downturn and then continue to look at places as you’ve seen us do some structural things to improve the business and the focus this year has really been within the Power Systems business where we’re doing that.
Steven Fisher: Okay. And it sounds like part of your second half outlook is a bit weaker trend in China. How are you thinking about the potential for stimulus there? And whether there’s any chance for upside still that might come out of that?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. At this point, we’re continuing to assume there’s no stimulus. There was, in a meeting, a few weeks ago, well, the – I think the government recognizes that they want to try to improve the economy. They want to do it and fiscally responsible stable way. And so we’re not assuming stimulus. China is playing out pretty much as we anticipated some improvement off of a very low 2022 and typical seasonality between first half and second half. And if there’s stimulus that comes in that impacts demand that would impact our outlook as well.
Mark Smith: Yes, but I would say that just seem the most likely size source of upside to our guidance right now.
Steven Fisher: Got it. Thank you very much.
Mark Smith: I’m worried about it. Just looking for more and there is much sign of it right now.
Steven Fisher: Right. Makes sense. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matt Elkott with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Matthew Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you guys still expect EBITDA neutral for Accelera by 2027, or are there any emerging new structural costs and investments needed that could change that timeline?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. We are still – with the strategy we have in place right now, we continue to work towards the EBITDA neutral in 2027. A big piece of that is this electrolyzer revenue growth as you saw with the comments on backlog that we continue to be confident in the outlook there and we – the increased investment this year is really focused on making sure we’ve got the product and the supply chain right to enable us to do that.
Matthew Elkott: Okay. And Jennifer, just one more question here on the construction side. The tempered outlook for the kind of latter part of the year, data centers are strong and public sector, non-residential construction is strong. Can you talk about some of the end markets driving a somewhat tempered outlook for construction in North America?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So, our outlook for U.S. construction down to flat, right? So data – and data centers would show up for us and power generation data center market is definitely strong. There’s parts of the market where construction, infrastructure investment and construction remains strong and there’s other segments of that market with rising interest rates and that we’re seeing things.
Mark Smith: Part of it is just a timing issue of like what’s the replenishment of the fleet been a lot of ordering of engines for construction equipment. So it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s just the demand on us is kind of leveled out, right now. And again, we’ll see where that is going.
Matthew Elkott: Does any of the data center construction market, does any of it show up in the – in construction for you guys, or it’s all most of your exposure to business…
Mark Smith: That’s in our Power Systems segment.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, it’s not a huge factor for us. I mean, the data center factor for us is that they buy these very large gensets for backup power and that drives significant revenue for power systems. The actual construction itself…
Mark Smith: It’s hard for us to track exactly where the construct – we’re selling to the OEMs sometimes rental.
Matthew Elkott: That makes sense. Thank you so much.
Mark Smith: Thank you.
Chris Clulow: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Noah Kaye: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to expand if I could on Accelera and the increased investment spend this year about $50 million. I think you mentioned a couple of times it’s really to get electrolyzer production and product right. It is an operating expense, right? So is this mainly engineering resources? Maybe you can give us a little color on what you felt you needed to spend on to get ready for this ramp? And maybe you can even put in the context of some of the industry and policy changes that you’ve seen come through, obviously, some significant ones over the last year?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Yes. The industry and policy changes drive that optimism and the outlook and the growing demand, the higher cost of shifts, not capital expenses of the plants as much as it is operating costs in engineering and in customer support as we’re scaling up that product or running higher than we had previously forecasted.
Noah Kaye: Okay. So customer support as well as product engineering. All right. That’s helpful. But just to make sure we understand, there’s no change to the revenue guidance. The current book of business, which I think is more weighted towards EV, I mean, is that delivering kind of the expected margin contribution? We hear mixed indicators on EV adoption, particularly in North America, would love to sort of understand where that side of the business is tracking versus your expectations?
Mark Smith: Right. So on the EV side, no, our demand today is mostly concentrated in the bus markets. I would say our margins have definitely been improving. The Accelera leadership team has done good work on improving the margins even with, yes, relatively modest, albeit increasing demand at this point in time. Yes, so we’re really looking for those next waves of demand, but the margins have been improving there. And on the electrolyzers, the demand keeps going up. The issue is not demand. It’s just making sure that we’re ready. There aren’t that many electrolyzers, new ones out in the field yet, right? We’re still building that capability. Yes, we’re shipping some, but that’s going to be going up to just making sure history shows a bit of investment now. It pays off multiple times in the long run.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Here’s a – there’s a couple of things that we watch on this, how the market develops. So on the electrolyzer side, there’s investments, but the actual details of how that government money flows and when it flows are still being defined. So that is a bit of a timing impact on some of that. And then in the electrified powertrain, there’s still a lot of uncertainty beyond the bus market where you’ve got cities and corporations that have incentives and want to electrify on exactly how that infrastructure is going to build out. So there’s regulations that’s going to start to drive more of that, but a lot of uncertainty I would say on the exact pace of that.
Noah Kaye: Appreciate it. Good to see you making the investments. Thanks so much.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you.
Mark Smith: Yes. Thanks, Noah.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back to Chris Clulow for any closing remarks.
Chris Clulow: Great. Thanks very much. That concludes our teleconference for today. Thank you all for participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today’s Cummins Incorporated second quarter earnings conference call. Thank you, everyone, for your participation. Have a wonderful rest of your day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-02 09:55:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Cummins Inc. First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Chris Clulow: Thank you Donna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins’ results for the first quarter of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today’s webcast presentations are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off. Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I’ll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter. In March, Cummins announced the launch of Accelera by Cummins, a new brand for our New Power business unit. Accelera provides a diverse portfolio of zero emission solutions for many of the world's most vital industries, empowering customers to accelerate their transition to a sustainable future. Coupled with our brand announcement, Accelera shared that it will supply a 90-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system for Varennes Carbon Recycling plant in Quebec, Canada. This will be the largest PEM installation in North America and a key step in advancing the green hydrogen economy. Accelera and Blue Bird also announced, we will increase production of electric school buses more than doubling the zero emission school buses that we've collectively put into operation over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, progress continues to be made on the planned separation of the filtration business. In February, we announced that our filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed underwritten IPO of newly issued common stock. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products continue to be strong across all of our key markets and regions with a slow improvement in China, resulting in record revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.5 billion, an increase of 32% compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand, and improved pricing. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% compared to $755 million or 11.8% a year ago. First quarter 2023 results include $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business, while the first quarter of 2022 results include $158 million related to the suspension of operations in Russia, and $17 million related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding these costs, EBITDA percentage increased in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes and improved pricing, offset by supply chain and compensation cost increases. Research and development expenses also increased in the first quarter of 2023 as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components, and Accelera segments. Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volume, pricing, and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases. As we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023 and we will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. In the first quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.3 billion and EBITDA of 9.4%. The improvement in profitability from the comparable EBITDA margin of 7.2% in 2022 was driven by improved pricing, operational improvements, and cost reduction activities aligned with our value capture initiatives. Our first quarter revenues in North America grew 39% to $5.1 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 76,000 units, up 17% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 27% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 33,000 units in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022, while our unit sales were 30, 000, up 13% from 2022. We shipped 39,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the first quarter of 2023, down 5% from 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 6% as volumes declined, partially offset by positive net pricing. Revenues for North America power generation increased by 14% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints began to ease. Our international revenues increased by 24% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 16% as on-highway markets began to recover. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 268,000 units, an increase of 2% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were $46,000, an increase of 31% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new product launches to meet NS VI standards. The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2022 levels at 476,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 36,000 units, an increase of 6%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 57,000 units, a decrease of 26% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to the change in emissions regulations and related adjustments and inventory levels. Our units sold were 9,000 units, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in the excavator market was offset by improved share with the new and expanded customer relationships and first quarter engine sales to replenish inventory levels at construction OEMs. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 28% in the first quarter, primarily driven by a decline in data center activity. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $752 million, an increase of 21% from first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 26%, while our shipments increased 7%. Power generation revenues increased by 30% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. In Brazil, our revenues increased 48%, driven by improved demand in most end markets. Now let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our forecast for total company revenue in 2023 to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 12% to 17%. This guidance reflects an improved outlook in North America, including stronger demand for Meritor. We are forecasting higher demand in heavy-duty truck and power systems markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2022. We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023 compared with our prior guide of 260,000 to 280,000. While supply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce, end customer demand remains strong. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. Similar to heavy duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 16% in 2023, an improvement from the previous guidance of up 7% driven by share growth better than expected construction volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the demand in the light-duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with the prior guide. We expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10%, improved from our prior guidance of a decline of 25% to 30%. While the market is adjusting to new emissions regulations, shipments to replenish inventory and export demand exceed our prior expectations. As we discussed previously, our guidance assumes a slow recovery in demand in China this year. We have continued to improve our presence in the region, through the down cycle of 2022 and are well-positioned for continued outgrowth. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners. We are seeing this in 2023 with improved on-highway share now that NSVI is fully implemented, along with higher share in the construction market as we expand our partnerships. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases in the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up 1% in 2023. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales and mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with the prior guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15%, driven by increases in non-residential construction and improvement in the data center market. For Accelera, we are expecting full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our prior guidance. Revenues are expected to approximately double from 2022 due to higher battery demand in North America school bus market and the additions of the electronic powertrain portion of the Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business. The electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum as well with the near-term forecast on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand. As mentioned on our previous call, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. Within components, Cummins expects revenue contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be between $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, an increase from $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in our previous guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance. In summary, coming off a very strong first quarter with visibility to strong demand beyond the first half of the year, we have raised our sales growth outlook for the year to 15% to 20%. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.7% from our previous guidance of 14.5% to 15.2%, reflecting very strong incremental margins while continue to invest for the future within our core business and Accelera. Demand in most of our core markets is strong. Our products are performing well, and we are excited about the investments we are making in the future. During the quarter, we returned $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. Strong execution resulted in record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in the first quarter, despite the continued challenging operating environment. I'm impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world who are delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our excellent results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect the planet for future generations and return cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter with organic revenue growth of 12%, record quarterly EBITDA, net income and earnings per share, an improved operating cash flow compared to a year ago. Given the strength of the first quarter results and improved outlook, we have raised our full year expectations for sales and profitability. Now, let me go into some more details of the first quarter performance. Revenues were a record $8.5 billion, up 32% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 39% and international revenues increased 24%. Of the total increase, 20% was driven by the addition of Meritor. Organic growth was driven by strong demand for products in all segments and improved pricing. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 2%. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% of sales for the quarter, including $18 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was $755 million or 11.8% of sales, including $158 million of costs related to the suspension of our operations in Russia, and $17 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding these items, the higher EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes and improved pricing, partially offset by increased investment in new products and capabilities. To provide clarity on the first quarter operational performance of our business and allow comparison to prior year and guidance and excluding the costs related to the separation of the Filtration business and the suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Let's look a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $2 billion increased $440 million, but as a percent of sales decreased by 90 basis points, as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive effect of Meritor. Across our businesses, we saw mixed trends on input costs, with the Engine business experiencing some increases, while other segments saw some benefits in freight and commodity costs. Results for Meritor improved from prior quarters due to improved pricing and operational improvements. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $191 million, driven by the addition of Meritor, higher variable compensation and research costs, as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth. Selling, admin and R&D decreased 110 basis points as a percent of sales. Joint venture income of $119 million decreased $8 million from the prior year, with higher earnings from joint ventures operations offset by lower technology fees. In China, we did see higher earnings than anticipated, as truck OEMs increased build rates to restock channels after a very challenging 2022. We not yet seeing signs of sustained improvement in end user demand, however. Other income was $71 million, an increase of $123 million from a year ago. The improvement in other income is driven by a gain of $19 million in mark-to-market investments compared to a loss of $37 million a year ago. We -- also, a year ago, we incurred an asset write-down of $36 million. Interest income and gains on foreign exchange also increased year-over-year in this line item. Interest expense increased by $70 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 21.7%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter were $790 million or $5.55 per diluted share, up 90% from the $418 million or $2.92 per diluted share a year ago. Our strong performance in Q1 continues our trend of raising performance over successive cycles. All-in, operating cash flow was an inflow of $495 million, $331 million higher than the first quarter last year, primarily due to higher earnings. I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor all year and it assumes that the operations of the Filtration business will be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Segment results and guidance exclude the costs or benefits related to the separation of the Filtration business as and when that occurs. Components segment revenue was a record $3.6 billion, an increase of 79%, while EBITDA decreased from 16.4% of sales to 14.6%, primarily driven by the addition of Meritor. Meritor revenues in the first quarter in the segment were $1.3 billion and EBITDA was $120 million or 9.4% of sales, up from last quarter and in line with our expectations. Components, we expect total 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37%, up 4% from prior year guidance and EBIT margin to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, unchanged from three months ago. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were a record $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 15.3%, flat with a year ago as the benefit from pricing was offset by higher material and variable compensation expenses. In 2023, we expect revenues for the Engine business to grow between 2% and 7%, up 2% at the midpoint from our prior guide, driven by continued strength in the North American truck market and a lower pace of deceleration in the China construction market. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% of sales, flat with previous guidance. And our overall projections for the Engine business include a modest tapering in both the top line and the bottom line in the fourth quarter. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to a record $2.4 billion. EBITDA also increased to 13.9% of sales compared to 9.9% a year ago, driven by higher volumes in both whole goods and aftermarket as well as improved net pricing. We expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10% and EBITDA margins in the range of 11.3% to 12%, and we've raised our guidance for sales by 3% at the midpoint and margins by 100 basis points. In the Power Systems business, we also had a strong quarter with the revenues of $1.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. EBITDA increased from 9.5% to 16.3% of sales driven by higher volumes, strong Parts business, and higher pricing. In 2023, we expect revenues to be up 5% to 10% consistent with our prior guidance. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 13.7% to 14.4%, an increase of 70 basis points from our prior projections. Accelera revenues more than doubled to $85 million, driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market, and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor and Siemens commercial vehicle business. Our EBITDA loss was $94 million as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate Accelera revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses to be in the range of $380 million at the midpoint, entirely consistent with our projections from three months ago. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions and end markets, we are raising full year company guidance. We now project 2023 company revenues to be up 15% to 20%, a 3% increase from our prior guidance. Company EBITDA margins are now expected to be approximately 15% to 15.7%, up 50 basis points from our prior projections. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior forecast. As we continue to make the critical investments necessary to bring to market new products and capacity expansion to support future growth. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash to shareholders over time. And as we said last time, in 2023, our primary focus will be on dividends and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt for this year, whilst we continue to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. In summary, we delivered record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in a very strong first quarter. Our customers are indicating stronger visibility into the second half of the year, giving us confidence to raise our forecast. We will continue to focus on delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies. There is one last matter I would like to bring to your attention. You will see in our Form 10-Q to be filed later today that we have updated our risk factor disclosure related to our ongoing discussions with the EPA and CARB on their review of our emission systems, most notably our pickup truck applications. We understand that these agencies are likely to propose resolving this matter by requesting in the relatively near future that we agree to one or more consent decrees and pay certain civil penalties. We are not able to estimate the amount of these penalties today, but we anticipate that the amount is likely to be material. We look forward to providing additional information on this topic when we reach a resolution. Thank you for joining us today, and now I'll turn it back over to Chris.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question.
Operator: Thank you. The first question today is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone.
Jennifer Rumsey: Good morning, Jerry.
Mark Smith: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Congratulations on a really strong quarter. I just wanted to ask for the Power Systems and Distribution businesses, outstanding first quarter, the guidance is for margins to decline significantly off of the first quarter run rate. Can you just step through? Is that just early in the year, and we want to make sure the results are sustainable, or are there any discrete items that you think declined sequentially for these two businesses?
Mark Smith: Yes, we've definitely been asking those questions internally as well, Jerry. Really strong results from both. I think pricing, of course, has been positive. I think in both those businesses, we haven't yet seen some of the cost increases that we anticipated for the full year. We had some beneficial moves in commodities that help power systems. So we're not assuming that they continue. And then in distribution, of course, very strong parts margins, and some lag effect before some of the cost increases take place. So we're still expecting strong full year results. Of course, we'll continue to push for improvement everywhere we can. And again, there was modest benefits from one or two corporate items that improved all of the segments. But I think the main takeaway I want you to leave with, we're really pleased with the performance in particular of those businesses. The Distribution business now has established quite a track record of improving margins over time, and we're really encouraged over the last three or four quarters by the progress in the Power Systems business. So we'll keep pushing for more. But I think one or two factors that we're not certain can continue through the subsequent quarters. And we are trying to drive down inventory a little bit, which may have some absorption impact in the Power Systems business a little.
Jerry Revich: Super. Thank you, Mark. And then can I just shift gears, Jennifer, you folks do a really good job of expanding your market share every time we have new regulations. I'm wondering can you just expand on the comments that you folks made in the prepared remarks and just talk about the opportunities that you folks have in terms of potential market share gains as we do see rising content and rising complexity on these engines, particularly within the context of the EPA's electric vehicle plans laid out recently as well? Thanks.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, Jerry. So as I commented and you saw start to come through in Q1, our pattern of leveraging emissions regulation change to drive outgrowth in market position as well as added content is playing out in China now following the launch of the NSVI. We've seen that playing out in India with BSVI regulation previously. And we do believe that there's continued opportunity both in the Engine space with future EPA regulations of the ultra-low NOx build rule to -- to some degree, increase our position in the market, although, of course, we have a strong position today in the US market. So content expansion. So that continues to be a tailwind and outgrowth opportunity slowing to some degree in North America on-highway, but there continues to be upside there. And then we are working clearly in our Accelera business to establish position in the electrified powertrain and in particular, our position in key components and as well as integrated powertrain. So batteries, power electronics and motor generators, eAxles, fuel cells. We feel like we've got the right portfolio of technologies and are forming partnerships and getting experience in the market to position ourselves over time as that market starts to electrify.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Tim Thein of Citi. Please, go ahead.
Tim Thein: Thank you. Good morning. Mark, maybe just one on -- to start on the Engine segment. You've taken up the full year revenue outlook and as well as JV income and the margin guidance, I believe, was unchanged. So what's working against the top line there in terms of the profit or the EBITDA guidance?
Mark Smith: Yes. In the near term, that's the one segment where we've actually faced more pressure on the cost front, on input cost inflation. We made quite a bit of progress in some of the other areas. So that's probably the biggest single factor in there. The JV income, we're not sure we've got -- found a footing in the market yet, Tim, it was better than we expected in Q1. It wasn't exceptional. It was just better than we expected. But we're just not -- we don't have a clear sight into the improving end user demand. I mean, eventually, that will pick up and that will be an upside. We just don't have visibility to it right now. But basically, that's the one business that's still wrestling with -- I wouldn't say the other businesses don't have challenges, but that's the one that continues to have some challenges on the supply side, and that's the biggest factor.
Tim Thein: Got it. Okay. And then, just on -- wouldn't be a Cummins call without an update on China. And you mentioned that on the on-highway side, you've seen a pickup from a production standpoint is not translating yet on the retail side. What just -- what is the team seeing and hearing, not just on the on-highway, but maybe some of the other key end markets for you. You mentioned excavators, but maybe some of the other ones in China and just kind of what's baked in into the balance of the year for the China operations as a whole? Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, I'll start and then Mark can add additional points that he'd like to. But as you -- as Mark alluded to, in the on-highway business, we're forecasting and believe we're seeing a slow recovery in the market and that there was some inventory buildup in the quarter, not significant increase in end user demand to slow recovery and opportunity outgrowth as we've already talked about. In off-highway, in construction, we have the emissions changeover that is negatively impacting the China market, less so than our previous guide, because we've seen again, some stocking up in the channel as well as higher export demand. We continue to see markets holding up in mining and oil and gas. And so, overall, a little bit of upside in on-highway kind of a mixed story and off-highway construction and power gen.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead.
Jamie Cook: Hi. Good morning and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, Mark, first question, similar to engines, on components too were increasing our sales guidance marginally, but the margins are unchanged. So what would be the reason behind that? And then, Jen, I guess, based on what you're saying, it sounds like you're seeing fairly good demand trends everywhere in your order book, is pretty good for 2023. But are there any areas where you're sort of seeing red flags? And in the event of a recession or downturn, how do we think about decrementals, or is there any other self-help that Cummins could do to sustain higher earnings, assuming the macro weakens? Thank you.
Mark Smith: Yes. I think, Jamie, I think components continues to do well. The main factor is just really the mix in the business. The underlying businesses are performing well. Again, not such a big help from price/cost in this segment relative to power systems and components. But I think really it's really some minor changes in the mix going forward. We've obviously got strong North America. Meritor continues to improve, but it's still dilutive to that overall segment, but no fundamental .
Jennifer Rumsey: And I'll just add, I mean, from a margin performance perspective, we're really focused on improving the Meritor business performance consistent with what we said when we did the acquisition, driving the incremental margin improvement across our other core businesses and then scaling up investing in a sustainable way and moving towards breakeven and Accelera business. And so we're paying attention to those -- each of those items to track that we're driving towards our targets. In terms of the broader picture, Jamie, to your question, the end market demand, order boards, our customers have, the comments that we continue to get from end customers remains fairly strong. Our confidence, as we said, is growing into the second half of the year, and we continue to watch these broader macroeconomic indicators and understand that we're in a cyclical business. And while this hasn't been a typical cycle because of the supply constraints, we are preparing and we'll take action to deliver decremental margins and outperform through the down cycle as we have in the past. So, already this year, we are making investments in key areas for our future, but also limiting investment in headcount growth in other areas and continue to monitor plant operations and operate at the level appropriate for the demand that we're seeing, and we'll continue to watch that closely and adjust as we need to.
Jamie Cook: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
David Raso: Hi. Sort of picking up on trying to look beyond 2023. I'm just curious, the conversations you're having with your off-highway customers for initial thoughts on what they need from you in 2024 relative to on-highway. Just curious if you have any distinguishing features between those different conversations?
Mark Smith: David, is in the construction area or more in the high horsepower markets just to make sure we're answering your question correctly?
David Raso: Open question on purpose. Off-highway versus on-highway.
Mark Smith: Yes. So I would say on the -- we don't really have -- we haven't given guidance, of course, for 2024. We haven't seen any weakening in the construction markets in North America similar to what we're seeing in on-highway, though we're watching this one closely. I think it's probably a very similar state as we look at construction versus on-highway, cautious probably as we move into the fourth quarter, but good visibility now that that's probably going into the -- well into the third quarter now.
Jennifer Rumsey: And I'll just add, of course, in China, you talked about the emissions changeover. So, there's a dynamic in that market and a question on does China do any action in the economy there that we'll pay attention to. And in Power Systems, same in terms of broader macroeconomic indicators I'm watching that, but we do have places where we're starting to take orders into 2024. And so it's a space that we're just watching closely at this point.
David Raso: I appreciate that. And people also are just curious about truck historically hasn't been the best market for maintaining price. But it's also been a pretty unique pricing power era we're living through right now. So, I'm just curious how are you thinking about or what are the early conversations like for 2024. I'm not saying if you have to give back price, there can't be commensurate offset and lower cost for you. But just trying to think about pricing in isolation, what are the initial conversations for 2024 given the pricing levels where we've been coming up to the last 12, 18 months?
Jennifer Rumsey: Well, we have emissions change overcoming in some of our markets in 2024. So, of course, that's a factor. But what I would say is we have long-term agreements with some of our customers. We price more regularly with some other customers in the market. We're continuing to pay attention to what's going on with price costs. As Mark said, it's still a mixed picture. And so we're committed to continuing to deliver strong returns and stay on top of price cost as that moves. But right now, this year, we're seeing improvements in some areas, and we're still seeing inflationary pressure and other areas. So it's a little bit difficult in -- 2024, yeah.
David Raso: But for price -- I'm just curious, any price concessions. When we hear some component suppliers, or I mean they were even being asked for concessions mid-year because I guess the answer would be why not if you're the OEM. But I'm just curious more structural for 2024. Is -- are we getting some price concession request? Should that be a base case and then it's about getting the cost down even more ideally?
Mark Smith: I think there a lot of factors go into pricing, David, included in input costs, agreements with customers, supplier available. A lot of those things, but that's not a main topic conversation right now at all. I think the thing we're most thinking about is the -- how long does this cycle run on and off-highway and right now, customers are telling us their confidence for the rest of the year is, on average, has gone up, not stayed the same. We recognize and appreciate the same questions really about demand levels for 2024. That's our radar is mostly upon any signals around demand. That's going to be the biggest driving factor of our performance.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Wertheimer: Almost just following up on that question with maybe a slightly different plant. Your businesses where you, I think, have more pricing control and distribution power systems did really well at margin. And the OEMs that you serve and on-highway truck have had a really good quarter as well. Just overall, is your general sense that you're pricing to those OEMs and components should catch up over time, and there's still your runway to go, or is that too strong?
Mark Smith: Well, first of all, we can't really -- we can't -- we're not aware of all the dynamics of the OEM pricing. That's really their business. We really have to look at the costs and the performance of our business. The other thing that's going on within our margins, of course, quite significant investment, we've got a lot of new products that we're excited about, and some of our customers are excited about. So the engineering cost of elevated. So that is the other factor that's really particularly in the engine components. I'm going to accelerate everything new and doesn't come with an enormous amount of revenue today. But in the engines and components, we have secured more business for the future, right? And we're planning to secure even more with the new technologies that we're bringing forward. We're price cost positive for this year. That's clearly a factor in our results, so where we can get pricing, we will do that. Aftermarket, there's obviously a stronger source of pricing for us generally, Rob. But I think looking at the margins, you've got to take into effect, how much are we investing? Because I think how much others are investing is also a signal about who's investing for more growth. And right now, we are putting more into the engineering across the business because we're excited about the future.
Rob Wertheimer: That's a helpful answer. Thank you. And if I can -- I think I've asked this before, I am not – easy to answer, but in Accelera, how should we think about as revenue start to ramp, what margins do? I mean are project level economics going to be consistently positive on the margin line and maybe not more be. Are you still bidding loss-making deliveries as your volumes to come through? How do we sort of think about what the underlying dynamics are of the margin there?
Mark Smith: I think there have been some higher fixed costs on the battery electric side. And then on electrolyzers, we are going to expect to have positive gross margins as we ramp up. And then we've stated previously that based on our current strategy, we're aiming to get at or around EBITDA neutral by 2027. So yes, as revenues go up, we're going to expect to see those losses clearly come down over time. And we've got -- we're building momentum on the sales, particularly yesterday, the Q1, most of the sales growth was on battery electric, excuse me. But as we've talked about recently, the electrolyzer backlog is really -- I won't use the word accelerate, has picked up quite a lot. And so we're bullish about that. But yes, very focused on the margins as the volumes come up. Battery is a little bit higher fixed cost rate.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Ishan [ph] on behalf of Tami. Congratulations on the great print. My first question is, are you preparing to ramp production assuming 2025 or 2026 could be pre-buy years ahead of the emission regulations in 2027? And then if I may ask a second on -- sorry, if I may ask a second on Meritor as well. Are you able to pass on cost inflation as anticipated, or are customers pushing back? Thanks.
Mark Smith: Yes. So what I'd say is we are making planned investments because we're -- irrespective of the economic cycle, we're expecting to pick up more business. So we're increasing capacity in parts of our business and launching new products. The nature of our business is such that we have to be prepared to ramp up and ramp down based on the economic cycle. So it's hard to predict with great certainty two or three years out. But as a general statement, yes, our CapEx is up this year because we're kind of bullish on our longer-term prospects. And then on pricing cost, of course, it's always competitive and challenging. But I think we're all aware that there's been significant inflation across the industrial space over time, and that's what's really necessitated the price increases and quite frankly, earlier on in the cycle late in 2021. It took us a while before we were able to increase prices. So to an extent, we've been kind of catching up with the trends there. Yes, so that's an ongoing…
Jennifer Rumsey: You saw some of that as Meritor specifically reflected in the EBITDA improvement.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead.
Steven Fisher: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just follow up, if I could, on the EPA and CARB legal situation that you mentioned, if there's any color on the potential timing of resolution that you can offer? And then I know this is obviously sensitive and I suspect you don't want to negotiate with yourself on a conference call, but just how to think about framing the size of what this might be? Is this something that might be in sort of the multi-hundreds of millions of dollars? Is this something that you could fund within your just ongoing cash flow and might it affect any other investment plans or spending plans that you might have?
Jennifer Rumsey: So, first, thanks for the question. I do want to start by saying that Cummins is fully committed to emissions compliance. We have been and we'll continue to cooperate with agencies all along and work through this matter to the best of our abilities. And our updated disclosure today is consistent with what we've done since we first announced our voluntary internal review in 2019 of disclosing transparently throughout this process. So, as Mark said, we think that we are nearing the end. It's premature to speculate though exact timing or exact amount at this point. We feel like the business is well positioned in a strong financial position and continuing to generate strong returns.
Steven Fisher: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I'm wondering, just to follow up on some of the price versus cost discussions. Are you able to actually quantify the price versus cost kind of cadence for this year and sort of the margin cadence for the rest of the year? And I'm thinking about the whole company, but if it makes sense to talk about highlight any specific segments, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Mark Smith: Well, in first quarter, we were about 2% net positive between price and cost. And as we said on the -- in the earlier remarks, it very much varied by business. And in fact, you can see it, since you're asking a lot of questions about the different margins in the business, you can see that. I mean, the pricing is pretty much set. Aftermarket is one area where we have the potential that were just prices more frequently. That's the nature of the aftermarket business. I don't think that's unique to Cummins. But pretty much, I think, the course is largely set for this year and then, it's really looking for efficiencies in every part of operations, working with customers, working with suppliers. We all enjoy it when the costs are lower. That's just not where we'd be. It's been an unprecedented period of supply constrains, some of which, frankly, we're not out of yet and it's been a period of unprecedented complexity and very, very robust demand. And we've continued to grow our business faster than some of the underlying markets. So that's been a positive, but that’s been a lot of work for our supply chain teams. But I think, largely, it's going to be a net positive for this year, Steve. I don't imagine dramatic changes quarter-to-quarter. The commodities can ebb and flow a little bit, and we saw some benefit copper prices in the Power Systems business. And again, we're using hedging and other techniques to try and smooth out those costs. But I don't expect fundamental changes to the reason for variation in earnings. We're really focused on this demand side. And right now, our confidence has gone up based on the confidence of our customers through the rest of this year.
Jennifer Rumsey: And just to keep in mind as context here. Over the last couple of years, as we saw that rapid increase in demand, there's really been two factors at play with the inflationary pressure and supply challenges. So one is cost versus our ability to pass that on a price, and we made a lot of progress through 2022, and you see that continue in 2023 to offset the inflationary pressure and then it's operating leverage. And because of all the supply disruptions we didn't see in those early quarters, the normal operating leverage that we would, and that has also improved and is reflected in some of the numbers that you see in Q1. So just to give you a sense of what that's like for us now in our Rocky Mount Engine Plant, which produces midrange engines. Last year, our on-time delivery from our suppliers was at 60%. In Q1, it was at 70%. And historically, we would expect something closer to 80%. And so that plays out in operating efficiency for us in our plant. So, it's improved. There's still a little bit of opportunity. But running at the rate that we are, we are continuing to be constrained by a couple of our supplier components. I'm shocked we've made it this far into the call without asking -- anybody asking me about supply chain. Yes, chips and electronics have improved, but they're still operating at capacity, which means small disruption hasn't impacted. But overall, underlying operating leverage has improved.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matt Elkott of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Matt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you On the rail side, wondering if you see any potential long-term content opportunities from the new locomotive rule that California issued on Thursday, which includes mandates on freight, passenger, and industrial locomotives. So, if it stands and goes national, there could be a big build cycle as well as a lot of new technology upgrades. Is there any opportunity for you guys from that?
Jennifer Rumsey: It's still early for me to add a lot of response here. We, of course, now are in the passenger rail business with our 95-liter engine. We have a Tier 4 compliant product, and then we've also entered the rail market with certain customers with fuel cells. And so we'll continue to explore opportunities with the product offerings that we have in that market.
Matt Elkott: Got it. And just one higher level question in light of your strong results and improved outlook. Do you see this bifurcation between your strength and the strength of the machinery sector as a whole on one hand and the rest of the economy being weak? Is that nearly a function of just catching up the demand from the last two and a half years or so while disruptions hampered production levels, or is this -- you mentioned, Jen, that this is not a typical cycle. Is there something more than that, more than just catching up the demand?
Jennifer Rumsey: Well, there is -- I mean, definitely, what you said is a factor, limitations in supply and high use, right, at high use and then new products are more fuel efficient. So, there's still a lot of factors that are causing customers to -- in commercial trucking to continue to want to buy. There's investments in infrastructure that's driving demand and construction and there's growing investments in the cloud, it's driving data center demand. And so there are some specific indicators for our business that maybe are decoupled from the broader economy. That said, the broader economy does have some influence, which is why we continue to be cautious about where we're making investments and increasing headcount.
Mark Smith: We do -- just like you as an observer of other parts of the economy and sometimes wonder at the rate of hiring and resources being added into new areas, and then you get retrenchment. And sometimes, that's very different from the business model that we operate in. We work with very efficient customers. A lot of efficiency is the focus, right, even when some growing are going through strong cycles in other sectors of the economy, you see some very different dynamics that just don't translate well to what we have experienced.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, we have run out of time for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Clulow for closing comments.
Chris Clulow: Thanks very much, Donna. Before we conclude, I want to turn it back over to Jennifer for a few closing comments.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Just to wrap up today, I want to again recognize the strong performance of the company in the first quarter, delivering record revenue, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share. We're in a strong financial position and are confident in our strategy and our leaders in the future of the company and look forward to continuing to update you on our progress in future calls.
Chris Clulow: Thank you. That concludes our teleconference for today, and thank you all for participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast, and enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Cummins Inc. Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Chris Clulow: Thank you very much. Good morning everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins’ results for the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the full year performance. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that, some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today’s webcast presentations are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I’ll start with a summary of 2022, discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. Last year was an incredibly exciting one for Cummins and our stakeholders. We made significant strides in our inorganic growth strategy, most notably through the acquisitions of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Meritor and the Siemens Commercial Vehicles business. We also navigated complex global supply chain challenges, advanced our preparation for the separation of our filtration business and transition from Tom to me as the CEO. We accomplished all of this and delivered record revenues, EBITDA, and earnings per share in 2022. We did so with the focus on the exciting opportunity in front of us to lead the industry to a broader clean economy and do so in a way that is best for our stakeholders and the planet. Decarbonization is a growth opportunity for Cummins, uniting our business and climate goals. In 2022, we launched our long-term decarbonization growth strategy, Destination Zero, which includes making meaningful reductions in carbon emissions through advanced internal combustion technologies widely accepted by the market today, while continuing to invest in and advance zero emissions technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. As part of our organic growth strategy, we unveiled the industry’s first unified fuel-agnostic internal combustion powertrain platforms, and we continue to see momentum in our electrolyzer technology and green hydrogen production opportunities. Demand for our products remains strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $7.8 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand in many of our North America markets. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance, I’m excluding the Meritor operating results and associated acquisition and integration costs, the costs related to the separation of the filtration business and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. Mark will provide more detail on the reported results in his comments. With these exclusions considered, EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% of sales in Q4, above our guidance of 15.5% and stronger than the $705 million or 12.1% reported a year ago. EBITDA and percentage improved due to an increase in gross margins with positive pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage costs and some improvement in logistics costs, all of which offset increases in material costs. Gross margin improvement is key to meeting our long-term goals of increasing the returns in our core business while transitioning our New Power business to break even EBITDA by 2027. In the fourth quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement, and we continue to accelerate value capture opportunities across the business. Our employees have done an excellent job in integrating the Meritor operations and people within Cummins and continue to make strides in identifying cost reduction opportunities. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $130 million in pretax synergies we referenced upon completion of the acquisition. And in addition, we expect to deliver incremental tax synergies as we integrate the business. Excluding Meritor, 2022 revenues were a record $26.2 billion, 9% higher than 2021. Also excluding Meritor, the costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and the impact of the indefinite suspension of our Russia operations, full year EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% of sales compared to $3.5 billion or 14.7% of sales in 2021. Improved volumes, better price realization and an improved supply chain environment more than offset higher compensation expenses, increased material costs and lower joint venture income for the year. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in Engine, Power Systems, Distribution and Components segments. Leading the way was the Components segment, which delivered 150 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. The Power Systems business finished 2022 with another solid quarter and delivered full year EBITDA of 12.2%, up from 11.2% last year. The improvement in performance in this segment over the past six months is encouraging, and you will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. EBITDA margins in the distribution business increased by 110 basis points. Our reported full year 2022 results include five months of operational performance for Meritor or $1.9 billion of revenue and $26 million of EBITDA, including $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs. Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2023 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2023 guidance includes our expected results of the Meritor business and excludes the costs or benefits associated with the separation of the filtration business. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2023 to increase 12% to 17%, compared to 2022 and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales, driven by the inclusion of a full year of sales from Meritor, continued strength in the North American truck market, improved demand in power generation markets, overall pricing improvement and slow improvement in the China on-highway markets. Industry’s production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 260,000 to 280,000 units in 2023, a range of a 5% decline to 2% improvement year-over-year. In medium-duty truck, we expect the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. We expect our deliveries in North America to continue to outpace the market, as the engine partnerships we announced in 2021 continue to phase in. Our Engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 7% in 2023. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy and medium duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in demand in the light duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 25% to 35% in 2023 as the market adjusts to new emissions regulations and digests inventory on hand. We are watching the situation in China closely, with ensuring the safety and well-being of our people as our first priority. The change in the country’s COVID lockdown policy could positively impact our operations in the coming months. The current events make it difficult to gauge. The markets within China are at a low point, as we close out 2022 and our guidance assumes a slow recovery in 2023. In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to be up 1% in 2023. We expect the industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, dependent upon the trajectory of commodity prices and supply chain improvement. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, primarily driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15%, driven by increases in non-residential construction and improvements in the data center market. In New Power, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, more than doubling our 2022 revenues. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to convert to backlog and to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, we shared that we had reached the milestone of a $100 million in electrolyzer backlog. This tripled to $300 million at the end of 2022, demonstrating the strong momentum in this market. With demand continuing to rise, we are focused on adding capacity for electrolyzer production. During 2022 we announced several capacity expansion investments and expect to have more than two gigawatts of scalable capacity in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe across Europe, North America and China. Additionally, we will continue to deliver battery, electric and fuel cell systems along with electric powertrain technologies as adoption continues in the transportation markets. As mentioned, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. We are continuing to drive improvement in our margins post-acquisition and expect Meritor to be accretive to earnings per share in 2023. We will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. Within Components, we expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue in 2023 with EBITDA margins in the range of 10.3% to 11%, an improvement from the comparable 2022 EBITDA margin of 7.2%. The electric powertrain portion of the Meritor business has been integrated within the New Power portfolio with projected 2023 EBITDA losses of $55 million included in the overall guidance for that segment. In 2023 we anticipate that demand will remain strong in most of our key regions and markets, especially in the first half of the year. While some macroeconomic indicators have weakened in recent months, we have not seen a significant change in customer orders at this time. In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 12% to 17% and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales. We have taken a number of actions to improve our EBITDA in 2023 and expect to generate very strong incremental margins within our core business and improve the margins of the Meritor business while continuing to invest in our New Power business. Having effectively managed through the challenges of the past couple years we expect improved performance in 2023 and are well positioned to invest in future growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. There are four key takeaways from my comments today. First, we delivered strong results in the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding our own projections for revenue and EBITDA from three months ago, and we delivered stronger margins Engines, Components, Distribution and Power Systems compared to a year ago. Second, we continue to make good progress on the integration of Meritor and we remain on-track to deliver $130 million of pretax synergies by the end of year three. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2022 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, demand for our products remains strong, supporting increased revenues in our core business and New Power and growth in EBITDA and earnings per share in 2023. Now, let me go into more details on the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter reported revenues were $7.8 billion and EBITDA of $1.1 billion or 14.2%. For the full year, revenues were $28.1 billion and EBITDA of $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales. Also in the fourth quarter, Meritor generated $1.2 billion of revenue, $60 million of EBITDA, after incurring $27 million of acquisition and integration related costs. Our fourth quarter results also included $19 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business. Full year 2022 results included five months of operational performance for Meritor, yielding $1.9 billion of revenue, $26 million of EBITDA, reflecting $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs. We will all look forward to a cleaner set of numbers in 2023. Our full year 2022 results also included $81 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance. I am excluding the Meritor results and the separation of filtration and the indefinite suspension of Russia in my following comments. But hopefully, you are clear after my earlier remarks about the magnitude of those -- each of those items. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 25%, driven by continued strong demand in truck markets. International revenues decreased 1% with stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment in most markets, offset by declines in China and, of course, the impact of our suspension of our operations in Russia. Currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4% due to a stronger U.S. dollar. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% compared to $705 million or 12.1% a year ago. EBITDA increased by $359 million due mainly to improved pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage expenses, all of which contributed to stronger gross margin performance and more than offset higher material costs. Now, let’s go into our income statement, a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 26.3% of sales increased by $420 million or 380 basis points from a year ago. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $52 million or 6% due to higher compensation and research costs as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly in the Engines and New Power segments. Joint venture income decreased $28 million due to lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $44 million, an increase of $13 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher pension income. Interest expense increased $58 million, largely driven by the financing costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17.2%, including $52 million or $0.36 per diluted share -- favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $631 million or $4.43 per diluted share, up from $394 million or $2.73 a year ago. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $817 million, including Meritor and, $85 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by higher earnings. For the full year ‘22, revenues were a record $26.2 billion or up 9% from a year ago, with sales in North America up 18% and international revenues down 2%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues for the full year by 2%. EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% for 2022 compared to $3.5 billion of 14.7% of sales a year ago. Improvements in Components, Distribution, Power Systems and Engine margins were partially offset by increased investment in New Power and more than $100 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin some of our nonqualified benefit plans. All of that run through our operating EBITDA. All-in net earnings were $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share compared to $2.1 billion or $14.61 per diluted share a year ago. Full year cash from operations was $2 billion, down from $2.3 billion, primarily due to higher inventory levels. Capital expenditures in 2022 were $916 million, an increase of $182 million from 2021 as we continue to invest in new products and capacity expansion critical for future growth. We returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders or 63% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends last year. Now, moving on to our guidance for 2023, which includes Meritor, and thankfully, reduces the number of exclusions we’ll have to explain each quarter, and I appreciate your patience as we work through that in 2022. We are excluding any separation costs associated with filtration, and for now, we’re assuming that the operating results of filtration are in our guidance for the full year 2023, as the timing of that separation is not yet determined. We expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion of revenue in 2023. We currently project 2023 company revenues, including Meritor, to be up 12% to 17% and company-wide EBITDA margins expected to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.2%. In ‘23, we expect revenues for the Engine business will be flat to up 5%, driven by continued strength in North American truck market and a modest recovery in China. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% compared to 14.4% in 2022. We expect distribution revenues this year to be up 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% compared to 10.5% in 2022. Including Meritor, we expect 2023 components revenues to increase 28% to 33% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8% compared to 15.0% in 2022. In ‘23, we also expect Power Systems revenues to be up 5% to 10% due to higher demand for oil and gas engines and power generation equipment globally. EBITDA there is projected to be between 13% and 13.7%, up from 12.2% of sales last year. And also this year, we expect New Power revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million. We expect New Power net losses to be in the range of $370 million to $390 million as we continue to make targeted investments in capacity, technology to support growing customer demand. Our goal remains to achieve breakeven EBITDA in 2027. Our effective tax rate this year is expected to be approximately 22%, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time and have accelerated cash returns to shareholders in recent years above that 50% goal when we have generated more cash than required to support our strategy. In 2023, we will prioritize cash towards dividends and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor while continuing to invest to deliver future profitable growth. Having a strong balance sheet is an important asset as we navigate through economic cycles and sustain our investments in new products for existing and new markets. To summarize, we delivered record sales, strong full year earnings in 2022, while managing through supply chain challenges and a very weak demand environment in China. As we move through 2023, demand for our products remains strong in most of our core markets with good visibility into the first half of the year. We’ll continue to focus on raising margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, generating strong cash flow and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies and penetrate new markets through our New Power business. Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it over to Chris.
Chris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we’re ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: I know it’s early post the acquisition of the Siemens propulsion systems and Meritor, but wondering if you could just comment on what the acceptance has been of the products in the marketplace? Post-Cummins ownership, what’s the pipeline from the developments look like? How is that cross-selling working out versus what you folks had expected before acquiring the assets? Thanks.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Thanks, Jerry, for the question. Yes, we are right now really focused on integrating the Meritor business, the Siemens Commercial Vehicle business and the investments that we were already making within New Power and having a number of conversations with our customers on how we bring that together to deliver those electric powertrains and components to meet their needs. So, it brings some strong products, employees as well as customer relationships, and we’re seeing growing opportunities as we have relationships at a senior more strategic level with these customers to grow our business going forward. It’s really early days at this point, so we’ll continue to talk about that as we bring those businesses together.
Jerry Revich: Sounds good, Jennifer, thanks. And Mark, can I ask in terms of the pricing that you’re expecting in ‘23 within the outlook? And if you could just touch on the logistics costs embedded in the guide as well. You folks have been running pretty hot to hit deliveries in ‘22. I’m wondering to what extent does that a tailwind within the guidance?
Mark Smith: Yes, we’ve got about 2% of price cost benefit embedded in the guidance, Jerry. That’s the biggest single driver of margin improvement.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jamie Cook: I guess, two questions. Just given the concern on the macro out there, can you guys speak to by business line where you see the most visibility or where demand trends do you see sort of weakening? And then, I guess, on the engine margin guidance. I guess, I would have thought margins would have been a little better in implied guide just given maybe price cost going away, China improving. So, if you can just help me bridge 2023 to 2022 engine margins what’s implied? Thank you.
Jennifer Rumsey: Great. Thanks, Jamie. Let me speak first to what we’re seeing in the market. And we, of course, are paying attention to some of these macroeconomic trends. If you take just the North America truck market as a starting point, while there has been some decrease in spot rates, we still continue to see healthy freight activity and strong backlogs out through the first half, which gives us confidence that the market is going to remain strong, certainly through the first half of the year. And it’s important to note, it’s just not been a typical cycle for us because for the last two years, we’ve been undersupplying to the market demand. They’ve been using that equipment. We’re seeing that reflected in very high aftermarket demand which continues, and these new trucks provide efficiency benefits to the fleet. So, we continue to expect strong North America truck market. In the Power Systems business, again, we have a healthy backlog of products and strong demand across many of our markets. Mining, we’re forecasting to remain around flat, but growth in power generation, growth in the oil and gas business. So, we’re feeling pretty confident about that as well. The biggest uncertainty is really around China. And as I said in my comments, we do project some slow recovery throughout 2023. With the lift of the stringent lockdowns that they had in the last couple of years in December, we expect that that may result in economic strengthening and certainly, less operational disruption, but we’re still monitoring what happens with the COVID waves there, is there any government stimulus into the economy. We feel really well positioned there. We’ve launched our NS VI products, which we think will enable Cummins to grow our position in the market. We’ve launched the automated manual transmission there. We’ve got a new natural gas platform. So, we’re really well positioned as China continues to strengthen and just uncertainty on exactly what the shape of that will look like. I’ll let Mark talk about the margin question.
Mark Smith: Yes. I think the main thing on the Engine business margins is that we haven’t got building a very strong recovery in China. And then the other piece that you didn’t mention, Jamie, is that we’ve got fairly sustained investments ahead of us over the next couple of years because we’re updating several of our platforms. We’ve won a lot of external business, and we’ve got to meet future emissions regulations. So, that’s the only other element that’s running through the Engine business that may not be obvious from the outside, but otherwise, we’ll expect them to do well if markets continue to be strong.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Stephen Volkmann: Maybe just following on, on the Engine margin question, Mark. Given what you just described around increased spending, R&D, et cetera, should we think about sort of flattish incremental margins over the next few years, or can it still be better than that, if we have some volume?
Mark Smith: I think it can definitely be better than that. We’re still battling some inefficiencies here and there Steve. We’re still expecting to have aftermarket growth over time. So no, we’re not locked into these margins. I was just trying to be clear on what the underlying factors. I’ve seen a few comments around Engine business margins, but no, I think they can go higher. Getting China, which is the world’s biggest truck market, I know the earnings come through JV, we have the lowest market in a decade. And we think we still got more share to gain there. We’ve got more content in the Components business. So, if I sit here today and say what could be the one thing that could move that could change our guidance most clearly, I would agree with Jen, it would be China, right now. We don’t have visibility. People are more enthusiastic, but the activity hasn’t yet materially picked up. So, that would be one important factor.
Stephen Volkmann: Great, understood. And then, my follow-on maybe a bigger, broader question. But as we start very early days but we start to think about the 2027 emissions regulations, do you guys feel like you have line of sight to what you need to do technically to get there? We’re starting to hear that this is going to be sort of the biggest emission hurdle ever and that some people may have trouble getting there or maybe have some massive costs associated with it, which has some implications for prebuys and maybe whether people do it themselves or outsource it to you, just your big picture thinking on 2027 and how that kind of plays through.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. We are focused on continuing to meet more stringent regulatory requirements and do so with products that will provide benefits to the environment and exceed our customer needs. We now have clarity on the EPA 2027 NOx regulations that happened late last year, and they finalize that standard at a 0.035 gram NOx. And our intention is to offer a full product lineup with our new fuel-agnostic engine platforms to meet that regulation, and we’re finalizing our product plans right now with our customers on those. But we really feel well positioned to invest in really as a part of our Destination Zero strategy, reduce CO2 and NOx impact to the environment and offer products -- market-leading products to our customers with that regulation.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
David Raso: Hi. Thank you. The China guide, the up 7%, I assume that includes consolidated and JV revenue, sort of how you usually kind of speak to it.
Mark Smith: Yes.
David Raso: Even -- maybe can you update us on the mix of your end markets? It feels like the consolidated off-highway, the construction exposure you have that shows up in the P&L more so than JV, and the JV is more of the on-highway. I’m surprised with the mix because that construction business at this stage must be pretty small after the declines we’ve seen. So, to have truck up double digit for China, for heavy and light, even though the excavator is down a lot, the mix would suggest you’d be up more than 7%, if truck is up double digit and at now relatively small construction business is down. Are there other businesses keeping it only at 7%? Is there a share comment there? Just trying to understand why only up 7% with that China end market guide?
Mark Smith: I don’t think there’s anything significant in there, David. I mean, obviously, whether it’s consolidated or unconsolidated, trucks probably [70%] plus when you add up all of our markets. So, the truck does better, we’ll be up more than 7%. If it doesn’t, we won’t. I think for components, that’s all consolidated revenue. That’s almost entirely on-highway. It’s really the engine business that has the off-highway business of any of any size. And then, yes, I think Power Systems has been pretty strong last year in China. It has probably been the exception to what we’ve seen in every other market. But there’s no big change in dynamics.
Jennifer Rumsey: Just on your share, we expect to continue to grow our share in the China market with the launch of the NS VI product. So, that’s assumed in our guidance.
David Raso: I’d even think with some of the transmissions as well. So, I’m just trying to understand like Photon is struggling more than I would have thought. It’s still barely making money now for two quarters in a row. Is there something about that dynamic we should be more sensitive to on the margin recovery in China in the JV because of Photon?
Mark Smith: No. We did get some sizable tech fees and other things from the early part of last year, which kind of helped -- the wrong word, we were entitled to those based on product launches, but no, I don’t think there’s anything significant there.
David Raso: And I’ll hop off, just one kind of modeling question. If you take the interest expense in the fourth quarter and annualize it, it’s $348 million. You mentioned there’s debt reduction, but your guide is $380 million. I mean, what are we assuming for interest rates from the fourth quarter on to have up interest expense, but you’re targeting debt reduction?
Mark Smith: Right. So, I think the answer to that is, we’ll need to keep working that down. I think we’ve got some floating rate exposure. It’s not all fixed, and probably, the debt reduction will come in the second half of the year, but let me come back to you on that, David.
Operator: The next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi. I know it’s still early days, but you’re starting to see some ramp in electrolyzers. And I guess there’s obviously a lot of uncertainty as to what the ultimate margin structure is going to be, New Power or clean energy generally. So I wonder if you have any thoughts on when you see clarity, any thoughts on where gross margins might trend. Maybe you’re still heavily investing, but the gross margins are improving, or just your thoughts on how the curve of profitability is shaping up in clean tech.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, the electrolyzer business is really going to drive the majority of our progress towards breakeven in ‘27 for New Power and the growth aspirations that we shared for 2030. And so, we expect during that time frame to scale up the product, the supply chain and manufacturing and continue to see growing backlog and conversion of orders into revenue. And so through that time period, you’ll see margins going positive and improving, the exact margin structure of that business is still unclear. There’s not a lot of suppliers in the market, and we expect demand to be quite strong through that time period. So, I’m optimistic on what margin structure for the business will look like. But, obviously, we’ll share more as we get towards that breakeven point and go margin positive.
Mark Smith: Yes. Rob, one thing I’ll add is, for the gross margin on a project basis, we’re at gross margin positive last year, which is a good early indicator. We have other costs that are going in, too, for capacity expansion and other things that obviously offsets that, but it’s a good indicator that we’re on the right path for profitability as we move forward with more volume.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you. And obviously, there’s just still a lot of build-out in manufacturing and supply chain. So, do you have a sense as to how you stack up competitively on either design cost, or I guess you have a lot of advantages in manufacturing as you build out and off the top there.
Jennifer Rumsey: I mean one of the advantages we have here is we’re able to leverage our existing footprint and capability that we have as a part of the broader comment. So, you saw us announce recently, we plan to use our Fridley manufacturing facility for electrolyzer production in North America. So, we are tapping into that strength we have in our footprint and supply chain capability to help build out profitable both product as well as supply chain. And that’s an advantage that I think Cummins has here.
Operator: The next question is coming from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nicole DeBlase: Maybe just on the distribution margins. It looks like you guys aren’t expecting margin expansion there, even though sales are up 2% to 7%. I guess what is the reason for that?
Mark Smith: I think there’s a little bit of improvement baked into the guidance, but we’ve got a pretty strong track record of improving. There’s no structural impediments to growing margins over time. It’s a range. So, under the different revenue scenarios, some variation, Nicole. But over the time, we expect the margins to keep going up.
Nicole DeBlase: Okay, understood. Thanks. And then I guess Power Systems stood out to me. On the other side, it’s just the margins look really impressive year-on-year in 2023. Is price/cost the biggest driver of that, or is there any other big drivers of the margin expansion that you guys are expecting?
Mark Smith: I think, certainly, that’s been a big factor, and we’ve got pretty healthy demand locked in now. So, there’s been a lot of focus on that business. We’ve been pleased with the solid results, particularly in the second half of this year, and we just -- we’ve got a very, very strong focus on continuing to drive…
Jennifer Rumsey: For that business, it’s important to keep in mind, you see a very long -- we have a very long lead time on orders. So, as costs accelerated, it took a while for us to pass on some of the price increases to offset that, and that is in part what drove the strong margin improvement from ‘21 to ‘22.
Operator: The next question is coming from Matt Elkott of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Matthew Elkott: If you can give us a sense of how much of a growth moderation can we expect in the second half? I’m assuming that will be the case directionally because you’ll have the Meritor comps. And also, it sounds like you guys are more cautious on the second half. So, how much of a growth moderation are we expecting?
Mark Smith: You can roughly split our revenues 52% to 53% in the first half versus the second half, Matt.
Matthew Elkott: Got it. That’s very helpful. And then, just one follow-up on the New Power front. It’s been about a year since you guys announced the fuel agnostic engine. So, any update on that and the receptiveness from customers in your conversations? And also, I think back in August PACCAR announced that they’re using your new natural gas engine. So, is there anything new on that front as well?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So, the fuel agnostic platform, just to clarify, that’s being developed as a part of our Engine business. And as I mentioned earlier, we’ll launch a full lineup in North America of that product as a part of the 27 EPA regulation. As you’ve seen, PACCAR is integrating and plans to introduce the natural gas version, and we have customers that are very interested in that product, including with renewable natural gas, and we announced partnerships around that. We also announced a memorandum of understanding with Tata late last year on the hydrogen version of that platform. And so really, we see a lot of interest in those platforms, both as a way to improve efficiency of diesel engines and then create flexibility to move to other fuels such as natural gas or hydrogen with the platform and really minimizing the integration pair up that’s required for customers as they move between those platforms. So, we’ll begin to launch those with the natural gas version here, in North America in late ‘23, early ‘24 and then accelerate introduction in the coming years after that.
Operator: The next question is coming from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Noah Kaye: Can you characterize the current mix of investment spending in New Power? Just kind of give us a sense of the key buckets where you’re spending? Maybe you can even give us some guidelines on how much of the CapEx for this year would be attributed to New Power? And then, I think the higher question here is, are you ready to call 2023 kind of the peak of net investment spending for the segment?
Jennifer Rumsey: At a high level, the different categories of investment in New Power, of course, there’s big investments happening in electrolyzers, and we talked about the growth and capacity investments that we’re making there. The other buckets include investments in batteries, other electrified components in the electric powertrain and then in fuel cells. So, we’re investing end of the prime mover as well as some of the key components to position ourselves as our current markets start to move to electrified powertrains to be both the powertrain provider as well as provide key components similar to the model we have today with Engine business and Components. You want to talk about allocation of investment?
Mark Smith: Yes. So CapEx, probably in the $100 million to $125 million range. So just under 10% of the total for the company in the New Power segment, and most -- more of that’s weighted towards electrolyzers where, of course, we’re ramping up production, albeit using existing Cummins sites, where possible and appropriate. And then, yes, I’d love to call the peak in New Power losses. They’re going to have to peak soon because we’re aiming towards breakeven in 2027 at the EBITDA level. The only caveat is, if there’s a significant change, should we invest in some new capabilities that aren’t part of our current portfolio? That’s not part of our plan today, Noah, but that would be the only variation.
Noah Kaye: That’s helpful. And then just to give us some expectations around the cadence of earnings this year, obviously, you’re guiding to EBITDA, not EPS. But thinking about China JV modestly improving, getting better synergies, capture on Meritor throughout the year, but then maybe some offset from potential deterioration in some end markets. So, just any guideposts you would give us on first half versus second half, the EBITDA or even EPS?
Mark Smith: No. I mean, by and large, it will go along with the revenue. Unfortunately, we had a tough Q3 in 2022. So that probably gives us the easiest comp, just kind of going through by quarter, and then we started the year much stronger. So ex-JV, I think we’ll have a good first half of the year. The JV will be the biggest single swing factor. When you look at our P&L, I would think -- in the first half of the year, maybe that helps in the second. Q3 gross margins were disappointing. We’ve rebounded well in here in Q4. So yes, modestly expect first half to be stronger all in, unless revenues in the second half change direction significantly from what we’ve guided.
Operator: The next question is coming from Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tami Zakaria: So my first question is, are you expecting any synergy savings from the Meritor acquisition this year? I believe you were expecting $130 million in total by year three. So, anything this year?
Mark Smith: Absolutely. Yes, we’re working very hard on that. I mean personally, along with many members of the Meritor, Cummins team. So yes, and we’ll talk about those as we go along, but yes, we’re feeling confident about that progress towards that $130 million.
Tami Zakaria: And some of that is embedded in guidance and assuming -- or would that be incremental?
Mark Smith: We’ll try and get as much as we can -- both helps the long-term interest of that business and improve the cost structure. So yes, we expect the results clearly to improve, especially in the Components segment. We’re assuming that’s all in for now. If we get more, then we’ll be happy to report. We won’t get more than $130 million, just to be clear. That’s a year three number, but we’re making good progress.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. And so, I’m sorry if I missed it, but can you give some color on the embedded Meritor margin expansion cadence for the year? Should it be in the guided 10% to 11%, or does it ramp towards the back?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So, let me just reiterate the guidance that we had within the Components business. We have $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue and EBITDA margins for the Meritor business, 10.3% to 11% compared to in 2022, that was 7.2%. And some of that is progress on price/cost in that business, operating efficiency as well as synergy cost savings.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you.
Mark Smith: I think you should just expect sequential improvement through the first half of the year from the Q4 levels.
Operator: The next question is coming from Avi Jaroslawicz [ph] of UBS. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions on for Steve Fisher. Just in terms of the power generation market, can you talk a little bit more about what’s driving that market to be so robust this year? We might have expected data centers weakening a little bit. It sounds like you’re expecting that to be up still again this year. But, if you could just talk about some of the drivers in that market.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. The power generation market really nonresidential construction as well as data centers, and despite some of the announcements that you’ve seen from our data center customers regarding staffing levels, they continue to show interest in investing in data centers and have demand and drive backup power -- demand on our products in that market. So, we are still quite bullish about the opportunities there for 2023.
Mark Smith: I think it’s fair to say, it’s pretty broad-based across multiple markets, broad parts of the economy. Yes, the data center gets a lot of attention. It is a significant individual segment, but we’re seeing robust underlying demand for power generation across multiple segments.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just in terms of the New Power business, have you seen acceleration in the recent months following the IRA in terms of customer interest there? And does that possible acceleration in the market change your view on when we could be breakeven in that business?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. How I would describe it is, the inflation reduction act and the investments around that are really going to be key to enable the adoption rate that we anticipate is going to drive an acceleration in hydrogen investment. The details around that investment are being clarified right now. So, it’s going to take several years before you really see that translate into actual projects and business. Definitely, it’s going to drive growth in the hydrogen market in the U.S. between now and 2030 as that -- as those incentives come in place to both put the hydrogen production in place as well as drive adoption of some of these technologies, which today, frankly, just cost more. So, you need those incentives in order to start to drive customer adoption and bring down the costs and make them more viable in the market. I mean, in the short run, we’re investing more because we’re building up capacity as are others in the industry. So, the faster we go in the short run could consume more cash. But obviously, we want the market to move, and we expect to deliver good gross margins once we get this kind of investment phase. So, it could go faster. It’s quite a long incubation period, so very different from, say, our on-highway engine business, while we take an order. And then typically, we’re shipping in a few weeks. It’s not been that typical in the last 12 months versus sometimes more than a year between headline announcements to actually putting equipment into place and sometimes even more than a year. But we are encouraged, strong adoption for our technology, and yes, business is doing well on the business development side.
Operator: We’re showing time for one final question today. The final question is coming from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Feniger: When we look at China revenue, the consolidated plus JV in 2022, it’s basically the lowest it’s been over three, four years. I think slightly below 2019. I’m just curious, in those three years, how profitability looks maybe post some restructuring optimization? If units in China recover, are you more profitable in each of those units than maybe you were in the past?
Mark Smith: Well, what’s happening over time is that the content is going up, right? So, one thing that’s been a big positive for our business is China consistently adopting more advanced emission standards. So the amount of revenue that we’re selling is going up per vehicle quite significantly over time. And certainly, cycle over cycle, it’s billions of dollars of extra revenue growth a year. We’re just at the lowest market in a decade. So, we agree that that growth rate is modest. We don’t have any signs yet of a rapid adoption. We’ll be looking at the same data you’re looking at, and obviously, taken on board the feedback from our customers, but we are profitable in our operations. We don’t disclose profitability by region, but for sure, when China volumes improve, our profits will go up.
Michael Feniger: Thank you. And we’ve seen quite a few emerging suppliers in the EV, e-mobility space really struggled in the last 12 months with deliveries or profitability. Do you see some of those dynamics driving OEM conversations back to you and traditional suppliers as we start looking ahead to some of these key dates and trying to adopt more of this altered powertrain?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. We talked about this in our Analyst Day about a year ago. We expect that this transition is going to take a long time for our industry, and that positions incumbents like Cummins well because you need to invest for the long term. Regardless of what our customers are adopting, we’ve got the solution in our portfolio. And so for sure, you see the benefit of a company like us that has a portfolio of options to meet their needs, it’s going to be around for the long term and continuing to invest in some of these new technologies, be able to do that and support the product as an advantage, and it’s playing out to be more of an advantage as time goes on compared to some of the new entrants. We continue to pay attention to those new entrants though and how they advance the technology and work to enter the market. So, we wouldn’t discount them, but certainly, this long investment period makes it more challenging for them to stay in and be successful.
Mark Smith: And I think also our footprint, our reputation for dependability, wherever our customers operate, is leading us to be approached in new segments by global large industrial players. So, it’s not just in the market that we operate in today, we’ve been approached to expand into different market applications. That’s particularly exciting.
Operator: At this time, I’d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Clulow for closing comments.
Chris Clulow: Thank you all for your participation today. That concludes our teleconference. I really appreciate the interest. And as always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call this afternoon. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cummins, Inc. Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions and comments following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. 
Christopher Clulow: [Technical Difficulty]. Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs, and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the risk factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you Chris and good morning. I will start with a summary of our third quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region, and I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.  Before getting into the details of our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the third quarter. On August 3rd, Cummins completed the acquisition of Meritor, a leading global supplier of drivetrain, mobility, braking, aftermarket and electric powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle and industrial markets. The integration of Meritor’s people, products and capabilities in axle and brake technology will position Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across the internal combustion and electric power applications. We've been excited to welcome our new colleagues into our company.  The company announced several collaborations that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals and advance our destinations Euro strategy. During the third quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Werner Enterprises, Transport Enterprise Leasing and Versatile to deliver 15-liter hydrogen internal combustion engines when available. The X15H hydrogen engine, part of Cummins’ fuel agnostic platform, will enable a more-timely solution to reduce carbon emissions by providing customers with an option that has powertrain installation commonality and end user familiarity. The New Power business continued to expand its green hydrogen presence globally as demand continues to rise in the key markets of North America, Europe, and China. Cummins announced it will expand PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capacity at its Oevel, Belgium, factory to 1 gigawatt. The company also announced it will begin producing electrolyzers in the United States, underscoring our continued dedication to advancing the nation’s green hydrogen economy. Electrolyzer production will take place at our Fridley, Minnesota facility, starting at 500 megawatts of manufacturing capacity annually and scalable to 1 gigawatt in the future. In addition we continue to make progress and preparing for the separation of our filtration business. The addition of Meritor and the planned separation of the filtration business are positive mood moves for our future. However, there are upfront costs associated with both transactions, which you can see from our press release and earnings materials, heavily influenced, our reported results this quarter. We expect that the most significant costs associated with both transactions are behind us and we look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remained strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the third quarter. Third quarter revenues totaled $7.3 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, third quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 11% from the same quarter in 2021. EBITDA in the third quarter was $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results and the $25 million related acquisition and integration cost, EBITDA was $907 million or 13.8% of sales compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. Third quarter results include cost of $16 million or $0.09 per diluted share related to the planned separation of the filtration business. Adjusting for these costs, EBITDA without Meritor and filtration cost was $923 million or 14% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the results of Meritor, the costs associated with its acquisition and the costs associated with the expected separation of our filtration business.  Our EBITDA percentage declined in the third quarter for three main reasons; first, we saw a 32% drop in joint venture income from the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in the China markets; second, we increased investments in research and development as we continued to invest in the products and technologies that will create competitive advantage in the future, particularly in the engine and new power segments; and finally, we made an investment in our people, through a one-time bonus in recognition of their intense work and commitment to meet customer demand and navigate supply chain and other challenges. This bonus did not apply to company officers. A motivated and highly effective workforce is critical to delivering our customers, executing on our strategy, and creating shareholder value. And this bonus will pay dividends over time in the retention and engagement of our people. We continue to make positive progress in improving gross margins of our business and offsetting the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we have experienced since the start of 2021. Gross margin percentage improved in the third quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2021, as the benefit of higher volumes and pricing exceeded the manufacturing, logistics, and material cost increases and higher product coverage costs during the quarter.  Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 19% to $4 billion driven by improved pricing, higher volumes, and higher after market demand. Industry production of heavy duty trucks in the third quarter was 64,000 units, up 23% from 2021 levels, while our heavy duty unit sales were 25,000, up 15% from 2021. Industry production of medium duty trucks was 29,000 units in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 26% from 2021 levels. While our unit sales were up 27,000, up 20% from 2021. We shipped 41,000 engines just to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2022, down 4% from 2021 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 16% over 2021 due to strong capital spending by rental companies and pricing. Power Systems North America sales were up 30% compared to 2021 driven by higher volumes and strength in aftermarket. Power Systems North America industrial sales were up 122% compared to the third quarter of 2021 driven by strong oil and gas demand. North America power generation sales also increased by 10% from the third quarter of 2021. Our International revenues decreased by 1% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 18% due to lower sales and on highway and construction markets. Industry demand from medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was a 164,000 units, a decrease of 25% from 2021. Weaker new vehicle demand, contracted property investment, and economic impacts from the shutdown as the country continues to respond to the COVID-19 outbreaks have pushed the market to the lowest level in a decade instead of our projected recovery of the market in the second half of the year. Our sales in units including joint ventures were 30,000 a decrease of 27%. The light duty market in China decreased 8% from 2021 levels to 387,000 units in the third quarter while our units sold including joint ventures were 24,000, a decrease of 30%. Industry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 57,000 units, an increase of 3% from 2021 levels and our units sold were 7,800 units, a decrease of 8%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 29% in the third quarter, due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.  Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $614 million, an increase of 18% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 37% while our shipments increased 20%, lagging the industry production due to the lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. Demand for power generation increased in the third quarter as economic activity continued to improve, resulting in record revenue in the quarter for that market.  Now, let me provide our outlook for 2022 including some comments on individual regions and end markets. To provide clarity on our projections, we will first provide guidance excluding the results of Meritor from the acquisition date through the end of 2022. We will then provide a view of the expected Meritor results for 2022. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a continued weak market outlook in China, as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas, and power generation markets, and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021.  EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15% of sales, excluding the Meritor results and costs associated with the acquisition and integration, the cost of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia and the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our filtration business. This is below our previous guidance of approximately 15.5% of sales as a result of the lower than expected market in China in the second half of 2022, and the one-time employee bonus investment made in the third quarter. This guidance reflects our expectations of increased profitability in the fourth quarter, as we continue to drive the improvements we've seen throughout the year on pricing relative to inflationary cost and improve our operating efficiency.  Based on our current forecast we expect production of heavy duty trucks in North America to be at 260,000 units in 2022, a 15% increase year-over-year. The supply chain constraints in our industry is expected to continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet the sustained strong end customer demand. In North America medium-duty truck market we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021 consistent with prior guidance. In China we now project total revenue including joint ventures to decrease 25% to 30% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 20% to 25%. We now project a 55% reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% to 20% reduction in demand in the light duty truck market compared to a 50% decline and 15% reduction respectively in our previous guidance. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021 consistent with our prior guidance. Despite the difficult economic and market environment in China we have continued to improve our presence in the region through the down cycle and are well positioned for continued out growth across our end markets in the region. As we look ahead industry volume of NS6 products will continue to increase as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition. With our NS6 share continuing to run ahead of our NS5 share. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions, as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 15% to 20% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 15%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022. Strong performance in power generation within India is also contributing to this improved outlook.  Most major global high-horsepower markets are expected to remain strong through the end of 2022. Sales of mining engines are now expected to be up 5% compared to the prior year, an improvement from our previous guidance of flat. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120% consistent with our prior guidance. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets amid energy and security has fueled this strong outlook. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10%, driven by increases in non-residential construction. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 5% driven by the increased production as supply chain constraint slightly eased and improved pricing.  We are projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021 consistent with our previous estimate. This strong outlook is driven by parts demand within our North America On-Highway business, as well as global Power Systems markets. In New Power we expect full year sales to be approximately $180 million down from our previous guidance of $200 million due to customer scheduling and supply chain impacts. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months and we are seeing increased momentum in North America following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.  Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with customers on both electrified power and fuel cell applications in 2022. This was demonstrated in the third quarter as we successfully launched the Cummins HD 120 fuel cell system in China by delivering 52 units to the Lin-gang Government for a bus application. For Meritor, we are expecting full year revenue since the date of acquisition to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 4.5% of sales during the same period, including the impact of required purchase accounting and integration costs. This represents the financial impact of Meritor across our Components and New Power businesses. During the quarter, we returned $245 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year.  As I sum up the third quarter, I want to emphasize that we are making progress in our strategy to lead in decarbonizing our industry. Although profitability dropped from the second quarter levels, the fundamentals of our business have not changed. Our products are performing well, leading to record demand from customers and rising market share in some of our core markets. This is the direct result of the contribution from our outstanding workforce. I do want to acknowledge the clear improvement in the financial performance of the Power Systems business this quarter, and I'm enthusiastic about the prospects for future earnings growth. We do expect total company profitability to improve in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels, as implied in our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are committed to improving the underlying financial performance of our business and delivering strong incremental margins through the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen and good morning everyone. There were a number of factors that impacted our reported results in the third quarter, and I will step through them to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the company and allow for comparison to our prior guidance. But the key takeaway I want you to leave with is that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. As you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August and are actively working through the business integration. Our third quarter results included two months of operational performance for the Meritor business, resulting in $737 million of sales and a total EBITDA loss of $23 million, which includes both the impact of purchase accounting and acquisition and integration costs. Our third quarter results also included $16 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. To provide clarity on the operational performance of our business, excluding the acquisition in comparison to our prior guidance, I am excluding the impact of these items in my following comments. Now let me get into more detail on our third quarter performance. Revenues were $6.6 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 19% while international revenues decreased 1%, driven by the decline in China, the impact of the suspension of our operations in Russia, and the unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced our reported sales by 3%. Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results, acquisition and integration costs and the costs associated with the separation of Filtration, EBITDA was $923 million or 14% of sales for the quarter compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by an increase in engineering support, engineering spend to support new product development, weaker joint venture earnings in China and the onetime bonus to recognize the commitment of our employees. This onetime bonus totaled $56 million and impacted the reported results of all operating segments, with $41 million of those costs reported within gross margin and $15 million reported within selling, admin, and research costs. Now let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.6 billion or 24.7% of sales increased by $213 million or 100 basis points compared to last year due to the benefits from stronger volumes and higher pricing, which more than offset higher material and people costs. Selling, admin, and research expenses increased by $110 million or 13%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting the development of products critical to achieving our Destination Zero strategy, including the fuel-agnostic engine platform, battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and PEM electrolyzer technologies. Joint venture income declined by $30 million compared to last year, primarily driven by lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $10 million, $22 million lower than a year ago, driven by $29 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our qualified benefit plans. And this compared to a gain on those investments of $1 million a year ago. Interest expense increased by $33 million due primarily to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor. Net earnings for the quarter were $468 million or $3.30 per diluted share, down from $534 million or $3.69 a year ago, with the decrease primarily attributed to an increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter. The all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.7%, including $57 million or $0.40 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete items primarily related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $382 million versus $569 million in Q3 of last year. Now let me comment on the segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues increased 8% from a year ago to $2.8 billion, and EBITDA decreased from 15.2% to 13.1% of sales as the benefits of pricing were more than offset by higher manufacturing and product coverage costs and lower joint venture income in China. For the full year 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, consistent with our prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 14.25%, a decrease from our previous guidance of 14.5% due to a weaker outlook in China and the impact of the onetime employee bonus. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to $2.2 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 10% compared to 9.8% a year ago due to pricing and stronger demand for parts, engines, and power generation equipment. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% compared to last year, in line with our prior guidance. EBIT is now expected to be approximately 10.5% of sales, consistent with our prior projection. Components revenue increased 10% in the third quarter, primarily driven by strong demand in North America. EBITDA increased from 14.1% of sales to 16.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions and lower warranty expense. We expect full year revenues to increase 3% and project EBIT margins -- EBITDA margins to be approximately 16.75%, unchanged from our view three months ago. Clearly, the Components segment results are most impacted by the acquisition of Meritor, and I just want to underline that the performance excluding the addition of Meritor was exactly in line with our guidance for the quarter and for the full year. In the Power Systems segment revenues increased 16% in the third quarter to $1.3 billion, a record for the segment. EBITDA increased from 11.5% to 14.3% due to higher volumes, strong price realization, and the increased demand for aftermarket parts. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, an increase from our prior guidance of up 8%. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11.25%, also up from our prior guidance of 11%, driven by stronger price realization and continued strength in sales. In the New Power segment, revenues were $45 million, up 96% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $86 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure, and capabilities to support strong future growth. For the full year 2022, we expect New Power revenues to be up approximately $180 million, down slightly from our prior guidance of $200 million due to delays in some customer projects and some supply chain constraints. Underlying demand, however, continues to grow for both battery electric systems and electrolyzers. Net expense for this segment is now projected to be $310 million compared to our prior guidance of $290 million, driven by increased investment to scale up electrolyzer production capacity and bring new products to market. As Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our 2022 expectations of total company revenues to be up 8%, and we now expect our EBITDA margins at approximately 15% for the full year. To be clear, once again, that this guidance excludes the Meritor business and related acquisition and integration costs, the impact of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, and any expenses associated with preparing for the separation of the Filtration business. This guidance does imply an improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter. We expect earnings from joint ventures to decline by 25% to 30% in 2022 due to the ongoing weakness in China and the impact of suspension of our business in Russia, and that is slightly worse than our prior guidance of down 25%, all due to the conditions in China. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 22% in 2022, lots of 22s there, excluding any discrete items, an increase from our prior guidance of 21.5%. Excluding Meritor, our capital expenditures in the quarter were $179 million, up from $150 million a year ago, and we're maintaining our full year guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. We returned $245 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the third quarter, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to $1 billion year-to-date. For the full year 2022, we still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And as I've already mentioned, we expect the Meritor revenues to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for the five months of this year under our ownership, and EBITDA to be approximately 4.5%, including the impact of purchase accounting. In closing, I want to again reinforce that Cummins is in a strong position, growing our leadership in our core markets while setting up the company for a stronger future through investment in new products and capabilities. And we are adjusting our portfolio of businesses, all while returning cash to shareholders. We do expect to deliver stronger profitability in the fourth quarter as implied in our full year guidance. Thank you for your guidance today -- no, your interest today. My guidance, your interest. Thank you. Now let me turn it over to Chris.
Christopher Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question.
Operator: Okay, our first question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please state your question. 
Stephen Volkmann: Great. Good morning guys. Thank you. Mark, I'm interested in your guidance. Mark, you kind of have my head spinning here. I apologize for that, it's a busy day. But how are you going to report the next quarter in terms of Meritor? I assume that will be in the numbers, but you'll probably adjust out maybe the purchase accounting, I'm just trying to figure out sort of on a like-for-like basis, kind of how we're supposed to think about the next quarter?
Mark Smith: Yes, so what we're trying to do and we realize it's complex for us also, there's a lot going on, Steve. So what we're trying to do is make clear how we're performing against our guidance in the Cummins business prior to the Meritor acquisition, which we lowered that guidance just to be clear and we'll try to be clear for the reasons why. And then we'll layer on the Meritor performance. So we're trying to give projections for both. We will report all in and then just as we've done this quarter in the earnings material, we'll break out the business pre-Meritor, Meritor separately, and the different elements so you can try and get a fuller picture and then next year, we'll move to the all-in reporting. But we will continue to provide details around Meritor, so that you can gain confidence that we're making progress on executing on the integration and growth of that business going forward. So the answer is yes, it's going to look similar in Q4 to this quarter. The noise from the purchase accounting will start to go -- will taper down next quarter and in subsequent quarters. But we're going to report with and without, so we're not reducing the visibility of our performance on either front. That's the main goal.
Stephen Volkmann: Okay, all right, fair enough. Maybe just a quick switch then, we've seen a couple of months now of pretty amazing heavy truck orders in the United States, North America. And I'm curious kind of what you're hearing as you talk to customers and sort of the outlook longer term, I mean, are you guys starting to slot in deliveries for these big orders that we're seeing and just kind of any color that you can give us there would be great?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, Steve. We continue to see strong heavy-duty customer order interest. The conversations that I have with both end customers and OEMs are around how we're working through supply constraints that continue to exist and increase production rates. And this has just not been a typical cycle, so all of those fundamentals for the business remain strong. We project that the market will remain strong into next year because they've been using the trucks at a high rate. They've not been able to replace at the level that they want to. And as well, these new trucks that are coming out, new powertrains have improved efficiency and as you see higher fuel prices, that's also attractive. So we continue to watch the broader economic indicators and what that may mean over time. Right now, we're continuing to work to increase production rates and see strong underlying demand.
Stephen Volkmann: Okay, thanks. I will pass it on. Appreciate it. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.
Jamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess just two questions. The R&D is up considerably sequentially. So -- and I know we're continuing to invest, but I'm wondering if we should think about that as a new run rate, is R&D going to be structurally higher and sort of the implications for 2023? And I guess my same question is on the SG&A side, even if we back out the $15 million that hit SG&A because of the bonus, the onetime bonus that was also up materially .And I'm just trying to think about spend in the context of concerns on the macro, understanding your customers are still saying things are strong now, but are we taking any actions in the case the macro does weaken? Thank you. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, great. Thanks, Jamie, for the question. Good to hear from you. We have, as you noted, taken up our R&D spend in particular in the Engine business and the New Power business where we have strategic investments in the fuel-agnostic platform and growing investments in electrolyzers and other key New Power technologies. And so we will continue to make those investments. And as we have in the past, we're going to manage through the cycles and improve performance, underlying financial performance of the company through the up and the down cycles while still making these key strategic investments that will position us to outgrow over time. We are looking closely at our priorities for next year. We are starting to more closely manage any headcount addition, so that we make sure that we're continuing to invest in key strategic areas while also managing those investments for potential downside scenarios. So we are more closely scrutinizing those priorities right now.
Mark Smith: Yes, and I would just add to that. We have lowered our admin costs like three quarters in a row. There is a tremendous focus on trying to flatten our costs out there, in particular, the increase in the SG&A was really in the selling side, which is a lot of that's tied to our aftermarket business and the Power Systems business, which is [Technical Difficulty] engineering on with the upward pressure and these are under the other type of pressure.
Jamie Cook: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob with Melius Research. Please state your question.
Robert Wertheimer: Thanks and hello, everybody. My question would be and I'm not sure it's an easy one to answer off the cuff. But when you look at your blended pricing on engines versus the OEM pricing on trucks across your customer base or if you wanted to specify North America, do you feel like you're caught up in that regard or do you have a couple of hundred bps to catch up? And could you lay out the time frame at which you would catch up if you think you are behind the OEM prices, which have a little bit more flexibility?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, Rob, this is how I would describe it. Over -- since the start of 2021, what we've seen is supply challenges and inflation that has driven cost and inefficiency into our business. For 2022, we are expecting a 400 basis point improvement in price compared to a 230 basis point impact on cost. So we are ahead for the year when you think about that price/cost balance, and we're also working to make improvements in operating efficiency. And we continue to have work to do to get back to where we were at the start of 2021. And we're able to price more rapidly into our aftermarket business. But of course, where we've got high backlog in the Power Systems business or long-term contracts, right, that takes time to flow through as we negotiate with customers and that we have metal market and other contractual agreements that also flow through over time, but not immediately.
Mark Smith: And just to confirm, the reason -- one of the reasons why we're ahead on price and material cost this year was, in fact, we bore a lot of those costs in the second half of 2021.
Robert Wertheimer: Are you still there, Mark?
Mark Smith: Yes, yes.
Robert Wertheimer: Okay, sorry. Got it, got it. And then could you give a general comment on just supply chain, do you feel like we've peaked out on risk, China may be doing lockdowns again, so if you take that after globally how does the risk of upside/downside on cost and supply chain feel to you? And I'll stop there. Thanks.
Jennifer Rumsey: Sure, on the supply chain side, we continue to see improvement and we also still have issues. So at this point, electronic component continues to be our biggest risk and disruptor. But as you said, there continue to be these dynamic lockdowns in China, congestion in certain ports that is more in the East Coast, more in Europe. And so we continue to see some supply chain disruption. So from where I sit, quarter-over-quarter it's been improving and we've been taking build rates up and able to drive some operational improvement, and those issues are not completely gone. And so that is, in part, influencing this continued expectation that we'll see improvement going into Q4 and into next year.
Robert Wertheimer: Alright, thank you. 
Mark Smith: Thanks Rob. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David with Evercore. Please state your question.
Mark Smith: David, you there? 
David Raso: Yes, I am. Sorry about that. Just so I can understand exactly the fourth quarter, sort of what you're adding back to 3Q, can you tell us what is your implied EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter, just so I can level set?
Mark Smith: 15.5 ex Meritor.
David Raso: So 15.5 for the fourth quarter?
Mark Smith: Compared to core -- yes.
David Raso: Then when I think about China, obviously, it's a big driver in the EBITDA margin, just given a lot of the truck business comes in as JV income. I know the consolidated aspect of construction activity there for your business. But obviously, truck, looking forward, how should we think about what you're seeing in China just from what you normally would see around Chinese New Year, obviously, with the Congress they just had their stimulus, a lot of things going on, I'm just curious, I thought Beijing Photon, in particular, was a little weaker than I would have thought, but I'm just curious what you're seeing on the truck side in particular?
Mark Smith: No significant momentum at all there right now, Dave, so that's certainly not part of the improvement from Q3 to Q4.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, and as you noted, I mean, they just had -- the Congress elected Xi to third term. We typically see some seasonality in that market. It's difficult to predict at this point. So as Mark said, we're not projecting improvements through the end of the year.
David Raso: And when it comes to the power gen business, and within that you obviously have some of the mining. Can you give us a little perspective, I mean, early look at 2023, how you're thinking about that business, just given the recent results were pretty healthy?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, like the U.S. truck market, the Power Systems markets continue to remain strong. We have -- there's a large back order there so we're projecting strength going into next year.
David Raso: Thank you very much.
Mark Smith: Thanks David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everyone. 
Mark Smith: Good morning Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Hey Mark. I'm wondering if you folks can talk about, as we head into 2023, you've got a number of tailwinds in terms of electrolyzer production ramping up, the eAxles ramping up at Meritor and maybe some medium-duty engine production ramping based on your recent wins. Looking at the new product contribution 2023 versus 2022, can you just outline for us the magnitude of tailwind, it feels like the electrolyzer opportunity is tracking ahead of expectations, but maybe I can get you to expand on that, if you don't mind.
Mark Smith: What I would say is, yes, we've got line of sight into improving demand in New Power business I would expect at this point in time without getting into specific numbers, both growth in battery electric systems and electrolyzer sales next year. So I think the momentum is going to continue in New Power. And then yes, we've got strong customer demand on the eAxle side. Again, I don't think that's going to be a dramatic change relative to a $27 billion company. But demand is strong. I've got clearest visibility into the New Power side right now.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, and on the electrolyzers, as I talked about some of the investment in production capacity. So we're in the early stages of building up that production capacity, building up the backlog. It's going to be lumpy at this point, and it's going to grow, as Mark said, over time. And we still feel really good. In fact, the Inflation Reduction Act and the climate provisions around that are strengthening the hydrogen outlook in the U.S.
Jerry Revich: Super. And can I ask, the initial customer response on the Meritor integration. Can you talk about what those conversations have been like, particularly as it pertains to selling eAxle and conventional axles to traditional Cummins customers that haven't been Meritor customers? And if you could touch on within the Meritor margin guidance, what's the inventory step-up that's embedded, that's depressing results looks like by at least two points, but I'm wondering if you could outline that relative to the full year guide on Slide 14 for Meritor? Thanks.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, we're obviously in the early days of integrating the Meritor business, excited to have that as part of us, starting to have conversations with customers at a strategic level. And it's a positive for them that we have added Meritor to our portfolio and can talk about how we're serving them both in the core businesses and New Power business going forward. Early days and those conversations are both on operational and supply as well as the strategic opportunities that we have.
Mark Smith: Yes, a lot of focus on demand and delivery right now as there is in other parts of our business, Jerry. So we aren't short of demand. We need to keep raising those production rates.
Christopher Clulow: And Jerry, on your question on the inventory step-up and there's a good reconciliation in the earnings deck, which talks through the complicated picture that is Meritor for this quarter. It's about $32 million was the impact in the third quarter of that inventory step-up.
Jerry Revich: Any in the fourth, Chris?
Christopher Clulow: Just a small bit. Most of that inventory burns off quickly as you would expect, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Super, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tami with J.P. Morgan. Please state your question.
Tami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So I have a couple of modeling questions. So my first question is, I saw in your presentation that Meritor's GAAP EBITDA rate I think you said, was 4.5%. And so can you help us with what it would have been on a non-GAAP basis because as we think about incorporating Meritor in our model, let's say for next year, what non-GAAP EBITDA rate should we be using and do you expect that rate to improve over the next few years just to better integrate that business?
Christopher Clulow: Yes. So let me try to unpack that a little bit. So the U.S. GAAP results essentially for Meritor at itself was essentially breakeven in the second quarter. And as Jen mentioned, our guidance for the full year for 2022 is about 4.5%. So that implies the U.S. GAAP, when you take out -- including the purchase accounting in Q2 and a little bit in Q3, implies an EBITDA of about 9% in the fourth quarter and that was up from, if you take out some of the noise in the third quarter, that was approximately 7.3% operating EBITDA. So we're seeing a step-up there. And then we would continue to -- as we go towards the future, continue to drive improvement there, both through the synergies we gain as well as other improvements in the business. So that gives you some view of kind of the trajectory there. I'm happy to talk through more separately, if you like.
Mark Smith: But also the performance in the short run, of course, is going to be dependent on the market. And we'll give you all of those elements, both in the Q4 and as we get to next year. I realize it's messy and appreciate everyone's patience as we've tried to work out the best disclosures to give you all this information. We'll continue to err on the side of sharing more and not less to make it as clear as possible.
Tami Zakaria: Got it. That's super helpful. And another quick one from me from a modeling perspective, the bonus that you gave to employees this quarter, as we lap it next year, we should be treating it as one-off for now, right?
Mark Smith: Yes, it won't be present even in the fourth quarter results and that's one of the factors why our EBITDA margins will -- not the only factor but one of the factors why our margins will be better in the fourth quarter.
Tami Zakaria: Okay, awesome, great. Thank you so much. 
Mark Smith: Thanks Tami.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven with UBS. Please state your question.
Steven Fisher : Thanks, good morning. So lots of puts and takes, but just to kind of summarize at a high level, is the overall message that basically your power gen business is a bit better than you're expecting, China is a bit worse and the China drag is just kind of a bit bigger than you have the benefit from power gen and you have slightly higher investments in New Power, I mean, is that sort of the key summary of it of the core business? And then you gave the 15.5% margin implied for Q4. Is there any bridge you can give us from Q3 EBITDA to Q4, I know you just mentioned, obviously, the $56 million of employee costs, is there any other sort of just direct bridge you can give us to help go from Q3 to Q4?
Mark Smith: Yes, there are really three core elements to that bridge, Steve: the bonus we've mentioned, a little bit of improvement in pricing from Q3 to Q4; and then we did have some operational challenges concentrated in one or two areas and we expect those to improve. And those three elements are the key drivers of the margin rebound. No improvement in China baked in, no significant increase in expenses expected in the fourth quarter.
Steven Fisher : Okay. And would you agree with that sort of the summary I gave of kind of what the main puts and takes of the core business were?
Mark Smith: Yes. And the only other thing is we continue to incur these mark-to-market losses so we didn't call them out. At some point, that will stabilize and rebound. Those were present in the third quarter but at a lower rate than in the second quarter. So that's noise in the other income line.
Steven Fisher : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just in terms of the heavy-duty truck market in North America, I'm curious how much visibility you have to the second half of 2023 at this point. I know you talked earlier about the order strength. I guess I'm just curious how far into 2023 the OEMs have given you their work plans and the confidence you have there relative to the first half? Thank you. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, I mean we are of course talking about outlook and forecast with our OEM customers and staying close to them on that. At this point, we've got about a nine-month backlog based on strong orders in September and October. And we'll continue to stay close to them to watch how that outlook evolves in the second half of the year.
Steven Fisher : Perfect, thank you. 
Mark Smith: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt with Cowen. Please state your question.
Matthew Elkott: Good morning, thank you. Can you just talk about the rationale behind doing a onetime bonus rather than further pay increases, I mean, is it that just you didn't want to lock in to pay increases ahead of a possible moderation of labor costs overall in the economy or did something specific happen in the quarter that made it necessary to do the bonus in order to not have a lot of attrition?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, really it was more of the latter. So of course, we're always looking at pay and what's happening with the market as it relates to labor costs. But really, we felt very strongly that given the tremendous effort of our employees over the last 18 months to deliver revenue at the level we did and work through all of the supply chain challenges and continue to commit to deliver key strategic growth initiatives, and given the environment where they are experiencing higher inflation, the impact to them, and the labor market is tighter. We felt that this onetime recognition was very appropriate to show appreciation, to mitigate attrition, and really motivate people to be connected to delivering and continuing to deliver for the company.
Matthew Elkott: Got it, makes sense. And then just a bigger picture question. You're expecting strong demand in mining and oil and gas for the rest of the year. Does it look like this momentum should continue into 2023? And on the mining side, does it look like the -- this demand is being driven by equipment replacement, I know we had equipment replacement cycle threatening to happen for the last decade, and it's been false starts, does it look to you guys like this time, it could be a multiyear replacement cycle on the mining side?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, we do see that demand continuing into next year. Of course, in oil and gas with the energy challenges, there's a lot of demand to invest there. And we'll have to continue to monitor those economic indicators over time. But right now in both of those markets, we continue to see strong demand holding into 2023.
Mark Smith: Yes, we're pretty much sold out for this year. There are some regional factors, increased coal production in India. There's some local factors as well as the overall security and availability of energy across borders.
Matthew Elkott: Thanks very much. 
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.
Noah Kaye: Alright, thanks for taking my questions. Just sticking with Off-Highway first. You mentioned that it's really the engine sales to some of the construction customers in North America, that growth being driven by CAPEX from rental companies and pricing. Have you started to see any benefits kicking in from IIJA yet, is that sort of a demand tailwind for 2023 or potentially beyond?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act is going to drive investment in infrastructure to support some of these clean energy technology. So we expect, over time, we'll see increased electrolyzer demand, as I alluded to earlier, and that could also provide benefit to underlying construction demand in the U.S. It's early, right, to actually see the specific impact of that. But certainly, it should provide a positive benefit.
Noah Kaye: Sorry, I know we've had a lot of legislation out of Washington. I was talking about the IIJA, the Infrastructure Bill.
Jennifer Rumsey: Sorry. Did I respond on the wrong one?
Noah Kaye: Yes. It sounds you have multiple shots on goal, but just wondering if you can talk through kind of any impact from the Infrastructure Bill so far?
Christopher Clulow: Yes, thanks, Noah. I think the Infrastructure Bill is similar -- actually it's having a very similar outcome, whereas obviously, the IRA is driving more into the New Power space. We are seeing some good momentum in that space. And we benefit that whether through the rental companies or some of the other construction equipment in North America has remained strong through this year and is carrying forward that momentum as those -- we continue to build out and there's a lot of work to be done, as you know. So that is certainly helping us.
Noah Kaye: Okay, great. And then I know a couple of folks have asked about Meritor impact going forward for next year. So I know we won't be precise here, but just for everybody's modeling, as we think about Components margin, I mean you annualized this year 7.5% EBITDA margin, add some synergies capture and some growth, it's still going to be a margin headwind in Components of probably a couple of hundred bps, right, as we look at 2023, is that a good starting point?
Mark Smith: Yes. On a percentage basis, it's clearly going to be dilutive in the early part of the ownership and the goal is to keep working that up over time.
Noah Kaye: And any early color on the cadence of the synergies capture that you can give us?
Mark Smith: No. I mean, we're working on that. We've got teams dedicated to that, working on that every day. Still feel confident about the numbers we gave earlier of $130 million pretax by year three. And I will say we're finding some other synergies as well in taxes and other things that are not included there. But lot of work still ahead of us, a lot of good progress to start and, of course, integrating the employees, that's a lot of work but we're off to a good start. I will say the business -- that business is also very busy with demand and supply challenges just as we are in our core. So we very much appreciate the hard work of the employees. We're listening towards driving synergies and improvement in their operations. They're all very busy and we appreciate that.
Noah Kaye: Okay, thanks so much for the color. 
Mark Smith: Thanks Noah.
Operator: That was our final question, and that concludes the Q&A session of this call. I'll turn it back over to Chris for closing remarks.
Christopher Clulow: Thank you, everyone -- much, everyone, for joining. As always, we will be available this afternoon to answer any questions that you may have from the Investor Relations perspective, and I appreciate your attendance today. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Q2 2022 Cummins Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Christopher Clulow: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the second quarter of 2022. Participating with me today are Tom Linebarger, our Executive Chairman; Jen Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the risk factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com.  With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Executive Chairman, Tom Linebarger one more time. Thanks.
Thomas Linebarger: Thank you, Chris. Brilliant. Good morning, everybody. I just -- I had to start by telling you about some rough math I did before I walked in today. And I believe this is my 70th earnings call. It's also going to be my last. I'm very grateful to the analysts and investors who are part of this journey with me. Many of you help me better understand the perspective of our shareholders, which influenced how we ran the company, how we developed our strategies and priorities, and how we communicated about our results and plans for the future. I always try to ensure that the senior leaders in the company understood your views and perspectives, and they understood who they were really working for. Some of you have been at this work almost as long as I have, and your commitment to understanding our company and its potential has been remarkable. I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me.  I'm very proud to have served as the CEO for this company for 10 years, as a senior executive for more than 20 years. It was an honor and a privilege. This company stands for more than its products and technology, its revenue or its earnings, and even its performance for customers all over the world. The people that work here are exceptional humans, not just exceptional workers. That's why this transition was so important to me. It is perhaps the most important work of my entire career. And I have a smile a mile wide today because of the quality of the individual that replaces me and the strength of the team beneath her.  Jennifer Rumsey is a once in a generation leader. She combines the leadership and technical skills needed, with the characters and values required and the inspiration of a CEO that can take this company to places where I could not. I'm as proud as I was on the day I took the job to see her succeed me. Jen?
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Tom. Good morning. I'm excited to join you this morning in this new capacity as President and CEO for Cummins. In July, we announced that Tom would end his term as CEO effective August 1. It is a bittersweet moment for me as he's been one of the most significant influences in my career and leadership. Tom has been an incredible leader for this company and a true partner and coach to me. Because of his leadership, we are in a strong position to navigate what comes next and execute our Destination Zero strategy. Tom and I share a common vision for Cummins and the role that our company plays empowering a more prosperous world. I feel deeply honored and proud to serve as the new CEO of Cummins, the first woman and just the seventh CEO of this great company. My life and leadership have prepared me for this role at this moment during the critical period for Cummins and our planet. A focus on purpose, people and impact has shaped my career and will influence how I lead. I look forward to working with all of you as we move forward.  I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. And I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the detail on our performance, I wanted to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter. The company achieved significant milestones related to 2 previously announced acquisitions: Jacobs Vehicle Systems, or JVS, and Meritor. In April, Cummins completed the acquisition of JVS, adding engine braking, cylinder deactivation, start-stop control and thermal management technologies, which are key components to meeting current and future emissions regulations. On May 26, Meritor's shareholders voted in favor of the Cummins acquisition bid, further validating the potential of what Cummins and Meritor can achieve together. The companies are working together to complete the acquisition this week as we have received all regulatory approvals to close the transaction.  During the second quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Daimler Truck, North America and Scania to deliver fuel cell electric powertrains for heavy-duty truck applications and with Komatsu on development of zero-emission haulage equipment, including hydrogen fuel cell solutions for large mining haul truck applications. Cummins, Chevron and Walmart also share plans to integrate Cummins X15N natural gas engines, powered by renewable natural gas into Walmart's heavy-duty truck fleet.  These customer collaborations are significant steps in alignment with our Destination Zero strategy to evolve our company, our products and our customers' products to the technologies needed for a decarbonized world. This strategy, which represents a significant growth opportunity for Cummins, includes reducing carbon emissions now by making improvements in engine-based solutions that are broadly available today while rapidly advancing the 0 emissions technologies of the future.  We continue to focus on our people and their development as a strategic advantage for the company. In the second quarter, the company posted its first human capital management report, detailing our commitment to creating and maintaining a dynamic and exciting work environment for our employees.  Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remained strong across all of our key markets and regions, with the notable exception of China, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter. Revenues for the second quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the second quarter of 2021. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16% compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. Second quarter results included costs of $29 million related to the preparations for the separation of the Filtration business.  As discussed previously, we recorded a charge of $158 million in the first quarter related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. In the second quarter, received certain inventory and other expense amounts reserved previously and incurred some small additional charges, resulting in a net recovery of $47 million. Adjusting for these items, EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the financial impact of the suspension of our Russia operations and the costs associated with the separation of our Filtration business.  EBITDA percentage declined in the second quarter as strength in sales and increased gross margin were offset by a 31% drop in joint venture income from the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in China markets. Research and development expenses also increased slightly in the second quarter of 2022 as we continued to invest in products and technologies that will create advantage in the future, particularly in the engine and new power segment. Gross margin percentage improved compared to second quarter of 2021 as the benefit of pricing and higher volumes exceeded the manufacturing, logistics and materials cost increases during the quarter. This pricing only partially offset the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we carried through from 2021 and experienced in the first half of 2022. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 15% to $4 billion, driven by improved pricing, higher volumes and higher aftermarket demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 62,000 units, up 9% from 2021 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, up 12% from 2021. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 30,000 units in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% from the 2021 levels, while our unit sales were 27,000, up 21% from 2021. We shipped 38,000 engines to [indiscernible] for the use on the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2022, down 9% from 2021 levels due to supply chain issues, which temporarily limited truck production. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 9% as other companies maintained strong capital spending.  Power Systems North America sales were flat compared to 2021 as strength in aftermarket offset lower volumes. Demand remains high in North America markets for Power Systems, but revenues for North America power generation declined by 3% as supply chain constraints limited our production for both U.S. military and mobile power applications. Our international revenues decreased by 2% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 43% due to lower sales in the on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 173,000 units, a decrease of 70% from 2021. Last year's numbers were strong, supported by a prebuy ahead of NS VI. But weaker new vehicle demand and economic impacts from shutdowns as the country is responding to a COVID-19 resurgence have pushed the market to the lowest level since 2007.  Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 25,000, a decrease of 70% despite the very difficult environment in China. We did see growth in some of our power systems markets, particularly mining and oil and gas. The light-duty market in China decreased 38% from 2021 levels to 380,000 units. While our units sold, including joint ventures, were 23,000, a decrease of 40%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 66,000 units, a decrease of 32% from 2021 levels. The decrease was driven by declining demand within the property market and the COVID-19 impact on infrastructure demand. Our units sold were 9,900 units, a decrease of 41%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 5% in the second quarter due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.  Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were a record $594 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 131%, while our shipments increased 78%, lagging the industry production due to lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. The high level of growth in the second quarter is coming off a very low base when India was experiencing a COVID-19 peak in 2021. Demand for power generation and construction equipment increased in the second quarter as economic activity continued to improve. In Brazil, our revenue increased 7%, driven by improved demand in most end markets.  Now let me provide our outlook for 2022, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a weaker market outlook in China as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 250,000 units to 260,000 units in 2022, a 10% to 15% increase over a year ago. The supply chain constraints our industry is experiencing continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet strong end customer demand. In North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are now projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021, an update to our previous guidance down 5%. In China, we are now projecting total revenue, including joint ventures, to decrease 20% to 25% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 10%. We now project a 50% reduction in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market compared to a 40% decline and a 12% reduction, respectively, in our previous guidance. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021, consistent with our prior guidance.  Despite the difficult economic and market environment in China, we have significantly improved our presence and profitability in the region compared to private -- prior cycles and are well positioned for continued outgrowth across our end markets in the region. As an illustration from 2019 to 2022, the demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks is projected to be down 40%, while across the same period, we are forecasting an increase in earnings from joint ventures in China.  As we look ahead, industry volume of NF VI product will increase through 2022 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to continue to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase 15% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 10%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022.  We continue to project most major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2022. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat in 2022 compared to the prior year, consistent with previous guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120%, an update from our previous guidance of up 95%. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets have fueled this improved outlook.  Revenue in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5%, driven by increases in nonresidential construction, consistent with our prior guidance. We are now projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021, an improvement from our previous estimate of up 15%. This is driven by parts demand within our North America On-Highway business as well as global Power Systems markets.  In New Power, we continue to expect full year sales to be approximately $200 million. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers, which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with OEMs on both electrified power and fuel cells for applications in 2022 as highlighted by the announcements I noted previously.  We are maintaining our full year 2022 EBITDA guidance of approximately 15.5%, excluding the impacts of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our filtration business and the expected costs associated with the pending acquisition of Meritor. We expect to deliver the strong profitability despite the supply chain constraints and rising inflationary costs that we are experiencing. During the quarter, we returned $240 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. Strong execution resulted in record sales in the quarter despite very difficult operating environment. The ongoing supply chain constraints and rising costs throughout the industry, continued COVID-19-related impacts and the effect of the conflict in Ukraine all present challenges to operating our business.  I am grateful for the commitment of our employees across the organization who have worked tirelessly to overcome these challenges. Their efforts resulted in a strong quarter, enabling us to support our customers while generating solid returns.  Cummins is in an excellent position to continue to execute our Destination Zero strategy, invest in the products and technologies that will fund future growth and drive advantage for our customers. We will accomplish this while generating strong financial results and meeting our commitment to return cash to shareholders. It's an exciting time to become CEO.  Thank you for joining us today. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter, especially in the context of a challenging global business environment. As Jen mentioned, our second quarter results included a $47 million benefit from adjusting the reserves related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business.  To provide clarity on operational performance, I'm going to exclude the impact of these items in my comments. We have provided a breakdown of the costs associated with Russia and the filtration separation costs by line item and by segment in our earnings material to help you understand the underlying performance more clearly.  Now let me go into more details on the second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues of $6.6 billion were up 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 15%, while international revenues declined by 2% due to a sharp slowdown in China. Foreign currency fluctuations, primarily a stronger U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales for the quarter compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by negative other income and lower joint venture earnings in China. Gross margins improved year-over-year and from the first quarter.  Now let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 25.6% of sales increased by $208 million or 140 basis points. The benefits of stronger volumes and higher pricing more than offset higher freight and material costs for this quarter. Of course, we have been facing increased costs for an extended period of time. And now our gross margins have returned back to 2019 of pre-COVID levels. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $16 million or 2%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting future growth, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.  Joint venture income declined by $42 million versus a year ago. Lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China was the primary driver of the decline in earnings. Other income was a negative $18 million, $87 million worse than a year ago. We experienced $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans in the second quarter, and this compares to gains of $20 million a year ago. This variation in this one category explains most of the change in other income.  Net earnings for the quarter were $678 million or $4.77 per diluted share compared to $600 million or $4.10 from a year ago. The earnings per share increased due to higher earnings, lower taxes and a reduced share count resulting from share repurchase activity. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 17.3%, including $36 million or $0.25 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $599 million compared to $616 million a year ago.  I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues increased 11% from a year ago, while EBITDA decreased from 16.1% of sales to 15.2% of sales, as the benefits of stronger volumes and pricing actions in our consolidated earnings were more than offset by lower joint venture income in China. In 2022, we expect the revenues to be up 10%, up 2% from our prior guidance. The increase in sales primarily driven by higher demand for engines and parts in North America. 2022 EBITDA is projected to be approximately 14.5%, in line with our prior guidance.  In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 17% from a year ago to $2.3 billion, a record quarter for the segment. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.2% compared to 10.5% sales a year ago, primarily due to stronger parts, whole goods, and sales and pricing actions. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% year-over-year and EBITDA margins in the range of 10.5% of sales, both in line with our prior guidance.  Components segment revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter, primarily driven by weaker demand in China. EBITDA increased from 15.1% of sales to 18.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions which offset material cost increases and lower warranty expense. We expect revenues to increase 3% for the year, down from an increase of 6% in our prior guidance, primarily to a lower outlook in China. EBITDA margin is expected to be 16.75% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.  In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 5% and EBITDA decreased from 12.2% to 10.6% of sales, as the benefit of stronger volumes and pricing were more than offset by higher material and logistics expenses. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 8% and EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11% for Power Systems, unchanged from our prior year guidance.  In the New Power segment, revenues were $42 million, up 75% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $80 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the products infrastructure and capabilities to support future growth and was in line with our expectations. In 2022, we still expect revenues for the New Power business to be approximately $200 million, up 72%. And net EBITDA losses are still expected to be in the range of $290 million for New Power, also unchanged from our prior guidance.  As Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our '22 expectations of company revenues to be up 8% and our EBITDA margins of approximately 15.5% of sales. This guidance excludes expenses outside of the normal course of business associated with the separation of the Filtration business, the pending acquisition of Meritor or the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We expect earnings from joint ventures to decline 25% in 2022, excluding the impact of suspension of our business in Russia. And this is down from our prior guide of a decline of 20% due to continued weakness -- or further weakness, in fact, in the China truck market. We are projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5% for this year, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures were $147 million in the quarter, up from $125 million a year ago. We still expect that our full year capital investments will be in the range of $850 million to $900 million.  We returned $240 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the second quarter, bringing our total cash returns of $758 million for the first half of the year. We still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. While high inflation and rising global interest rates present risks to global economic growth, we did not experience any significant changes in aggregate demand from our customers over the past quarter. Our focus remains on raising financial performance cycle-over-cycle in our core business, while investing in technologies that will deliver future profitable growth, including in new markets, new applications and with new customers.  We continue to advance our strategy in the second quarter, delivered record quarterly revenues and earnings per share, and recently announced an 8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the 13th straight year of dividend increases.  Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.
Christopher Clulow: Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Tom and Jen, congratulations.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thanks, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: So Tom, over those 70 earnings calls, I just want to add some rough math, too. So the earnings power of Cummins is up about sevenfold. So congratulations to you and the team here.
Thomas Linebarger: Thank you, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could just talk about the supply chain environment. You folks are sending a lot more via airfreight than you do in a normal environment. I'm wondering if you could just flesh that out for us. What proportion of your shipments are now airfreight versus in a normal environment? And how should we think about, whenever demand does slow, what decremental margins might look like given the step down that we see in expedited freight in that environment?
Jennifer Rumsey: Great. Thanks, Jerry. Yes, we continue to experience an environment where supply chain is limiting our production in most of our markets. And as you've seen, the team here has worked really hard to navigate that and continue to deliver as much product as we can to our customers who are also experiencing issues.  Some of those issues have lessened. We continue however to experience constraints, in particular, in the electronics space, microprocessors and other electronic components. We've seen improvement in our premium freight and also are closely monitoring what's going on with the standard freight rates. So while we have some improvement off the peak, we're still running at high levels as we continue to navigate disruptions caused by a combination of supply constraints and COVID-related disruptions.
Jerry Revich: I was just going to ask you if it's possible to quantify how much higher than is the normal?
Mark Smith: Well, at one point, last year, we were running probably 4x the normal level of premium freight, and that's come down. It has been that we've seen sequential improvement over the last 3 or 4 quarters, but we're still running 2x to 3x kind of extra costs right now. And then you'd asked about decremental margins, Jerry, in the event there's a slowdown. What I would say to you is we have to embrace these cycles when they come. We have a very experienced team that's navigated through several of them. I'm very proud of our record of raising cycle-over-cycle performance at the peak and trough. I can't give you exact decremental margins, but know that we will adjust plan outcome to operate the wells to continue to as and when the next cycle comes. That's all I can say really at this point.
Jerry Revich: Got it. And just lastly, normally, your margins tend to be down in the third quarter versus second quarter seasonally. I'm wondering given the supply chain, the dynamic that we have here, could we actually see margins flat up for you folks sequentially depending on how supply chain performs?
Mark Smith: I think the biggest challenge in the second half -- well, it's baked into our guidance, is that we see a drop-off in earnings in China. We typically see about a 25% to 30% lower JV income in the second half of the year, and we're projecting that again. You've heard from some of our important customers what their trajectory looks like on the top line going into the third quarter. Yes, there's still a lot of moving parts, still a lot of challenges we're working through. We've maintained our full year guidance. We're slightly behind the EBITDA percent for the full year through the first half of the year, but we're on track, not expecting extraordinary variation, at least from what we know today.
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citigroup.
Timothy Thein: Yes. Tom and Jen, congrats to you both. Yes. And Tom, I trust you'll be dialing into that 71st call, just so you can hear Chris read through the legal disclaimer.
Thomas Linebarger: No question about it.
Timothy Thein: Yes. So yes, Tom, maybe one for you, just higher level. Obviously, you've observed a number of cycles during your time. And I'm just curious, you mentioned that you guys weren't seeing anything of note. But obviously, there's a lot of broader concerns regarding the potential for either a recession is here or on our doorstep. And I'm just curious, if you have conversations with customers, what would you be alerting the team for in terms of signposts or indications of -- if that begins to, in fact, come through, where would you be watching? And what kind of, again, signals would you be kind of leading the team for?
Thomas Linebarger: Thanks, Tim. And I have been through a lot of these, and this is an unusual one, there's no question about it. But I'm going to flip it back to Jen just because in terms of conversations with customers about where they are, Jen's actually been doing more of those than I have. But I would say that -- I just kind of repeat the point Mark made. It is an unusual period and it has been an unusual cycle. And I think our team has continued to figure out ways to adapt to it, and I think we will here too. But make no mistake, a lot of us in the industry are trying to figure things out that we haven't faced before, labor shortages, part shortages over extended periods and things like that, I think you've heard from Jen. But let me just turn it back to her for kind of your perspective, Jen, of the customers and what they're looking at.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great, great. Thanks, Tom. As Mark and Tom have said, we're in a cyclical business. We have a strong team that understands how to navigate and manage over the cycles and use the cycles to strengthen the business and emerge stronger. And this is not a typical cycle because, coming out of the COVID-19 -- early part of COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen really strong demand that has been constrained by supply chain constraints across the industry. And we have been unable to meet our collective customer demand in these markets outside of China. That have been strong now for 18 months. You see that showing up in very high aftermarket demand as well as customers have been using these products heavily and had higher parts demand as they worked to keep them running.  So despite the fact that we do see some decrease in spot rates, some reduction off of really high indicators, when I talk to customers and look at some of these backlogs and freight activity, it's still very strong. And they still would like us to supply more than we're able to. So the conversations are all focused on where are we at with supply constraints and can we ship more to them. We continue to monitor those overall indicators. At this point, end customer demand is strong. Aftermarket demand is strong. Used truck prices continue to be elevated. And also recall, with higher fuel prices, these more fuel-efficient, next-generation products are attractive to customers. And so we'll continue to stay close to it and monitor what happens. But right now, we see supply being the constraint through this year outside of China.
Operator: Our next question is with Jamie Cook with Credit Crédit Suisse.
Jamie Cook: Congrats, Jennifer. And congrats, Tom, and thank you for all the support throughout the years. I wish you well. And I'm sure you're going to miss all our very insightful questions on earnings calls. I guess, Jennifer, my first question for you, understanding that you and Tom have been working closely together, and you co the Destination Zero strategy. You both obviously worked closely with and have buy-in. But sort of every CEO puts their own sort of stamp on a company. So just sort of -- as you're thinking about leading the company, sort of maybe nuances or differences relative to Tom or how you're thinking about the company just slightly differently? And then I guess just my second question, and I'll -- Jennifer, this is for you or for Mark. It's probably unfair, but I'll ask it anyway. Understanding you can't control a downturn if we have one, but I feel like Cummins' downturn theoretically in 2023 could be different as you think about, one, we have -- we're adding Meritor, you have market share wins. I guess we won't have the Filtration business. And maybe China is actually okay in this downturn because we're still -- the markets are depressed. So any way you want to sort of put buckets around how that could be additive to a normal downturn? Sorry for an unfair first question, Jennifer.
Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Jamie. Appreciate the question. And as you noted, Tom and I have developed the Destination Zero strategy together. I've been a member of the Cummins leadership team now for more than 7 years as Chief Technical Officer, leading the Components business, Chief Operating Officer, and now CEO. So the strategy, the focus of the company going forward remains the same. The commitment to all of our stakeholders to deliver strong results, to really create strategic advantage to our people will continue.  I think the big difference is just that, as we continue to operate in this evolving environment, paying attention to how markets are evolving, technologies are evolving, integration of Meritor, major new company, I'm going to be thinking a lot about strategic execution, and what does that mean for different parts of our business as our strategy evolves and paying attention to a more dynamic environment. And that's one of the reasons why I've kept the President role in addition to CEO is to stay close to the businesses as we focus not only on continuing to refine that strategy, but really driving strategic execution and delivering results.  As it relates to next year, we'll, of course, talk later more about next year. You've heard us say we see supply being the limiting factor through this year. Backlog is strong. China is down, and will improve, right? There's a lot of opportunity to improve. And Cummins is very well positioned. Our products are performing very well. The customer demand for that product is strong. We have new partnership opportunities in the core business and in New Power. And we'll continue to invest in products that will position the company for the future and manage through the cycles as they come.
Thomas Linebarger: And by the way, I'll miss you, Jamie.
Jamie Cook: No. I mean, that's fine. I was just wondering, too, I mean, the incremental market brings more opportunities and also the Meritor, some of these market share wins start to help in 2023? If you want to answer, fine, if not, that's fine. I can get back in queue.
Mark Smith: I think you just described most of my work plan from Tom, we'll be working on all of those. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS.
Steven Fisher: Not sure if I missed this, but what was your first half aftermarket growth? I know you raised the full year of 15% to 20% from 15%. Just kind of wondering what you're assuming for kind of the second half trajectory within that guidance if some of the market activity is kind of slowing that down at all?
Christopher Clulow: Yes. Steve, it's Chris. Yes, we experienced about that same level in the first half, and we expect it to hold throughout the year. I think the demand is still very high, particularly in the heavy-duty market, in North America as well as the global Power Systems markets. Mining, oil and gas have strong demands there for aftermarket parts, rebuilds and whatnot. So we expect that to hold certainly through the remainder of 2022.
Mark Smith: Yes. Q2 was a little stronger than Q1. As Tom and Jen mentioned, there have been some supply chain challenges. So these are little bit, and demand remains strong.
Steven Fisher: Okay. And then as you're kind of discussing with Tim before, I mean, it seems like we're kind of in this broad macro limbo at the moment. I guess I'm just curious how that is affecting any of your investment plans or strategic actions, if that's changing the timing of anything?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Good question. So obviously, we've moved forward with our JBS acquisition and Meritor will complete this week. We're continuing to make these key investments in the future. And we are still in the process on the separation of our Filtration business as we've disclosed previously and monitoring the environment as that continues.
Mark Smith: And the other thing I'd add is, we're just -- as you'd imagine, we're not just waiting around for changing economic conditions. An important part of how we've grown the earnings over time is just like a continual focus on trying to drive efficiencies in everything that we do. Doesn't always make the headlines, but almost every aspect of our work, we're looking for efficiency, better output. So we're always looking for those types of ways to improve the underlying performance of the business.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Robert Wertheimer: Congrats to both of you. My question is really on New Power. There's a lot that's changed in the world in the last 6 months. Your revenue trends are pretty good. And I'm curious if you have any comments on competitive position within electrolyzers, whether you see it solidifying or expanding. You guys have the wherewithal to invest, and presumably, that pays off somehow. And then just whether the outlook into, I guess, '23, '24, I'm not sure how far along your backlog extends is inflecting upwards as the world reevaluate its energy mix?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, yes. Great question. So we did -- we delivered the highest revenue in the second quarter to date from our New Power business at $42 million and made a lot of progress across all parts of the business. So you saw announcements of new partnerships on fuel cells, both on and off-highway, where we think long term the market will move. Continuing to make progress and having lots of conversations on the electrolyzers and demonstrating the capability of our PEM electrolyzer solutions there. And we believe, as we demonstrate some of those larger installations of PEM electrolyzer, that the market's going to increasingly move towards that solution and that we're well positioned competitively.  The market is lumpy at this point. And a lot of our focus is on building up capacity and scale to meet the demand. And so we will -- Amy and I will continue to be talking about what are those key milestones that we see in the market and in our scale-up activity and how that's evolving. We still feel very optimistic. And with this energy challenge that we see in the global world, expect that the focus and interest in green hydrogen will continue to grow.  And lastly, with the Meritor acquisition, that's another key component that we think positions us well in the electric powertrain. And we'll be building on the business that we have and very complementary to our existing New Power business and electrified powertrain. So overall, well positioned for the future with New Power.
Robert Wertheimer: That's comprehensive answer. Any inside track on whether the Inflation Reduction Act gets passed? And then you would benefit obviously from green hydrogen with that. I don't know if there's any production or any other obvious benefits that you saw in that potential bill, and I will stop there.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. So we're hopeful that the Inflation Reduction Act will get passed. It has many key provisions that we think are important for advancing lower carbon solutions, and it fits well with our Destination Zero strategy. It's really critical that there's investment to build out infrastructure and to make these technologies more affordable as they scale in advance. So we are -- have been active and advocating for some of the key energy provisions in that act, and we'll continue to do that as our Congress considers it.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Elkott with Cowen.
Matthew Elkott: So after the initial COVID shutdowns in China, we saw a pretty record recovery in the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. I understand we're highly unlikely to see anything like that after the current lockdowns. But do you have any sense of how things could play out when or if China moves fully past lockdowns like most of the rest of the world has?  And a longer picture question related to China as a follow-up. You've seen some western companies, like some automakers reconsider JVs in China. Do you guys still see your JV model in China as the right strategy? Any updated thoughts on that would be appreciated.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. What happens with China COVID lockdowns is one of the big questions that we debate a lot. At this point, they continue to have this dynamic lockdown strategy. And we've continued to see some smaller scale lockdowns that have been happening and operating and kind of closed loop, closed circle environments within that from a business perspective. So I don't see when and how they completely evolve out of that. We're prepared to continue to operate in that type of environment. However, we do think that, that market is going to come back. It's a large market. It's an important market for us to be a part of because of its size. And we are committed to continuing to invest in the products and joint ventures that we have there, while also ensuring from a global supply chain perspective that we have resiliency in our supply chain so that we can navigate through COVID, weather disruptions and other constraints.
Operator: Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.
Noah Kaye: And let me add to the congratulations here. And I just want to follow up on the IRA. So obviously, there's a lot of potential benefits for Cummins in this legislation. But among them, you could be looking at up to a $3 per kg production tax credit for green hydrogen. And obviously, it has been kind of on again, off again for the last couple of years. I have to imagine that some scenario planning has played out in some of these potential customer discussions. So at this point, is it possible to actually dimension the magnitude of the opportunities domestically that might pencil out with that kind of a PTC? And then how quickly do you think you can move to convert those opportunities to revenue if it does come to pass?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. No. It's a great question. And within that, Inflation Reduction Act, as you noted, there is incentive for hydrogen production, which is significant, as well as incentives for other clean vehicles and clean fuels. It's important to note that there's also incentive for things like biodiesel and renewable natural gas within that. So a lot of things that will help drive advantage.  We have had active conversations in recent years in Europe and growing conversations in the U.S. The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill also put some significant investment in hydrogen infrastructure. And so we believe that this will continue to add to that and are really focused on scaling up our product and production to meet the demand that we think will be there. So it's hard for me to mention specifically to you right now. As I said, we'll continue to talk about what we see as the key milestones in that business, growing revenue and growing our return from the electrolyzer business over time.
Noah Kaye: Okay. And maybe one quick follow-up, and there have been some discussions about preparing for a potential downturn and how you can flex down amidst that. But one variable that I'm sure you're considering is just the investment cycle for the next step-up in emissions reduction. So how do we think about that factoring into budgeting for next year, some potential increase, investment spending on the combustion side in preparing for tighter emission standards?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So you've seen us increasing our investments, in particular in both New Power and Engine business, as we invest in the technologies and electrolyzers in New Power and also these next-generation fuel-agnostic platforms and engine business. We have the scale advantage globally to do that. Those are investments that we will continue to make. And we're also looking at driving efficiency and improvement in parts of our business that can adjust with the cycle. And so we'll continue to deliver on our financial commitments and strong returns through the ups and downs as we invest in those key areas for our future.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey Kauffman: And like everybody else, Tom, thank you for your leadership, and Jennifer, best of luck in the future. I wanted to focus a little bit. You discussed supply chain costs and talked a little bit about what was going on with raw material costs. If we looked at the inflationary part of cost of goods sold, how do those costs stack up against each other, in terms of how much of the increase in expense is more on the raw input side versus how much more are we spending on supply chain than we normally would? And also noting that in recent weeks and months, supply chain costs while still high have been easing, raw material costs while still high have been easing. And I'm just kind of curious, is any of that built into the guide at this point, maintaining the margins where they are?
Mark Smith: Yes. Jeff, this is Mark. So I would say, this year, if you look at our costs, the material costs have been increasing. That's been the biggest single driver on the costs side. Last year, certainly the first half of the year, it was very heavy on the freight -- premium-free costs. But then we started to see more inflation in materials play out over time. So as we talked about, the premium freight costs have come down a little bit, part of that through better coordination and management of the expenses. Material costs continue to increase at this point in time. We put the -- I would say, within a fairly predictable range quarter-to-quarter so far, yes, 1 or 2 commodity costs have come off the peak, but remain at fairly elevated levels. And of course, whatever changes there are in the market, costs of freight and metal markets, those take time to work through the supply chain.
Jeffrey Kauffman: Okay. But Mark, back to the question though. So for the quarter, costs of goods sold was up about 5% on total revenue growth of about 8%. Ex inflationary costs, what are we looking at in terms of that raw material or the costs of goods sold inflation? I'm just trying to understand how much is kind of temporary cost inflation on materials, how much is temporary cost inflation on supply chain costs and kind of what's the underlying rate?
Mark Smith: Let me put it like this. Our material cost in the second quarter increased by 1.9% of sales year-over-year, just to -- what is temporary and what's -- we're always working to make changes to products, redesign things, take costs out. But right now, that's a pretty high level over what -- certainly pre-COVID, pre this inflationary environment, that there's a high level of material cost increases. What's temporary and permanent is very hard to say. But about 1.9%, freight costs are fairly flattish year-over-year, but at a very elevated level. Material cost increase -- there are some pressure on some of the categories, but those are the biggest elements.
Jeffrey Kauffman: All right. That's helpful. And then in terms of the guidance, I'm assuming no real change in either of those in terms of your outlook or has there been a change built into that outlook of margins maintaining?
Mark Smith: No significant change on the costs side. We've lowered our outlook for JV earnings, which is not what you're talking about. But I'm just trying to triangulate back to the overall guidance of lower JV earnings. And we've got slightly stronger aftermarket revenues, particularly in North America, which should balance -- those balance out, but no significant changes on the other categories.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Clulow for closing remarks.
Christopher Clulow: Great. Thanks, Maria. That concludes our teleconference for the day. Thank you all for participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Thanks.
Operator: You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-02-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q1, 2022 Meritor Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker’s presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you, GG. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor’s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Chris Villavarayan, CEO and President; and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today’s call are available at meritor.com. We’ll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you’ll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I’ll turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Villavarayan: Good morning. Carl and I look forward to walking you through an excellent first quarter. Before I begin, I want to thank the exceptional Meritor team for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Now, let’s turn to slide 3. Overall, we are pleased with our financial performance and are off to a good start for the year. We demonstrated our ability to manage the business well through a challenging set of factors on higher sales driven by stronger demand in most of our end global markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 11.5% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.80, an increase of more than 35% year-over-year. We’re working closely with our customers and suppliers to offset historically high freight and material costs while managing supply chain constraint and a prolonged labor shortage. We’re navigating these headwinds and are confident in our full year outlook that we’re reaffirming today.  In December, we introduced aggressive M2025 targets that include growing $500 million in revenue above market, with one half coming from electrification and expanding margins to 13% while generating $600 million in free cash flow. M2025 represents Meritor fourth M plan, our execution of these plans have transformed the company since the introduction of M2016, we have increased adjusted earnings per share by more than $2 through fiscal 2021 and expect to further increase EPS by almost an additional dollar this fiscal year. We have also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 350 basis points. We had a very successful first quarter in terms of finalizing New Business Awards, some of which we announced at Investor Day. Let me briefly recap the significance of these. We have an exclusive agreement with Thomas Built Bus for Meritor’s electric powertrain with SOP plan for 2024. With the electric school bus market expected to be one of the fastest adopting segments in large part due to the infrastructure bill, this agreement represents a meaningful near term opportunity to accelerate our electrification journey and expand our long term relationship with Daimler Trucks, North America. We extended our multiyear agreement with PACCAR to supply electric powertrain and full electric solutions for Kenworth and Peterbilt tractors and Refuse trucks. And we added three new prototype collaborations in the quarter with two different customers, two hydrogen fuel cell applications for Hexagon and a road sweeper platform for Electra. This makes the fifth quarter in a row that we have announced new electrification wins. In our core business, we’re excited to significantly increase our on-highway presence in China. With this five year agreement, we will supply Daimler with rear axles for the Actros. We also have a new business win with one of our largest trailer customers. This is our first five year agreement with Wabash and is valued at more than $150 million. You can see on slide 4 that Meritor is differentiating itself in the industry. We believe our growing number of electrification awards is the true measure of the value our customers place on our integration capabilities and electric powertrain. In fact, our electrification revenue forecast for fiscal 2022 has increased by more than 30% since December. Slide 5 brings into focus all our electrification programs announced to-date. I want to make three important points with this slide. First, half of our production programs are in the medium-duty with accelerated adoption rate expected in this segment, we anticipate that volumes on these programs will grow faster than on the heavy side, which is all growth for us. Second, we’re either exclusive or standard position on all these programs. And finally, we have eight production contracts, three with large OEMs and the remainder with promising startups. We look forward to helping more customers drive to a cleaner world.  On slide 6, I want to emphasize the importance of the work we’re doing at our innovation complex in Escondido, California. With the technical expertise inherent in this operation we can offer a complete turnkey vehicle electric vehicle solution. In addition to the electric powertrain, Meritor can provide the PCAS or power controls and accessory subsystem. Our acquisition of TransPower gave us a wealth of experience in vehicle controls that we have strengthened since taking ownership in 2020. We’re proud to be production ready for our electric powertrain and the full electric system. We’re confident in our capabilities and in the important role Meritor will play as commercial vehicles transform over the next decade. This is an incredibly exciting time for us. Now, I’ll turn it over to Carl. 
Carl Anderson: Thanks, Chris and good morning. On today’s call, I’ll review our first quarter financial results and outlook for fiscal year 2022. Overall, we delivered excellent financial performance to begin the final year of our M2022 plan. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.80. Now let’s review the details of our financial results on slide 7. Overall, revenue came in at $984 million, up 11% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher truck production in most markets as orders remain elevated around the globe. Net income from continuing operations was $54 million compared to $32 million last year. Higher net income was driven by increased sales volumes and lower interest expense, partially offset by net fuel costs. We also benefited from a $6 million settlement with an insurance carrier related to our asbestos liability this quarter. On a comparative basis, you will recall last year we recognize a $6 million onetime gain from our joint venture in Brazil, relating to a value added tax credit. Adjusted EBITDA was $113 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. The growth in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher sales volumes partially offset by net steel costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.80, up $0.21 from last year. And finally, free cash flow for the quarter was the use of $39 million compared to $34 million of cash generated last year. The decrease was in line with our expectations as we built higher inventory levels to support an anticipated strong production environment throughout the year. Additionally, incentive compensation payments were higher this year. Now I will discuss our segment results for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck were $785 million, up nearly 14% year-over-year. The increase was driven by higher truck production in most global market. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $69 million, up $6 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.8% a slight decrease of 30 basis points from a year ago. Higher sales partially offset by net fuel costs drove an increase to adjusted EBITDA. However, adjusted EBITDA margin was lower as net sale costs impacted sales conversion. Aftermarket industrial sales were $241 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year. Pricing actions executed over the last year in the segment was the primary driver of the improvement in revenue. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $3 million to $38 million, and EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points to 15.8%. The expansion in segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily from the footprint optimization initiatives implemented after the first quarter last year.  Now let’s review our global production outlook on slide 8. As we saw last quarter demand remained strong across our markets. In the North American Class 8 market the backlog is estimated at approximately 260,000 trucks representing nearly a full year of industry production. While we are closely monitoring constraints in the global supply chain, we are beginning to see some signs of stabilization. We are expecting supply chains to continue to improve as we progress throughout the year. As a result, we are not seeing a significant change from our November view. Therefore, we are maintaining our global production forecast for all markets.  Let’s turn to slide 9 for an update to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Based on first quarter results and our expectations for the rest of the year we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2022 guidance across all of our metrics. We expect revenue to be in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion based on our unchanged global market assumptions. Additionally, our expectations for adjusted EBITDA margin remains between 11.5% to 12.5%. We continue to plan for pricing actions to help mitigate steel, freight and labor cost pressures. We expect these recoveries to be more fully realized as we progress through the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations remain in a range of $3.25 to $3.75. And finally, our free cash flow guidance is also unchanged with a projected range of $175 million to $200 million. Our first quarter results provide a great foundation for a successful final year of M2022. We remain focused on executing this plan while simultaneously gearing up for M2025. As we approach the start of this new plan, we are forging a path with the coming electrification of the commercial vehicle industry. The road ahead is blue. Now we will take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sherif El-Sabbahy from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Sherif El-Sabbahy: So first off, congratulations, a great quarter. On the commercial truck margins, the first quarter saw some headwinds from steel. Looking at similar incremental data suggests deals around the $10 million to $11 million headwind to EBITDA. Is that correct? And then how would you see the cadence of those headwinds playing out quarter to quarter throughout the year? 
CarlAnderson: Yes, thanks Sherif. Yes, for the entire quarter steel was actually about a $24 million net headwind for us with the vast majority of that close to $20 million really affecting the commercial truck segment. And as we look forward, we think steel will continue to be a headwind for the rest of this year. But the next big step of that probably will be in the second quarter. And then as we look forward for the second half, we do believe, based off the trend line we’re seeing in steel prices that we’ll start seeing that the impact really starts to decline as we get in the second half.
Sherif El-Sabbahy: Makes sense. And then last quarter, you mentioned it was a very difficult quarter with the sporadic shutdowns from semis and limited visibility. And you expected that to normalize in the first quarter. So have you seen sort of a normalization of those lingering shortages and do you have better visibility based on OEM setting their line rates?
Carl Anderson: Yes, Sharif, I’ll take that one. For sure, I mean, based on I think where we’re seeing demand, the supply chain has improved from Q4 to Q1, but to your point that’s not resolved. And I would say, certainly, as we see from Q1 to Q2 we do see more stabilization. And it’s probably too early to declare a victory. And you do see over time this continuing to improve. But at this point, we certainly do see an improvement, both from a supply chain standpoint, and let’s call it more from our customers. Customers getting far more comfortable with their ability to get chips or understand their chip supply and also forecast better. As you can also see with PACCAR’s announcement, and taking the number of offline trucks, they’re obviously starting to get more chips in the system. So we do see that improving but again, probably too early to declare victory.
Sherif El-Sabbahy: And just one final one, with the PACCAR partnership expansion you announced last evening. How long is that multi, I know, it’s a multiyear. Are you disclosing how long that relationship lasts? And then, with regards to the integration and software aspect of that relationship how sticky do you see that being longer term as EV adoption expands and the partnership evolves?
Chris Villavarayan: Well, Sherif. Thanks. That’s a great question that I’d love to talk to. So in terms of the relationship that we announced, it’s through 2025. But just to put it in perspective across the two platforms on the day cab, and the waste trucks where we’re releasing six platforms and to just put it in perspective, that’s about somewhere between 1,500 to 1800 components across the power electronics. So the PCAS, the battery management system, as well as the ePowertrain, so in total between the two teams, we brought 10,000 parts to production in a period of 18 months to 24 months, and it’s PACCAR saw how complex that process was and obviously was an integral part of working with that. And that integration ties software between obviously the PCAS, the battery system, the powertrain, but also their truck, and all the validation that’s gone through that, and we put this into production in December. So certainly, they’ve seen the value that we’ve brought to the marketplace with them, and provided as an extension, and it’s truly a validation of the value of the Meritor proposition. So we’re very proud of it.
Sherif El-Sabbahy: Thanks, I’ll pass it along.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from a line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Joseph Spak: Thanks. I guess my first question is, is really sort of bigger picture here. If we go back to your capital markets say, if I made a point of talking about additional system design on electrification including more software features, and I think you’re getting highlighted that today on the full design system, on the full system design side. I guess what I’m curious about is how much you’re going to need to spend to hire the right people and how, and your ability to attract those individuals because clearly there is, I think there’s a limited set of people with the skill set, and you’re competing against, in some cases, your customers in some cases other end markets like electrification, etc, and in some cases, just for even other industries. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about that and sort of how you see the cost related to that over the coming years and also your ability to get the right people you need to, to execute on that plan?
Chris Villavarayan: Well, I think probably a good perspective to start on this Joe, is, is probably off our slide 5, and if look at the fact that we have eight production contracts, half of them coming from the medium duty space and half of them coming from the heavy space. It probably is a good starting point that the customer certainly believe that we have the right building blocks in place. So then going to that slide that the following slide on slide 6 that walks through what did we do across both those spaces. So let me take a minute and walk you through on the full system. So on the full system, as we did in the capital market space we talked a meeting, we talked across the three segments that were approaching this. So when we think about heavy, which is core to Meritor, we invested in TransPower. We acquired it and we used it as the building blocks to not only give us the access to test our product, but also work with customers such as PACCAR to drive that system and bring it to production. And for us to have been able to done that, to do that the number of folks that we have already put in place in Escondido as well as in Detroit seems to have certainly supported that. And it’s certainly working for us. So on that side, I believe that we have the right building block to go approach that. On the transit space and the medium duty space, if you notice, we made announcements with BAE to help us on the transit space. And we made announcements with C-Electric to help us with the full system as we focused more on the powertrain. So that’s how we focused on how we want to approach the full system capability as well as working with our customers some of which obviously have that system. And on the e-powertrain, we certainly believe again, that we have the right building blocks more because of the wins across all of them. We’ve announced 14 wins on this side on our motors and inverters. We work with Danfoss, which we believe is a strong partner who obviously has scales on motors. And then we are putting inverter capability internally as well as working with external parties. And again, as this evolves, we will continue to look at M&A. But at this point, based on the validation that we’re getting from the customers, we believe we have the right building blocks. 
Joseph Spak: But I guess just maybe in building those building blocks or in retaining some of those sort of the talent for those building blocks like, is that proving to be costly? Or how do you think about that sort of on a go forward basis, because they get especially starting to try to get more into some of the software it seems like that there could be sort of an incremental cost to your business. And I’m not saying there’s not a return on that. But like, it seems like the cost has to come before the return?
Chris Villavarayan: And maybe I’ll split that up into parts. Joe. I’ll answer the question on in terms of finding the talent and retaining the talent, and maybe Carl can pick up what’s the cost of it, but in terms of certainly finding the talent and returning the talent part of it is being in Detroit, we certainly have been successful in finding that talent. Our approach with how we acquire TransPower certainly gave us a baseline of folks. And so we were able to build off that. So to this point, we don’t seem to have struggled with finding people. In fact, we continue to add and grow in this area. And talking to my CTO, he certainly doesn’t seem to be having struggles just this yet, but in terms of costs.
Carl Anderson: Yes, Joe as mentioned in the strategy day if I look forward from an R&D perspective, we are looking at increasing that quite substantially probably close to 30%, from what our current run rate has been. But I think the other planning assumption and how we’re running the companies, we are looking at pivoting some of our expense and costs we are that we support the traditional business into what we’re doing on electrification. So I think it’s all embedded in our planning assumptions as we look to drive the M2025. So that you’re absolutely right, you’ll see that cost increase as relates to all the efforts we’re doing there, but we’re also doing a lot where we’ll be reducing some of the costs on our traditional products as well.
Joseph Spak: Thanks Carl and then just more near term, I guess. Can you sort of update us on steel costs and recoveries for the balance of the year? We’ve obviously seen at least spots deals sort of come off the highs here. But I know there can be sort of lags in both directions in terms of sort of outflows for your business. So how are you sort of thinking about steel cost and recoveries for the balance of the year? I know, you didn’t sort of change your guidance, but it seems like probably spot still has sort of maybe moved versus prior.
Carl Anderson: It has. So I think from a forecast perspective we were planning originally to have steel decline throughout the year when we last spoke in November. I would say that where I see spot prices today, they are coming in a little bit lower than what we originally were planning for. But from a lag perspective, obviously, steel is still a significant headwind for us this quarter as I referenced earlier. We expect that also to happen in the second quarter, and then you’ll start seeing that kind of normalize, as we kind of get into the second half of our fiscal year.
Joseph Spak: To be like more neutral in the back half or kind of like a year-over-year positive by the back half?
Carl Anderson: It could be, it could turn into a year-over-year positive depending on where the spot prices kind of come to, and it does get. There’s that lag effect, as you referenced before, depending on most of our contracts somewhere it’s three to six months. So it depends. But yes, that would be our expectation at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Bruce Chan: Good morning and congrats on the results. Don’t really want to feel wet blanket here, but wondering if you can maybe just give us some brief commentary on order cancellations. I’m sure that’s not really in the picture today. But maybe you can just remind us of what kinds of deposits or contract penalties if any there are for cancellation. And how do you couch the risk of cancellations to earnings and margins when you think about the sensitivities that you’ve built into that M2025 plan?
Chris Villavarayan: So I think obviously maybe you’re referring back to about November or December when it’s, we saw a little bit of a spike, let’s call it to 6% on cancellations on Class 8. But honestly when I look at it, Bruce, the demand is incredibly strong out there. I mean we got 260,000 trucks in the backlog, which is almost a year and we sit here and we look at this current market, and you wonder about the challenges, but if I go back to 2018, which was preparing for the second highest market we’ve ever seen in 2019 you still had regions that were going the wrong way. So we had India going the wrong way. We saw South America kind of still coming out of the recession. But at this point, when you look at 2021, you got India bouncing back from their weakest. If I go back to South America, they’re running at 150,000 trucks up from 109 in 2018/2019 timeframe. In North America if you look at between ACT and FDR, were somewhere between the 285 to 290 the midpoint being 290, our forecast is 280. And you got yet another almost 12 months in backlog. So we see enormous demand and I would say there’s the silver lining is once we figured out how to resolve some of the supply chain constraints I do see more of a demand story. I think some of the elements of the cancellations was frankly OEs refloating going forward, as well as fleets just adjusting their order board, because they just can’t get anything in the next three to six months.
Bruce Chan: Now that’s very helpful. And obviously, the portfolio as we get later into the plan is looking a little bit different. It’s a little bit more diversified. So maybe towards that end and I’m not sure if I missed this early in your commentary. But maybe you can give some commentary on the EV revenue backlog. I think that’s something that you also mentioned during the Capital Markets Day. Is that trending any differently as we sit here in February? I know, it’s only been a few months. 
Chris Villavarayan: Well, I’ll start off, I think we had talked about $500 million or a $0.5 billion in backlog, right through to let’s call it the capital markets day. I would say that, obviously, from what we see in forecasts that it’s now we’re significantly heading north of that. But what we did was we switched from talking about backlogs to now driving defined revenue within the years so that just to give a better perspective of how Meritor approaches things. And so that’s the one where in my prepared remarks, I talked about revenue that we’ve planned for 22 actually being up 30%. And our target for 2025 is $280 million, which we’re as we see where the backlog is sitting, we’re pretty confident we’re certainly seeing a path to hit that plus some as you know, we approach this pretty conservatively as Meritor.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Brian Johnson: Yes, thank you. I want to talk a little bit more about the electrification going blue angle. The first question is, can you give us any sense of the win rates on the 14Xe Axel? Second would be where different OEMs are in sourcing, obviously, the German truck companies and Daimler in particular, tend to do more both engine and axle work in house. That’s question number two? And then question number three is a pushback we get from investors is, yes, you’re making progress, but what about Cummins, Eaton and Allison. They are well entrenched with the same OEMs that you serve. Are they going to wake up one day and flex their muscle in this segment and does that worry you is Meritor management?
Chris Villavarayan: So good morning, Brian, love to take that question. So I’m going to break it into three sections. I think the first part really, in terms of the 14Xe and the success rate on the 14Xe. So again, going back to that slide 5, all of that is with the 14Xe with the exception of the MAN announced, the Volkswagen announcement that we have, that’s working off what we call an echo axle that’s designed to work with a remote mounted system, what with the future, being on a medium duty 12Xe. But everything that we have announced on that page is or let’s call it the 14 that we’re working on are all working off the 14Xe and then we’re super proud of that, because it really shows that I think whether folks are building ground up which are let’s call it the new entrants, such as Lion or Volta that have an option of designing whatever technology they want, or the folks that are, let’s call it the, the traditional OEMs, whether it’s Daimler or whether it’s PACCAR or whether it’s Autocar they’ve picked the 14Xe. So that’s, I think, the first comment. The second question in terms of vertical integration, I believe that there’s so much opportunity here and that there’s naturally going to be more competition. We’re going to see more suppliers, more OEMs entering this space. But frankly, we face that today. I mean, if you think about Daimler in North America, they still buy 50% of their class 8 axles from us, even though they’re vertically integrated. But I see the opportunity for us to grow in this space, primarily because of three reasons. The first one is, if you notice, half the wins are in the medium duty space. We only have 15% share there. So this is pure growth from that segments as we every entry that we make there. The content is three to four times more content. So with that, I mean, if you think about our axle’s volume, and if you think about this transitioning, we’re getting so much more in revenue and content as we transition here. And finally, in concept of vertical integration, I think the OEs whether it’s Daimler, as you defined it, let’s call it the European OEs they certainly see value here and with the announcement that we made, both at the strategy day or today, with Daimler they’re working with us on the Thomasville school bus, which is an exclusive agreement. And it’s something that they certainly have the capability on their own and they certainly picked us. So we’re pretty confident that customers over time will see value. And in any case, across those three reasons, we see a path to continue to grow.
Brian Johnson: And any indication that the other, we know data strategy pretty well, but the other powertrain players in the North American truck space, whether you even see them in these RFP situations?
Chris Villavarayan: We do. As I mentioned, I think there are there are more competitors, but frankly, I think I look at it from what’s our strengths that we bring to the marketplace. And it is really the fact that just put it in perspective Brian, we have around the world, we’re the number one commercial axle provider in North America. If you think about the fact that we have a scale of 70%, 7 out of 10 that run on our product, which if you put it in perspective is 2,000, about 1,500 to 2,000 axles. So the e-power trains built off that scale. And it’s frankly, we’ve been designing efficiency into axles for over a century. So we believe we have that capability will help us. Now in terms of some of the other competitors you mentioned, I believe that technology is moving into our space. So whether it’s the engine or their transmission that technology is moving into the axle and who better understands that for the last 100 years, but us. So I think that’s why we believe we have the strength here. And we certainly see that validated with in terms of the customers. The customers are being methodical. They are testing which we obviously expect them to do. They’re testing many products. Obviously there is value in some of the things that our competitors are doing. But we believe the market is so big and there’s enormous opportunity here that the basket is great for all of us.
Brian Johnson: Thank you and look forward to discussing this further in Florida in a couple of weeks.
Chris Villavarayan: Absolutely, look forward to it too.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Well, hi, good morning. This is [Indiscernible] on for Ryan. I just had one question on incremental margins. You talked about being able to offset some of the commodities and trade pressures through price. Just curious, in terms of new wage inflation, it was managed pretty well in the first quarter. But on a go forward basis given where we are with wage inflation, did you see any change in view to your incremental margins on a go forward basis? How do you manage that or flex that in the future? That’s the only question. Thanks.
Chris Villavarayan: Yes, we are definitely seeing wage inflation. Primarily, it’s a U.S. story for us. It’s obviously something that’s embedded in our current forecast. And so obviously we’re finding other ways to offset that as well as we think about what it means for the rest of the year. So, no change in margin, obviously, we kept everything unchanged from our guide that we had back in November. So I think it’s part of its internal continuing to drive internal efficiency, as well as discussions that we’re having with our customers as it relates to pricing.
Unidentified Analyst: So like going forward and beyond the current year if inflation does persist, do you feel like you can continue to manage that through other areas of maybe cost reductions or your pricing?
Chris Villavarayan: Yes. That is the plan. I think in addition to kind of our normal approach and strategy I think you’re going to see us obviously, look to automate even further, and many in most of our facilities as well as to provide other offsets for us.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks for the color and good luck.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I’m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for closing remarks.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-11-17 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Meritor Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker’s presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 earnings call. On the call today, we have Chris Villavarayan, CEO and President; and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc.

Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Villavarayan: Good morning. Thank you for joining the call today to discuss Meritor's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Once again, we delivered solid financial performance. We achieved our full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin and exceeded adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.23, while simultaneously expanding our reach into electrification. We accomplished this during significant supply chain disruption and labor issues in the United States. I want to thank the Meritor team and supply partners for working closely with our customers to optimize production and delivery. As shown on Slide 3, we had good conversion on higher revenue as global demand snapped back. Extraordinarily high input costs obviously impacted our margin for the quarter and the year, but all things considered, we're extremely pleased with the result. Let's turn to Slide 4. While the circumstances were demanding, we remained intently focused on safety, quality and delivery. We ended the year with strong metrics that give us a path to achieve our M2022 goals. With 50% of our facilities having zero recordable incidents in the year, I commend these teams for the work they did to maintain a safe working culture in a challenging environment. Our excellent quality for the year resulted in customer PPM of 23. Four of our facilities and three of our joint venture operations received the Daimler Masters of Quality Award, which recognizes outstanding suppliers with scores for quality, delivery, technology and cost performance. We're proud to say that including this year, we have earned 55 Masters of Quality Awards from Daimler over the years. We believe this level of quality differentiates us in the industry, as does our delivery rate of 96% this year. While not as high as a typical year where we consistently run 99%, we view this as an accomplishment considering the prolonged supply and labor disruption the industry is experiencing. As the commercial vehicle industry advances towards electric vehicles, we view every prototype agreement, collaboration and partnership as an important opportunity. Each one is a validation of our technology solution that could lead to a production contract as customers finalize their market strategies and architecture choices. Every quarter this year, we announced new agreements to expand our customer base and for electrification. This quarter is no exception. Please turn to Slide 5. First, Axos is electric mobility company that designs and manufactures medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks that travel on last mile back-to-base routes of less than 200 miles per day. Under a prototype agreement, Axos will evaluate and test Meritor's ePowertrain with the intention of taking it to production in future platforms. We also have a new collaboration with Electra commercial vehicles. Meritor will work with Electra to bring electrified commercial vehicles to Europe city centers, integrating Meritor's electric powertrain into an IVECO-based road sweeper application will allow Electra to replace its remote drive conversion solution and test a more efficient and compact electric powertrain. With Meritor's technical architecture, Electra can maximize the space for batteries, which will allow the vehicles to sweep more road surface in a single shift. Finally, we're proud to be a part of the U.S. Department of Energy Super Truck 3 program in collaboration with PACCAR. The goal of this program is to develop zero-emission medium-and heavy-duty trucks. Let's go to Slide 6 for a look at the significant number of diverse electrification agreements we have announced in fiscal 2021. From production awards to prototypes, medium duty to heavy, we're growing through new and existing customer relationships. In 2020, we announced the PACCAR and Volkswagen electrification production program. This fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2020, we've more than tripled the value of new EV wins and further diversified our customer base. We're also growing our opportunities in the medium-duty application space. Here, we historically have not had a large share. We have now booked electrification business of almost $0.5 billion. On Slide 7, we wanted to recap the important activity in our core business during the year. We extended contracts with Navistar and IVECO and secured new business with industrial and truck customers in India and the United States. We're on track to exceed our M2022 new business win target by approximately $100 million. Keep in mind, we expect the sustained growth of our core business to fund the growth of our electrification business as the customer base and product portfolio continues to grow. I will now turn it over to Carl for the financial details.
Carl Anderson: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and provide an outlook for fiscal year 2022. Despite significant headwinds in the supply chain and operating environment, we delivered solid financial performance in our fiscal year. We converted on incremental revenue at 18%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 180 basis points to 10.7%, increased adjusted earnings per share by 176% to $2.68 and generated $107 million of free cash flow. Now let's turn to Slide 8. First, I will review our segment results for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in Commercial Truck were $740 million, up over 30% year-over-year. The increase in sales was driven by higher global truck production in all markets. A year ago at this time, we were just starting to recover from pandemic-related shutdowns. Segment adjusted EBITDA for Commercial Truck was $54 million, up $30 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 7.3%, an increase of 300 basis points from a year ago. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and margin was driven primarily by conversion on the higher revenue. This was partially offset by higher freight and steel costs. Aftermarket & Industrial sales were $250 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. The majority of this was driven by higher order activity in our North America aftermarket business. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat year-over-year. However, margins were impacted by higher freight costs, resulting in a 140 basis point decrease. For the full year, sales rose to over $3.8 billion, up 26% from last year due to strong global demand and higher truck production in all of our markets. Production in India more than doubled. South America was up 50%, and Class 8 production in North America increased by 20%. Net income from continuing operations was $200 million compared to $244 million in the prior year. You will recall last year, we recognized more than $200 million of income, net of tax, associated with the termination of the company's distribution arrangement with WABCO. This was partially offset by the recognition of value-added tax credits in our wholly-owned Brazilian entity of $15 million net of tax during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Additionally, we recognized $10 million in net tax benefits from certain tax initiatives that were implemented in the fourth quarter of this year. Adjusted EBITDA was $411 million in fiscal year 2021, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7%, an increase of 180 basis points. The increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin year-over-year was driven primarily by conversion on higher sales, partially offset by increased freight, steel and electrification costs. In total, higher steel and freight costs were an $84 million headwind in 2021. During the year, ocean container costs nearly quadrupled, hot-rolled steel increased over 250% and scrap costs double. Had we not faced these increased costs in steel and freight, our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2021 would have been significantly higher, demonstrating how well the underlying business is performing. Additionally, we also incurred $21 million in higher electrification expense as we continue to invest for the future. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.68, an increase of $1.71 from the prior year. This does exclude the $15 million in tax credits from Brazil and the $10 million of tax initiatives I mentioned earlier. And finally, free cash flow was $107 million compared to $180 million last year. Keep in mind, our 2020 free cash flow included the $265 million benefit in cash received from the termination of the distribution arrangement we had with WABCO. In 2021, we also had an approximately $70 million increase in our working capital requirements as we secured supply for our customer needs and prepare for another increase in volumes in 2022. Now let's review our global production outlook on Slide 9. We continue to see strong demand across our global markets. However, global supply chain constraints continue to impact production for our customers and the industry which we expect to continue into next year. In North America, we expect Class 8 production to be in the range of 270,000 to 290,000 units, an increase of almost 7% at the midpoint from 2021. While order activity has begun to moderate, there have been over 320,000 Class 8 trucks ordered since January. Additionally, the backlog in September was approximately 280,000 units, which is approaching the previous all-time high set in October 2018. Overall, we expect production to be limited only by constraints in the supply chain. In Europe, our production outlook is in the range of 410,000 to 430,000 units as we continue to see stable product levels on the continent. In Brazil, we expect strong demand to continue as 2021 was the highest Class 8 truck production in this region since 2014. We expect production next year in the range of 145,000 to 155,000 units. And in India, we project a slight increase from the prior year as production in the region continues to rebound. Let's turn to Slide 10 for an update to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. We are projecting our full year sales to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. In addition to revenue growth based on the production forecast I discussed, we expect approximately $100 million in incremental sales related to new business wins as part of M2022 plan. We also continue to recoup steel costs from our pass-through recovery mechanisms, which we expect will increase revenue in the range of $100 million to $150 million compared to last year. Moving to our margin outlook. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%. Our guidance range is wider than normal due to the continued uncertainty in the overall operating environment. We continue to see significant headwinds from steel and freight and anticipate these costs to be an incremental headwind of $70 million to $110 million as compared to 2021. We are executing on recovery and pricing actions to help offset some of the cost pressures we are seeing. In total, we currently are planning for $50 million to $80 million of actions, which will be more fully realized starting in our second quarter. In addition, we expect several tailwinds in fiscal year 2022. First, we will continue to drive operational performance in the business, and we will complete our previously announced footprint consolidation initiative in the first quarter, providing a $12 million to $15 million year-over-year improvement. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2022 is approximately $3.25 to $3.75. Keep in mind, this outlook is based on our revised reporting of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share that we changed in the second quarter of 2021, which excludes the benefit of noncash tax adjustments we had previously included when we announced the M2022 plan back in November 2018. And finally, we now expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million as working capital stabilizes and we convert on incremental sales. Overall, the team continues to remain focused on delivering superior financial performance in the final year of our M2022 plan. Now I will turn the call back over to Chris for some closing remarks.
Chris Villavarayan: As Carl stated, our guidance ranges for this fiscal year are wider than usual due to the volatility we have grown accustomed to in the past few quarters. However, we are focused on delivering excellent financial results. Slide 11 provides M2022 highlights. We're particularly excited about the growth we see and plan to achieve in our core business and advanced technology. Meritor recognizes the future is electric. Our success in 2021 and our legacy in the commercial vehicle and brake business will position us well to capitalize on the growing adoption of electric vehicles around the world. As we look at the next decade, we expect the rate of adoption to dramatically increase heading towards 2030. And as the market shifts to electric powertrains, we believe Meritor's content per vehicle will grow significantly. Please turn to Slide 12. We hope you will join us for Meritor's Virtual Strategy Day on December 7. At that time, we will dimension our growth expectations as the industry transforms to electrification and share exciting new business wins with you. Following that event, we will have a live Q&A. So please mark that on your calendars. We will now take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jason Stuhldreher: Team, this is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian. Congrats on finishing fiscal year '21. I was hoping maybe just on the outlook first. The incremental margins that the outlook seems to imply, if we kind of exclude the recoveries that you're getting and then the additional steel and freight cost, it looks to be in sort of the low 30-ish percent range, which is higher than we've seen in the past. And you kind of mentioned some one-off factors, but hoping you could sort of kind of dimensionalize what your kind of expected standalone incremental margins would be? And then what the benefits of sort of finishing the footprint consolidation and other factors for next year?
Carl Anderson: Sure. It's Carl. I can address that question. Yes, as we look at the incrementals going into 2022, a couple of things to keep in mind. I would say kind of just on base revenue, our expectation now with all of the actions we've executed over the last several years is that we will be north of 20% conversion on that incremental revenue. In addition to the footprint consolidation of $12 million to $15 million tailwind, we also expect to drive significant continued operational performance in the business as well. So that would be an additional up to $30 million plus of operational improvement, and we are also planning for less incentive compensation expense in 2022. So that all will box you to the higher margin in an absolute sense.
Jason Stuhldreher: Understood. And then maybe just on the free cash flow conversion, I mean the numbers that you're guiding to are pretty strong for 2022 kind of -- in that 75% range, maybe even a little higher. And I guess we're going to get an update on what sort of cash you guys can generate in your next -- in the next set of planning period. But as we think about some of the restructuring cash uses kind of rolling off and maybe sort of a normalization of working capital, is it kind of fair to hope for maybe north of 75% kind of going forward?
Carl Anderson: Yes. I think obviously, we're driving to achieve the 75% for this year in 2022. And we will obviously provide an update in a couple of weeks at our Strategy Day in a little bit more detail. But the expectation, just given the improved overall balance sheet and what we expect from working capital, I think it would be a fair assumption we should be driving that number north of 75% as we go forward.
Jason Stuhldreher: Understood. Okay. Then lots to talk about on the electrification front, but I'll save that for next month. So thanks, team.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sherif El-Sabbahy with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Sherif El-Sabbahy: So I just wanted to ask about the 140 basis point impact on aftermarket and industrial. It seems like freight is having an outsized impact on that segment. Could you provide a bit more color? And then when would you expect that freight impact to maybe roll off?
Carl Anderson: Yes, as we're seeing -- as we look at kind of just global freight index since -- just in the fourth quarter alone. So this is -- if I go back to when we last talked to you back in July and where we are now, we have seen freight costs increase 50% since that time period. So I think that continues to be a near-term short-term headwind in the business. But as we kind of go forward, there are actions that we addressed in the call, especially with the aftermarket business around pricing that we expect to go into effect in the -- our second quarter. So you should start seeing that normalize a little bit further as we get out of this first quarter.
Sherif El-Sabbahy: Understood. And then with regards to the Commercial Truck segment, has it seen a similar level? Or is there pass-throughs or something of that nature there that would be offsetting a bit more that isn't present in aftermarket?
Carl Anderson: No, it is affecting both segments, we are seeing that. Obviously, we have pass-through mechanisms on our steel, we do not have that in freight. So that is something that we have to -- have further discussions with our customers on for pricing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital. Your line is open.
Joseph Spak: Carl, if I look at some of the factors for the margin walk in '22 and revenue conversion and operating performance. If I just sort of use sort of normal historical incremental margins on the revenue you're showing, it would seem like maybe half of that 1.4 to 2.2 is from volume and the other half would be more operational performance. And I know you sort of called out the $12 million to $15 million from actions taken, but what are some of the other areas there where you can sort of drive further operational performance in '22?
Carl Anderson: Joe, yes, I think there a couple of other areas in addition to footprint, as I mentioned earlier, would be we are expecting lower incentive compensation. So that was a -- so call that in around that $10 million type of range year-over-year. And then additionally, our expectation is we will continue to drive significant material performance into the business on a year-over-year basis. So I think those are kind of the key drivers for us to -- for that bridge.
Joseph Spak: Okay. I guess staying there, and you sort of just touched on this a little bit like the recovery in pricing actions. So it sounds to me like that's a mix of contractual stuff and sort of negotiation, can you just help us sort of understand the split there in terms of sort of what is more just contractual that sort of owed to you? And how much is you guys rolling up your sleeves at the table and sort of trying to get some pricing back and what the reaction to those conversations have been so far?
Chris Villavarayan: So I'll take that one. And just if you break it up, steel is mostly contractual. So we have that on average somewhere between 75% to 80% as passed through. There's obviously the lag associated with when we have that recovery. Most of the conversations are most -- are on the freight side, as Carl mentioned, that is something that is not covered. And so those negotiations, as you could imagine, are obviously difficult, but our customers understand it, especially when you think about numbers where freight has gone up 400% to 500% depending on which region and the type of freight. So we've had those -- we've started those conversations early. We've continued to have those conversations, though difficult. What I would say, Joe, is at the end of the day, our customers need us healthy. So we've been able to work with them. And as we see going into '22, those costs continue to rise. So we will have to continue to have those conversations.
Joseph Spak: And historically, it's been easier to take pricing on the aftermarket side, right, than on the correct?
Chris Villavarayan: Yes, correct. We twice the year and we've usually...
Joseph Spak: Yes. Okay. Last one for me. Like on the EV stuff, great to hear $500 million in wins, which is, I think, what you were already, which is what you're targeting. Is there a way to let us know the split between, let's call them, legacy truck makers and some of these newer names? And also like what's the time frame for that $500 million to be recognized over?
Chris Villavarayan: So let me take that one. We don't usually provide the granularity by customer, Joe. What we're doing is essentially taking the full basket or the full revenue that we have from all our customers and risk adjusting, and that's what you see. However, in terms of, let's call it, timing, that's something that we will provide when you call in on December 7.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel.
Matthew Milask: This is Matt on for Bruce. Congratulations on the solid fiscal '21. With regards to the fiscal '22 outlook, could you provide some more color around the key assumptions on labor cost inflation perhaps how good you guys feel about your line of sight into how the salary, wages and benefit line might ultimately impact margins next year? And maybe as a follow-up to that, if you could comment on the hiring and staffing challenges that you're experiencing now in the market, if you have any thoughts on what the impact might be on production, labor and so forth from The Biden Administration's vaccine regulations?
Carl Anderson: Thanks, Matt. I'll take the first question and turn it over to Chris for the second. As it relates to the inflation for the workforce that we're seeing, it is embedded in our guidance right now. I think it is definitely obviously increasing depending on where we're operating and what we're in, but I would say it's fully reflected in what our guidance is from an assumption perspective. So I'll turn it over to Chris.
Chris Villavarayan: And so on the second half, Matt, if you think about it, I would say Q4 for us was probably one of our most challenging quarters thinking about labor coming with the -- obviously, the impact of the Delta variant as well as the inability to really get a good view of the line rates because of the impacts of the semiconductor shortages. So we were seeing quite a bit of sporadic shutdowns through Q4. We do see that normalizing in Q1. So our OEs have adjusted line rates based more from the visibility they have ahead of them, and that's provided us the ability to then appropriately staff. One of the other things we have done and it's a true testament of the Meritor the employees of Meritor is we were able to respond, in many cases, by moving some of our salaried folks to respond into the plants. And as we think through some of our strategies at least stabilizing through the next quarter, those are some of the, let's call it, the elements that we continue to deploy.
Matthew Milask: And lastly, if I could sneak one more in. Could you provide any updates on the Blue Horizon platform? Perhaps some color around the planned product portfolio, production time line, maybe the order book with existing customers or any new customer activity would be great.
Chris Villavarayan: Yes, I'd love to. So perfect. So I think Blue Horizon -- under Blue Horizon, we captured both our ePowertrain as well as, let's call it, the full system with the full system, which is where we provide the PACCAR, the battery system as well as the ePowertrain, which we're launching with PACCAR, we're all aligned to go into production at the end of this year. So we're in great shape there. And then with the which is -- 14Xe, which is the ePowertrain, we announced obviously the two prototype announcements today. So that stream continues to build, and we look forward to talking more about it on our Strategy Day on the 7.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ryan Brinkman: Given that you're mostly protected in customer agreements with regard to steel cost recoveries with the biggest consideration there, I think being mostly timing differences and the optics on margin, et cetera. I thought to ask some more questions on these non-commodity supply chain costs. A number of light vehicle suppliers this quarter have called out these costs, including ocean shipping, freight, electricity, natural gas, diesel, even labor, suggesting that they are unusual and that they would seek to at least partially recover them via commercial negotiations with their customers. I heard you guys mention ocean shipping and freight a number of times. To what extent should we think about these costs as needing to be offset more through productivity and other cost savings? Is that how you've tended to handle lower rates of inflation of these costs in the past versus to what extent do you expect to pass on higher non-commodity supply chain cost to customers? If you do intend to pass along those costs, what would that process or timing of that process look like? And does it make sense to potentially formalize into future agreements, I mean not labor, but certainly maybe ocean shipping, for example, in the way that commodities began to be formalized in the contracts in the 2000s?
Chris Villavarayan: Well, it's a great question, Ryan. I think when you think about the size and scale it isn't something that we can truly absorb when we think about the business. I mean you come to a point where it becomes detrimental over time. So for us, the -- conceptually, when you look at the other elements and you've identified them well, whether it's power and portions of labor, we certainly will be looking to pass some of these on to our customers. We've started with freight because that was the most significant discussion we've had, but we certainly have had other baskets we've started discussing with our customers. As we look at the last year and just preparing for the next year, you know that a significant portion of this needs to be moved out of the business. We started early coming into the pandemic by reacting -- by adjusting our headcount as well as looking at all nondiscretionary costs. So we've done quite a bit of, let's call it, internal work. But when it comes to a point where you have increases of 200% to 500%, we certainly will be looking to have conversations with our customers.
Ryan Brinkman: And then my last question is on the labor front. You did get a question there already, so I'll try to ask it from a bit of a different angle. In the past, mostly in the industry downturns, I think you have highlighted the relatively higher percent of your workers that are temporary or were temporary at the time with the implication being that maybe there could be more easily or cost effectively let go when not needed, which is seemingly the opposite of the situation today, right? So I'm just curious what your mix of permanent versus temporary workers looks like today. If you're thinking any differently about permanent versus temporary with the benefit of temporary maybe being as much as sort of greater in downturns than upturns. And generally, what your retention looks like at the moment, you did get the question of how labor costs might track going forward. But just how about ensuring that you have sufficient continuity of experienced employees to meet quality and productivity goals, et cetera.
Chris Villavarayan: So when it comes to -- so I'll break the question into two parts. When it comes to our full-time employees, I would say that retention has been still quite good. And it's -- part of it, Ryan, is the, let's call it, the legacy of Meritor's 110 years of Rockwell heritage. And on average, when I look through our facilities, we have employees somewhere in that 14 to 17 years that are full time. So we've been -- we've done a great job in retaining those employees, and those employees based on the brand and the fact that they've worked with the same team and the same company have provided that level of loyalty, and we've seen very little issues on the retention side there. Specific to the temp side, the temp ratio is lower than what we have had previously. And that is, as you could imagine, the same pressures that we're experiencing in -- that the industry is experiencing. So we are -- the way we've been attempting to fix that is by, obviously, bringing down our temp ratio, and that's how we've addressed that. Overall, our full time, let's call it, retention is up running north of 96%.
Ryan Brinkman: And if just sneak a couple more in on capacity, where do you stand on capacity with all these new electrification awards? I don't know how intensive they are in terms of number of employees or square footage or whatnot, but it does seem like some of these awards might be incremental to existing business. Do you have sufficient capacity to the electrification wins that you've been securing or might you need to add capacity when was the last time that you've done something like that?
Carl Anderson: So we've actually broken up -- I'll break that into two elements. So the full powertrain where we build the PACCAR, the battery system and the axle, there, we have -- that is through our acquisition in TransPower. We have two buildings, and we're constantly looking at expanding our capacity there as we see that business growing. When it comes to our ePowertrain just the axle -- the integrated axle, here, what we are doing -- we have been able to integrate it into our manufacturing sites in North Carolina between Asheville and Forest City. So here, we feel that we have enough capacity to be able to respond to the market as we see it over the next few years.
Ryan Brinkman: And then just finally, there's so much excitement right now about last-mile delivery vans, the leverage to e-commerce, think about bright drop and some of their competitors. To what extent are Ford transit or sprinter van considered to be in the Class 5 through 7 or how positioned are you or aren't you to compete in the light commercial vehicle space? What's your interest in that portion of commercial vehicles?
Carl Anderson: Well, that's a great question. I'd love to answer that one. So when you take out -- so when you think about it, we have historically been on the heavy side. And so we started off with the 14Xe. And so if you think about Lion highly on Autocar, PACCAR, that's been the 14Xe. But the best part about our, let's call it, [indiscernible] into electrification is the wins on the medium-duty side. And so as you guys know, historically, we have had about 15% share here, and we've been winning here. So as we think about Class 7, Class 6, this is Volta, which is Hexagon, and that's where we see significant growth. And it's just been a true testament to the product that we've brought to the market right now. So we have the 14Xe that comes to Class 7 or the bottom end -- the top end of medium duty or the bottom end of heavy. And so that's what both Volta and Hexagon are using. And beyond that, we have the 12Xe that we plan to bring to the market in '23 as well as our agreement with Electric, which helps us get us into, let's call it, the top end of Class 5, Class 6 and 7. So it's not that we decided on, let's call it, a sequential strategy. We came up with parallel strategies on the medium side, and it's great to see that we're winning.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open.
Itay Michaeli: Just two follow-up financial questions for me. First, can you just touch upon what you're assuming for R&D in fiscal 2022? And then second, going back to the recovery and pricing actions, particularly for the noncontractual freight portion, how do you go about kind of modeling that? Is there sort of a percent success rate or recovery that you're assuming, just given that there might be a bit of a, I guess, an uncertain nature in terms of how those discussions may go?
Chris Villavarayan: Sure. Yes, I think on R&D, we are currently assuming about 2% R&D as a percent of sales is kind of what's in the modeling and the forecast embedded in our guidance. And then as it relates to just those discussions, whether it's freight, steel, in some cases as well because we don't always recover 100%, I think it's just -- we do build certain assumptions in there. But I would say what's happening is the pricing continues to change, and we're still seeing that kind of run up. And so those discussions are just extremely critical for us. And so at this point, we will be driving to achieve everything from all customers as it relates to the pricing actions that we need to deliver on as we go forward. And we've had some success to date. But in this rising inflationary environment, especially on some of these costs, they continue to run. So there's more work and discussions we need to have.
Itay Michaeli: Maybe a quick follow-up, Carl. I think you mentioned working capital obviously a drag with all that's been going on in the supply chain. Are you assuming a full recovery in fiscal '22? Or will there still be some additional recoveries beyond '22 just for all the recent volatility?
Carl Anderson: Yes. As we look at it, we -- as I mentioned, we had about a $70 million headwind in '21 compared to 2020 expectations. I don't know if we'll claw all the way back, but I would say we should definitely see a $50 million-plus improvement in working capital on a year-over-year basis.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for closing remarks.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you, and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cummins Inc. Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jack Kienzler, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.
Jack Kienzler: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the Third Quarter of 2021. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jen Rumsey, and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Smith. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the conference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs, and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in this slide. Deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Due during the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www. cummins.com, under the heading of Investors and Media. But with that out of the way, we will begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you, Jack and good morning. Welcome everybody. I'll start with a summary of our Third Quarter financial results and our market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Demand remains strong in the third quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions outside of China. In China, industry-wide sales of trucks and construction equipment is slowed sharply, but in line with our expectations. We remain encouraged by the economic trends in our markets, which point to strong end-user demand extending into 2022. We also continue to see orders for our products outpaced our competition as a result of their strong performance in the field. Unfortunately, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact our ability to produce and ship products, driving up costs and limiting sales growth in the short run. These supply chain constraints are impacting our OEM customers in much the same way. Before getting further into our results, I want to take a moment to highlight a couple of strategic milestones in the evolution of our next-generation products and technologies. In October, we announced that we will bring a 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks to the North American market. This engine was launched earlier this year in China and has been well-received in the market, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability this far. The 15-liter natural gas engine is an important part of our path to zero emission strategy, by offering a significant reduction in both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases in a product that's available today and utilizes existing infrastructure. Equally exciting is that this engine is designed to accept a range of gases and renewable fuels, including hydrogen in the future. In fact, all of Cummins' engine platforms are being designed with the same fuel flexibility. At the same time, we are working with Chevron and others in the energy industry to increase the availability of renewable natural gas and other renewable fuels to ensure infrastructure is in place to meet our customers needs. We also signed a letter of intent to establish a joint venture between Rush Enterprises and Cummins, which will produce Cummins branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for the commercial vehicle market in North America, combining the strengths of momentum fuel technology's compressed natural gas fuel delivery systems and Cummins powertrain expertise along with the engineering and support infrastructure of both companies. These are important steps in expanding our portfolio of Power Solutions options to help customers meet their business goals and operation objectives, while also meeting increasingly stringent emission standards and achieving our customers sustainability goals. Now, I will comment on the overall Company performance for the third quarter of 2021 and cover some of our key markets. Revenues for the third quarter of 2021 were $6 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $862 million or 14.4% compared to $876 million or 17.1% a year ago. Higher freight and logistics expenses, rising material costs and other manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ongoing supply chain challenges in our industry. More than offset the benefits of global volume in increases compared to the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, EBITDA in the third quarter of last year was helped by temporary salary reductions, which lowered our cost by approximately $90 million. Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 13% to $3.4 billion, driven by higher engine and component shipments across the heavy and medium-duty on highway markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 55,000 units, increase of 10% from 2020 levels. Cummins sold 22,000 heavy-duty engines in the same period, up 30% from 2020 levels. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 26,000 units in the third quarter, a decrease of 5% from 2020 levels, while our Cummins unit sales were 23,000, an increase of 25% in 2020. We shipped 43,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the third quarter of this year, a decrease of 2% from 2020 levels, but still a very strong quarter. Revenues for power generation grew by 2% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle, standby power, and datacenter markets. Our international revenues increased by 22% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 11% due to lower demand in the medium and heavy-duty truck markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 217,000 units, a decrease of 53% as the industry works through the national standard 5 truck inventory on hand and lower demand for newer higher-cost national standard 6 unit. Our unit sales in units, including joint ventures, were 40,000, a decrease of 49% versus the third quarter last year. Our light-duty engine sales were 33,000, a decrease of 40% driven by supply chain constraints and weaker market demand. Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter were 56,000 units, a decrease of 15% from 2020 levels. Our units in Cummins sold were 88,600 units, a decrease of 20%. Power generation sales in China increased 52% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, based on strong demand in data centers and other backup power applications. We continue to hold a market-leading position in the data center segment in China, driven by strong end-user relationships and our compelling product offerings.  Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $520 million, an increase of 76% from the third quarter of 2020. Industry truck production increased by a 120%, while our shipments increased 135% as our joint venture partner continued to gain share. Demand for power generation and construction equipment also rebounded strongly in the third quarter compared to a very low base a year ago. In our Power Systems market, industrial engine revenue increased 33% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year driven by mining in oil and gas. In Brazil, our revenues increased 26% driven by increased demand across all end markets. Now let me quickly cover our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect our revenue to be at the lower end of our guidance are up approximately 20% versus 2020. EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15%, below our previous guidance of 15.5% to 16% of sales. Our expected EBITDA margins are lower because of the persistence of the supply chain constraints and disruptions, which are now exacerbated by escalating material and freight prices. We've lowered our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 228,000 units, up 25% compared to 2020, but below our prior guidance of 264,000 units. This is again due to the supply chain constraints impacting our customers rather than a lack of end-user demand. In the medium-duty trucks market, we are decreasing our forecast for industry production to a 118,000 units, up 15% year-over-year, but below our prior guidance of 134,000 units. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be up 25% compared to 2020, an increase of 7.5% from our expectations three months ago. In China, we continue to expect domestic on-highway demand to decline from record levels a year ago. Our 2021 outlook for medium and heavy-duty truck market demand is 1.65 million units, and our 2021 outlook for light-duty trucks market is 2 million units; both unchanged from our previous guidance. We continue to expect industry sales of excavators to be flat with the record levels achieved in 2020 and unchanged from our previous guidance. In India, we anticipate industry demand for trucks to be up 75%,compared to levels experienced in 2020. And our other businesses are showing promising growth due to continued infrastructure investment, this is also unchanged from previous guidance. We now expect demand for mining engines, to increase 60% in 2021. Up from our expectation of 45% 3 months ago based on continued strength in commodity prices. We continue to expect global power generation revenue to increase 15%, primarily driven by the data-center and recreational vehicle markets. Summing up the quarter, strong demand across many of our markets drove continued sales growth in the third quarter. Despite the strong demand, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact both our operations and those of our customers, resulting in higher material and logistics costs, as well as capping revenue growth. We are working collaboratively with our customers and suppliers to navigate these challenges and position the Company for better performance in 2022. Customers are recognizing the strong performance of our products, resulting in our sales growing faster than industry demand in a number of important markets. We continue to invest in bringing new technology to our customers, outgrowing our end markets, and providing strong cash returns to our shareholders. The Company expects to return over 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2021 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Thank you for your time today and now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. There are four key takeaways from our third quarter results. End customer demand remains strong in the third quarter, driving sales growth -- strong sales growth across most end markets and businesses outside of China, where truck and construction demand has weakened in line with our expectations. Global supply chains remain constrained, impacting our industry's ability to meet strong customer demand, and resulting in higher freight, labor, and logistics expenses and rising material costs. As a result of the continued supply challenges and associated costs, we are lowering our full-year sales and profitability outlook even though underlying demand remains very strong. Finally, we'll return $345 million to shareholders through cash dividends, and share repurchases in the quarter, and a total of $1.83 billion for the first 9 months of the year consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year. Now let me go into more details on the third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, an increase of 17% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 13% and international revenues rose 22%. EBITDA was $862 million dollars or 14.4% of sales for the quarter, compared to $876 million or 17.1% of sales a year ago. As a reminder, EBITDA in Q3 last year would lose by $90 million of temporary salary reductions, and the $44 million VAT recovery in Brazil. Along with the strong demand, the key feature of our performance in Q3 was that our gross margin continues to be challenged by the supply chain constraints and elevated costs. gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.7% of sales increased by $65 million but declined as a percent of sales by 270 basis points. Global supply chain constraints continue to impact the industry's ability to meet elevated and the cost demand and have resulted in higher costs. We incurred approximately $90 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs in the third quarter. in addition to rising material costs, partially offset by increased pricing in the aftermarket. SG&A expenses increased by $38 million or 7%, and research expenses increased by $42 million or 19% from a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. As a reminder, due to the significant uncertainty the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented temporary salary reductions in April 2020, through the end of September last year. These salary reductions resulted in approximately $90 million of pre -tax savings for the Company last year and impacted gross margin and our operating expenses and impacted the comparisons of the results of all of our operating segments. Joint venture income was $94 million in the third quarter, down slightly from $98 million a year ago due primarily to weaker demand for both trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income of $32 million increased by $11 million year-over-year. Net earnings for the quarter were $534 million or $3.69 per diluted share compared to $501 million or $3.36 per share from a year ago, primarily due to a lower tax rate and a reduced share count. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.9%. Our income tax expense included favorable discrete items of $11 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $569 million dollars compared to $1.2 billion dollars a year ago. An increase in working capital led to the lower operating cash flow for this quarter. Now, let me comment on segment performance and our latest guidance for the full-year 2021. For the engine segment, third quarter revenues increased 22% from a year ago, driven by increased demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in the U.S. and Europe. EBITDA decreased from 18.1% to 15.2%, primarily driven by higher supply chain costs, lower joint venture income, and higher compensation expense, partially offset by the benefits of stronger volumes and lower warranty expense. But the full year, we've reduced our revenue guidance to be 24% at the midpoint, down 1% for the full year. We now expect EBITDA margins to be between 14.2% and 14.7% a little below our prior year guidance of 14.5% to 15% primarily due to the weaker sales on ongoing supply chain challenges. In the distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago. EBITDA increased in dollars but decreased as a percent of sales from 10.6% to 9.8% primarily due to some of the supply chain challenges but again the higher compensation costs. We have maintained our 2021 outlook for distribution segment revenues to be up 8% and increased EBITDA margins to 9.3% of sales at the midpoint of our guidance. Component segment, revenues increased 16% in the third quarter, driven primarily by stronger demand for trucks in North America. EBITDA decreased from 16.9% to 14.1% primarily due to higher supply chain costs and higher warranty expenses compared to very, very low cost of quality in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we now expect components revenue to increase 28%, lower than our prior guidance of up 32%, primarily driven by a weaker outlook in North America and slightly lower outlook for China truck. We have also lowered our forecast EBITDA margins for the segment to be at 15.5% of sales at the midpoint, down from our prior guidance of 17%, as this segment is being more hardly -- has been hit harder by the supply chain challenges and the slowdown in truck production in North America and China. In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 19% in the third quarter, driven by stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased by $33 million, and expanded by 10.3 to 11.5% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage expense. Partially offset by elevated supply chain costs. For the full year we're increasing our power systems revenue guidance to be up 22% from our prior guide of 18% growth driven primarily by a stronger outlook in the mining segment. We're also increasing our EBITDA margin forecast to be 11.5% of sales at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 11.25. In the new power segment, revenue increased $23 million, up 28% due to stronger sales of battery electric system. EBITDA losses for the quarter were $58 million as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies that we're developing. For the full year, we now project new power revenues of $120 million at the midpoint, and EBITDA losses to be in the range of $200 million. We expect total Company revenues now to grow approximately 20% at the low-end of our prior guidance. We're also lowering our EBITDA margin guidance to be approximately 15% for the full year, down from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16%. A slower pace of improvement in North American truck production and continued elevated costs associated with the global supply chain challenges were the primary drivers of the lower outlook. We expect joint venture earnings to be up 10% for this year in line with our prior [Indiscernible]. We're forecasting our full-year effective tax rate to be 21.5%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures were a $150 million in the quarter, up from a $116 million a year ago, when we continue to expect full-year capital spend of between $725-$775 million. To summarize, we faced incredibly strong demand in many of our core markets but continue to face global supply chain challenges which have impacted our cost base, and more so than we'd expected in the second half of the year. However, this end customer demand remains strong, outpacing supply in many important markets and setting us up for a strong 2022, assuming the global economy remains strong. I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless work this year to ensure that we've meet the needs of our customers while continuing to deliver solid financial results. We continue to prioritize improving our performance cycle-over-cycle, investing in technologies that will power profitable growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. Thank you for your interest today. And now let me turn it back over to Jack.
Jack Kienzler: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. And if you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.
Operator: Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, [Operator Instructions]. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Again, [Operator Instructions]. And as just previously stated, please make sure you're limiting yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our next question is come -- sorry, our first question is coming from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Stephen Volkmann: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I'll just dive in on some of these supply chain issues. Is it possible to just bucket the impact that you guys have seen? I'm thinking about price costs being a headwind, I'm thinking about logistics costs I think you gave us a number for that Mark. I'm guessing there's probably some productivity headwinds. I'm just trying to see if we can better understand exactly what you're seeing relative to these supplier interruptions.
Mark Smith: Happy to do that and good morning, Steve. So yes, we are almost 2% worse between the price we've recovered in -- well, not recovered. The price increases that we've made principally in the aftermarket this year, which has added about 70 basis points to our results. And we've lost yeah, more than 2.5 points between the premium freight, rising material costs, and inefficiencies in our operations. And that's a little bit -- that's higher obviously than when anticipated 3 months ago. We did see a reduction in premium freight from the second quarter to the third quarter, but we started to see more increase on the material cost side.
Stephen Volkmann: And Mark, is it too early? I mean, I'm assuming for 2022 year goal will be to get right with that. Or maybe even a little bit better. I don't know, any commentary you can make as we go out into '22?
Mark Smith: I will just say this continues to be a high area of focus both on our operation side and also working through this with suppliers and customers and implementing price increases.
Tom Linebarger: Hey Steve, this is Tom, the one thing that everybody is still worried about in our industry is semiconductors. It's not that things haven't improved some because they have, but it's marginal improvement. It's still a really tight supply chain, so there's a lot of issues across the supply chain, labor shortages, freight, etc. But semiconductors look like they're -- they have a longer-term capacity issue and I'd also say the freight side of things just seems like it's not quite getting better yet when you look at where containers are and what ports look like. So there's no question that, as Mark said, internally, we are working as much as we can to address our cost side inefficiencies. He talked about going out and negotiating price increases, and as you know on the material cost side, those come automatically, but we'll have to negotiate for the rest. It's just that some of these things look like they are likely to be somewhat persistent. That doesn't mean we're not hoping to improve them all. I just want to be realistic about those. There'll be some element that looks like it goes into next year too.
Stephen Volkmann: Understood. Thank you, I guess high freight costs are probably good long-term for you guys, but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. Thanks.
Operator: Yeah.
Mark Smith: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Jamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess Tom, I just wanted to get more color from you on how you're thinking about China as we head into 2022, that's an important market for you. And what, in terms of like the power shortages and outages over there, how that's impacting your business goals from a negative perspective and potentially a positive perspective over time. I -- so I guess I'll start there.
Tom Linebarger: Yeah. Let me let Jen talk a little bit about how the China market is now and how we're seeing it, and I can jump back in and see us talk about sort of longer-term things.
Jamie Cook: Okay.
Jennifer Rumsey: Hi, Jamie. As you heard from Mark, and we've been forecasting, we've seen a drop-off at the middle of the year in the China market -- on-highway market in particular, with the changeover between NS V and NS VI emission standards. So we saw inventory building up in the first half of the year and we're now seeing that coming down and getting sold in regions that are still allowing NS V product sales. And so that combined with a higher cost of the new emissions product has, as we expected, driven a drop in on-highway demand, which we expect to come back to some degree. 2020 was a record year for China though, so our expectation is that market's going to come back to be more in line with what we saw in '19 for on-highway. We are benefiting in China from additional content in the components business with new emissions requirements and also the launch of the endurance transmission now in China. So we see that benefit and we think our NS-VI products are going to performed well in the market as well and give us some upside potential. But the market overall is down. The construction market has also come down some and we are continuing to see some strength in the power gen market there. We are watching the impact of those power shortage issues in China very closely with our suppliers, it's not created a major disruption for us to this point, but it is something we continue to watch closely.
Tom Linebarger: Yeah. I would just pick up from where Jen left off, the power shortages as she said. Some impacts on production, but not a huge cost impact. But as you suggested, Jamie, we do think it helps us in the market. And as I mentioned in my remarks, our power-gen business is positioned well in China and now I look at China and I see us positioned across all of our markets. The truck side, as Jen said, we've now got -- our automatic transmissions are taking off, our content across the engines is growing. There's more consolidation in the market. So as things start to come back, I think we're better positioned we've ever been. Add to it, that we're now doing electrolyzers with a partner in China. We've got fuel-cell launches in China. So on the new power side, while things are moving slower in China than maybe and people anticipated several years ago, that's just allowed us to position ourselves to be in those markets more strongly as they take off. So again, today -- looking where I am today, I'd say our position in China has really never been stronger. So, yeah. Do I wish the market was stronger this year? Sure. But I think as it turns back down, we're able to consolidate more and strengthen our position.
Jennifer Rumsey: And we have the new N15 natural gas product launched in China as well now, and that I think positions us better for what's a fairly sizable natural gas market in China as well.
Jamie Cook: Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk to how far your order book extent today and to what degree there's risks that the order book has unfavorable pricing in it, and are you concerned about double ordering at all? Thanks.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah. I mean, at this point, the demand out there is very strong. We're seeing growing back orders in some of our businesses. And I've been out in recent couple of months talking with both OEMS and customers and there is strong demand out there that for sure is real at this point, customers are not getting all the trucks that they would like to get this year and do not believe even looking into next year, they think that there's going to be some limitations. I think that orders are strong and as Tom said, we've got some contractual pricing on metals that we'll get, as we go into next year. We've been taking pricing actions where we go direct to the market and aftermarket on PowerGen, and we're continuing to work with our OEM customers, on first-fit to negotiate pricing just in light of that cost environment we see right now.
Jamie Cook: Thank you very much.
Tom Linebarger: Thanks Jamie.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ann Duignan of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Ann Duignan: Hi. Good morning. Thank you, Just to follow up on the supply chain, a quick follow-up, please. Would you expect, the announcement that we're eliminating the European tariffs on steel and aluminum to have any impact on U.S. steel prices in 2022?
Tom Linebarger: Hi Ann I'm Tom, it's good to hear you. I really don't know because again, there are, as you know, export, I mean, sorry, import caps on that too. So how much that's going to really impact prices is unclear to me. And demand, of course, for metals is pretty high now. So the markets are pretty well-supported. In fact, our mining, you saw our mining numbers are up and that's primarily driven by metal prices. So just in the U.S., it feels to me like it's going to have moderate long-term impact. Short-term, it may provide a little bit of relief, but I would have said that given the import caps, it's probably not a big move medium or long term.
Ann Duignan: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color on that and my real question though is more fundamental. I mean, you're talking about the 15-liter engine being able to use fuels like hydrogen as their major fuel. If it's so easy to convert a 15-liter internal combustion engine to burning hydrogen, why are we investing in fuel-cells at all? If we can do it with just a new fuel injection system or some minor re-engineering of an internal combustion engine, why go down the path of the hydrogen investments or in particular fuel cells at all?
Tom Linebarger: Well, as you know, the hydrogen investments would be the same. Still we would need to generate hydrogen and, of course, we need green hydrogen in order to actually reduce the CO2 impact of the fuel. And really, hydrogen combustion is a good answer. It's just not as efficient as a fuel cell. So if you're running our long-haul heavy-duty trucks where fuel is your number one cost or power energy is, then that efficiency increase from a fuel cell is going to be worth it to you. If you have a relatively short range or you have a vocational truck, our view is maybe a hydrogen engine might work for you, especially if the conversion to fuel cell is too expensive and you're not having that many units. So our view is there's a place for both, but if you want to think what's going to really drive the transportation economy 20 years -- 15 years from now, you're going to need the efficiency that a fuel cell, especially with an electric system, is going to provide. So our feeling still as fuel sales win, for the majority of the trucking industry, but we -- hydrogen engines are a real addition to the portfolio of products that are -- can be available across our markets.
Jennifer Rumsey: And there's a time factor too, as you can imagine. As fuel cells advanced and costs come down, and maybe there are period of time where hydrogen engines are having an economic advantage, but as Tom said over time costs come down, that efficiency benefit for customers that are really driven strictly by total costs on ownership. May -- we think will drive a shift toward fuel cell and applications like Line Haul.
Ann Duignan: Okay, I'll take mine more engineering relented questions offline and then
Jennifer Rumsey: You have a lot of them. I'm going to be Jamie to be
Tom Linebarger: Ann [Indiscernible]
Jennifer Rumsey: Ann, I'm going to be happy to have a longer conversation --
Ann Duignan: I'm over-simplifying just simple fuel injection system re-engineering.
Jennifer Rumsey: Exactly, I think taken 30 Second on it, we're designing this platform that the physical hardware for flexibility is exactly as you said, this fuel system and some other components differences and then the tuning. Of course, the calibration and control of the engine is different based on the fuel, but we're able to leverage some of that manufacturing and engineering investment in a common platform.
Ann Duignan: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue. Appreciate that.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you, Ann.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Tse of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Tim Tse: Thank you. Good morning. The question really is just hoping you could give some help in terms of how we should think about the relationship between heavy and medium-duty engine sales for Cummins versus Industry truck production, both in the fourth quarter and then as we get into '22. I'm just thinking about how you out pacing the industry as your OEM customers deal with all these red-tag trucks. How should we think about that, again, relationship? Obviously, a global impact or maybe just thinking about the heavy-duty segment here in the near term.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes, there's a couple of dynamics. So of course, we've added some additional OEM customers. So when you think about our sales through OEMS and medium-duty and heavy-duty. And you saw -- you heard some of the numbers around how much of the total market we're seeing with Cummins engine. So we feel really well-positioned, our products are performing well, there's a lot of end-user pull and we've seen good position in the market. The dynamic that is happening in the fourth quarter, in most cases, we have been able to work through the supply constraints and continue to supply to our OEM customers and have not, in most cases, been the reason they've not been able to build trucks.  So as they take down some of their build rate, stabilize their production and complete these trucks that they build short of some components. We have seen some reduction in demand on the engine itself as they're working to really stabilize and get to more efficient build rates to make sure they are building with what supply and inventory they have and level that out. So that is impacting that in the fourth quarter and in part why we adjusted our revenue guidance.
Mark Smith: What I would add Tim is what we see is our products are performing incredibly well. We see it in our financials with very positive results on cost of quality and overall strong sense of enthusiasm for the products that we're putting in the market. Invariably, you're going to get some volatility quarter-to-quarter, as we always do, but we feel really good about the position of our products in the market. I think that's the message when you step back and when we're done with this year and and we look at the message you want you to leave with, and, of course, we're optimistic about picking up more business over time.
Tim Tse: Got it. And then Mark just on the margin impact in components. Obviously, a lot of metals and platinum and palladium and etc. used there, and I know there's always a time lag. Is there a way to think about the margin impact this year that's effectively a timing gap that you get the presume the -- presuming things stabilize, which maybe is a wrong assumption, but is there a way to think about what is more of a short-term impact that gets reversed next year or is it too hard to piece that part?
Mark Smith: If I just step back because there's a lot of noise year-over-year because some of the actions we took last year, the boosted results for us to step back from the noise of the numbers. I'll come back to that in a moment. Really, we're wrestling with three issues in that business that are somewhat different than we'd anticipated 3 or 6 months ago. Number one, for the production in North America has not picked up in the second half of the year, if anything, it's drifted down a little bit. And we were counting on that in our guidance. So we think underlying demand supports are robust environment for next year, and that should take care of itself. Number 2, whilst we anticipated a sharp drop in the second half of the year in China and that's playing out largely as we've expected. This business is doing a major product transition for NS-5 to NS-6. And in variable when we start with the launch of new products, will below optimal scale, demand is still pretty light for NS-6 so as we ramp up, we'd expect margins to recover. The bigger challenge, or the more, naughty challenges the rise in supply chain costs, which is really what we've seen when in the first half of the year we saw OEMS principally, availability impacting our operations, supply chain and the engine business. We've seen that spread more to more electrical components. And what's happened is the components business has picked up more cost and efficiency. So that one's not you were working
Mark Smith: through all that. Yes, we got the metal costs, we got the normal contractual adjustments around that. But it's that focus on the supply chain and the other actions that we talked about at the start of the call that we're focused on here. But I just wanted to try and simplify the message. There's a lot of noise out there. I'll just say one other thing just -- you didn't ask me, just clear up some noise I hear. Whilst -- in the explanations, we mentioned higher product coverage costs in this segment, it's compared to an extraordinarily low number last year. There's no big charge for product coverage or warranty in the segments. I just wanted to clear that up for other listeners. Thank you.
Tim Tse: Got it. All right. Thanks for the time, Mark.
Mark Smith: Cheers, Tim. Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Tom Linebarger: Hi, Jerry.
Jennifer Rumsey: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Tom, you folks target structural improvements in the business every cycle and I'm wondering as you look at the supply chain challenges that the entire industry face here, how are you folks thinking about potential changes in the way you manage inventories or the way you manage the supply chain going forward? Is there an opportunity to reduce some of the volatility by meaningfully increasing inventories given where cost of debt is, etc.? wondering how you're thinking about positioning comments coming out of this pretty complex environment we're facing here.
Tom Linebarger: Jerry, it's a terrific question, and as you can imagine, it's been on my mind for a while. We did -- early in the pandemic we did do some structural reform. I think we talked about on some previous calls trying to say, hey, well, the market's down, let's make sure that we get our capacity rightsize and I think we did some good work early on on that. But with the supply chain challenges, we've also seen a bunch of new problems that we weren't seeing before. You highlighted some of them. Do we have enough inventory in the right places? Are we outsourced in places we should be insourced? And then of course with trade challenges between countries, are we relying too much on cross-border trade. So all those things now are in our strategy looking forward about how we want to reposition our supply chain. So today what we're doing is trying to get our costs down, trying to get our production up to meet customer demand, and trying to keep our supply chain people at work. when it's -- they're basically working 24/7. It's been really, really rough, so I would just say that the strategic elements, while we're doing a lot of work and analysis on them, there's no question that we've taken a backseat to try to keep operations going in the last couple of quarters. But those issues are first and foremost, for us and the leadership team, thinking about how we want to position. And I will just say this, broadly speaking, what we're thinking about is we do need to reposition what we outsourced and what we in-source for the future, partly because of some of the supply chain challenges we've seen here, but also because the industry is likely to consolidate further. And we need to make sure that we can be the reliable supplier that we need to be for our customers. So we will be looking at that and thinking through where the right way to position ourselves in different supply chains is, but I think you've hit on a key point that there will be some optimization that will be helpful to us, both from a cost and reliability point-of-view overtime.
Jerry Revich: Terrific. On a separate note, I'm wondering if you could talk about the outlook for your electrification opportunities in off-highway markets, obviously a pretty fragmented supplier base in terms of other engine systems in the market now. How do you see that as an opportunity set for comments and are there significant major new product milestones that we should look forward to as you folks electrify the off-highway offerings?
Tom Linebarger: As you said, off highway is more fragmented and generally speaking, conversations are a phase behind on highway in battery electric power trains, but they are common. As you'd guess, every major off highway producers trying to figure out what their long-term strategy is from carbon point of view and sustainability point of view. We are having conversations with many of them. In all cases, I think the battery electric conversation, it is at a high level strategically as the same thing. All of them need a solution. All of them want to figure out when is the costs -- the total cost of ownership for end-users work out and it generally doesn't today unless you're in a publicly financed application. If you're in a train or a bus or a ferry, okay. If you're in a commercially viable thing, it doesn't quite work out yet, but the numbers as you know are changing quickly, but it still doesn't work out. So they are trying to figure out how to position themselves for when it does work out, who they partner with, and how. And today, most of those partnership conversations are pushed out because there's not a viable offering to make today, nor is there a way to get to a viable offering within technologies and the costs as they are now. So everyone's looking forward trying to figure out what does it look like. Off-highway, I believe, strategically, will be in the same challenge that they're in today. Not enough volume to justify a special one, but very specific needs to their application. And our view is that Cummins will be well-positioned because we will have products and on-highway which will give us volume and scale and then we will have an understanding of their application and how to adapt the technologies most effectively to off-highway so that we'll represent a good partner to them, and as you guessed, that sort of the pitch I'm making to them now that we'd be the right partner for them in battery electric as we are with engines.
Jerry Revich: I appreciate the discussion. Thanks.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Noah Kaye: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom, I wonder if you could kind of update us on how the naturaliser pipeline is developing. I think we've seen some of the companies in the industry just a really robust demand growth since the start of the year. And if you can also comment, obviously it's not set in stone, but there appear to be some pretty healthy incentives for nitrogen production in the reconciliational provision. So just wondering if you'd comment on potential impact of that outgrow the business?
Tom Linebarger: Yeah. He thinks -- no I appreciate your question and the answer is, we have continued to see backlog growth in the electrolyzer business, and I'd say the big strategic move we wanted to make was to add some bigger projects to the backlog and those conversations have been going much better in a backlog. I think last time we checked with 60 megawatts or something quite a good backlog, some newer larger projects which were exciting to add in there. And of course the problem with larger projects, they take longer to get together, and more likely delays in funding, but that's where the market's going. We need to have those big ones, so it was good to see some of those come into backlog. and I would just say that the interest in electrolyzers is still quite strong. As you mentioned, the bill -- the Build Back Better Plan has some incentives in there for producing hydrogen, especially low -- carbon-free ammonia. We think that's going to be a good use of electrolyzers in the early phase of electrolyzers. We see it in Europe where there's a carbon price already. We see it in some fertilizer-related projects and it's an area where there's a lot of carbon used in fertilizer through gray hydrogen and making that hydrogen green is a way -- there's already demand calculations about how to get cost. Equivalency are pretty straightforward. They're not easy, they take some funding and they take some incentives, which is why you see those in the bill. But once you do the calculations, you can see how you can get there, so I do expect that to be one of the markets that's likely to move more quickly, especially if those incentives make it through into law. I do think it will promote the green hydrogen -- green nitrogen, I guess the green ammonia business pretty quickly in the U.S.
Noah Kaye: Thanks. And then just on a different topic, wonder if we could get any update on the filtration business, particularly in light of the comments made earlier about some of the operational changes or realignment from a high level that you're planning. Where you at in terms of exploring the alternatives for that business?
Mark Smith: Hi Noah, this is Mark. Yes, we continue to make progress in pursuing the alternatives for that business. Our plans are unchanged and you should expect an update in the new year as we continue that work. Will be no -- I don't anticipate any significant change in the remaining three months. But an update in the new year and the direction and the enthusiasm for that process remains unchecked. And I will just say the performance of that business has also been very strong this year that. It's embedded within the components business, but the business continues to do very well.
Noah Kaye: Yes. Thanks very much, Mark.
Mark Smith: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Elkott of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Matt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. So guys, in the U.S., we're looking at significant upcycles in truck production as well as construction and mining equipment. As these upcycles begin to unfold, are there opportunities for you guys to increase the percentage of your engines with your customers, both on-highway and off-highway? And if I take it a bit longer term, are there opportunities for potentially gaining new customers who may currently be fully integrated?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, great question. We are constantly working to make sure that we have the most competitive engine in the market that drives end-user pull and grows our position in the market and also ensuring that we have capacity to meet OEM s' needs through strong cycles. And we continue to have conversations. You've seen announcements around the partnerships with Isuzu, with Hino, with Dymo. We're continuing to have those conversations with customers that may not offer Cummins engines today to introduce those in the future. So we expect that those opportunities will continue over time.
Matt Elkott: So generally, during an OEM cyclical production up-cycle, does the vertical integration usually go up or down for the OEMS?
Tom Linebarger: Matt, it depends, but at the very top of the market, generally speaking, our penetration goes up a little bit because they run out of capacity if they use both, if they have both their own demand and ours. But again, generally is not a good indicator for a given quarter and as Mark was saying earlier, quarter-to-quarter variation is pretty high because they may have backlogs. In this case, they may have unfinished trucks with more of their engine. So just quarter-to-quarter, it's hard to see. What's more is because of the supply chain challenges, right now, OEM truck production is capped by suppliers. So we're not anywhere near the maximum production of the industry today. I mean, we hope to be based on what engine users demand, but we're not. We're in an area where they can produce more if they could get more parts. So I think we're not really near the spot that you're asking about in terms of industry production.
Matt Elkott: Got it. Next [Indiscernible] Tom and then just one follow-up question on the natural gas engine. In the U.S. it's very small. I think it's -- you guys produce about 10,000 engines and you dominate the market. With the 15-liter engine, can you talk about the growth opportunity and when you could see it unfold? I mean, is it going to be a meaningful opportunity next year or is this more longer-term?
Jennifer Rumsey: Yes. So the plan -- we've announced that we're bringing this N15 natural gas engine that we have in production in China now into the U.S. market by '24. So we're couple of years out from offering that product. As I've talked to end customers, they are very excited about this product and in particular, as they pursue their own goals for carbon reduction. In the coming years, they see natural gas as a great way to meet those, including using renewable natural gas. So we expect some upside opportunities as we bring that new platform into the market and also some growing interest yo natural gas in the market.
Mark Smith: Which again should boost our share given our position in natural gas, yeah.
Matt Elkott: Thank you very much.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. You guys touched on pricing earlier, could you remind us maybe just give a quick recap overview of how pricing works on engine platforms. Is that the only one where you have constraints on what price that includes material costs, escalators, but not freight maybe if I understand right. And then, what portion of the mix do you then have to go after things like freight on?
Tom Linebarger: Broadly speaking, Rob, the way it works is that we have OEM long-term agreements with large customers for engines and the major components. That's the sort of sectors where you'll see some of those long-term agreements. The benefit of those, of course, is that we can count on continued customer orders over a period of time over phase of production of trucks and engines. And the pricing arrangements in those for the most part, again, they're -- each one's a little different, but the general deal is it on basic material costs. There's an escalator or a pass-through, and on the rest, you need to negotiate if you want to make a change. Doesn't mean you can't negotiate, just means you have to negotiate with your partner. And then on generator sets and aftermarket where we go directly to retail customers, then we only have what's on the order book as what's what you can -- you can't price on. So as Mark and Jen said, we -- this year, we priced in the aftermarket. Early in the year, we priced in the aftermarket again. In the middle of the year, and we always are looking back at that to see if we should do more. And then gen sets we also move pricing right away. And then now what we're doing is talking with all of our OEM customers about the fact that we've had these escalators, not just freight, by the way, freight, logistics, material costs, special shipments as a result of delays in semiconductors, and other products that we want to recover from them, and we're in negotiations with them now.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Tom, thinking about an overview on -- you touched on it earlier on semiconductors. Do you have a sense on when you think the industry be in better shape and what does Cummins doing specifically I'd love your re-qualifying supplier, qualifying new suppliers, redesigning chips, etc, before the industry gets better? I'll stop there, thanks.
Jennifer Rumsey: Yeah, I will comment on that one. So it's something we've been working really closely throughout the year and we've started to see some improvement quarter-over-quarter since the middle of the year and supply of microprocessors for most of our components that we've seen some growing disruption on other electrical components. That has become a bigger issue for us in the second half of the year. And we have also in parallel been working and I think we'll revisit inventory strategies as we are able to build inventory. Not today in the current very constrained environment. And we're also looking at, sourcing strategy and doing dual-sourcing back all the way to a tier 3 level to make sure we've got more flexibility in the future.
Tom Linebarger: And Rob, the thing we really needed in the U.S of course, as we need, we need domestic semiconductor production that's targeted at the automotive industry. That's -- I mean, that's -- I don't mean to be pie in the sky about it, but strategically, it's kind of a nightmare that we only have -- all those semiconductor wafers are coming from pretty much one factory or one set of factories in Taiwan, and that we're a very small part of that Company's output. That's not the ideal situation for a supply chain. So if you ever said, hey, what's the strategic plan? The strategic plan has to be defined semiconductor manufacturers who think the automotive industry is more critical to their success and ideally to have some closer to shore onshore so that we can look at the total capacity and demand, because right now most automotive -- most trucks and buses are adding a significant portion of electronics. Each revolution or each time that their new product ramps come out, they add 30% more chips or sensors or something, and that's not the way the industry semiconductor -- the capacity of the semiconductors is moving. So we need to add more capacity and we need to add it -- target it at those customers.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
Jack Kienzler: Thank you, Tom. And thank you, everybody. I believe that concludes our teleconference today. As always, thank you to everybody for your continued interest in Cummins and for joining today. I will be available for questions after the call. Thank you again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast and enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-05-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q2 2021 Meritor Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Todd Chirillo, the Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please, go ahead, sir. 
Todd Chirillo: Thank you, Felicia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. On the call today we have Chris Villavarayan, CEO and President; and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor Inc. It's protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the express written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to slide two for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris. 
Chris Villavarayan: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to slide three. We had strong results this quarter, with $983 million in sales and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%. Total company sales were up 13% year-over-year, as truck demand increased in all our global markets. Free cash flow performance was excellent this quarter, coming in at $47 million. This was one of our highest second quarter cash flows since we began the implants in 2013. Once again, the Meritor team demonstrated its ability to successfully respond to markets. Even with the sharp increase in volumes and supply chain challenges, we maintain excellent delivery and quality performance for our customers, while converting increased sales to profits at expected levels. Looking at the full fiscal year, we're holding our sales, margin and cash flow guidance, despite indications that we will have one of the largest unfavorable steel impacts we have seen, in addition to higher expense in electric powertrain development, as we ramp up production capabilities to meet the increasing demand. Carl will provide more detail, but our ability to offset these headwinds reflects the consistent strong execution you expect from us. We have a brand-new electrification program to announce this quarter, in addition to an exciting new opportunity to accelerate development of our 17Xe electric powertrain in Europe. And in our core business, we have recently finalized long-term agreements with two global OE customers. Please move to slide four. In the second quarter, we extended our agreement with Navistar through 2026. We are pleased to continue our long-standing relationship with Navistar, as it becomes part of the Traton family. This agreement extends our current relationship, while providing opportunity for future growth in our major product categories of axles, brakes and drivelines. We also completed a new agreement with IVECO in Europe through 2024. This includes the supply of single reduction axles and strengthens our successful business relationship between our companies. It also provides the opportunity for future growth on other product lines. With Navistar and IVECO complete, most of our long-term agreements with major customers have been renewed well past the 2022 time frame. Moving to electrification on slide 5. We are pleased to announce a new collaboration with Hexagon Purus Systems, a global leader in zero emission e-mobility. Hexagon will integrate Meritor's 14Xe powertrain into its Class 6, Class 7 box trucks and Class 8 6x4 vehicles starting 2021. Customers, including PACCAR, AutoCar, line electric Volta trucks and Hexagon have chosen Meritor's 14Xe integrated electric powertrain. We believe this is market validation of its industry-leading performance. In early 2020, we announced an agreement with PACCAR to be the initial launch partner and supplier for the integration of the fully functional battery electric systems on the Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt 579 and 520 electric vehicles. We have begun prototype production and PACCAR is performing validation testing on its test tracks. It's very exciting for us to see these fully electric vehicles being assembled. Soon these and many others with Meritor's preferred electric powertrain solutions will be fully operational on roads and highways. Please take a minute to view a video of this truck in motion on meritor.com. This footage was shot last week, at our Escondido California facility. With market adoption growing for our 14Xe, we're now shifting the focus to the development of the 17Xe platform in Europe. Last month, we learnt we were a grant recipient of the advanced propulsion center in the United Kingdom. This grant will partially fund the development of Meritor 17Xe. After a comprehensive months-long nomination and consideration process, we were thrilled to be selected along with our consortium partners Danfoss Editron and Electra Commercial Vehicles. This grant totaling almost £16 million will rapidly accelerate development of this product, that is designed for multiple vehicle platforms and extend our ability to offer Meritor's e-powertrain solutions for the European market. We believe demand for this product will grow because of the EU 2025 CO2 reduction targets. Stricter targets will start applying in 2030 and by 2040 all new trucks sold in Europe will need to be fossil-free to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The 17Xe is another significant step towards completing our electric powertrain portfolio. Carl, will now provide details on our financial results.
Carl Anderson: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our second quarter financial results and provide an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. As Chris mentioned at the beginning of the call, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.3%, and we generated $47 million of free cash flow. Now, let's review our financial results compared to the prior year on slide 6. Before I continue, I want to highlight a revision we are making to our presentation of two non-GAAP measures, adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share. To better align with SEC guidance, we will no longer include in non-GAAP measures the adjustment for non-cash tax expense related to the use of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions with net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits. It is important to note, this is a change to our reporting metrics only as the underlying availability and benefit of tax attributes to offset future taxable income has not changed. We expect to maintain an effective cash tax rate of approximately 15% through the M2022 planning cycle. In the appendix, we have also updated prior periods to reflect this change providing for consistent comparatives. Now let's review the details of our financial results. Beginning with the total company, revenue came in at $983 million, up $112 million from the same period last year. As economies rebounded globally, we saw increased truck production in all of our markets. Net income from continuing operations was $63 million, compared to $240 million last year. As a reminder, prior year results include $203 million of after-tax income related to the termination of the distribution arrangement we had with WABCO. This was partially offset by the recognition of value-added tax credits in our wholly owned Brazilian entity of $22 million or $15 million net of tax during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $111 million, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%, a decrease of 100 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA this quarter excludes the $22 million Brazil value-added tax credit I previously mentioned. The decrease in margin was primarily driven by an approximately $20 million impact from incentive compensation cost compared to the prior period. Keep in mind, last year we significantly reduced our incentive compensation accrual at the onset of the pandemic. Additionally, we experienced higher freight costs as compared to a year ago. This higher expense was offset by cost reduction actions executed in the second half of last year. Overall, we were pleased with our margin performance, especially given some of these cost headwinds. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up $0.04 from last year. And free cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $47 million. Last year we generated $292 million of free cash flow, which included $265 million related to our distribution agreement termination. If you adjust for the one-time impact from last year, free cash flow improved $20 million year-over-year. Based on our market outlook and expectations on cash flow generation going forward, we are in a position to return to a more normalized level of cash on our balance sheet. We therefore are announcing the redemption of the remaining 6.25% notes due in 2024. The $175 million principal balance will be redeemed at the call price of just over 101%, utilizing available cash on hand, which was $321 million at the end of the second quarter. Our objective of maintaining BB credit metrics through market cycles was reinforced this past year, as we were able to successfully manage through the onset of the pandemic. Upon completion of the debt repurchase, our gross debt balances will be similar to where we were pre-COVID. We were also on track for net leverage to be approximately two times this year and plan for a further step down in 2022. Now let's look at our segment results compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck increased by 23%, driven by higher global truck production in all markets. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $73 million, up $15 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 9.4%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue and by cost reductions actions executed last year. This was partially offset by higher incentive compensation and freight costs. Aftermarket and industrial sales were $247 million in the second quarter, down $30 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by the termination of our distribution arrangement, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.  Segment adjusted EBITDA was down $12 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 13.8%. The decreases were driven primarily by the impact from the termination of our distribution arrangement and increased incentive compensation costs, partially offset by cost reduction actions.  Before I review our current global market outlook on slide 7, I want to provide an update on supply chain constraints in the markets we are closely monitoring. Global supply chains, primarily for semiconductors have become constrained during this global production upturn. This has affected many global manufacturing industries including commercial trucks. We are seeing some impact to production schedules as a result.  In India, the current wave of the pandemic is having a significant impact on the country, which could affect the ability of our OE customers and suppliers to manufacture in the short run. Demand however, remains high in all of our markets. In particular, order activity in the North America Class 8 market continues to be robust averaging over 40,000 units per month in our fiscal second quarter and cancellation rates remain very low.  Overall, as we assess all of the pluses and minuses, we are keeping our global production outlook unchanged as we balance strong global demand with potential supply chain constraints.  Let's turn to slide 8 for an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Consistent with our market assumptions, we are holding forecasted sales to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.8 billion unchanged from our prior forecast. We are also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance steady at an expected range of 10.6% to 10.8%. We are however seeing steel costs continue to increase. Since September hot-rolled coil prices have increased more than 130% and scrap prices are up nearly 100%.  The price movement in steel has been the most severe and rapid increase we have seen over the past 10 years. As a result, we now anticipate a full year headwind of $25 million to $30 million in higher steel costs up $10 million from our prior review. Most of this impact will be felt in our third fiscal quarter as prices begin to reset with our steel suppliers.  While this is a significant headwind in 2021, we do a pass-through mechanism in place with our customers, which are typically on a three- to six-month lag. We expect to see most of this recovery beginning in early fiscal year in 2022.  Additionally, we are increasing our electrification spend between $5 million to $10 million from our prior guidance as we continue to respond to this growing opportunity. While we are experiencing these higher costs, we expect to be able to offset most of these increases through continued operational performance. Our purchasing team has done an excellent job in driving material performance savings and we continue to see the benefits from cost reduction actions executed last year.  Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is now in the range of $2.15 to $2.30. This reflects the impact from the adjustment for non-cash taxes as well as the lower interest expense expected from the bond redemption. Our effective cash tax rate of approximately 15% in fiscal 2021 remains unchanged.  And finally, we are maintaining our expectation to generate between $110 million to $125 million of free cash flow. Overall, the team is doing a fantastic job, managing through the challenges of the strong global rebound and deliver a solid glide path to M2022.  Now I will turn the call back over to Chris. 
Chris Villavarayan: Thanks, Carl. Let's turn to slide 9. While it is difficult to schedule events with certainty, we're planning to hold our Analyst Day in person this year in New York. More details will be provided in the coming months. At that time we will present M2025. We will move of course -- we will of course closely monitor the situation as we move closer to this date to ensure we can meet safely. Before we close I would like to express our concern for the serious situation occurring in India as the pandemic worsens. Our team in the region has taken actions to help employees and the community through care centers, vaccination and mobile testing facilities and we plan to do more. Our thoughts are with our colleagues and their families during this crisis. Again, I want to thank you for joining us today to review Meritor's second quarter results and welcome any questions you may have at this time. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of James Picariello of KeyBanc. 
James Picariello: Hey, good morning.
Chris Villavarayan: Good morning, James.
James Picariello: Just within the company's reiterated guide for the year, you're now anticipating what was I think referred to as record commodity inflation in the back half, right not surprisingly, but can you help quantify what the net headwind exposure is relative to what will likely flow through within your recovery mechanism just to get a sense of that net exposure? 
Carl Anderson: Sure. James, it's Carl. As it relates to steel prices, which is the really primary driver for us we do expect it to be year-over-year about $25 million to $30 million headwind in fiscal 2021. So if you think about the recovery mechanisms as that begins to kind of flow through that will come through really beginning in fiscal -- the first part of fiscal 2022. And so of that we would expect to be recovering around probably $20 million of that number as we go forward. 
James Picariello: Okay. No that's really helpful. Just from an industry standpoint focusing on the North American market for a second, I mean again from an industry standpoint we're trying to get near record order levels. This year the industry backlogs are also going to be at or close to all-time highs. Are you seeing anything unique in terms of builds build commitments build slot commitments for next year at this point? It just seems as that's where we're going to be especially given the temporary chip shortage impacts which I think are also proving to be more muted. Just seems like we're on track for a really, really strong volumes next year. 
Chris Villavarayan: For sure, James. I'll take that. So when you think about it it's beyond the last three months. If you look at it it's the last six months. Order intake has come in at 40 or above 40. And to your point, backlogs are passing I think, I believe 300,000. And for our fiscal year right now the midpoint with the recent change is -- it's 285000 for the fiscal between ACT and FTR. And if you look at the midpoint for next year for the heavy market, it's at about 340. So to your point great highs and you got to believe the Texas storms resolved, as well as the fire in Japan. So the chip shortage will get resolved here shortly or will improve shortly. We do believe there is impact through the next couple of quarters, but it eventually should improve. So again we believe there's a strong 2022 ahead of us as well. 
James Picariello: Got it. If I could just squeeze one more in. Within the aftermarket and industrial segment this quarter's -- the second quarter's margins was there anything within that related to the timing of price increases or excess of premium freight? Just any color on that segment's margins? 
Carl Anderson: Yes, James, it was really just driven by a couple of factors. One was, we did see some higher freight costs in the second quarter, as well as a little bit higher cost from steel that affected the aftermarket business.
James Picariello: Thanks.
Carl Anderson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets.
Joseph Spak: Thank you. Appreciate it. So I think just to maybe sort of to get a little better sense for some of the costs you talked about Carl in the back half, I think, if we look at the guidance it still implies on a year-over-year basis about 20% incrementals. But I think that seems to be maybe some of the base period in the map, because is it fair to assume that sequentially we should see maybe decrementals a little bit higher than normal given some of the headwinds and then as you can start to get some of those recovery mechanisms back next year that reverts?
Carl Anderson: I think that's the right way to think about it Joe. If you look at the six months EBITDA margin performance to-date, we're right around 11.4%. So if you think what our guide is of 10.6% to 10.8% that does imply the second half margins will be about 10% on roughly the same type of revenue.
Joseph Spak: Right. Right. Okay. Thank you for that. Just a bigger picture question on electrification. I know you have to --you're up in the spend again here. In the past when you've talked about that it's really sort of been to support programs that you think are sooner rather than later. So maybe if you could just sort of confirm again if that increase of 5% to 10% is for that. And then somewhat related on electrification, can you talk at all about your ability to attach other Meritor products like maybe disc brakes, for instance, like when you get eAxle limbs like is there a pretty high attach rate for Meritor when you're able to do that?
Carl Anderson: Absolutely Joe, but I'll start with the first question. First, I think, glad to see the backlog continuing to grow. As you remember, we talked about having this $500 million target for electrification as our revenue pipeline. We accomplished $400 million of that with the -- at the last quarter. And so with this announcement with Hexagon, we've taken a chunk of that. So we continue to see the growth. And to put it in perspective of spend, if you go back to 2019, we spent about $12 million. Last year we spent $21 million, and this year we're moving it up to $35 million to $40 million. So we're almost doubling it per year, and it's primarily because of the wins and it's essentially application and testing of our products as it wins with more customers. To your second question, the ability to attach components, absolutely, we do see a path with brakes -- as primarily with brakes with many of the customers as an opportunity to grow business as well. 
Joseph Spak: But when you up your electrification backlog, I mean, those associated products I am assuming are not in that. So is it fair to assume the other side of your backlog is being benefited too by the electrification wins?
Carl Anderson: It is on, let's call it, everybody that is, let's call it, new entrants coming into the market. So when you think about the new entrants, we have a significant share of the existing traditional business. So it is on the new business, but you also have to take into account when you think about electrification always remember it's five times and up to five times content on a 14Xe, for example. So, we're already seeing that growth as well.
Joseph Spak: Okay. Carl maybe just a quick one on -- thanks for the color on the tax rate and sort of the change in guidance. I think you used to sort of point to mid-teens with the way you sort of adjusted. So, should we model something more like 20% in the outer years now given the change?
Chris Villavarayan: Well, I think it's -- Joe to that point, it's 15% definitely through 2022. I think once you start getting past 2022 you got to 2023 and 2024; it could begin to moderately step up. So, you're probably not too far off with that assumption.
Joseph Spak: Okay. Thanks very much.
Chris Villavarayan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. 
Ben Fung: Hi, good morning. This is Ben Fung form JPMorgan for Ryan. I just have two questions. The first one is what is your view on the impact of higher labor cost to margin and production start to come back? And on the same note, how are you seeing freight cost progressing through the rest of the year? I know that someone in the aftermarket last week said something about the freight cost could be two or three times higher than they're seeing right now. So, how much impact to margin do you expect this headwind? And what are some factors that can be used to offset the impact? Thank you.
Chris Villavarayan: Absolutely. So, let me start with the first question specific to labor. It's a red hot market out there as you could see with the first question. There's significant drive and demand for the product. And I think it's running right through the economy GDPB being strong and consumer spending. So, in essence, we were able to drive that -- some of that recovery is specific to that with some of our customers. However, on top of that, it's really about operational performance. It's driving incremental operational performance whether it's labor and burden in how we look at our lines or whether it's how we look at material opportunities. So, that's how we drive that savings to offset labor. Specific to freight, we're seeing about three times more freight in terms of cost to your point whether it's on ocean or internal as well. And for those elements what we are again doing is trying to offset a lot of that with -- sorry with material performance and operational performance. But on top of that we also look at working with our customers as well.
Ben Fung: And I'm sorry to ask. So, this is pretty cost and everything already factored in the guidance, right?
Carl Anderson: Yes, it is. Yes. And to add to what Chris said, as we look at just overall freight costs in our first quarter, we did experience probably higher premium costs associated with the rapid increase in production that we saw in the first quarter. But the -- what we're seeing is kind of just the basic run rate with cost today is all factored into our guidance.
Ben Fung: Thank you. Very helpful. And my second question is on the RV business. So, the RV demand has been very strong in the last few months and just this morning an RV dealer up their adjusted EBITDA guidance materially. Can you talk about the opportunity for growth in this area of the business? And I think last quarter you mentioned something about independent suspension. With wheels and motors for RVs? And if you can please just give any update on that? Thank you.
Carl Anderson: Absolutely. So, the industrial specialty and off-highway markets are incredibly important for us. This is why we did the AxleTech and Fabco acquisitions two years ago. And so we are seeing the fruits of those acquisitions as we think through 2022 and our -- as we look at our revenue pipeline growth. When we think about the core business and as we have talked about exceeding our revenue targets for 2022, a lot of it is coming in our industrial Defense & Specialty business and a lot of it is driven by this. So we are seeing that growth. Again last quarter we talked about developing an independent suspension for this market. And it is going into production this year and it will be in run-rate next year. And then second is we're also developing a similar system on the electric side. So we're looking at an electric platform that requires to accomplish us the same thing as well for the RV space.
Ben Fung: Thank you very much for taking my question.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel.
Matt Milask: Hey good morning, this is Matt Milask on for Bruce Chan.
Chris Villavarayan: Good morning Matt.
Matt Milask: Morning. With regards to higher freight costs, you mentioned one of the mitigating things that you're doing is working with customers. Any additional color we can get around there and how those conversations might be going?
Carl Anderson: Sure. I think when we -- at this point, we are working with customers that we have agreements in certain regions. And as you could imagine, they are hard agreements and they take a while to work through. And it's a discussion that we are working through and we are seeing the benefits in some areas.
Matt Milask: Thanks a lot.
Chris Villavarayan: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi.
Itay Michaeli: Good morning everybody. Just two quick ones for me. First just a little bit of housekeeping on CapEx. I mean, it looks like it's still running maybe below the full year. And I think the original plan for the cumulative CapEx through 2022 was about $475 million. Just curious whether you're seeing efficiency there if that's just some timing?
Carl Anderson: Good morning Itay. It's more timing. For the first six months, we had about $25 million of CapEx. We are planning for about $70 million of CapEx in the last six months of the year. So part of it was production came back pretty quickly as you recall in our first fiscal quarter. And I think some of the programs we are just beginning to ramp back up here this quarter as well as in the fourth quarter for us.
Itay Michaeli: Great. That's helpful color. And just -- I think you addressed it to the prior questions, but just as we think about that bridge from the second half margins to the 2022 target, I think you mentioned some of the recoveries on steel. But can you just maybe walk us through some of the bigger puts and takes in terms of what -- at least some of the headwinds that you're facing today that are contractually going to reverse next year particularly on the other steel side?
Chris Villavarayan: Yeah. Itay, the biggest thing we're seeing when you really boil it down is really on steel. So as I referenced that $25 million to $30 million headwind is really a second-half story for us. So while freight costs what we've talked about are -- have increased and are elevated from what they have been historically our material performance and some of our operational performance items have been able to offset that. So the true story is steel. And if you were to simply adjust for this deal of $25 million to $30 million; our margins would be very similar to what they are here in the first and second quarter.
Itay Michaeli: Got it. Perfect. That’s real helpful. Thanks.
Chris Villavarayan: Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. And I'll turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo.
Todd Chirillo: Great. Thank you, and thank you everyone for joining our call today. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-02-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the first quarter, 2021 Meritor Inc. earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference to one of your speakers today, Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investors. Sir, please go ahead.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; Chris Villavarayan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; all of whom will be available for questions following the call. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc. It's protected by U.S. and international copyright law, and may not be rebroadcast without the express written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3. As you can see from our results this quarter, we're off to a tremendous start for the year. I want to thank Meritor employees for the excellent performance. Regardless of the environment, this team exceeds expectations, as demonstrated last year, and right out of the gate, in fiscal 2021. Our Class 8 truck orders from North America, our largest market, rose to the fourth and fifth highest months in history, in November and December. We executed it exceedingly well, as you will hear from Chris and Carl. In fact, with truck volumes materially rising in almost all our end markets, we are raising our full year outlook significantly.  Since 2021 rebound provides us with increased confidence and a clear path to 2022 objectives, particularly because we believe that some of this year's headwinds, will become tailwinds next year, as we complete our current M-plans. At the same time, we're investing in the revolutionary technologies we are bringing to market. These technologies will give commercial vehicle OEMS, optimal solutions to meet regional CO2 reduction targets, and will also provide a host of other benefits.  At this point, I will turn the call over to Chris, for highlights for the quarter, and come back later for closing comments. 
Chris Villavarayan: Thanks, Jake. We're obviously pleased with our results this quarter. On revenue that was essentially flat year-over -year, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 60 basis points higher than the same period last year, and free cash flow was up significantly. Carl will give you more details on the financials in just a moment, but the primary takeaway is that we're optimistic about the demand for commercial vehicles throughout the remainder of fiscal 2021.  We expect significantly higher volumes than most markets, as most economies deploy fiscal and monetary stimuli, the vaccine rollout gains momentum, and the demand for goods increases, particularly in North America. On the right half of this slide, we highlight business wins this quarter. You will remember that last November, we said we expected to exceed our M2022 new business target of 300 million. We're going to talk about some of those contracts that are driving that outperformance in our truck and industrial businesses, as well as production awards for our electric powertrain.  Moving to Slide 4, you will see a few examples of customers with whom we have recently secured new business on a variety of applications. In India, we have additional axle contracts with Ashok Leyland and Daimler India, for medium and heavy duty vehicle. We now have standard position with Terex for front and rear drive axles and brakes on concrete mixers. We will supply an existing customer with independent front suspensions for recreational vehicles, and we have entered a new three-year LTA with John Deere for 100% of its applicator axles. Transitioning to electrification, Slide 5 gives you a look at additional contracts we’ve secured for our ePowertrain. As mentioned last quarter, we believe we'll be the first supplier to manufacture electric ePowertrains for Class 8 trucks. These new contracts reflect the application flexibility we’ve designed into our electric powertrain portfolio, and the growing demand for Meritor’s solution. The ePowertrain is an integrated product, engineered to allow for a variety of subsystems, including axle, transmission, motors, wheel ends, and brakes, to function as one efficient system.  We have entered into a five-year agreement to supply Meritor’s 14Xe electric powertrains for Autocar’s refuse vehicle. With Lion Electric, a Canadian manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles, we signed a three-year agreement to supply our heavy duty tandem electric powertrain for Lion’s AT tractor. And we’ve also secured a three-year contract with Volta Trucks in London. Meritor’s 14Xe will be equipped on the Volta Zero, a full land 16-tonne commercial vehicle designed for inner city parcel and freight distribution. We expect revenues from all these contracts to ramp up in 2023. With the industry recognition we have already received for this product, the growing number of production contracts, we are highly confident that Meritor’s electric powertrain represents game-changing technology for commercial vehicles.  Carl will now provide more detail on our financial results.
Carl Anderson: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our first quarter financial results, discuss the upturn we are seeing in most of our global markets, and provide an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Overall, as you heard from Chris, we delivered strong financial performance in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5%, and we generated $34 million of free cash flow.  Now, let me provide the details of our financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 6. Beginning with total company results, revenue came in at $889 million, roughly flat from the same period last year. Net income from continuing operations was $32 million, compared to $39 million in the prior year. Lower net income was primarily the result of higher interest expense, which included $8 million of debt extinguishment costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. This was partially offset by cost reduction actions executed in the second half of last year.  Additionally, joint venture earnings increased $5 million from a year ago. This was driven primarily from a $6 million one-time gain recognized from our joint venture in Brazil relating to a value added tax credit. Overall, this drove adjusted EBITDA of $102 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2021, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%, a 50 basis point increase from the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.60, down slightly from $0.64 last year. And free cash flow improved by $69 million from a year ago, as we saw a tailwind from our back stream programs, and we had $32 million in lower incentive compensation payments in the quarter. Now, let's look at our segment results compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck increased by 4% to $691 million. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by slightly higher market bounds in Europe and India. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $63 million, up $6 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 9.1%, an increase of 50 basis points over the prior year.  The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue, cost reduction actions executed last year, and higher joint venture earnings. This was partially offset by higher freight premiums, and a $6 million increase in electrification spend, as compared to last year. Aftermarket industrial sales were $234 million in the first quarter, down $41 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As we saw last quarter, even with lower revenue, segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 15%. The increase was driven by cost reduction actions executed last year, which more than offset the impact from lower revenue.  I'll review our current global market outlook on Slide 7. In the North America Class 8 market, we are now projecting production levels between 270,000 to 290,000 units, a nearly 20% increase at the midpoint from our prior outlook. We have seen a full quarter of strong order intakes, including two months of orders greater than 50,000 units. And just last night, January preliminary orders came in at over 42,000 units. This aligns with the strong production forecast we are seeing from our customers, all pointing to a significant production recovery in 2021. Turning to Europe, we're also seeing a steady increase in this market. We now forecast production will be in the range of 360,000 to 380,000 units. South America is another market where we are experiencing a strong rebound. We are now forecasting production to be in the range of 135,000 to 145,000 units, almost a 50% increase at the mid-point from our prior outlook. At these levels, it would be the strongest Class 8 production year since 2014. And in India, we are maintaining our previous forecast of 230,000 to 250,000 units. Keep in mind, this still represents an increase of approximately 80% year-over -year from historically low volumes in 2020. Let’s turn to Slide 8 for an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Given the market assumptions we just reviewed, we are now forecasting sales to be in the range of 3.65 billion to 3.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.8%, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance. With the upturn, we are encountering several headwinds which will impact earnings conversions as we move through 2021. Increasing demand across the global economy is driving significant increases in steel, our largest material cost.  While we have cost recovery mechanisms in place with most of our OE customers, they generally are on a three to six month lag. As a result, we are currently seeing $15 million to $20 million in higher steel costs in fiscal 2021, due to the timing impact of these cost recovery mechanisms. Additionally, at the significantly higher market levels, we are anticipating higher incentive compensation costs of approximately $15 million. With these headwinds, we now anticipate earnings conversion of approximately 19% on incremental revenue, compared to last year. Overall, if you were to adjust for these two items, our conversion on the incremental revenue would be around 22 to 23%, more in line with our expectations. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is now the range of $2.25 and $2.50. And finally, we expect to generate $110 million to $125 million of free cash flow.  On Slide 9, I want to provide an update to our path for achieving the company's M2022 margin target of 12.5%. As we have seen in prior M-plans, the steps for achieving our targets may change, but we typically are able to adjust to the current operating environment and deliver on our targets. The 12.5% margin target is no exception. As we discussed on the previous slide, we are seeing increased costs related to both steel and incentive compensation in 2021. Next year, we do expect these costs to normalize, providing a 60 to 80 basis point tailwind. We also anticipate converting on incremental volume and new business wins at greater than 20%.  Additionally, as we announced last quarter, we are in the process of executing a footprint optimization plan, which will result in the consolidation of four locations into existing facilities. This will provide an additional tailwind of $12 million to $15 million, as $5 million of cost to execute the consolidation in 2021, will be behind us, and approximately $7 million to $10 million of savings from the smaller footprint, will be realized. The conversion on increased revenue and the footprint optimization, are expected to provide an additional 90 to 130 basis points of incremental margin next year. Overall, the path to achieving our 12.5% margin target remains clear.  Before I turn the call back over to Jay, I want to take a moment to express my deepest appreciation for his extraordinary leadership he's shown through his many years at Meritor. On both a personal and professional level, I wish Jay all the best, and look forward to working with him in his new role. Now, I will turn the call over to Jay for final remarks. 
Jay Craig: Thanks, Carl. Let’s turn to Slide 10. With this being my last call with you, I wanted to make a few comments before we go to questions. My first earnings call with Meritor was in the second quarter of 2008, and except for a few quarters in 2013, and ‘14, when I was running the business, I have not missed one. So, I guess that puts me somewhere close to 50 calls. While in charge and all CEOs and CFOs look forward to them, I can honestly say, I always did. Our investors and analysts, many of whom have been with us a long time, always drove us to be better, and challenged us to look at the business from different perspectives. Your insight, comments, and questions, contributed to the successful transformation of the company over the past several years. As I transition to the role of Executive Chairman, I have full confidence in Chris's ability and that of his leadership team, to maintain the trajectory of high performance that we have demonstrated for quite a long time now. Growing our base business, expanding our electrification capabilities, and maintaining excellent levels of operating performance, will continue to be the highest priority, as we remain focused on returning value to shareholders. As we near the successful completion of our third M-plan, we recognize the discipline and execution that it took to become the company we are today, and we'll proceed with the same diligence. For this, I want to thank all our employees around the globe that have helped us achieve the enormous stretch targets we have set for ourselves. I will miss working day to day with such a diverse, talented and driven team.  I also want to thank our Board of Directors for their support and guidance. We have a strong board with a diverse set of strengths, that has played an important role in the company's journey. I look forward to continuing to work with them as Executive Chairman. I wish all of you my best in the future. And with that, we will take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from the line of James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
James Picariello: Hey, good morning guys. And Jay, congratulations again on your retirement. It's been a pleasure. Within your FY’21 guidance here, can you just talk about what the implied incrementals are, what the additional EV related spend might be? And then, Carl, you did mention color on incrementals to FY’22. I mean, can you just talk about those incrementals, how we get to that targeted 12.5% for FY’22 within that framework? Thanks.
Carl Anderson: Good morning, James. Yes, as it relates to fiscal ’21, as I referenced, we do expect all in, to have about 19% conversion on the incremental revenue that we're seeing. We are faced with a couple of headwinds, and I referenced both steel and incentive compensation, but with - and as it relates to electrification. In the quarter, we did at $6 million of higher electrification spend compared to a year ago. We are also probably tracking closer to the $30 million of electrification expense within fiscal year ‘21 as well. So overall, as we look forward, we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver and get close to that 20% kind of incremental margins for fiscal 21, but more importantly, it really is - as I laid out, we're definitely on track to deliver on our ‘22 target.
James Picariello: Got it. The 30 million electrification spend, that's cumulative, right? That would be like an incremental $10 million or so, is that right?
Carl Anderson: Yes. It's about 7 million to 8 million higher than we did a year ago.
James Picariello: Got it. And then can you just - I mean, maybe I just missed this, but can you provide an update on what the number is in terms of EV awards that are booked, and then what the - is the pipeline potential, that 200 million, has that changed at all? And just maybe talk about what the latest two - the last two awards, what is a highly competitive process. Thanks.
Chris Villavarayan: James, it's Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that question. So what we talked about is a line of sight for $500 million, of which, with the announcements we've made today with booked business to $400 million. And we still have our line of sight for the last $100 million to the targets that we had provided earlier. And then talking about the three agreements that we announced today with Lion Electric Volta, and Autocar, that accounts for a total of $200 million of booked up business in total. We're not breaking that out by year.
James Picariello: Understood. Thanks guys. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Ryan Brinkman: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me?
Jay Craig: Yes, we can.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay, great. Thanks. Given the mention on Slide 4 of exposure to the RV market via front suspensions and the record wholesale shipment numbers that have been coming out of the recreational vehicle industry association lately, I just wanted to ask about what your revenue exposure is to this area, what kind of growth you might be seeing. Are you primarily benefiting from the increase in industry volumes, or are you also in any way incrementally targeting that market with new products, et cetera? And also since you last reported earnings, I think we heard the very first announcements relative to the potential for electrification in the RV space, which came from Lordstown Motors and Camping World in December. Do you have any thoughts on electrification in this corner of the market and what role that Meritor could potentially play?
Chris Villavarayan: Sure. Ryan, it’s Chris Villavarayan. I'll start the question and then maybe hand it over to Carl to just provide some of the financials. But very quickly, with the acquisition of AxleTech, obviously this has been a very important market. And so, as part of M2022, we also had a strategy to grow in this market. And so, what we're doing is exactly executing on that strategy. The new win is part of a growth strategy and is not associated with the current market growth. So we had a plan to grow this business, and that's exactly what we're doing.  Specific to electrification, we are looking at, let's call it independent suspensions with Wieland Motors, but that is something that we're exploring a little bit further. With that, I'm going to turn it to Carl.
Carl Anderson: Ryan, that business kind of resides in our industrial segment. And if I look at what we're seeing in that, especially entering into ‘21 in total, we do now see our industrial business up on a high single digit percent on a year-over-year basis at this point.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay. Very good. Thank you. And then just last question, relative to the electrification opportunities that were identified on Slide 5, I'm curious if the potential pipeline has maybe grown. And I'd be interested too, if you have any thoughts on GM's new BrightDrop plans, and whether that automaker’s relatively greater vertical integration of electrified drive line components in the light vehicle side, might or might not translate into similar vertical integration on the commercial vehicle side. Also, just what you're seeing generally in terms of the latest developments with regard to commercial vehicle manufacturers’ plans to either insource or outsource the types of electrification components that you're able to provide.
Chris Villavarayan: Well, I'll take that question, Ryan. Just maybe first perspective, from a broad spectrum, when we look at the three customer awards that we presented today, Autocar, a nameplate that's been around for 125 - 123 years. And then if you look at Volta, it's a brand new entrant, and Lion’s been in the market for about 10 years. So it's great to see that from a broad spectrum of customers, they see the value in Meritor’s product. Now, specific to where we see this growth, we do see - the first thing that we're focused on is obviously completing our pipeline. And to that point, we’re testing with a multitude of OEs right now around the globe. So hopefully we can talk about more wins here, but right now, we're targeting - targeted on closing out on our $500 million book of business that we talk about. Specific to the GM, and let's call it the skateboard, I think when you look at - the best part about it is, in terms of whether you look at OEs integrating this, the best part of electrification is in any sense, I think what it does is, it drives competition, and it will speed us faster towards sustainable energy. And in any sense, as we look at the real estate we have, it just means more content for us, no matter what happens. And in that sense, our perspective is that as long as we're in this space, this will continue to grow for us. 
Jay Craig: Yes. And I’d say, Ryan - this is Jay. One last comment. There’s always been a significant difference between the commercial vehicle and the light vehicle OEs and the level of vertical integration of components. So we've obviously had a significant share of the drive train market across the EV industry, and we expect that to continue into the future, based on the discussions that we're having so far moving to electrification.
Ryan Brinkman: Very helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Joseph Spak: Thank you very much, and wanted to echo my congratulations to Jay again, and then obviously the rest of the team. Back on electrification, a couple of questions here. You mentioned a bunch of these startups. There’s obviously a lot more we've seen trying to come to market than on this page. Like how - can you just talk to us a little bit about how you approach the opportunity? Because obviously, they’re sort of all incremental, but it does require you guys to commit resources and capital and the exact path of some of these ventures is maybe a little bit unclear. So how do you think - you almost have to be a little bit of a VC in that respect, right? So how do you think about sort of approaching the opportunity with some of these startups?
Chris Villavarayan: So, Joe, I'll take that question. And I think the perspective that we use, if we look at the Class 8, let's call it the medium and the heavy duty Class 8 market, and we look at, what is the percentage of electrification, and we aim for that, or a percentage - a fair share of that. And in essence, work with every OE that is approaching that space and provide our product. But in overall in how we capacitize, we're looking at what we believe will be the model of what roles will be there in electrification as a percentage of the overall market.
Joseph Spak: Okay. So it's not necessarily - you don't necessarily view it as sort of like a bet on any one of these individual companies, because the product is somewhat fungible between them?
Chris Villavarayan: Yes. I think, Joe, to that point, I think it’s - for us, it’s more about the product as far as all the development, all of the testing that we have done and kind of how that stands. And I do think, as we think about how that fits in with whether a couple of the startups with existing customers and obviously the large OE customers we have today, that is kind of the focus. And we do believe our product is a differentiator, and that will - is really kind of the path to market for us across all of these potential opportunities.
Joseph Spak: Okay. So, maybe then just to follow up, or two quick follow ups on that. Like, one, can you talk about the range of activities on electrification, like from - like either whole e-axles or components and how that might vary with different potential customers? And I guess also, we touched a little bit on the EV spend, but it seems like that might need to continue to sort of move higher, especially if the new wins continue to move higher. So, wanted to get some thoughts on that and when you might sort of get to a breakeven, or sort of self-funding level on the investment,
Jay Craig: Well, let me start off. And just following on Carl's comments, if you look at the three announcements today, they're all based off the 14Xe powertrain. So it's the perfect example of using the same product and making - as you called it, fungible across the three OEs. So that's one perspective that we're using. On top of that, when we - the announcement we made with PACCAR, the last one for a full EV kit, that includes the PCARs, the battery system, as well as the electric powertrain, or the 14Xe tandem. With that, I'll turn it over to Carl.
Carl Anderson: Yes, Joe, as we look at it, we're not chasing all the various startups. We’re really just focused on what's fitting our product portfolio. So that's kind of one of the first lens that we look through. And as Chris just discussed, we are - we both have the kit side, as well as the 14Xe and the axle side, and 17Xe in the future. And as we look forward, our expectation is, when it kind of flips to profitability, it’s probably outside the ‘22 time horizon, but as we see it now, that that can come potentially as early as in 2023, depending on what we're seeing in the market at that time. 
Joseph Spak: Okay. Maybe I could just sneak one more. I thought I heard you mentioned some additional optimization and restructuring. I’m just curious if you could provide a little bit more details on that because, right, the team - you guys mentioned sort of early on, it seems like the markets are moving in your favor, sort of going more up than down. So I just wanted to better understand that.
Chris Villavarayan: Yes. So nothing was new. This was just - we didn't talk about this last quarter as well. So we just helped to try to frame what the impact we will see in ‘22 as a result from these optimization plans. So in total, we are expecting, as you kind of compare ‘22 to ‘21, it's probably somewhere about $13 million to $15 million of tailwind, if we think about EBITDA as we enter ’22, once we're fully are - complete these facility closures. 
Joseph Spak: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And our next question does come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brian Johnson: Good morning, and want to echo congratulations to Jay, who I'm sure will still be helpful on the strategic direction. I think I've been at probably 95% of those calls since then. So in terms of the 14Xe and these interesting wins, just when I thought I knew every electric bus and truck company out there, you find another one. But the question is, can you just remind - a few things. One, just remind us of the content opportunity, obviously not your price list. But if you think about an electric urban truck like Volta is talking about, with the 14Xe axle versus if you did one for one of your traditional OEMs, the type of content you might have.
Jay Craig: Sure. Brian, I'll take that. And first of all, Brian, it's about five times in terms of content of our traditional vehicle platform. 
Brian Johnson: And then, we’re certainly well aware of Dana, the competitor sort of in that space, then they focus more on medium duty. A question we get though is, given Cummins, EDEN, Allison, are also very important Class 5 to 7 and Class 8 suppliers, how do your - what do you see from those powertrain buyers coming over into the electric truck and bus marketplace?
Jay Craig: Well, I think, the one thing is, as I look at it, and as I mentioned that competition and obviously is something that will make us all better and drive towards electrification and drive the products to be better across the whole spectrum. But specific to our products, I think the one great thing is, we're going to be first to production here in the summer of this year. We have over 100 vehicles on path.  And in that sense, if you look at our product, I think the best part about it is the fact that it's fully integrated. You have a motor integrated with an axle, integrated with the wheel end, and that’s - the sense of what we're putting together, that's only about 100 to 150 pounds heavier than a standard axle. So if you put that in perspective, you're removing an engine and a transmission and shrink - then shrinking it into that space.
Brian Johnson: Right. And given the high margins we've seen in the transmission space, one way to think about is you're basically taking both engine and transmission content and margin, and bringing it over to Meritor. Is that a fair generalization?
Chris Villavarayan: Well, that’s - as you said, maybe the best way to answer that, Brian, is we …
Carl Anderson: Yes, I think, Brian, I would say, over the last six years, we've seen that margin move up, not only cost reductions, but from all the new products we've introduced, taken out the traditional side. And I would say, our expectations for the electric products are no different. We’ll be introducing products we think have more concepts and higher margin.
Brian Johnson: Okay. And then kind of a follow on question, which is kind of, as you look at these specs and the new entrants, most of them are kind of pre-revenue. How do you - I know you sort of answered this question earlier, how do you get comfortable that it's actually worth your time? And I guess the second one is, with some of the larger fleet and larger Class 8 manufacturers, how would you - if someone doesn't go with a startup truck operator, but wants to go with a player provider, how are you positioned there?
Jay Craig: Well, again, I think we're focused on the product, and let's call it the weight class. So when we come in, we're looking at it as, what does the 14Xe powertrain cover? And we think about it as the Class 8 line hall space, or just down to a medium duty, the top end of a Class 7 space. And we're taking a product and positioning it where it can go across, whether it's to a new entrant, or to a company that's been well entrenched and a customer of Meritor for many, many years. So - and there's perfect examples of both ends of that spectrum, even in our announcements in the last two quarters, whether it's Autocar and PACCAR on one side, or Lion and Volta on the other side.
Brian Johnson: Okay. And final question. You didn't have your trademark analyst day at a hotel this year. But we are both coming up on the successor to Meritor ‘22, as well as starts to kind of kicking the tires again, so to speak, or the axles, on some of your products - e-products, is going to be interesting. Do you have any thoughts about an event later in the year that would bring those two important things together?
Chris Villavarayan: We do, Brian. And I think, just as you have experienced with Jay, we've in essence, always done - started preparing for the release of it a year in advance. And so, we're in the process of developing our M2025 strategy. And ideally, we'd like to have it with all of you in-person, probably at the end of the year or worst case, let's call it at the beginning of next year. But that's our goal right now, is to drive for the end of this year.
Brian Johnson: Okay. Thank you. Look forward to that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Itay Michaeli: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two follow-up financial questions, first on the M2022 revenue target that you expect to exceed. Hoping you can just update us, remind us of the latest end market assumptions, particularly relative to the original end market assumptions behind the $4 billion of revenue target. And then secondly, just on free cash flow conversion, I think last quarter, you were still talking about 75%. Just curious if there's any change to next year's free cash conversion outlook.
Carl Anderson: Okay. Good morning, Itay. As it relates to - maybe I’ll answer the free cash flow first, yes, no change in our planning assumptions for ’22. We still expect to drive and achieve the 75% free cash flow conversion. I think in the short term, in ‘21, I think every cash flow is cutting a high 50% - just about 70% as we are expanding a little bit of our CapEx spend this year by about $10 million, which is one of the drivers to that. As relating to the end market assumptions, we're not updating them today, but what we did say back in November, we were still planning for replacement demand market levels in North America and Europe, primarily in 2022. And it's something that, just based off the strength of the market that we're seeing here in ’21, we will be taking a closer look at that once again as we kind of get later out this year and provide a further update as we kind of get into ‘22. 
Itay Michaeli: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Bruce Chan: Gents, good morning, and congratulations. Maybe want to wax a little bit more philosophical here for a second. I think a lot of investors have been drawing comparisons this freight cycle with the last great cycle, which is maybe natural, except that the wavelength this time around has obviously been very compressed. And I'm wondering, as you talk to your customers on the commercial vehicle side, especially what your perception is in terms of where we are in the cycle inning-wise. And then maybe just a little bit more broadly, with the continued growth in the EV opportunity, how do you think about cyclicality in your business going forward?
Chris Villavarayan: Sure. Let me - Bruce, I'll take that question. So when - in terms of the market, obviously going back probably fall of last year, not too many of us could have predicted this return. However, as we looked at the last November, December, 40s and supplies, truck order intakes, and then with January at 42,000, in essence what we're seeing from our customers is, all of them are cautiously raising line rates up, primarily focused on three things. One is COVID. The second one is looking at the impact of the supply chains. And then the final one is also being mindful of finding folks to be able to staff up the shifts.  So - but with that, what we're seeing right now is, the backend or the mid to backend of this is, line rates are starting to come back up with most of our customers. So that's one perspective. And specific to electrification, I think it's a very fair question. I think when you think about electrification, the cyclicality should come out because of - you think about a growth that is much more muted as the growth goes through. I think we'll see far less cyclicality. So I hope that's helpful.
Bruce Chan: It is. Great. I appreciate the time.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Chirillo for any further remarks.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you for joining Meritor’s first quarter earnings call. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you, and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-11-12 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q4 and Full Year 2020 Meritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Todd Chirillo : Thank you, Jewel. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Villavarayan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, all of whom will be available for questions following the call. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc. It's protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the expressed written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Before we review our results, I would like to take a moment to address the leadership transition plan we announced last week. After nearly 6 years as CEO, I will transition to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board on February 28. At that time, Chris Villavarayan, our Chief Operating Officer, has been selected to succeed me as Meritor's next CEO and President. Additionally, Bill Newlin, our current Chairman, will become the lead Director of the Board. Since I assumed the CEO position, we have made great strides through execution of our M2016, M2019 and now our M2022 plans. We have advanced our innovation and product portfolio, strengthened our financial foundation and created a collaborative and diverse organization that fosters growth. M2022 is well underway and we are seeing signs of recovery in our business and industry since the onset of COVID-19, which I'll touch upon more later. That said, we believe now is the ideal time to set in motion our long-term succession plan. Many of you know Chris, who has been lit Meritor for more than 2 decades and is an integral member of our leadership team. He has had a significant impact on our company during his tenure, and this transition represents a natural next step. On a personal note, Chris has been a true partner to me, helping to execute our successful and plans. In the months ahead, I will continue to lead Meritor and work closely with Chris as we prepare for a smooth transition. Now let's turn to our results on Slide 3. Obviously, our fourth quarter and full year results were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes due to the pandemic. However, we were able to partly offset the impact on our margin for the quarter and for the year, with the cost-reduction actions we implemented in the second half. Carl will give you more detail on the results, but the important takeaway here is the extent to which we are able to preserve our financial stability, considering the significance of the headwind created by COVID-19. As you see in the center of the slide, we're able to execute well on an approximate 50% increase in sales sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth, with a conversion rate of 22%. All things considered, we recovered from the crisis exceptionally well. We took aggressive actions to protect the company financially, and most importantly, we took immediate steps to protect our employees while it worked. While certain countries and states where we have operations are experiencing rising case counts, we remain fully operational globally with no limitations at this time. Let's turn to Slide 4. While the pandemic required a great deal of management attention in 2020, we still had many achievements that support all aspects of M2022. Our safety, quality and delivery metrics were excellent. With regard to safety, the total recordable case rate was 0.57 per 200,000 hours worked with more than 50% of our facilities reporting 0 recordables for the year. We believe this makes us one of the safest global manufacturers in the world. This speaks volumes for our team's commitment to each other and is certainly one of the accomplishments I am most proud of during my tenure. We are honored to receive Daimler's coveted Global Supplier Award this year for providing more than 1 million axles, brakes and drive lines, with excellent quality and parts per million rates during the peak 2019 North American market. In addition, we are able to repurchase 10.4 million shares in fiscal 2020, were added to the S&P 600 SmallCap Index and announced 4 footprint actions, 3 in the United States and 1 in Europe. We expect these actions to generate annual run rate savings of approximately $10 million and give us added confidence to achieving our M2022 objectives. In July, we celebrated production of our 100 millionth remanufactured brake shoe. With nearly 50% of remanufactured brake shoe production in North America, Meritor is the industry leader. We continue to win new business with important customers and later in the discussion, Carl will review our expected outperformance against the M2022 new business target. And finally, we received approval from our Board for an incremental $30 million to industrialize medium and heavy applications for our ePowertrain portfolio, more on that in a moment. On Slide 5, you will see additional detail related to the long-term agreement we signed with Daimler. This is an important contract for us that extends our relationship with Daimler through 2027 and will now put Meritor in standard position for air disc brakes on the Freightliner Cascadia through 2025. Let's look at Slide 6 for an update on electrification. Essentially, the takeaway here is that we will be in production with our electric powertrain in 2021. The picture on this slide was taken recently at our EE powertrain assembly operation. We are very excited that we are only months away from delivering under the contract we secured with PACCAR for its heavy-duty electric trucks. In advance of production, the 14Xe is already receiving industry acclaim. Earlier this year, we told you we were recognized as a 2020 PACEpilot Honoree by Automotive News for our Blue Horizon electrification solutions. And recently, Meritor received the Diesel Progress Achievement of the Year and Electric Application of the Year awards. We believe we will be the first supplier to begin production of electric powertrains for Class 8 electric vehicles, and we anticipate additional production contracts in 2021. Let's go to the next slide. As you know, customers have numerous electric drivetrain solutions to consider. We are often asked about the remote mount architecture versus the electric powertrain. Meritor's electric powertrain is revolutionary and that we are taking an electric motor and a multi-speed transmission and integrating them into the carrier. We are not just bolting on a motor. This design is fully integrated and designed to maximize efficiency, performance, weight savings and space utilization. By partnering with the leading motor technology companies in the world, we have designed the electric motor from the ground up to meet and exceed customer expectations and performance targets. And since this technology is based on Meritor's traditional 14X axle design manufacturing is easier, and OEMs can integrate it into existing chassis using the same mounting locations and hardware. Although we are prepared to deliver e-optimized axles for remote mount solutions, Meritor's class-leading integrated powertrain architecture is beginning to be the product of choice within the commercial vehicle industry. We believe we've developed the most advanced electric powertrain for medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles in the industry and that it will be game-changing. On this slide, we have provided the hotlink to meritor.com, where you can get an inside look at the e powertrain production at our plants in addition to a video that shows the differences between the architectures I described. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carl.
Carl Anderson: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results, provide fiscal year 2021 outlook and provide an update on our M2022 financial goals. Now let's walk through our financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 8. First, I will review our segment results for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck decreased by just over $200 million year-over-year. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower volumes in most markets due to COVID-19. While volumes were down year-over-year, we did see production increase throughout the quarter as we began to recover from the shutdowns earlier in the year. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $24 million, down $48 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 4.3%, down 500 basis points from a year ago. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily by lower market volumes. In addition, we increased our electrification spend by $6 million compared to last year. This was partially offset by cost-reduction actions primarily executed in the second half of the year, lower incentive compensation and operational performance. Aftermarket industrial sales were $226 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, down 22% compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower volumes in our North America aftermarket specialty and defense businesses. Aftermarket sales were also negatively impacted by $36 million due to the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. While revenues were lower, segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 15% from 14.2% in the prior year. The margin increase was driven by cost-reduction actions, lower incentive compensation and operational performance, which more than offset lower volume. For the full year, revenue came in just north of $3 billion, down 31% from the same period last year. The revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower market volumes across our segments due to COVID-19. Net income from continuing operations attributable to the company was $244 million compared to $290 million in the prior year. We did incur $27 million of restructuring expense in 2020 due to the headcount reduction programs executed throughout the year. This was partially offset by $203 million of after-tax income associated with the termination of the company's distribution arrangement in fiscal year 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $272 million in fiscal year 2020, translating to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.9%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.12, down from $3.82 in the prior year. Finally, free cash flow is $180 million in 2020. This does include the benefit of $265 million in cash received from the termination of the distribution arrangement. Excluding this impact, free cash flow was negative $85 million for the full year. Keep in mind, this includes the impact from our factoring programs that were down $77 million this year due primarily from lower European revenue. As markets begin to recover, this will be a tailwind for free cash flow as we move forward. Next, I'll review our key balance sheet metrics on Slide 9. We ended the fiscal year with a strong liquidity position of over $1 billion, which is up almost $200 million from last year. Our cash on hand is $315 million, which is more than we typically hold. Given the current environment, we believe it is prudent to run higher cash balances at this time. Our funded status and our pension plans also significantly improved, and we are now in a net global overfunding status on our plans. It is important to note that we achieved this milestone without any cash contributions over the past several years. Our long-term liability driven investment strategy and strong asset returns drove the increase in the funding status. Moving to our debt maturity profile. We have no significant maturities for the next 3 years. We recently called the remaining $23 million of 7.875% convertible debt which upon completion will reduce both our outstanding debt and the share dilution associated with its convertible instrument. Furthermore, our 2024 bonds are currently callable, which provides further flexibility to be opportunistic in managing our debt profile. Additionally, while our leverage is expected to be above our target range in the near term, we do expect to deploy capital to begin to pay down debt in the second half of 2021. Next, I'll review our current global market outlook on Slide 10. You will notice we are giving market ranges wider than our typical guidance. While most global markets point to recovery in 2021, we are prudently planning for a variety of scenarios. In the North America Class 8 market, we are projecting production levels between 215,000 to 255,000 units. We have seen an increase in orders over the last several months, which could point to the upper end of the range. At the same time, some of this recent activity could prove to be transitory given the changing conditions associated with the virus. As we look at our other markets, we anticipate Europe will be in the range of 300,000 to 350,000 units. In addition to the new restrictions currently being imposed in certain European countries, we are also closely monitoring Brexit as we move throughout 2021. For India, we are projecting the market will increase at the midpoint by approximately 80% year-over-year from historically low volumes in 2020. India was not only severely impacted by the pandemic last year, but also from the transition to the BS-VI emission standard. In the South American market, we expect production in a range of 90,000 to 100,000 units, reflecting relatively stable levels as compared to last year. Let's turn to Slide 11 for our fiscal 2021 outlook. Given the market assumptions we just reviewed, we are forecasting sales to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.35 billion. Our revenue guidance does include approximately $75 million in lower aftermarket revenue from the termination of our distribution arrangement with WABCO. However, this is expected to be more than offset by over $100 million of new business wins that we will expect to be in the P&L this year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 9.2% to 10.2%. We anticipate converting a greater than 20% on increased volumes and new business wins due to continued performance and net cost reductions we executed in 2020, which will more than offset higher expected incentive compensation this year. We expect to convert at these levels even while we continue to invest in electrification, which we anticipate at $25 million to $30 million, which is higher than what we spent in 2020. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is in the range of $1.10 to $1.75. Keep in mind, our expected adjusted earnings per share is negatively impacted by about $0.15 over 2020 due to higher expected interest expense as a result of the liquidity actions we executed in June. And finally, we expect to generate $60 million to $100 million of free cash flow, resulting in a conversion rate of 75%, consistent with our M2022 target. Next, I will provide you an update on our progress towards our M2022 targets beginning with new business wins on Slide 12. Our current expectation for fiscal year 2022 is we will exceed our target of $300 million of new business wins by more than $150 million. Several key developments are driving this outperformance. Our acquisition of AxleTech, which provides diversification from our linehaul markets is expected to provide between $175 million to $200 million of revenue in 2022. Additionally, we have been able to win new business in both our commercial truck and aftermarket industrial segments. We are winning new business in every market we serve and across our product portfolio, including in air disc brakes, drivelines and specialty axles for off-highway and defense. And as we go into production with our 14Xe electric powertrain in 2021, we expect revenue will continue to expand in this growing business for us. Now let's turn to the remaining financial targets on the next page. We are confident in our path for achieving a 12.5% adjusted EBITDA margin by converting on incremental revenue from global markets and new business wins at greater than 20%. We expect to deliver strong operational performance from reduced material costs, structural cost savings, footprint optimization and further investments to drive automation and efficiency. We also are on track to meet our free cash flow conversion target of 75%, driven by disciplined and focused working capital management. Our cumulative free cash flow generation for the M2022 3-year plan is coming in lower, however, than our original assumptions due to the pandemic. As a result, this is impacting the amount of future share repurchase activity and our ability to deliver the $4 EPS target. However, we still expect to achieve earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.60, even with these headwinds. Overall, we are on track to achieve or exceed 3 out of the 4 of our M2022 financial targets. Now I will turn the call back over to Jay for some closing remarks.
Jay Craig : Thanks, Carl. Now let's turn to Slide 14. As you heard today, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and exceptional execution. We earned new business, manage costs aggressively and extended relationships with important customers. And we are now preparing to begin the next step in our transition from prototype to production of the next-generation powertrain. We look forward to our continued journey in fiscal 2021. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital.
James Picariello: Jay, congrats on the decision. And Chris, of course, congrats to you as well.
Jay Craig: Thanks a lot, Jim.
James Picariello: Just on the key bridge items to FY '21 EBITDA, what are the incremental permanent savings you expect to achieve this upcoming year? And to what extent does the unwind of this past year's temporary cost actions present a headwind or an offset?
Carl Anderson: Yes. James, it's Carl. On the run rate savings we expect to achieve from the reductions we executed last year, it's about $30 million. And if you look at the impact that we had in 2020, we had about $20 million to $23 million associated with just kind of the temporary salary reductions. And we also had a benefit from some of the headcount actions that we took in the last quarter of the year. So run rate, $30 million as we go forward. In addition, this year, we also have some other more temporary discretion cost reductions that we are planning for as well, which is about $10 million.
James Picariello: Okay. And that last part, is that tied to the aftermarket industrial restructuring that you announced this morning? Or is that something separate?
Carl Anderson: No, that would be separate. So -- and then if you think about that as far as, as Jay alluded to, we do expect to have run rate savings, which really will begin in 2022. But for this year, in '21, it's a little bit of a headwind because we do have some expense that we will incur as a result of those actions.
James Picariello: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And on the new business wins, encouraging to see the raised target, right, to greater than $450 million versus the original $300 million. I know AxleTech probably takes care of most of that original $300 million. And did I hear correctly you expect to realize $100 million in new business wins this year in FY '21 as incremental to the P&L?
Carl Anderson: That is correct on the last point, yes.
James Picariello: Okay. So the pipeline, the EV pipeline, I think last quarter, the pipeline was maybe $500 million and you had in backlog bookings $200 million. Are those the right numbers? And have they changed at all?
Carl Anderson: I think that's still directionally the right numbers as you think about what we have for electrification at this point.
Jay Craig: And I think, James, we're estimating for 2022, we should have approximately $100 million of incremental revenue for electrification.
James Picariello: Right. Okay. So maybe the $200 million is more like $300 million? Or we could...
Jay Craig: No, of that pipeline, what will be realized in 2022 will be about $100 million.
James Picariello: Understood. Understood. Got it. Last one for me. The fact that receivable I think you might have $75 million left to recover, correct me if I'm wrong. And just from an industry volume standpoint in Europe, what would be needed to fully recover that amount? I mean is it a 450,000 unit number? How should we think about that?
Carl Anderson: It's a good question. I think in order to pull a recovery, it would be probably closer to the 400,000 type of production range.
Operator: Next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.
Brian Johnson: Yes. Congratulations again. Carl, I want to first talk about the air disc brake business. What part of the commercial truck business is breaks? Is that relevant going forward for electric trucks, what are the puts and takes with regen brakes? And are you active to regen index? And then kind of finally, now that WABCO is integrated into ZF, does that change the competitive landscape at all?
Chris Villavarayan: Brian, this is Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that question. So in terms of our portfolio, somewhere about 1/3 to 40% of our business is our brake business. And it is integral. And if you think about it, obviously, even with electrification, air disc brakes are needed, and so it is an integral portion of our business. So the win is very significant as we see it. Going forward, you will always need disc brakes even with regen braking, you do need a secondary form of protection, and that's what the disc brakes provide.
Brian Johnson: Okay. And in terms of the competitive landscape, does it change at all with WABCO? Because I remember in the distant past, I think you had the Roadranger JV together. Just maybe update us on how that changes anything in terms of your competitive position in brakes?
Chris Villavarayan: No, it doesn't change any of the competitive position. And in terms of this specific win, it's specific to the North American market. And so we don't see that as having any impact.
Brian Johnson: Okay. And in terms of the new revenue target, it's a bit higher than in M22, okay AxleTech comes in, but also, I think your original targeted same 250,000 Class 8 market. So where should we think about starting -- should we start at $4.1 billion and work our way up and down based on end markets? Or are there other kind of revenue puts and takes we should be thinking about?
Carl Anderson: Yes. Brian, it's a good question. Yes, I think relative to what we originally laid out in our Analyst Day back in 2018, we had about $3.95 billion of revenue. We are coming out ahead on the new business wins, as we outlined. But relative to that, we do have some FX headwinds associated with that about $100 million, and we also have some lower market assumptions, if you think, especially in India as well as in China. So I think the revenue line item, all in is still around what we originally planned for, which is around that $3.9 billion, $3.95 billion range.
Brian Johnson: Okay. And then final question, great slide on Daimler. But just light vehicles were all obsessed with the potential for OEMs to in-source e-driveline activities. Can you just recap -- Daimler is one of the more integrated Class 8 players on the -- with Detroit diesel, for example. Do you expect this to be a very long-term contract? Or do you expect to somehow transition this technology to more of a component supply and have them manufacture it?
Chris Villavarayan: So Brian, let me take that question again. It's Chris Villavarayan. I think when you think about it, we've had a very long relationship with Daimler. And if you think through the strategy that both companies have had over the past 10 years, that strategy has existed and we've worked well through that. And through the market cycles up and down, we've managed to maintain or even with that growth share. And so I don't see this dynamic changing. If anything, I think this agreement brings us both together and closer. And so we do see it as a great win capping on what Jay talked about with respect to how we have done on the quality and the delivery standpoint over the last 2 years. And we can build off that through 2027.
Brian Johnson: Okay. And congratulations again.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital.
Joseph Spak: I'll extend my congrats again as well. Carl, maybe just a first question, and thanks for all the color. I'm trying to sort of follow along at home here. It seems like with all the different puts and takes you mentioned in terms of incremental restructuring and costs coming back and the step-up in electrification investment that underlying incrementals on just the volume portion is still in that 15% to 20%. Is that roughly correct?
Carl Anderson: I think, Joe, it's probably closer to the upper end of that range, but that is directionally correct. And then obviously, from that point, if you layer in the cost savings that are now more permanent,as well as the footprint optimization, that's what drives the incremental conversions north of 20% as we go forward.
Joseph Spak: Okay. On the '21 guide, just on the industry outlook, I think you're below some recent third-party forecasts that were just revised higher. Is that just some typical Meritor management prudence or is there something you're seeing...
Jay Craig: No. I think, Joe, those estimates by the industry analytic firms have been extremely volatile. You've seen people changing them almost on a weekly basis. And as you would expect, that wide range of guidance is how we're running the company internally, and we want to be prepared, as Carl said, if there's uptick in the pandemic and unfortunately, required shutdowns, particularly in Europe or North America, we could see those volumes come down from the higher end in towards the midpoint of the lower end. And we want to make sure the company is prepared to operate successfully at that light end to that range. As I told our Board last week, this is probably the most uncertain time in terms of market estimates I've ever seen in my tenure with the company. So we're just trying to make sure we keep all the optionality open for running the company.
Joseph Spak: Okay. On the new business target, $150 million higher. Can you tell us how much of that incremental $150 million has already been achieved? And how much more is to go? How much of that $150 million is electrification? And also, does it include the additional ePowertrain awards you indicated you expect on Slide 6?
Carl Anderson: Yes. I think, Joe, as we signaled on the -- just in my prepared remarks, if you think about '21, we are anticipating to have a little bit north of $100 million of new wins coming into P&L that wasn't in last year. If I kind of look at where we ended up last year, we ended up just on total net basis, a little bit less than $100 million. So it really kind of implies we have north of $200 million that will come into '22 in order for us to achieve those targets that we laid out. This is all inclusive of even -- at least to date, some of the electrification awards, obviously, if we're successful in the near future with adding some others that will be incremental.
Joseph Spak: And then one last...
Chris Villavarayan: And a good way to think about that last part, Joe, is that the electrification portion, as Jay pointed out, would be about $100 million in 2022.
Joseph Spak: Okay. Last one for me, just on the '22 margin bridge. You still say, a portion of that's from normalized global markets. And Jay, I appreciate your comment that it seems more uncertain than ever. But it seems like at least North America, even what you're talking for '21 is pretty close to $250 million, which I think is really normalized. So is it fair to say that, that margin bridge unless North America goes in excess of normalized is really dependent on international markets?
Carl Anderson: I think it's -- Joe, yes, I mean, if you look at what we're expecting, we are looking for increases in Brazil, India. We also are planning for the additional new business wins as well as what we're -- in Europe as well. So it is really outside of North America that we expect to really generate the incremental revenue in '22.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
Ryan Brinkman: Just relative to the $6 million headwind to commercial truck EBITDA in 3Q from electrification initiatives, are you able to quantify the extent to which those costs -- what costs either on an absolute level or a year-over-year basis are maybe factored into the '21 guide? And then just taking a step back from that, too. I recall you in the past saying that ultimately, you expect electrification to be accretive to margin, including I imagine because you're providing more value-add technology, et cetera. Should we think about the incrementals for electrification associated revenue tracking above the sort of more normal-ish 20% conversion? And then as you get those higher incrementals and they compare to the investments, at what point in time and what year do you think is it 2022, et cetera, after the ePowertrain launches, et cetera, that ultimately, the electrification business does become accretive to the overall all-in margin?
Carl Anderson: Ryan, thanks for the questions. As it relates to just on the cost actions, if you think about it, it's probably best to think about it on a year-over-year basis. We did have about $30 million of cost actions that affected and came into the P&L in fiscal '20. I would say 2/3 of that was really along temporary cost actions and salary reductions, with 1/3 of that being more permanent in the actions we executed back in the late third quarter for us. As a result, if you kind of flip into '21, on a run rate basis, we do expect about $30 million of cost savings from all of those headcount reduction actions we executed. In addition, we are also planning for about $10 million of, I would say, other cost items as well for next year. And then on your electrification question, I think we're still kind of in the ramp-up mode. As Jay articulated, we are beginning production this in '21, a little bit later in a couple of months. And then obviously, we're going to be ramping up through '22 and then beyond. So I think our expectation is this will be accretive at some point, but I would say, over the next couple of years, we're still going to be kind of in ramp-up mode and will be a little bit of a headwind for us.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just relative to capital allocation, I think I heard you say, is that right that you'd be starting to repay debt in the back half of next year? And also just comments on capital expenditure outlook? Is it a little bit less than in recent years? And how should we think about that trending in light of electrification investments impacting EBITDA, too? And then how do you weigh the debt paydown versus you've been buying back shares in recent years in terms of priority, et cetera?
Carl Anderson: Yes. As it relates to capital allocation, we are committed to ensure we maintain our strong BB credit metrics. And as you think about -- as we think about the current leverage, it's obviously inflated this year just due to the absolute drop in EBITDA dollars. As that kind of comes back, we anticipate to grow back into the balance sheet and be able to have those type of BB credit metrics as we go forward. We are planning, though, in the second half of the year to repay some debt in order to ensure we accelerate that path. And then as we kind of get into '22, we will be looking at again as far as allocating capital to share buybacks. We'll be assessing that at that point. And then on your capital expenditures questions, it's about $85 million, very similar to what we did last year. That's something that as the year goes on, we'll continue to take a look at. But we tend to, as you know, have CapEx as a percent of revenue, somewhere between the 2.7% to 3% range, and we're very comfortable in that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.
Itay Michaeli: Jay, Chris, congrats to you both. Carl, just to follow-on the prior question, just to clarify, with the fiscal '22 free cash conversion outlook today, does that still translate just to over the original kind of $200 million plus you guided to originally in 2018?
Carl Anderson: It's pretty close to that, Itay. When you do the quick math on that, I think it points to about $190 million, but yes, it's right around that range.
Itay Michaeli: Great. And then as we think about just the new business progress and kind of how we think about maybe margins beyond markets normalizing. What's a good way to think about incremental margins, specifically on new business going forward?
Jay Craig: I think it depends, Itay, on which segment it comes through. Certainly, as we see new business coming in through the AxleTech acquisition or in our specialty and off-highway, that would be at the higher end of the margin profile relative to that segment that it resides in with aftermarket. As far as the other truck revenue, new business, we're always striving to have the incremental new business to be at or above what the current business is. And I think you've seen over the last 6 years or so that, that track record has been pretty strong. So it really depends on the mix of that business. And we do have quite a few wins that are in the specialty and off-highway areas. So we could see that segment get a disproportionate share of the new business wins.
Itay Michaeli: That's very helpful. And maybe just lastly, back to the balance sheet, and I apologize if I missed this. Carl, as you kind of -- I think you mentioned earlier, maybe it was Jay that you want to run with a little bit higher cash balances now just given the crisis. Any thoughts that we could think about in terms of how the company wants to run with minimum liquidity or even a leverage target in the next sort of 12 to 18 months?
Jay Craig: I think I'll start off and ask Carl to fill in. Carl did just mention it on a previous question. But remember, our first priority in capital allocation is to maintain our strong BB credit metrics. We believe that has served us and investors extremely well over the last 6 to 9 months as we've been through this crisis. And it has validated our belief that, that's a critical benchmark for us to maintain. So that will be the first and foremost goal in the capital allocation and then as you've seen historically with us, we do not let cash sit idly on our balance sheet, but we'll deploy any excess cash beyond that in shareholder-friendly ways.
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for closing remarks.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Cummins Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Once again, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to James Hopkins, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
James Hopkins: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins’ results for the third quarter of 2020. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Smith; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tony Satterthwaite. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available on the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and media. With that out of the way, we will begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you, James, and good morning. Third quarter continued a period of high demand volatility across our end markets. Three months ago, we experienced the largest sales decline in the company's history. We have now followed that with the largest sequential increase in sales in the company's history. Even with the dramatic increase, however, sales remained below last year's levels. While we have seen increased demand around most of our end markets over the last three months, we continue to see differences in recovery rates, both by market and by region, and we expect these differences to continue. Our employees have done a remarkable job of supporting our customers through this period while maintaining a safe work environment. In the third quarter, our supply chain organization continue to support near record levels of truck production in China, as well as ramping up production to meet significantly increased demand in the North American heavy duty truck, and pickup market. Our engineering group has continued to successfully launch new products during this period, over the last six months we introduced an entire range of broad stage six products in India, and portions of our National Standard VI portfolio in China. We also recently announced our full product lineup to meet EPA 2021 regulations in North America. While nearly everything about the way we have worked -- we work has changed due to COVID-19, the commitment and capability of our employees has remained intact. Now I'll move to a summary of our third quarter results and a discussion of our major end markets. Mark will then take you through more details of our third quarter financial performance and update you on our balance sheet and liquidity. Revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 11%, compared to the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA was $876 million or 17.1%, compared to $958 million or 16.6% a year ago. The impact of lower volumes and higher variable compensation costs was offset by the benefits of restructuring, temporary salary reductions, reduced warranty costs and higher joint venture income. The increase in joint venture income was primarily due to continued strong levels of demand in China. Engine Business revenues declined by 13% in the third quarter compared to a year ago. Lower production in North American truck markets drove most of the revenue decline. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 18.1%, compared to 14.1% for the same period in 2019. Cost savings related to restructuring activities and salary reductions, as well as increased joint venture income, partially offset the impact of lower volumes. Third quarter results also benefited from a VAT recovery in Brazil. Sales for our Distribution segment declined by 14% year-over-year, with lower revenues in domestic and international markets. Third quarter EBITDA was $182 million or 10.6% of sales, compared to 9.3% in the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA margins increased, as we realize more of the benefits of our transformation work in North America. Third quarter revenues for the Components segment declined 7%. Sales in North America declined 24%, driven by lower truck build rates, while revenues in international markets increased by 26%, driven by higher truck demand in China. EBITDA for the third quarter was $261 million or 16.9% compared to 17.3% in the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA percent decreased, as the impact of lower volumes was partially offset by the benefits of restructuring and temporary salary reductions. Power Systems sales in the third quarter declined 13% year-over-year. Industrial sales declined 21%, driven by continued weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. Power Generation sales decreased by 7%, with lower revenues in both North America and international markets. EBITDA in the third quarter was 10.3% or $101 million, compared to 14% a year ago. The impact of lower volumes more than offset the benefits of cost reduction actions. In the New Power business, sales of $18 million were double those from a year ago. EBITDA was a loss of $40 million, in line with our expectations. Now I will comment on some of our key regions and markets, starting with North America, and then I’ll cover some of our largest international markets. Our third quarter revenues in North America declined 18% to $3 billion, but increased by 49% sequentially. Compared to last year, we experienced lower demand in both on and off highway markets, as well as within our parts and service business. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks declined 35% in the third quarter, compared to a year ago, but rose 119% sequentially. Year-to-date, our market share is 33%, driven by the continued strong performance of our products in the field. Production of medium-duty trucks decreased by 33% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, but increased 76% from second quarter levels. We continue to maintain our clear market share leadership in the medium-duty truck market, with over 80% of new trucks powered by Cummins power trains in 2020. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 4% compared to a year ago, and included a catch-up in production by our OEM partner after an extended second quarter shut down. Demand in domestic bus markets remain weak in the third quarter with sales down, 24%, driven by demand lower demand from both transit and school bus customers. In domestic, our highway market engine sales for construction equipment decreased by 47%, driven by lower demand by rental fleets who went through a significant replenishment cycle in 2018 and 2019. Revenues for power generation equipment fell by 7% with lower demand and backup power market. Demand for engines and oil and gas markets declined by 80%. Now I'll turn to our international markets. International revenues were flat in the third quarter of 2020, compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.7 billion, an increase of 46%, compared to a year ago, driven by continued strong demand in both truck and construction markets. And the third quarter industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China, increased by 74% compared to a year ago. While demand declines sequentially, which is normal in the third quarter for China. Total industry production with the highest on record for any third quarter. Demand continues to be driven by improved levels of freight activity and government policies, supporting the scrapping of old NSV trucks. Our market share was 17% in the quarter, up from 16% in the third quarter of 2019, driven by increased truck market share of our partner Foton, along with higher utilization of our engine in Foton trucks, which now stands at over 80%. Industry sales of light duty trucks, increased by 49% in the third quarter, and our market share was 9%, up from 7% last year, our increased market share was driven by improved truck market share Foton, as well as increased use of our engines and JC, while new NSX regulations come into effect for all markets in China next July, there are certain cities and applications where these regulations are already in place. 12 of our NSX engine models are now in production, including our entire light duty portfolio, as well as our leading 6.7 and 12 liter products. We've shipped over 50,000 NSX compliant units so far in 2020 and are seeing strong acceptance of our new engines. In addition, we are now selling our automated manual transmissions into the Chinese market, and are on track to sell over 1000 Endurant AMTs by the end of the year. Third quarter demand for excavators in China, increased by 57% from a year ago. The central government is encouraging increased levels of borrowing by local municipalities to support investment in infrastructure and housing projects. So far this year over $500 billion in local government loans have been issued, targeting infrastructure projects and resulting in increased excavator demand. Our market share was 16% this quarter compared to 15% a year ago, driven by the strong performance of our domestic OEM customers. Demand for power generation equipment in China was flat compared to a year ago with increased demands on data center customers offset by weaker demand for standby power. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $295 million, a reduction of 14% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck sales in India decreased 47%. While power generation sales declined by 45%. While demand in India remains at very low levels. It's the industry truck sales more than triple compared to second quarter levels. While credit availability remains tight, certain segments of the truck market, especially those tied to construction are seeing a recovery in demand driven by state government stimulus for infrastructure. Cummins is well positioned to benefit from our recovery in Indian markets. Both because of our leading market position, as well as the incremental content we have on engines that meet BSVI on-highway emission standards, which became effective in April. Outside of India and China, we saw a year-over-year revenue declines of 8% in Europe, and 15% in Latin America, primarily due to lower truck production, compared to the second quarter sales – compared to the second quarter sales increased by 25% in Europe, and increased by 102% in Latin America, as OEMs resumed truck production in both regions. Global sales of mining engines declined 39% compared to a year ago. Demand remains stable among copper and iron ore miners, while sales related to coal mining remained low. I also wanted to discuss our aftermarket revenues during this quarter. Sales of parts declined by 12% in our engine business and 14% in our Power Systems business. Part sales remain depressed in our Power Systems business, due to low demand in oil and gas markets, as well as lower rebuild activity in mining markets. In our engine business, parts sales were down 12% year-over-year for increased 20% sequentially. Compared to last year, we are seeing weaker demand in bus markets and parts for older model trucks. Parts demand for current on-highway truck engines are flat with last year. While demand increased from second quarter levels across most of our end markets, we remain cautious about future demand increases due to the continued spread of COVID-19 in most countries outside of Asia. And while we are encouraged by continued strong demand in China and improving fundamentals in North American truck markets, industry backlogs remain at modest levels. We currently expect consolidated company revenues in the fourth quarter to be similar to third quarter levels, with higher demand in North American truck markets and continued improvement in aftermarket sales, partially offset by lower demand in China. We continue to expect that the pace of market recovery will differ from region-to-region and may change based on government actions, both to control the spread of COVID-19 or to stimulate their economies and build business and consumer confidence. We continue working hard to support our end users and build our – build strong OEM relationships during this period. In August, we announced the extension of our medium and heavy-duty truck engine partnership with Navistar. Cummins will continue to supply engines for Navistar's medium and heavy-duty trucks as well as for bus applications through the end of 2026, extending our 80-year relationship with Navistar. Through the development and introduction of new products, we continue to reduce the emissions levels of our products while increasing fuel economy. This includes the launch of our full product lineup for 2021 EPA regulations in North America and NSVI regulations in China and BSVI regulations in India. We are encouraged by the performance and market acceptance of these products that are already in the field. We also continue to focus on supporting our customers in their transition to carbon-neutral technologies. Our revenues doubled in our new Power Segment this quarter, and we are excited to share more about how we expect our hydrogen production and fuel cell business to develop at Cummins Hydrogen Day on November 16. We hope you all will be able to attend this virtual event. Now let me turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial performance this quarter, including our record operating cash flow. Mark?
Mark Smith: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I would like you to leave this call with two key takeaways from our financial performance in the third quarter. Number one, we delivered solid decremental margins in the third quarter, which put us on track for full year performance that will extend our record of raising profitability over successive downturns. This performance is a testament to our operational flexibility, ramping down effectively in the second quarter and then converting additional volume into stronger earnings and record operating cash flow in the third quarter. Number two is a result of the record operating cash flows and the addition of low-cost, long-term financing in the third quarter, the company sits today with strong liquidity, which will allow us to keep investing in our future in the face of any further volatility and return any excess capital to shareholders in the future. Now, let me share some of the key details of our third quarter. Third quarter revenues were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 11% from a year ago. Sales in North America fell 18%, and international revenues were flat. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%, primarily due to a weaker Brazilian real. Earnings before interest and taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $876 million or 17.1% of sales for the quarter, compared to $958 million or 16.6% of sales a year ago, representing a decremental EBITDA of 13%. EBITDA dollars decreased by $82 million over the third quarter last year, driven by the negative impact of lower sales, partially offset by the benefits of prior restructuring actions, temporary salary reductions, lower warranty and material costs and increased joint venture income in China. During the quarter, we recorded a recovery of previously expensed value-added taxes in Brazil, which boosted revenues and pre-tax earnings by $44 million and primarily benefited the engine business. The variable compensation expense in the third quarter was higher than a year ago as we increased our accrual, reflecting higher expectations for full year company profitability than we anticipated three months ago. For the full year 2020, variable compensation is projected to be lower than 2019. Gross margin of $1.3 billion, or 26.4% of sales, increased by 50 basis points from a year ago. Lower base compensation expense due to the benefits of restructuring actions, temporary salary cuts, material cost reductions and the VAT recovery in Brazil, more than offset the impact of lower sales and higher variable compensation expense. As a reminder, our gross margin last year was negatively impacted by $37 million in pre-tax charges, as we exited two unprofitable product lines. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $67 million or 11% due to the benefits of restructuring, temporary salary reductions and reduced discretionary expenses, partially offset by the increased overall compensation. Research expenses decreased by $18 million or 7% from a year ago, but increased by $35 million or 19% from the second quarter, as expected, as we ramped up work at our global technical centers and continued progress on engineering programs following some disruption to operations in the second quarter. Joint venture income increased by $30 million, but driven by continued strong demand for trucks in China, and joint venture income in China was a record for the third quarter, as we converted those higher volumes into strong earnings. Other income of $21 million decreased by $40 million compared to a year ago. Last year, we recognized a onetime $35 million cash gain related to the company's foreign exchange hedging program, which did not repeat this year. Net earnings for the quarter were $501 million or $3.36 per diluted share compared to $622 million or $3.97 a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.5%, and income tax expense included unfavorable discrete items of $31 million or $0.21 per diluted share.  After a tough second quarter, operating cash flow rebounded to a record inflow of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by strong profitability and lower working capital levels. Our inventory decreased by $185 million in the quarter, even as sales increased 33% from second quarter levels. Capital expenditures was $116 million in the quarter, down from $153 million a year ago. We expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of $500 million to $525 million, unchanged from our prior guidance and down more than 25% from 2019. We continue to return cash to shareholders in the third quarter with $194 million of cash dividends paid out. In August, the company completed an aggregate $2 billion debt offering of 5, 10 and 30-year maturities, taking advantage of extremely attractive long-term interest rates that reflected both favorable market conditions and our own strong credit rating. This long-term financing was used in part to pay down our commercial paper borrowings and reduces our reliance on credit facilities going forward. Company's long-term credit ratings remain unchanged at A+ from Standard and Poor's and A2 from Moody's with stable outlooks  As a result of our strong operating cash flow and the debt offering, we boosted our total liquidity to $6.5 billion at the end of September, which puts Cummins in a strong position to navigate any further volatility that may lie ahead. In October, we announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend, our 11th straight year of dividend growth. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to remain similar to third quarter levels. Strong industry orders are expected to lead to strong demand in North American truck markets and improved aftermarket demand. India has shown some signs of improvement from very low levels in demand as the lockdowns have been eased and some economic activities increasing. In China, where demand has been at record levels over the last 6 months, we expect to experience some seasonal declines in the fourth quarter, but demand remained at relatively strong levels. The temporary salary reduction that went into effect in mid-April ended at the end of September as planned. The restoration of salaries will add approximately $90 million of pretax expenses in the fourth quarter. In summary, we delivered a strong set of results in the third quarter, including record operating cash flow. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their dedication and commitment to excellence through these last 6 very challenging months. Following unprecedented decline in demand in the second quarter, we responded well in ramping back up in the third quarter, supporting our customers and maintaining financial discipline throughout. While many of our markets have improved, the effects of the pandemic can still be felt in many regions and may impact the pace of recovery. We will continue to align our business with market conditions, deliver strong operational performance, invest in the technologies that will fuel profitable growth and return any excess capital to shareholders. Finally, as Tom previously mentioned, we'll be holding our Hydrogen Day on November 16th, where we will highlight our participation in hydrogen economy. Additional details and registration can be found on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Cummins. Now let me turn it back to James.
James Hopkins: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a related follow-up, and if you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're now ready for our first question.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Stephen Volkmann: Thank you.
Mark Smith: Hello?
Stephen Volkmann: Can you guys hear me okay?
Mark Smith: Yeah, obviously.
Stephen Volkmann: Okay, good. Sorry. So yeah, my question, maybe this is a Mark question, I don't know, but I'm trying to just see if I can disaggregate your temporary cost activities from your restructuring benefits? And obviously, I'm trying to start to think about 2021 and figure out what you get to keep and kind of what you have to give back. Can you give us some help with that?
Mark Smith: You'll remember that we implemented a temporary salary reductions in the middle of April, Steve. So when you do the math, it's about $165 million of full year lower expenses in 2020. Obviously, that will not repeat. We've restored those salaries in the fourth quarter. The restructuring, I mean, is embedded in our solid decremental margins. And again, we don't have any further major restructuring actions in place, but we have captured the benefits of that $250 million to $300 million in the current year as anticipated.
Stephen Volkmann: Okay. I guess what -- that's sort of where I'm trying to go, Mark, is how should we think about incremental margins, assuming there's some small increment next year? Low decrementals, kind of maybe employ low incrementals, but maybe not if you're getting a good chunk of restructuring benefits.
Mark Smith: Yeah. I think, just at this point, so it's a very -- I understand the question. It's just too early even to assess our market conditions next year. But you will -- you can see from our results today that we're pushing on all the levers, productivity gains that we can. It's just too early beyond the obvious items to comment much on next year.
Stephen Volkmann: Okay, thanks. Worth a try. Appreciate it.
Mark Smith: Thank you.
James Hopkins: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Courtney Yakavonis: Hi, thanks guys. If you can just comment a little bit more on the guidance that 4Q revenues would be similar to 3Q relative to kind of some of the strength we saw in the international markets versus the increases that we're expecting in North America, if you can just help us understand that? And then relative to what you're expecting in parts relative to the engine side? Thanks.
Mark Smith: So the strength in international market, all being flat, lower down to China, right. There really wasn't any strength to speak of elsewhere in terms of year-over-year growth. There was steady recovery in some markets. But any part of our business that touch China, whether within the component business, even our construction business, within the engine business, data center orders for the power systems, anything that touch China was pretty much up year-over-year. And so that's really what – you're all flat international revenues for the quarter. It's typical currently that we see some seasonal weakening going into the third – into the fourth quarter every year in China. So we still expect relative to prior year, strong demand but weaker sequentially, primarily impacting the components business since all – pretty much all of their revenue was consolidated, and then to a lesser extent, the Engine business. So that's the primary market where we're expecting some seasonal declines. And then yes, truck production build rates, I think, are largely set for the fourth quarter. And then yes, on parts, what we saw in the second quarter was particularly some weaker demand in the bus market, truck parts, particularly on newer model, heavy-duty truck was stable in the third quarter, and we expect steadily improving parts demand in subsequent quarters. The big factor is really China easing, and we're not expecting rapid further acceleration in truck demand right now.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook from Crédit Suisse. Your line is now live.
Jamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. I guess two questions. First, the margins in the Distribution business improved again in the third quarter. So can you talk about how to think about those margins longer term, sort of what's structural based on some of the internal self-help you guys have been implementing? And then my second question, Mark, understanding you guys are always conservative, but you are sitting with $3 billion or so in cash. So how do you think about cash flow for the year? What's the right number? At what point do we, you know, start to thinking about putting that cash to use? Thanks.
Mark Smith: Good. Yes, so you're right. And I'll start on Distribution, Tony, if you want to chime in. We have had a very focused effort, particularly in North America, on driving margin improvement, a lot of it's coming out of the cost side of the business, this years we've been pleased with the progress this year Jamie. I think then, you know, then we're really looking to see, you know, as parts and service which, you know, have been down, probably more, more than in prior cycles due to the severity of the impact of COVID. How that recovers in future years. So I think, we've made a lot of progress in the margin improvement over the last couple of years. We certainly expect to hang on to that. And then we'll be looking to build on revenue growth going forward. So avoid given a specific target Tony?
Tony Satterthwaite: Yes, I would just add Jamie, you know, revenue has been a little weaker in this downturn and DBU than previous downturns. And so we've been really pleased with the cost performance and the restructuring and focusing going forward is going to be on how do we see better revenue growth as that business comes back? And how do we gain some share in the parts and service business in particular? So that's what we're looking for more about how do we get that business back to a higher revenue level than necessarily trying to get margins up.
Jamie Cook: Okay. But is there any reason to believe the margins can structurally sort of be now in the double-digit range on an adjusted EBITDA basis?
Tony Satterthwaite: That has been our goal. That's what we said when we launched this transformation program. So that's what we're trying to do is keep them in the double-digit level going forward. That's our goal. Yes.
Jamie Cook: Okay. Mark, and then on your cash – sorry, go ahead.
Tom Linebarger: Yes, it's Tom. I mean just to make sure I get them – you get the math right. So our view that we are already in double digits, while facing -- yes, we had some cost -- temporary cost measures that helped, but we had way more headwinds with regard to both sales and then parts and service decline. So our view is that, that we are on our plan despite pretty heavy headwinds. So we are not only feeling good about where we are, but we're more confident than ever that we're going to be in double-digit margins from now forward. So again, you can imagine some scenarios with COVID that would make it so you might have a quarter or 2 that weren't. But broadly speaking, our view is the restructuring stuff has gone better than we expected. So we – as Tony said, that was our target, and we feel like we're ahead of target. So that's just -- on the cash side, I'll let Mark fill in some more. But I mean, broadly speaking, we've definitely acted conservatively from a balance sheet this year to protect ourselves against the worst potential outcomes -- economic outcomes from the pandemic. So we've shored up the balance sheet with our debt offering, low cost financing, our cash flow has improved dramatically. So we feel good about the position the company is in and expect, barring some significant change in economic conditions, to return to our cash flow plans that we've been operating under for many years. So our plan is to go back to returning as a normalized level, half of our cash flow in dividends and share buybacks. We still have to take all that stuff to the Board. We have to finish our planning work for next year. There's a lot of work left to do. And of course, there's still a pandemic. So we'll keep watching and paying attention. But right now, as we see it, that's where we're headed. Mark, I don't know what you would add.
Mark Smith: Yes. I think we've made it clear, we're not trying to hold cash a little -- being cautious this year but I think Tom has made it clear going forward.
Jamie Cook: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research. Your line is now live.
Adam Uhlman: Hey guys. Good morning. I was hoping to get your perspective on heavy truck markets. I guess we've seen this spike in spot rates and the orders have been soaring. I guess I'm just wondering how sustainable do you think that is? And most of your customers are looking for pretty aggressive build growth in the next year. I guess maybe you could frame up your thoughts on how the cycle plays out from here that would be helpful.
Tom Linebarger: Tony?
Tony Satterthwaite: Sure, Adam. We're all waiting. Sorry. We're not together, Adam. So this is Tony. Yes. It's been very pleasing to see the growth, particularly in the last couple of months. I think the thing to remember is that the virus is still with us. And although we are very encouraged, I also think we're very cautious about how the market is going to play out next year. I do think that there is a view that demand is higher, the newer trucks and newer products are definitely working better. We get really good feedback from customers. And we've got new products coming out next year that meet the latest greenhouse gas emissions for EPA 2021. So we're excited with the products we have on offer. Our OEM customers are feeling pretty bullish. But at the same time, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. And so we're just -- we're trying to be prudent. We're trying to keep our eye on all the things going on and make sure that we are ready if things come in stronger and we're prepared if things all of a sudden take a downturn. So the main characteristic of this COVID environment is unpredictability and volatility. And so we're just trying to be ready for that as best we can.
Mark Smith: I'll just say, Adam, the other thing we look at is really the parts consumption, because in prior cycles, this one may not be the same as prior cycles. In prior cycles, we've had a pretty good run of accelerating parts consumption before orders sustainably stepped up. So that's something, we're watching closely by segment and end market. And that should give you some indication from us and other participants in future quarters.
Adam Uhlman: Okay. Got you. And then Mark, the – with these new products coming out for 2021, I guess, the company has been benefiting from lower warranty expense, and there's some structural actions going on there. Should we expect a pause in lower warranty expense next year, or do you think we have more legs lower as you execute on your strategic initiatives? Thanks.
Mark Smith: Thanks, Adam. Really good question. I think on the one end, of course, we're always driving for more improvement, but I would say that our expenses at 1.8% or 1.9% of sales for this year have run below expectations. And the principal drivers of the warranty performance are field performance of existing products, field campaigns, and then over a longer period of time, changing emission regulations and then the launch of new products. So – you're right, the launch of new products will continue. We typically start those with higher warranty rates. And this year, the number of field campaigns has been below normal. So we would expect even some tick up in the fourth quarter. And yes, probably, we shouldn't be looking in 1.8% for now as a run rate. So yeah, we'll provide you with an update on that when we get into next year, some tick up from here should be expect – we even expected something this quarter. But that's where we are right now.
Adam Uhlman: Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Joel Tiss: Hi. How is it going guys?
Tom Linebarger: Hi, Joe.
Joel Tiss: I wonder, Tony, or – can you talk a little bit about any product lines that have been, like, systematically challenged? And I'm thinking over a couple of years, not just because of this. And any areas that you could like do product line simplification and reduce some of that exposure to drive the gross margins higher, or you're always doing that, and there's nothing that really stands out?
Tony Satterthwaite: Hey, Joe, I'll go first. I think we did some of that last year, right? So we ended production of one of our engine platforms in the pickup market in North America, which not only – we took a charge this time last year, but that's also improved our operating performance year-over-year, and similarly in one of the transmission lines of business. So yeah, we're always looking at things like that. But I would say, don't see any major changes like that. But there's always some opportunity to trim and prune and improve we would never.
Joel Tiss: And I wonder if you can talk about the M&A environment out there and what you guys are focused on is – is everything so disrupted that it's not the right time to be looking, or maybe because things are disrupted, there are some unique opportunities? And what area would you be thinking about?
Tom Linebarger: I think – it's Tom. I can step in on that. I mean, for sure, in the second quarter, we were on pause a little bit, making sure that our balance sheet was shored up. But with all the potential outcomes, we took a pause. But things, as I mentioned to Jamie's question, I think things have begun to normalize, at least economically to a place where we feel pretty secure in our balance sheet. And we're looking at restarting our cash flow return, and we will -- of course, we have continued actively looking at the strategic areas where acquisitions would be interesting to us. You probably wrote a call from our previous calls or Investor Day that we kind of start with strategy first, acquisition second. So we think through what are the areas that we'd like to expand in. And we've talked about those before, but they're all the areas where we feel like our competitive advantages, the things that we bring in terms of technology, global footprint, supply chain, that sort of thing, help us move forward. And then, of course, our new technology areas, the acquisitions like we did with Hydrogenics and battery companies, those were to add new capabilities. So, we're continuing to look in those same areas. I think maybe the one comment I would make is that I expected, given the disruption for valuations to be lower today, so I was -- as you -- kind of like the basis of your question, I expect it, maybe disruption would cause valuations to drop out a little bit. That's actually not happened so much. It doesn't mean that it won't happen, but -- and it's maybe because of the private equity dollars are so large. But I would say as we look around using disciplined method to look at what acquisition would mean for our company. I still see acquisition prices relatively lofty. So, we'll continue to look, and we're continuing to talk to people and look for the right thing. But we will just -- we'll remain disciplined and look for the right things at the right price, and we find it, we'll act. And if we don't, we'll return more cash to shareholders just like we planned.
Joel Tiss: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Jerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.
Tom Linebarger: Hi.
Mark Smith: Hey Jerry.
Jerry Revich: Tom, now that a number of your customers have sharpened their pencils, at least publicly on their hydrogen and alternative vehicle strategies, are they any closer to allocating lower volume diesel engine product lines to you? Can you talk about, if you can, which regions or which product lines you see the most potential for you folks to add value for customers that have lower volumes in those areas?
Tom Linebarger: Jerry, here's the thing. I would say that every customer that we're talking to is doing exactly that pencil sharpening calculations that you talked about. It's a really different environment than it was 10 or 15 years ago, or the calculations were maybe the opposite about how to backward integrate more. Mostly what I hear is maybe backward integrate less. But that said, there's no deal until there's a deal, right? So, again, I can't really preannounce or suggest anyone who's going to go because they're -- they're difficult decisions for them to figure out what they want to continue and what they don't. I feel very optimistic that we'll play an increasing role with our major customers on selling them more diesel engines, providing them more components technology in the future than the past. So, I expect market share increase in the future based on the fact that they will decide that their money be spent elsewhere. Exactly where and when, again, I just -- I can't get ahead of my customers on those conversations, but we're talking with everybody about it. We're excited about it. And they have a lot of strategic considerations to make as do we. So, these conversations are complicated in -- and take time. But anyway, there you are. We're in it for sure, and we're -- and I'm confident that we will win increased share.
Jerry Revich: I appreciate the color. And Mark, as we look at the fourth quarter sales outlook, flattish sales. Normal seasonality is closer to up 7% sequentially. And you mentioned China, but obviously, North America and other regions are accelerating. So I'm just wondering, are you expecting a slowdown versus normal seasonality, or is it the sort of situation where, look, where – could get hit by the second wave, and we don't want to get into a situation where if it's worse, we're missing numbers. Is there some conservatism in there or other pieces that you're legitimately concerned with?
Mark Smith: Yes. The numbers will be what the numbers will be, Jerry. I mean we've been very focused on cost. And then Tony and the team are on this incredible ramp back up again. But let's just use the pickup truck market as an example. If you just said at Q3 in isolation, you would see that, that's in the top 10 quarters in history of pickup truck engine demand. But if you do look back at Q2, you would say it's 0, right? So you just can't normalize everything that happened in Q3 and say, flat means everything is flat. So I think there will be some rebalancing in some markets. But again, we'll see where it is. Our focus is on cost and delivery and then delivering the calendar results that go with whatever volume were thrown them.
Tom Linebarger: And Jerry as Tony said, we are encouraged by tough market. As these clients said to us, all of customers are projecting stronger volumes which is great for us. So yes we are always cautious, because that’s how we live. But nonetheless we are encouraged by their comments and their vehicles to the market, they are watching fleet customer and what they're ordering, and we're hearing good things from the fleets, too. So yes, we are very encouraged. In China, while we expect seasonal demand, we don't expect a gigantic drop off. We just expect seasonal demand normal. It's just the thing is flying so high now that -- again, we just remain cautious. So just don't hear from us discouragement. We are – the markets are going well, and we're surprised and pleased by how strong they are, and we're encouraged by those. We're just trying to make sure that we balance our enthusiasm with the cautious attitude that's appropriate for a global pandemic.
Jerry Revich: Glad to hear. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.
David Raso: Hi, thank you. My question is on engine margins for next year, just thinking about the framework, Tom, and given your China comments just now. I'm trying to square up, it looks like next year, you have sort of a sweet spot of strong growth but not yet at those extremely high levels where sometimes there's inefficiency serving the domestic truck market. So on a consolidated margin basis, I'm just curious how you think about the margin structurally versus, say, 2019? Just some sense of what we might not get back to those revenues, are the domestic margins set up in a way where they could be maybe a little closer to '19 than otherwise, given some bit of a sweet spot. But then within the segment, you do have the JV income, which is a big contributor. And thus, maybe if you could share your initial views on '21 for China as that business is debatable, if it's up or not next year. So I just would appreciate your thoughts for an early framework on '21 engine margins?
Tom Linebarger: Well, within China, there are a number of moving parts, David that will add to the complexity. We're expecting a bigger step-up in the penetration of NS VI products. What that will happen to demand. The take up is all to be figured out there. So yeah, we're not in a position right now to give you 2021. I guess Q3 margins were higher than normal for a couple of the factors that we've laid out. But we're still going through our planning cycle for next year as we speak. So not as we speak, but after we speak here, we'll be back on that again here shortly. So it's just too early to say, given everything that's going on. Look, I would just say we are very pleased with performance of the engine business and the fact that they were able to deliver such strong margins in this very, very challenging environment. And I think it speaks to the strength of the global franchise and the scale we've got in multiple markets, obviously, North America and China has been primary. But yeah, we're not ready to give guidance next year. I appreciate you're asking. We'll look forward to giving an update with Q4 earnings.
David Raso: Would you mind just to clarify there, just given how high China is today, maybe while you don't want to predict the industry, I'm curious -- and you've given some numbers in the past, But now we're a little bit closer, the incremental content, some of the opportunities are idiosyncratic to the company. If there is a thought that China's volumes are so high this year, they're down next year, but maybe you have some self-help offsets. Can you give us some framework, as we've discussed in the past, but now closer to it? What kind of potentially framework revenue impact you could see that is from better NS VI content or increase with photon and so forth? Can you help us a little bit, just frame it?
Mark Smith: Yeah. I'll just make a couple of comments, and then James can maybe give you some numbers. But I think this, kind of, couple of dynamics. One, so there's the potential -- or the expectation of higher content for the components business on a consolidated revenue basis. As the emissions regulations are rolled out, that's kind of a given, given that we saw -- we specify the after-treatment systems are an integral part of our engine system design. James will give you the numbers in a moment. We hope then, as we move in through these more advanced missions regulations, that we can continue to pick up share. We feel like our NS VI products have been well received. And our penetration of photon has already been really accelerating over the last couple of years. We're already up to 80%. And it's encouraging to see photons been picking up some share as well. So yes, we're optimistic about, if we set aside the market, which, of course, markets do drive earnings as well, but our position and our ability to add self-help there. And James, you can maybe quantify the revenues.
James Hopkins: Yeah. And David, from a revenue impact of that, we've talked broadly before, both between the emissions content in China and in India. That will be roughly $600 million of incremental revenue, and that primarily hits our component segment. I think in addition to that, Tom mentioned in his remarks excitement about the endurant transmission that we're selling 1,000 units out in the second half of this year. We'll see continued growth of that product in China next year, which will provide customers with even improved fuel economy and hopefully to more market share gains. And so I think that is also some self-help as we look into 2021.
Tom Linebarger: David, this is Tom. As you kind of think through the model, the numbers for this year are so high in the truck market. This is what Mark's saying that right now, it's just hard for us to do that. The weighing one or the other because we know what the content is. We know we've won the share with. We even have forecast for how we think it converts over to NS VI and what growth we see in transmissions. The challenge is just what's the overall market going to be. And we were wrong this year. I mean just to say it straight out, we had pretty balanced assumptions about how well this year would be, and we've been wrong every single quarter on the low side. It's been better than every single quarter. So that's why we're just a little gun shy about doing the overall balance for you. We will do it, of course, when we get done with fourth quarter earnings. But I just would say that, we're hopeful that we can offset a downturn with a lot of these other content pieces, but it just depends on how big the slope down is.
David Raso: Yes. I mean that's what's interesting, Tom. I mean historically, your order book could be accelerating every time on the call, you want to say, well, China is going to slow down. And a lot of times, it doesn't. And in this environment, you'd almost say we're at such a high level. And you've seen Volvo and so forth already forecast China down next year. You know, betting man would have said like, well, knowing Tom's history or the way he looks at China, just trying to be cautious with it. And we'll definitely be hearing today baseline – oh, it's definitely down. It seems like what you're seeing enough internally in your own opportunities, it's still an open question, which estimates a little more positive than I would have thought.
Tom Linebarger: So yes, you're right about it. You're right, David. It is an open question, and I appreciate your comments, and I do acknowledge that I have been calling it down more than it has been. So I'll just take that one – and accept it. That hasn't been right. And so anyway, I think it's a good point you raise.
David Raso: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Ann Duignan: Yes. Hi, I'd like to go back to Q4. I mean you've guided to revenue flattish quarter-over-quarter. You called out $90 million in higher compensation expenses. You mentioned perhaps warranty costs coming back up. Could you talk about some of the positives and negatives that we ought to consider beyond those or quantify maybe the warranty impact as we head into Q4? Just so we don't assume that EBITDA is flat, also minus the $90 million. What else should we take into consideration?
Mark Smith: Yes. I mean, there's really three main things. There's – you've got the $90 million – it's likely there's some increase in the warranty expense in the fourth quarter. And then, as I said in my prepared remarks, we trued up our variable compensation in the third quarter to catch up for our higher expectation. So I think it's unlikely now that we'll be showing up again in the fourth quarter. JV income, despite all the comments just passed, directionally, I would expect that still to be a little bit lighter in China, just based on seasonality. It's still very strong, just to be clear, year-over-year, but just weaker into the fourth quarter. So those are really the big moving parts. And other than the volume – and we've converted that well when we've received it this year.
Tom Linebarger: Yes. And we hope the volume being higher in the North America truck market is net positive towards incremental margins, too. It's a good market for us. And we're operating at a reasonably efficient level, especially given all the challenges as COVID. We're operating at a good level on North American truck market. So we're hopeful that, that also helps us some.
Ann Duignan: Okay. And I think you mentioned also on distribution. If aftermarket were to continue to accelerate, that should be a positive for mix also. Is that a fair statement?
Mark Smith: It is a first statement, and it would benefit a number of businesses, but particularly distribution, yes.
Ann Duignan: Okay. Thank you. I’ll leave it there. As most of my other questions are answered. Appreciate it.
Tom Linebarger: Thanks, Ann.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question is coming from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Ross Gilardi: Good morning, guys.
Tom Linebarger: Hi, Ross.
Mark Smith: Hi. How are you?
Ross Gilardi: Okay. Great. Thank you. Look, clearly, your overall results are very strong and very impressive. I realize that engines from mining and energy are not big parts of your company anymore, so sorry to focus there. I missed the strong quarter, but wanted to get your perspective on those two end markets. And I think you said, mining engine shipments were down 39%. Was that actually worse in the second quarter? You mentioned coal, and are you starting to view mining or energy as more structurally challenged end markets for Cummins, or is this just a cyclical downturn like prior downturns? And just beyond that, is there any real hope for a real pickup in either mining or energy in 2021, or do these businesses potentially get worse or just kind of flat line at a low level before they get better?
Mark Smith: James will do the numbers for you, Ross, just to confirm, first of all.
James Hopkins: Yes. Ross, so on the mining engine sales side, as you mentioned, third quarter revenues were very similar to second quarter in the mining overall. And as you mentioned, we continue to see relatively stable demand in miners that are going to be focused more on iron ore and copper and continued weak demand along the coal side of things. But we were flat sequentially on the mining revenues.
Ross Gilardi: And oil and gas was de minimis?
James Hopkins: Yes. Oil and gas, very de minimis. So sales in North America at this point on the oil and gas side for new engines, almost nothing. And we've also continued to see very weak demand in oil and gas markets in relation to rebuilds, really kind of highlighting the fact that there are rigs that are not currently being utilized in the market.
Tom Linebarger: And, Ross, maybe just stepping back, I would just say that from a mining point of view, I don't think we see it as a structurally challenged market. Well, it's challenged in the following sense. There tends to be over shots and under shots a lot in the market. You know that well, and you know a lot of mining companies overshot by a lot in the last cycle and really got knocked back hard. And so needless to say, they're all being careful, not overshooting now, which has meant that equipment buying has been more muted, even in good markets, than it was in the previous cycle. So our expectation of the cycle was that it wasn't going to be as good as the last one, I'm sure enough it hasn't been at all. And of course, just general economic demand being dampened, confidence in future demand being dampened by the pandemic has meant that mining is indeed slow. And I think it really won't get a lot stronger until there's confidence built in global economic growth, which means the end of the pandemic. I mean really, I just don't see a way that it changes. Energy is a whole another conversation and energy has a lot more structural challenge to it, but I'm not the right one to answer it. As you say, we have a participation there, not a huge one. And so, I think, it's better for someone else to comment on that. But it looks more structurally challenged to me than some of the other markets.
Ross Gilardi: Yes. Thank you.
James Hopkins: Okay, great. I think with that, that -- sorry.
Operator: I'll turn the floor back over to you for any further or closing comments.
Tom Linebarger: Great. Thank you for that. So, again, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for taking the time to call in today. Appreciate that, as always, and for your continued interest in Cummins. And I'll be available for any follow-up questions here this afternoon.
Mark Smith: And let me add my thanks to James. I really appreciate your attention. I'm sorry that I did not invite my dog [ph] to this quarterly call. I'll try t include her on future calls, but it was nice to have a noise-free call. Thank you very much for your attention. Bye-bye.
Tom Linebarger: Thanks everyone. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-04-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2020 Meritor Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you, Jash. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Meritor's second quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President, Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chris Villavarayan, Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, all of whom will be available for questions following the call. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor Inc. is protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the expressed written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks Todd and good morning. I'd like to begin by expressing my thanks to all our Meritor employees for their dedication and hard work as we take on the challenges we faced today. As part of an essential business, Meritor employees remain committed to supporting the delivery of medical, food and other critical products for our communities around the world. I also want to express my thanks to the frontline workers that Meritor had the privilege to support in the fight against Covid-19. I'll now spend just a couple minutes talking about the second quarter before providing an update on the status of the business today in light of Covid-19. Let's turn to Slide 3. The company was performing extremely well before the pandemic began to impact production first in China beginning in mid-January then throughout the rest of the world beginning late in the second quarter and continuing into the third. Carl will share more detail, but here you can see the highlights from the quarter. Sales were down $285 million from last year due to lower volumes. We finished the quarter however with a 12.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 12% in the same quarter of last year. That income was $240 million, up $167 million from the same period last year. This was driven by $203 million of after tax income associated with the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO. Our liquidity position at the end of the second quarter was $829 million. This represents approximately 20% of our trailing 12-month sales. Cash on the balance sheet was $508 million. We have access to the remaining $321 million of availability under our revolving credit facility and expect to be in compliance with our covenants under this facility for the remainder of the year. Although, it is still early to accurately forecast the extent of the pandemic's impact on the industry, the strong foundation we built over the past several years will provide advantages as we work through this crisis. Let's go to Slide 4. As we bring operations up around the world, the safety of our employees is our highest priority. Over time, we have improved our safety record to be comparable with the best companies in the world and it is my intent to maintain that level of excellence as we face the challenge of protecting our employees during this global health crisis. We have developed a comprehensive set of procedures that make up safe start. This plan outlines protocols for operating in this new reality. It includes procedures and policies that will be audited at each of our global locations whether it's a manufacturing plant, office, distribution center or a test environment. These practices include preventative measures in entryways and common locations, heat mapping to identify areas that require special attention, personal protective equipment, wellness checks, more frequent and in-depth cleanings, visual indicators and the attrition [Indiscernible] 0:05:52.5of social distance coaches, to ensure that we are following and sharing best practices across the company. I have asked Meritor's General Auditor to assume the additional role of Chief Safety Compliance Officer. He will consult with outside experts as needed to ensure that best practices are being implemented and followed. On Slide 5, we provide a current update on our global operations. Meritor's aftermarket distribution business ran without interruption over the past two months to maintain the supply of critical replacement parts for trucks and trailers. Our industrial business operated at lower volumes to support the production of vehicles considered critical for defense, bus and coach, terminal tractor, fire and rescue and other off highway applications. We also maintained delivery of battery electric kits from our TransPower facility in California primarily for Kalmar terminal tractors for delivery to companies like Amazon and Walmart. And we continue to work on critical electric vehicle integration projects for our customers. Currently, the majority of our operations in North America and Europe have resumed limited production. Over the coming weeks, we also expect to restart operations in South America and India. China resumed full operations last month. We acted swiftly to implement a series of actions that took effect in early April. This allowed us time to look at the business longer term and evaluate next steps. These actions included a reduction in pay for salaried employees in addition to reduce discretionary spending and capital expenditures. Since that time, we have lessened the salary reduction for most employees beginning May 1 the current reduction in payer 40% to 50% of base salaries will be reduced to 20% to 25%. Salary reductions for the executive committee including me will remain up to previously set levels of 50% to 60%. Other actions announced in March are in fact indefinitely. Now, I'll turn the call over to Carl.
Carl Anderson: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call I'll review our second quarter financial results, liquidity position, debt maturity profile and retirement related liabilities. Before I begin, I wanted to take an opportunity to express how proud I'm of our team's ability to quickly mobilize and rise to the challenges, which have been placed before us. Now, let's walk through our second quarter financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 6. Overall, sales were $871 million, down 25% from the same period last year. Sales in our commercial truck segment decreased by 33% year-over-year to $588 million. The decrease in revenue was in line with global truck market conditions as all regions saw lower production levels. The suspension of production due to COVID-19 first in China in mid-January and then late March in Europe also contributed to lower sales. In our Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer segment sales was $319 million, down $10 million or 3% from last year. Lower sales were primarily driven by decreased volumes across the segment including the beginning impacts of COVID-19 and overall market demand, partially offset by $43 million in revenue generated from our AxleTech business. Net income from continuing operations attributable to the company was $240 million compared to $73 million in the same period last year. As Jay mentioned higher net income year-over-year was driven by $203 million of after tax income associated with the termination of the aftermarket distribution arrangement with WABCO. Adjusted EBITDA was $107 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $139 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.3% compared to 12% a year ago. The improvement in margin was largely driven by a $10 million adjustment of lower incentive compensation expense to align with the revised performance expectations due to COVID-19. We also recognized the $4 million benefit resulting from a tax law change in India. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $55 million, down $33 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck came in at 9.4%, down from 10% in the prior year. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs, lower net steel cost, and other material costs. Segment adjusted EBITDA in our Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer segment was $49 million, a decrease of $3 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 40 basis points to 15.4%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $292 million compared to $19 million in the same period last year. The increase in free cash flow was driven primarily by the $265 million of cash received from WABCO. Next, I'll review the debt governs of revolving credit facility on Slide 7. The credit facility as the sole financial covenant based on priority debt which is a subset of our total outstanding debt. The calculation states priority debt cannot exceed trailing 12-month compliance EBITDA by more than 2.25x. It is important to note, the $265 million pretax income we recorded associated with the WABCO termination is included in trailing 12-month compliance EBITDA. Now let me walk you through the calculation in detail. First, priority debt is comprised of any outstanding borrowings under the revolver inclusive of any term loan funding, any outstanding US factoring and US securitization balances plus any secured lien for us consists of our capital leases. In total, priority debt as of the second quarter was $633 million. Secondly, priority debt as compared to trailing 12 months compliance EBITDA which starts with consolidated net income and then added back our depreciation, amortization, interest in taxes. Including other minor adjustments, the total 12 months trailing compliance EBITDA at the end of the second quarter was $701 million. The results in ratio are 0.9x priority debt compared to compliance EBITDA significantly under the limit of 2.25x. Furthermore, the covenant is only measured on the last day of each quarter. If compliance is achieved, the covenant is being met for the entire following quarter. As the income from the WABCO termination will be included in our priority debt calculation for four fiscal quarter is going forward, at this time, we expect to be in compliance with our covenant throughout the year and maintain access to the full credit facility. Let's move to Slide 8, which details our extended debt maturity profile and retirement liabilities. As you can see on the chart on the left, we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. In fact, we only have $4 million of debt coming due for the remainder of this year and $32 million in total debt maturities in fiscal year 2021. You will note in fiscal year 2023, we saw the maturity for our US securitization facility. We typically extend this facility annually for an additional year, which we would expect to do again later this year. The bottom line is that we have a clear runway with our debt maturities with no significant cause on cash through 2024. At the end of 2019, our net pension liability was a $122 million, which translated to a 93% overall funded status. Based on this, we expect very manageable required contributions over the next couple of years. And while we have obviously seen challenging financial markets as we ended the second quarter, our estimated funding status has actually improved from the end of 2019. This has been driven by a combination of strong US asset returns in the plan, which are up over 10% through March and higher discount rates as corporate spreads have widened. While our plans will continue to be susceptible to changes in asset returns and discount rates as we move through the remainder of the year. Our asset allocation is skewed more towards fixed income given our liability hedging strategy. Overall, we are pleased with the performance to date. Turning to our OPEB liability, as we have previously discussed we have taken steps in recent years to significantly reduce this obligation. At the end of 2019, this liability was only $67 million. Overall with an extended debt maturity profile and well-funded pension plan, we don't have any significant cost and cash from these liabilities in the near-term. In summary, the balance sheet actions we have executed over the last several years along with our current liquidity position makes us well-positioned to navigate the current environment. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Carl. Please turn to Slide 9 for our third quarter outlook. Let me highlight our assumptions, as I said it earlier segments of our operations have continued to run. We expect these businesses to contribute between 50% to 60% of our revenue during the third quarter. To restart and ramp up of our commercial truck business is not as clear, while we expect most of our plants around the world will be running in early May, there is uncertainty on timing and volume, which is driving a large range of our revenue outlook of $400 million to $500 million. Negative cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $225 million. This includes the one-time impact of the unwind of our factoring programs. These programs allow us to monetize our receivables quickly after they are generated. Removing the impact of factoring, we expect negative cash flow from operations of $25 million to $50 million during the third quarter. Turning to margins, we expect to hold sequential detrimentals in the third quarter in the range of 20% to 30%. This includes additional investment required to implement new safety protocols. We were able to achieve this due to the quick and aggressive cost containment measures we have already taken. I want to emphasize that we are running the business to focus on operational cash flow in the near term. Let's move to Slide 10. As we enter the second-half of the fiscal year and restart production, we are making sure that every safety protocol is in place, including providing the necessary PPE. With the existing challenges, it obtaining large quantities of masks, gloves, cleaning supplies and disinfectants. We will first make sure that each of our plants, distribution centers and testing labs has the necessary quantities on hand before we start allocating these supplies to global administrative offices. I have been pleased with the adjustments that our salaried employees have made to working remotely. With that in mind, our salaried employees will work from home until further notice. We have begun to see the favorable impact of our aggressive cost reduction initiatives. As I mentioned, we believe these initiatives will provide the stability necessary to minimize negative operating cash outflow in the near term. We are working closely with our customers to run production as needed to meet their schedules. Our assumptions include a significant decrease level of production for the remainder of 2020 and we will evaluate and implement additional cost actions with a focus on minimizing operating cash flow in the near term. As we now turn our attention to the longer term outlook for the company, we are evaluating the appropriate strategies for a global environment where demand for our products may be weak for many quarters. We plan to provide you with a longer term outlook for fiscal 2021 and our M2022 planned performance on our third quarter earnings call if there is a set of market forecasts that we are comfortable with for modeling purposes. This outlook will include a summation of the benefits we expect to see from the longer term actions we're in the planning phase of executing. While the pandemic created a situation unlike any we have faced in the past with the full repercussions as yet unknown, we are taking the actions we believe will put the company in the best position for the long term. I want to thank Meritor employees for their focus during this unprecedented crisis. Our employees' dedication and responsiveness to customers and to each other has been overwhelming. Now, we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.
JosephSpak: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and good to hear all your voices. I hope everyone is okay. I guess first question is even if we sort of look at the decrementals in this quarter ex some of the incentive benefit, it still seems like there's a step down on the decrementals into the next quarter. Is that just all sort of you know volume driven as you know sort of feeling the bigger the clients or is there anything else that could sort of help bridge that gap between the performance?
CarlAnderson: Yes. Good morning, Joe. Good to talk to you as well. Yes, as I think we look at the next quarter. One this, what we provided was a sequential look relative to the second quarter. I think when you cut through the math on a year-over-year basis it gets - it's kind of running a little bit in the low 20% range. And as far as we look specifically for the second quarter, as you pointed out we did benefit from lower incentive comps in our actuals, as well as the - in the one-time kind of tax impact that ran through EBITDA.
JosephSpak: Okay and yes just, while I guess actually somewhat related. Obviously, sort of taking out a bunch of cost in the short-term and I guess some of that can be viewed as temporary. But as you mentioned sort of maybe new world, new era. Is there an opportunity to sort of maybe as you reevaluate make some of those temporary savings more permanent in the mid to long term as you reevaluate the cost structure?
JayCraig: Joe, this is Jay. Thanks, very good question. Obviously, that was what I was referring to in my comments. We think the aggressive actions we took including 40% to 50% to 60% salary reductions in a very short order allowed us the time to sit back and say what is the longer term impact of this crisis look like to Meritor. And what additional actions should we take that can allow us to be successful throughout what potentially could be a longer term downturn. So we are looking at strategies as I mentioned in my comments and beginning to execute them that. We think we'll set our cost structure on the right basis for what we would expect to see for fiscal year 2021 and beyond.
JosephSpak: Yes. Jay, the tough one, you know sort of, I guess, plan for otherwise hope, hope over the best mentality, but as a veterinary industry, I wanted to I guess pick your brand and what you thought could it be the potential snapback ability of the market and maybe what you're sort of hearing maybe from some of the, even your customers because even - if you look at sort of typical peak to trough timing probably would have normally come to the end of sort of cycle sometime around the end of the calendar year maybe a little later. And COVID obviously made it much steeper, but even if you sort of don't return to the replacement levels next year, it seems like there could be some pretty healthy growth versus obviously a very depressed 2020. So what are – do you have any high level thoughts on that?
JayCraig: Well, I think it – it's, it's difficult for us to say in the near-term. And you heard the comments from our customers who have their calls, so far, they – they've been very reticent to project what the outlook looks like in future. And I think that goes for us as well. What I believe and what our team is working on is, is as you mentioned is setting up to plan for the worst and hope for the best and make sure we retain the capabilities in the company to respond to the aggressive snapback that ultimately will occur most likely in long quarters time as it always does and we're going to make certain we retain that expertise to be as successful as we have been and capturing the value on that snapback and those volumes.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question.
AlexPotter: Yes. Thanks very much. Hope everybody is doing well. You mentioned that cutting back on CapEx on discretionary spending, can you just give maybe a few examples of things that you are and are not reducing spending on just trying to get a better idea of the sort of initiative that you think are sufficiently important to continue investing in even in this macro?
ChrisVillavarayan: Sure. Good morning, Alex. I think you know me, this is Chris Villavarayan. If you look at it, for example last quarter we talked about launching our or building a new facility in Brazil where we were looking at making a significant investment. As we see the current market, we might look at for example slowing down on that investment and just really modeling out where we see the market snapback and then making decisions like that. We are very definitely proceeding with the long-term prospects for Brazil, but in the short term, we might look at slowing down our investment. Also when you think about sustaining investments through our facility imagine for markets that we're running almost 60% to 70% from where we forecast, you could look and make decisions in the short-term on what we do. However, I think one thing that, Jay, is driving that as we think of the long term strategy in terms of investment in electrification, we are not slowing down on that process and as he also mentioned in how we are running the facilities and delivering the proportion or the systems we are continuing our investments into TransPower as well as electrification for the next quarter.
AlexPotter: Okay. Very good. That's helpful. I was wondering if you could comment also on the supply chain risk, you know not all companies end up having this sort of balance sheet that you guys have. I'm thinking particularly of risks that you see upstream potentially for smaller suppliers. You know is this going to be an issue, you have solvency risk concerns for any of the suppliers that you rely on.
JayCraig: Good question, Alex. And we're using the same playbook that we put in place during the 2008-2009 recession where we immediately put up a multi-discipline team together including finance, purchasing, supply chain, manufacturing expertise to do much more active monitoring of suppliers, particularly those who we think do not have the balance sheets that may provide them enough liquidity through this time period. So far, we have not seen any disruptions, but we're monitoring it extremely closely and that playbook that we did execute in 2008-2009 was very successful for us. Included in that is engagement of outside experts that we can send in to the suppliers to assist them with operational and financial challenges that we've already locked those same experts into agreements if they are necessary.
AlexPotter: Interesting. Okay. That's good to hear. I – one thing, obviously this, this WABCO infusion was, was well timed. Can you update me us on the ongoing relationship with WABCO, if there is any I think – what is the relationship between the two companies going forward? Have you essentially severed all historical relationships now going forward or not?
JayCraig: Yes. We have a much smaller relationship here through our aftermarket business as a distributor for certain products. But it, it, I, I don't want to misrepresent it, it's a fraction of what the business was previously. And those expected revenues are embedded in our outlook for the third quarter.
AlexPotter: Okay. Very good. Last question. I know that you had historically looked at some of these smaller sorts of mom and pop machine, machine shop type operation to support aftermarket gearing and off highway. That always struck me as sort of an interesting business. I don't know I guess maybe two questions. First, do you want to continue building that part of the business through acquisition of these little companies? And question number two is, do you think COVID-19 will potentially present you with the opportunities to do that?
JayCraig: That's a very good question, Alex. I think it gets around the broader question as obviously there will be M&A opportunities that present themselves through this crisis for people who maybe don't operate as well or have the financial wherewithal to withstand the downturn. At this point in time, we are focused to make certain that our company operates successfully as it's currently configured. And we like the growth prospects of the company in areas like electrification, like our recent off highway acquisition of AxleTech, so we didn't see a burning need to add bolt-on acquisitions at this time. Now as we come out of the crisis, if there is just some incredible opportunity on the landscape and we see our revenues growing during that time period we may revisit at that time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
JasonStuhldreher: Hi, Jay, and good morning. This is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian. And just first question on margins maybe first in the Commercial Truck space. In the past we've talked about sort of layered capacity giving you the ability to sort of flex that debt, the footprint the direct labor footprint given with the variations in Commercial Truck. Just curious I mean in the margins that we saw this quarter, which I frankly thought were pretty good. Did any of those benefits from offloading that layer capacity or did that layer capacity pretty much already hit bottom by last quarter. And then similarly on Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer. I was also impressed by the margins this quarter was thinking the AxleTech acquisition would be a little bit dilutive is that not the case sort of now?
CarlAnderson: Good questions. This is Carl Anderson. Just on your first question as relates to Commercial Truck, as we look at those layered capacity cost for the most part those have pretty much been eliminated in the second quarter. We did have some that pretty much been eliminated in the second quarter. We did have some that carried a little bit in the first quarter. And as we go forward as we're kind of back in ramp up mode depending on the supply chains, you could see a little bit maybe some incremental cost kind of coming in over the next couple of quarters, but nowhere near where we were running last year with a high truck markets kind of at that point. And then as relates to your aftermarket question. I think the AxleTech business, I think; we're very pleased with the amount of synergies we've been able to achieve as it relates to that. One thing that's running a little bit softer than initial plan is just overall revenue for that business. And so I think the margins aren't exactly where we want them to be currently, but as you know over time as revenue begins hopefully at some point pick up, I think we're going to be in good position with an acquisition in that business.
JayCraig: And just adding to Carl's comment, I think one of the benefits we got with also the layered capacity costs coming down is also a benefit from not seeing the premium freight costs associated with all of that. So we have seen some benefit both from the layered capacity as well as the premium freight. And I think in terms of the overall cost of purchase components versus our own internal cost there's also the benefit that we're seeing from that as well.
JasonStuhldreher: All right. Got it. Okay, very helpful color. And then just I guess more broadly as we think about the electrification opportunity, Jay, I think you've mentioned, the team has mentioned how pivotal of a year 2020 we're shaping out to be in terms of the awards activity pipeline that was going to be coming here in the next few quarters. Just curious if that pipeline is still full or if that is – if the industry is basically push that out 8 to 12 months as we deal with the current situation?
JayCraig: Yes. It's a very good question, Jason. Obviously, I think it's a question on the industry spend where this will be viewed as something that can be deferred to preserve capital. But so far all of the programs we're associated with particularly the largest program, the PACCAR program, it remains on schedule. I've had technical updates with the PACCAR team recently. Our products are performing extremely well and so we see no sign that our customers not too dissimilar from us are not continuing to prioritize that spend. And as Chris mentioned in one of his comments, this is one area with all the cost reductions we've made both on the CapEx and expense side. We are retaining our investments in electrification and we continually continue to respond to active code opportunities and still look at this year to be a very big year for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.
RyanBrinkman: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Is there anything that you can relate about customer order books in the back half of the calendar year after lockdowns are presumably lifted? I'm sure their visibility is also low, but when you look across your various customers and your various end markets you know commercial and highway, off-highway, specialty trailer et cetera, are there notable differences and how you expect these end markets to bounce back or hold up.
ChrisVillavarayan: And maybe I'll take this one Ryan, just you know as you can see that we're not giving much guidance beyond the next quarter. Again, it's from the perspective that we are seeing from our customers as well. But at a very high level, let's just break it down into maybe the three areas. And if you think about aftermarket and we've looked through last quarter as well as you know what we're seeing at least in the short-term window, aftermarket is obviously holding well you know when you think about 75% of the products that we use to travel by truck. The aftermarket seems to be holding strong. We see a slight weakening but nothing that's dramatic in the near future. Moving to the specialty defense of highway space. As I think Carl pointed out, we have noticed, you know, we did notice at the back end of that order board was getting weaker, we could say maybe about 20%, 30% but nothing of significance obviously consistent demand on that side and we got to see how that plays out. The truck market is obviously the big one as we see the customers coming up in April or late April and early May, that's where we're going to probably see what the real order boards come in. So, we – all the customers will be up of you know as we see most will be up as up May 4. So that would be probably a good time to see a perspective. But then breaking it up by region maybe I'll just address in that way China, you know as, as you all of you know I think we've seen a quick V and markets are back now whether that will hold up is all based on stimulus. And then India and South America are still under a pretty hard shut down and so time will tell how those two markets will come up. But in those two markets, inventories were low as you know with the FX. And the other two markets have addressed previously, I think we just have to see where our customers come back at.
RyanBrinkman: Okay. Thanks. You know those are helpful rundown. Just lastly from me, why are you it looks like unwinding some of your factoring facilities. Can you remind us, was that something that was previously planned you know prior to your mention in that March 25 release? And does it relate to the various Volvo facilities mentioned in the K or the US one with P&C that I think has a covenant attached. I'm just asking because it would seem maintaining the facilities might help bolster liquidity in the current environment or am I missing something? Thanks.
CarlAnderson: Yes. Good morning, Ryan. It's Carl. Good question. You know I think that the factoring unwind is really – it's really that's a function of having a lot lower sales especially - really in Europe where we are utilizers of the supply chain financing program. So it's - if the unwind is just more, it's more natural because we're not able to sell receivables in normal course because the sales are a lot lower. The real impact is just because you have a timing mismatch as far as obviously the payables need to kind of run off in the working capital perspective. And you are unable to sell new receivables. So yes, it is consistent with what we kind of provided back in the March 25, March 25th 8-K that we put out as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc. You may proceed with your questions.
JamesPicariello: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just regarding your covenant, the total priority debt over, over trailing EBITDA, I mean it seems very encouraging how the EBITDA is calculated; you just to clarify this include the gain on the WABCO aftermarket sale now. Is that right? And then, has there been any change on that point? And then just based on your third quarter outlook that outlook clearly be the most challenged environment, is it safe to assume that the Meritor can now avoid any covenant breach over the next 12-months? Thanks, Jay and Carl.
CarlAnderson: Yes. Thanks, James. Yes. I mean I think what you're seeing from the WABCO income, yes, it is included in the trailing 12-month calculation. And so as I was highlighting that we're kind of carry through for the next really four quarters as well as we look to calculate the overall compliance to EBITDA. So as we look at what's in front of us not only third quarter but for the rest of this year, our expectation is we will not have any issues with our debt covenant and we feel that coupled with the overall liquidity of the company. So with the amount of cash on hand I think we're in a pretty good spot to be able to manage the current environment.
JamesPicariello: Okay. Yes. That's great to hear. And then just on that factor receivable the previous question, can that reverse partially by as early as the fourth quarter?
CarlAnderson: Yes. That's exactly right. And so that's how we're characterizing it. There is, we'll call it a one-time impact at a sales levels dropped significantly based on the lower production volume. But as the fourth quarter, if there is some pick up and production kind of comes back, you will see the cash benefits at that point in time.
JamesPicariello: Got it. And then it sounds as though you guys were not stepping off the accelerator in terms of future EV investment for this year. But just in terms of CapEx is a good starting point and assumption of maybe a similar level of your CapEx as a percentage of sales for this year-
CarlAnderson: I think that's early -
JamesPicariello: Or early to be?
CarlAnderson: That's a good way to think about. I think the last quarter that we had a guided about $115 million of CapEx. So it's probably closer in the $80 million, $85 million range at this point as we think for the remainder – for the full year. So that kind of around 3% is probably the right way to think about it.
JamesPicariello: Got it. And then my apologies if I missed this, did you mention the AxleTech contribution in the quarter, so just wondering on that point and then how the synergies are trending, does the current environment accelerate or maybe delay the synergy pull through.
CarlAnderson: No. I would say on the synergy side in AxleTech, we're coming in right on plan and actually we're looking and we feel very good with all the actions that we have been able to take since we acquired the company last year. You know there is a reference, obviously, we are seeing some softness in overall just revenue levels, specifically in the off-highway market, as well as in aftermarket. So overall the margin performance is still probably not where we want it to be, but a lot of that now is driven more on the revenue side as opposed to any of the cost actions that we've taken to date.
JamesPicariello: And what about the just the revenue contribution in the quarter.
CarlAnderson: Yes, it was about $43 million, so very consistent with what we saw in the first quarter as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. You may proceed with your question.
FaheemSabeiha: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the guidance you are able to provide for FY 3Q and the additional color regarding the revenue breakdown but can you provide a little more color around Aftermarket, Industrial, and Trailer, I mean, then imply the sizable hit, and I know first talk about aftermarket coming down a little, just wondering if most of that's in Trailer or equally across all three parts of that business.
CarlAnderson: Good morning, Faheem. You know I think one of the things that's in there is the impact from the WABCO, agreement being, our distribution agreement being terminated and so prior to the crisis that was a probably a book of business about a $115 million. So you are seeing a headwind now in this quarter that we're in as well and that will continue on as we kind of go forward. So a significant piece of that really relates to that particular business.
FaheemSabeiha: Okay. And how much are you baking in from AxleTech acquisition in 3Q?
CarlAnderson: Well, again I would say, we've not kind of given line by line guidance on the revenue, but I would just say the first two quarters that we've seen this year in AxleTech has been running a little bit north of $40 million of revenue. And I would expect - we don't expect probably some little bit further softness for a period of time for that business.
FaheemSabeiha: Okay and then you commented a little on the visibility in the back half of the year, but as far as 3Q, I mean, you guys provided a pretty wide band and I'm just curious if that's based solely on orders received thus far as truck production restarts or if there could be some upside later in the quarter?
JayCraig: I think it's really almost entirely based on the lack of visibility on the OE manufacturing side. So if you take the business that your questions, Carl, you were just discussing the aftermarket business and Industrial that represents roughly a 50% of our expected revenue in that guidance. So if you took the remaining revenue, we have almost a 50% range of aftermath on the truck OE business. And I think that's very consistent with what we're hearing from our customers both in our private discussions and what you've heard them discussed publicly as they've released their earnings. It's just - it's a very opaque visibility window right now and after this quarter. And so that's why we put as wide range on revenue as we did. But understand this revenue estimate was important for us internally as well because it gave us the markers on which we have to manage the business to achieve our objectives of having the operating cash outflow be a very limited amount.
FaheemSabeiha: Yes. Okay. And as far as the 20% to 30% sequential downside earnings convergence, I mean, is that going to be balanced between commercial truck in aftermarket, industrial and trailer to one of those segments will look a little weaker?
JayCraig: I don't think where we're providing that level of guidance just given the volatility, I mentioned on the revenue outlook. But what I would make note of is included in that downside sequential guidance is the incremental cost of providing the safety materials that we need to ramp up our production such as masks, face shields, sanitary products, positional cleaning. So there is some incremental cost that's being incurred right now that's outside our norms in running the business.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for any further remarks.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 conference call. Please reach out to me directly with any questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-01-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2020 Meritor Inc. earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Meritor’s first quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President, Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chris Villavarayan, Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, all of whom will be available for questions following the call. The slides accompanying today’s call are available at meritor.com. We’ll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we’re recording, is the property of Meritor Inc., is protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the express written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you’ll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I’ll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks Todd. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first quarter and have a number of highlights we would like to share with you today. Let's look at Slide 3, which provides an overview. I am especially pleased that we continue to perform well despite production volumes being down year-over-year in most of our global end markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9% and we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.64. As markets have weakened, we have taken steps to manage cost and maintain a downside conversion of 15% which is at the lower end of our expected range of 15% to 20%. We are effectively managing what we can control considering the cyclical nature of our business and the rapid declines in virtually all of global end markets, continuing our track record of operational excellence. In the first several months of the fiscal year, we continued to execute our share repurchase program, finalized a meaningful new electrification agreement with Paccar, were added to the S&P 600 small-cap index, enhanced our technology and product portfolios and appointed Chris Villavarayan, Chief Operating Officer. As you saw in the press release announcing Chris's appointment, he has been with Meritor for 20 years in various leadership roles. In each of those positions, he has excelled and has made significant contributions toward achieving the targets we set forth both in M2016 and 2019. Global operating responsibility for both of Meritor's business segments was the next appropriate step for Chris and critical to leadership development for our team as we move forward. Notably, Meritor's electrification business is transitioning to low-volume production more quickly than we anticipated as adoption of battery electric commercial vehicles increases globally. This is demonstrated by the new business award we announced today with Paccar. Meritor is providing customers with a range of electric powertrain technology including fully integrated system solutions. We are confident that our differentiated offerings are establishing Meritor as a leader in the industry. With Chris's transition to Chief Operating Officer, I will be personally dedicating more time to electrification as we expand product development, integrate TransPower and grow our customer base. I look forward to having more direct involvement in refining and executing our strategic plan as we go to market with our blue horizon portfolio that serves global customers in many different applications. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a capital allocation update. On our last earnings call mid-November, we noted that we have repurchased $60 million of shares as part of our planned $300 million share repurchase program for fiscal year 2020. Since that time, we have repurchased an additional $140 million of shares for a total of 8.8 million shares purchased effectively completing two thirds of the 2020 program. Late last fiscal year, we exercised our option to terminate the aftermarket distribution arrangement with Fabco. We now expect to complete that transaction in this quarter with proceeds anticipated to be at the high-end of the $225 million to $265 million range we previously disclosed. As a result, we accelerated $200 million of repurchases in the first four months of this fiscal year. As we have said, we believe that committing capital towards significant share repurchases is one of the primary ways we intend to achieve our shareholder return objectives under M2022. On Slide 5 we highlighted variety of products introduced in the quarter. These new offerings further demonstrate that we continue to expand our portfolio maintaining the aggressive new product launch cadence initiated under our M plans. As part of M2022, we have a clear view toward maintaining our leading market share positions with best in class products and services. We are introducing new products including our single piston air disc break in our range of high-efficiency axles. This includes a new vocational axle that is the first of its type in decades. We are also bringing to market the lightest weight trailer suspension in the industry providing 23,000 pound capacity for tankers, flatbeds and other demanding vocational applications. Let's take a look at Slide 6, first I am pleased to announce today that we were selected as Paccar supplier of electric powertrain for and Peter [ph] and heavy duty battery electric vehicles. Production is targeted to begin in 2021. We are very excited about this opportunity with such an important customer. As you know, we have had a long-standing relationship with Paccar and look forward to expanding the scope of that collaboration. Additionally, Meritor has also delivered six blue horizon electric powertrains to Daimler Trucks North America for it's EM2 innovation fleet. These are being manufactured in one of our facilities in North Carolina. We continue to be a leader in electrification for the commercial vehicle industry and are positioning the company for long-term success by expanding our product portfolio and technology capabilities. Last year we announced in addition to the 14XE, we will begin development of the medium duty 12XE and the 17XE for heavy duty application primarily in Europe. And as you heard last week, we've acquired the remaining voting equity interest in TransPower for $16 million, expanding our offering to include full EV integration capability that enables us to continue delivering complete battery electric systems to our OEM customers. As I've said, the pace of investment and opportunities in this space is accelerating more quickly than we originally foresaw and we believe this will result in additional production awards for us over the next 12 months. Today our book of expected business is greater than $200 million and growing. We also have line of sight to other potential production awards that could drive our revenue pipeline north of $500 million, which we expect to be profitable as production ramps up in fiscal 2021. As we are successful in finalizing these opportunities, we will be sure to update you. Overall, I believe we have tremendous opportunities in front of us and I'm very pleased with how we are positioned in electrification. On Slide 7, I wanted to highlight our investment to build a manufacturing facility in Brazil. As we see the region continue to recover and grow, this is the right time for us to optimize our footprint. This project is one of the largest manufacturing cost reduction programs in M2022 and will help us achieve our margin objective. As we mentioned last quarter we are happy to be part of the e-Consortium with Volkswagen in Brazil, which provides us with the opportunity to supply axles for E delivery vehicles. As we look at the quarter, I'm pleased with our performance as we navigate end market volumes that are significantly lower on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us with significant financial flexibility. Our increased free cash flow generation provides us with the opportunities to continue returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan while we also invest in our core product portfolio and electrification business. The company is well positioned to deliver strong growth, margin improvement and robust free cash flow generation under M2022. With that I'll turn the call over to Carl for more detail on the financials.
Carl Anderson: Thanks Jay and good morning. On today's call I'll review our first quarter financial results and updated full-year guidance. Overall, as you heard from Jay, we delivered a solid start to 2020. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.64, reflecting our ability to manage the business effectively across current end market conditions. Additionally, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and in the first four months of the fiscal year, we have repurchased over 10% of outstanding shares. This reflects our continued confidence in achieving and delivering on our M2022 targets. Let's walk through the details by turning to Slide 8 where you'll see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $901 million in the quarter down $137 million from a year ago driven primarily by lower global truck production and lower volumes across your other businesses. This was partially offset by revenue from AxleTech, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019. As anticipated we saw a significant decrease in North America Class 8 production in the first quarter. Compared to the same period last year, production was down almost 17,000 units or about 20%. Additionally in Europe, production was down approximately 18,000 units or 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and in India, production volumes which were down almost 40% continued to be impacted by the emission standard changeover that will occur on April 1, which requires all vehicles sold after this date to comply with the new standards. This is resulting in an industry-wide focus of reducing inventory levels prior to the changeover. Additionally, we are seeing tighter credit conditions which is also contributing to the market challenges and finally revenue from AxleTech helped to offset slowing market conditions in our North America aftermarket specialty and trailer businesses. Looking at the right side of the page, we did a good job of managing cost to limit total downside earning conversion to 15% on the lower revenue. Lower volume decreased sales by $127 million or 12% from last year. On this revenue decline, adjusted EBITDA decreased $17 million or 14%. Our ability to manage cost on lower revenue was highlighted this quarter as we were able to drive lower material, labor and operating [ph] expense which resulted in very solid downside conversion performance. In addition foreign exchange was a slight headwind on sales as the US dollar had strengthen year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by $4 million compared to the prior year. Overall, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $98 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9%. Looking at the left-hand side of the chart, gross margin came in at 14.1% this quarter an increase of 50 basis points from a year ago. This improvement was mainly driven by lower overall material costs including reduced layered capacity cost. You also recall, we announced a restructuring plan at the end of fiscal year last September. The plan was implemented in anticipation of the slowing market conditions we are now experiencing. As a result we did recognize $5 million related to the restructuring in the first quarter. As we move down the table on the left, you'll see that we're reporting $39 million of GAAP net income from continuing operations. In addition to lower sales compared to last year in fiscal 2019 we recognized a $31 million gain from the remeasurement of the Maremont asbestos liability, which did not repeat. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $52 million resulting in $0.64 per adjusted diluted share. And finally free cash was negative $35 million this quarter compared to negative $12 million in the same period last year. As you may recall, we typically use cash in the first quarter due to fewer selling days as a result of the holiday season which generally drives lower revenues and incentive compensation payments for achieve performance in 2019. Let's move to Slide 9, which details our first quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our commercial truck segment, sales decreased by 20% to $622 million. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower truck production across most regions in the segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $56 million, down $21 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck came in at 9% down from 9.9% in the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by lower freight and material cost, including reduced net steel and layer capacity cost. Lower labor and burden cost also contributed to managing to 13% downside conversion on the lower revenue in the segment. In our aftermarket industrial and trailer segment, sales were $370 million up $14 million or 5% from last year. The increase in sales was primarily driven by revenue from AxleTech, partially offset by decreased volumes across the segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $40 million which was flat compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 60 basis points to 12.6%. The decrease was driven primarily by the impact from AxleTech as the expected benefit from synergies continues to ramp up to full run rate. Next I'll review our updated fiscal year 2020 global market outlook on Slide 10. We are revising production levels for India to between 265,000 to 285,000 units down over 15% from our prior outlook. Based on the market uncertainty we're seeing in this region, it is likely that the production levels after April 1 may not fully compensate for the lower production levels we are seeing now. In Europe, we're lowering our production outlook by 5,000 reflecting slightly lower truck demand and finally we are revising our outlook for the US trailer market to approximately 230,000 units to 240,000 units as we are now forecasting the trailer market to decrease more in line with Class 8 truck production. On the next slide, we provide a summary of our 2020 guidance based on these updated market assumptions. We now expect revenue to be approximately $3.7 million which is at the lower end of our previously provided guidance. We're also revising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin to 11%. We expect to manage our downside revenue conversion at the low-end of our expected range through our laser focus on managing cost. As a result of the slightly lower expectations, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be approximately $2.75 which is consistent with the low-end of our previous guidance. And finally, we now expect to generate free cash flow of $165 million this year. While we cannot control the global markets, we are pleased with our team's ability to quickly adjust to market changes and delivered solid financial results as we begin our M2022 plan. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Faheem Sabeiha: Hi. Good morning, guys and thanks for taking my questions and Chris, congrats on the promotion. Jay you mentioned the $500 million revenue opportunity for the EV portfolio, but I was wondering what's baked into your guide this year and I guess what does the ramp look like over the next few years.
Jay Craig: As I mentioned in my comments, the production of the Paccar work begins next year. So we're wrapping up our capabilities on the manufacturing side particularly at TransPower to deliver those vehicles beginning in 2021 and then we see them reach what we would call full production rate during 2022.
Faheem Sabeiha: Okay. And can you talk about the revenue content of these EV systems on the Paccar trucks plus the other platforms you expect to go live on versus your contents on a diesel engine. I just want to understanding what the profitability looks like on these projects.
Jay Craig: We're not disclosing specifics on that right now but the way you could think about it is this is somewhere between prototype and low-volume production. So the prices are quite a bit higher than we would expect when it reaches full production. So even though the range we gave at our last Analyst Day of 5 to 10 times the content when we got to full production mode these particular content levels are quite a bit higher than that because we're still somewhat at the prototype stage of these volumes.
Faheem Sabeiha: Okay. And is there any white space left in the portfolio and EV portfolio or are there other services or offerings that Meritor is maybe eyeing that would increase the EV value proposition of the customer at this point?
Jay Craig: Absolutely. As I mentioned in the comments, really twofold, we're thrilled with our purchase of the remaining equity at TransPower. We think that integration capabilities have significant growth opportunities for us in all different types of applications, be them medium duty refuse, school buses, heavy-duty, so a lot of white space growth. But just as importantly, I discussed our intent to launch our 17Xe and 17Xe electric exile. Right now we're running with just the 14Xe and those other two actual offerings will bring us into different market segments.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
James Picariello: So just at a high level regarding the guidance, is the generalization here that we're seeing some additional weakening across US trailers, Europe, India and you're still delivering a mid-teens on just that modest weakening in the markets that you're seeing?
Carl Anderson: James, it's Carl. I think that's right. I think if you look at the guidance, the markets we did take down are what your referenced. We're still seeing North America come in relatively consistent with what we thought previously and it's really just the capabilities and ability for us to manage the cost structure to be at that lower end of our downside conversion levels of that -- around that 15% and that's what we're really managing the company to.
James Picariello: Got it. And then can you just talk about what the status of your internal actions are with respect to, is the restructuring plan completely finalized now and then maybe just some other cost-our initiatives that help support the margin resilience for the year and also how are commodities trending?
Jay Craig: You would expect James company operating in deeply cyclical environments that we do. We're constantly looking at our cost structure really with the target to try and convert if we can at the lower end of that conversion guidance that we provide of 15% to 20%. Obviously we're successful in doing that this first quarter in spite of this being a quarter of our resolve rapid ramp downs in production. While we're continuously looking at actions that we could potentially take to manage that very volatile volume environment.
James Picariello: Okay. And is the status of the restructuring plan is that completely finalized or do you still have some more work to do?
Jay Craig: Again we are still -- there are of the previous restructuring plan we announced that is virtually complete, but again we continue to monitor our cost structure and if we see further declines in our market expectations, we will have to take additional cost actions but I believe we've established a track record over the last half dozen years of being very good at reacting to that very, very quickly.
James Picariello: Got it. Appreciate it. And then just on AxleTech and maybe I missed this, so my apologies, but what was the contribution in the quarter for AxleTech and how are you thinking about the full-year in terms of the revenue and the synergies that should be realized for AxleTech this year?
Carl Anderson: Yes, James, it’s Carl. If you look at the AxleTech revenue, we had about $43 million of revenue from AxleTech. I think what we're seeing, as it relates to the synergies expectations we’re actually kind of above our internal planning from an expectation what we -- that we're delivering on. I think the business itself, we're seeing some general softness just like you're seeing whether it's in the Highway, defense and aftermarket kind of areas of the business which is similar to what we're seeing with the rest of Meritor’s business. But I would say overall, we continue to be very pleased with the strategy and with the acquisition of the company. I think revenue is a little bit softer than what we’re originally planning, if we had the discussion six months ago, but overall, what we're very pleased with is really just the team's ability to execute on the synergy plan and where we stand at this point.
James Picariello: Got it, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Alex Potter: Hi, guys. Interested in digging in, I guess maybe a little bit more on this EV opportunity with PACCAR. I guess what I'm trying to understand is once this is in run rate production, are you primarily going to be providing them with eAxles, drivetrain components or is it going to be something that flows through TransPower, these fully electrified chassis type products? Thanks.
Carl Anderson: Okay, good question, Alex. The short answer is both. So, that's the beauty of the investment in TransPower is we truly felt that two plus two equals three or four in the Meritor products and the customer relationships we brought could be added with TransPower’s capabilities on in that they're able to provide them the full integration for an electric vehicle. So we will be working now with our wholly owned subsidiary of TransPower on providing fully integrated electric vehicles for PACCAR. And they will be composed also where we can have have Meritor components including eAxles on some of the vehicles.
Alex Potter: Okay, thanks, I guess I mean the reason I asked the question is I think you may agree or maybe not, with that. But eventually presumably once electric vehicle penetration reaches a certain threshold, the truck manufacturers themselves are going to have to decide what they view as core and what they're going to rely on the supply chain for. And I got to believe that at some point, they'll take some of that content and do it internally. Maybe that's not the case in the sort of quasi prototype space but I don't know what's your view on when you think the OEMs said on that line differently?
Carl Anderson: No, I think as we've spoken before we couldn't agree with you more, that's fine. We've taken what we've labeled an open architecture model towards our work primarily out of TransPower, where we work very closely with our OE’s development teams and work with them on what capabilities they will eventually want to in-source. And as we've mentioned specifically, as an example, we're looking forward to them in sourcing the battery sourcing and battery management systems. We're doing that right now. But we expect that they will integrate that over time because they have actually greater scale for purchasing of those. But offsetting that decline in revenue on that end will be two different items on the other side, coming up which is one are eAxles which were developing and getting to full run rate production will begin to be placed on more vehicles with significantly more content than a traditional axle. And then secondarily, there will be a segment of the market that won't have the scale that will be able to execute all the integration services. So we will be providing those as our technology is proven.
Alex Potter: Interesting. Okay, very good. That that makes good sense. I was wondering then outside of electrification, some of the other maybe more slightly more near-term growth initiatives that you've spoken about recently, thinking about things like off-highway precision gearing, maybe medium duty truck share disc brakes, pretty sure I'm omitting a couple more here as well. But if you could maybe just rank order those opportunities based on your recent experience, which ones are doing better than plan in line with plan and maybe some that are performing below expectations?
Jay Craig: What I'm going to do is, is like Chris, I wanted him to speak about this breaking opportunities, because we take they are significant, but obviously the biggest opportunity we have during this planning period through 2022 is the successful integration of AxleTech and making sure we garner all of those costs and revenue synergies, particularly as we focus on the off-highway military opportunities there. But I would Chris to also speak about the disc braking side.
Chris Villavarayan: Thanks, Jay and good morning, Alex. I think when you think about M22 and our target is $300 million of revenue. And as you look at our presentation, we talked about seven new products, and the one right in the middle is the disc brake, our single piston disc brake that we’re launching. As we announced over a year-ago, we have a standard agreement on air disc brakes with Daimler. And we're looking as one customer and as we're growing here in the future, we plan to take this globally and grow the disc brakes. So the disc brake business is a considerable part of our growth strategy going forward.
Alex Potter: Great, very good, thanks a lot guys.
Chris Villavarayan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Brian Johnson: Great, I both have kind of outlook kind of housekeeping question and then a more strategic question. In terms of just and I know you have hit in this before, but the commercial truck downside conversion was very strong at 15%. I was particularly struck by the how gross margins held in which would seem to imply that perhaps you're managing detrimentals on the SG&A OpEx side. Could you maybe talk about that or in particular with the gross margin get better, was there a commodity tailwind there?
Carl Anderson: Yes, Brian it’s Carl, I think you're right on the gross margin, what we did see is we did see some benefit from steel in the quarter, kind of similar in line what we talked about back in November as far as outlook for the full-year. So I would say steel was probably a mid single digit million tailwind for us in the quarter. We also had a pretty significant improvement in cost as it relates to labor and burden in the quarter as well as really managing kind of our freight expenses well. So it's really, it was a combination of all of those items which were all around kind of the same type of magnitude for the quarter in which we saw which helped really drive the improvement in gross margin for us.
Brian Johnson: Okay, second question around what are you seeing in kind of the mid truck market in North America that gives you some greater confidence in both how it’s held up and then how it's going to look over the coming year?
Carl Anderson: Well, right now in terms of the market, I think we're in line with where we see, let's call it the external rating agencies coming in ACT and FTR between 240 to 250. And then on top of that, as I look at the line rates that we're seeing from our customers, I believe all those three are actually boxing in very closely. So we're quite comfortable with what we see going forward. Maybe your question on with respect to new trucks and where we see that going in the future, I think trucks are becoming far more efficient as we see. And obviously, we've seen over the last two years and with the path of electrification diesels got to get even more efficient. So I think that's one place where we've really play strongly. And so I think it's equally important because if you think about our high efficiency axles that we've launched recently as well as you know, the axles that we have coming, Jay talked about the new vocational axle, we really believe that the efficiency gain will drive it and I just want to clarify one point also on the forecast, it's 245,000 to 255,000.
Brian Johnson: Okay, and then finally the PACCAR obviously prototype to look in its early days but then you talked about some things like battery management, how are you thinking about the software that would span across managing the flow from the battery, the flow through the power electronics, and then the actual control, the motors itself, is that something where you're whether it's some of the acquisitions you made, you're writing the software, or are you basically providing the hardware and the OEM partners doing the software?
Carl Anderson: Very good question, Brian. I mean, that's why the TransPower investment and now the acquisition of the remaining equity was so critical, TransPower provides supervisory controls to the software in that area, that makes the whole system run including instrumentation on the vehicle, breaking all the other supervisory controls. They also provide the battery management controls that determine the energy rate of energy flow and the utilization of energy. So we do have software and software engineers at TransPower. In addition, we've ramped up within Meritor, our software engineering capability just to manage the features in the eAxle because that eAxle obviously containing motor components, cooling components requires a lot of software system intellectual properties. So we have an entire software team here in our Troy research center that's focused on the software on the eAxle as well.
Brian Johnson: And as part of that, are you getting close loop data out of vehicles on the road that would allow you to refine the algorithms and control algorithms?
Carl Anderson: Yes, we welcome any of our investors or analysts to come visit TransPower in San Diego and you can ride on the test vehicles with me and see how they operate. We have thousands and thousands of test miles on these vehicles right now.
Brian Johnson: And any plan once those get on the road to continue to harvest the data, I’m thinking here of last night and?
Carl Anderson: Yes, continuously. Sorry for misunderstanding your question. But yes, it’s true.
Brian Johnson: Yes, I know, I'm thinking of the advantage the Tesla has in terms of getting for its BMS and control systems?
Carl Anderson: Correct, although I think as we heard in a previous question, it is our expectation with the large OEs that they will start to take control of management of some of that data as well. And we're very open and working with them to enable them to do that.
Brian Johnson: Okay, thank you.
Carl Anderson: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Ryan Brinkman: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Clearly you have accelerated the share repurchases here, which as you've mentioned before, provides flexibility toward meeting those longer-term targets in a wider variety of macro scenarios. I'm curious though, just given that only $100 million remains whether you intend to pursue another authorization or what your plans might be after the current authorization is completed?
Carl Anderson: Good morning, Ryan. It's Carl, I think you're absolutely right, we have $100 million left to go which the board has authorized us. And we've been in the first four months pretty aggressive in the share repurchases. We did signal last quarter that we have an opportunity in front of us over the next couple of years is related to what we're generating in free cash flow to repurchase up to potentially another 400 million of shares. And so I think our approach will be we'd like to fully execute and complete the existing program. But I would believe that once we do that, we'll be in a position to seek further authorization, especially where the stock is currently trading.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on Slide 8 regarding that catch all volume mix performance, other category driver of EBITDA, I know you'd call it out your decremental track for the lower end of your targeted range, which indicates solid performance within that category. But are you just able to maybe disaggregate that bucket a little bit, what is electrification investment running within this category? And how are you thinking about the impact of performance or electrification investment for the full fiscal year?
Carl Anderson: Yes, I think Ryan as we look at the quarter specifically, electrification really was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis at least in the first quarter, we do expect that to continue to ramp-up for the rest of this fiscal year. And I think what we were talking about, probably up about $10 million or so from a year-ago. So overall as it relates about that line item itself, when you kind of do the math is about 13% downside conversion with all the components but as we go forward, we do see this pickup and ramp up in electrification spend especially with the success we've had with the new PACCAR win as well as with the TransPower acquisition.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay, great. Just lastly from me regarding that new facility in Brazil, there's been some reticence to invest more capital in light vehicle capacity in that region on the part of suppliers. Can you just maybe talk a little bit? Why you're excited about this? Is it a case of increased localization, which helps to offset currency risk? Or also, I heard you say that it was a significant cost savings move. So maybe it's replacing some older, more expensive capacity anymore how to think about that would be helpful, thanks.
Chris Villavarayan: Yes, excellent, Ryan. This is Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that one. So I think you hit on two points that we've been in Brazil for several years, actually over 50 years. And our current location is landlocked, and we're unable to grow from that site. And the Brazilian market, as you could imagine, and you have seen through many of our quarters is a very important market for Meritor. And so we made the decision many years ago to make a long-term commitment here and we've been working on deciding a new facility here for over 10 years. And so with the market continuing to strengthen and we've seen it strengthened over the last four to five years are our thoughts are we need a new facility, we’ll add more capacity and drive local content to your point also bring us closer to our customers and also drive the best-in-class cost. It provides us yet another opportunity, have to build a new facility that's more modernized and then continues to drive our cost position. So it is one of the largest as Jay pointed out, cost reduction opportunities in our M22 plan.
Ryan Brinkman: Great, it’s very helpful. Thanks a lot.
Chris Villavarayan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Joseph Spak: Thanks, everyone. I guess first just on the aftermarket industrial trailer segment, so margins are down. You called out in some of the integration. You lowered your trailer outlook but then the synergies ran through the year. Like what do we expect margins for the year, for the whole year in that segment to be now like, can they be fired? Or should we sort of start modeling them down now given some of the incremental headwinds?
Carl Anderson: Yes, I think, Joe what we are seeing, we definitely see a margin increase in kind of from the current run rate that we finished the first quarter in. The one thing to take into account is just the overall just general softness we're seeing across the segment, obviously, we talked trailers, but also with the industrial and off-highway parts of the business and aftermarket itself that we're seeing here in North America. We're just seeing some general softness, but our expectations, as you know, we don't give a number specifically for the year by this segment, but we definitely see that margin increasing progressing throughout the year.
Joseph Spak: Driven by the synergies ramping on?
Carl Anderson: Yes.
Joseph Spak: Okay, Jay the TransPower full acquisition, not a surprise, I think you've sort of hinted or indicated this could be possible. But you've also been working very closely with them to-date. So like, just what specifically does sort of the full ownership allow you to do now that you weren't able to do before?
Jay Craig: Well, I think it's just overall the statement to the employee base there of how importantly are to Meritor. I think we're the perfect home for them. And what we've found in the period that we've had an investment in TransPower is those benefits are even greater than we originally estimated. And we each bring different skill sets. Obviously Meritor has over 100 year history of production for the commercial vehicle industry. And we can assist TransPower as they're moving from this low volume prototype stage to production stage. And we actually have a Head of Production that resides in San Diego and has for many months now. That's an executive of Meritor that is running the production floor. And TransPower brings to us the development expertise in this particular area and jump starts us as a full vehicle integrator. So I think overall, it's been a perfect marriage, the employees at TransPower that I meet are just thrilled to be part of Meritor. So I think it's just a natural progression.
Joseph Spak: Okay, and then lastly from me, with the appointment of Chris to COO, very exciting and I appreciate Chris, all Chris's sort of comments and look forward to talking more with him. But you've also like been an operating story and operating at a very high level for some time. So what specifically did you see that led you to believe that now is the right time to have that role? And I guess I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but is there any element of succession planning in this decision as well?
Jay Craig: Well, to be honest, there's always elements of succession planning whenever anybody gets promoted. But I'm not saying that in any time in the foreseeable future, I see stepping away from the company. It's really twofold. Chris has really been my partner in time on the operating side. I was reading through my prepared remarks, almost everything related to the operating side of the product side. I would say Chris has either led or we've jointly led. So I think a lot of it is recognition of Chris’s importance to the business. But secondarily also, as I've mentioned, the rate of the ramp-up of the electrification business has been much happened much more quickly than any of us anticipated. And those capital allocation decisions and other critical decisions around that business have really ended up flowing to my desk as you would expect, and I think it's the right time just for me to get more directly involved with that and make sure we're all aligned on those different decision points we have we encountered.
Joseph Spak: Great, I really appreciate that color. Thank you.
Jay Craig: Okay, thank you.
Carl Anderson: Thanks Joe.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Todd Chirillo for any closing remarks.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our call today. Please reach out to me directly, if you have any questions. Thank you and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-11-13 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2019 Meritor earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir. 
Todd Chirillo: Thank you Catherine. Good morning everyone and welcome to Meritor’s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President, and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today’s call are available at meritor.com. We’ll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we’re recording, is the property of Meritor Inc., is protected by U.S. and international copyright law, and may not be rebroadcast without the express written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you’ll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I’ll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks Todd and good morning. We appreciate you joining us today for a look at our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Let’s go to Slide 3. Our performance this year was excellent. You can see we have consistently delivered meaningful improvement over the past three years. Since launching M2019, revenue was up 25%, adjusted EBITDA margin has expanded by 25% or 240 basis points, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is up 140%.  In a moment, I want to highlight some of our achievements during M2019, but first let me make a few comments about this past year. We saw commercial vehicle volumes at peak levels, closing out the year at 359.000 units, up 17% year-over-year, the highest market in 13 years. Production at that level requires nothing short of highly orchestrated cross-functional and regional coordination to ensure customer requirements are fulfilled. I am proud to say that despite the stress this level of production puts on the entire supply chain, our delivery performance was greater than 99% for the total company and our quality score was 108 parts per million. If we excluded an issue that arose in one facility this year, our quality would have been an impressive 24 parts per million.  I am pleased to tell you that we achieved an overall total recordable safety case rate of 0.59 injuries per 200,000 hours worked. This safety rate required significant diligence by all of our employees during this time frame.  In addition to the great effort required to manage the peak efficiently and convert on the increased revenue, we also completed the acquisition of AxleTech, made incredible progress in our electrified drive train offerings, and launched several new products in core and adjacent markets. We also recently announced that Steve Beringhause, CTO of Sensata Technologies, will join our board of directors. Steve’s background and expertise in the application of advanced technology for the transportation industry make him an excellent addition. We are pleased that he has agreed to join us as we begin M2022. Now let’s talk about the highlights of M2019 performance. On Slide 4, we scorecard our financial results against targets. We had more than $600 million in revenue outperformance or 16%, driven by new business around the world, including adjacent markets and revenue from our three most recent acquisitions. As a result of our high performance during the peak cycle, we were also able to gain rear axle share with customers in North America. Not only did we beat our adjusted diluted EPS target, we almost exceeded it by $1 per share, increasing it by $2.23 from 2015. You will remember this was an aggressive goal when we announced it at the end of fiscal year 2015. At that time, we said we believed an 80% improvement in adjusted EPS was the ultimate measure of success for M2019. We actually delivered 140% improvement.  Our third financial target was to achieve 1.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the financing associated with the AxleTech acquisition, we achieved 1.3 times or 1.6 times if we include it. We generated strong free cash flow over the term of the plan that reduced legacy liabilities. Let’s go to Slide 5 for a summary of our capital allocation strategy. As I mentioned, we are now generating strong free cash flow and are returning a significant percentage to Meritor’s shareholders. During M2019, we returned $276 million of cash to shareholders through equity repurchases, which represents 56% of our free cash flow since fiscal year 2016. That is more than double the target we established of returning 25% in that time frame. We intend to maintain an aggressive rate of share repurchases during the M2022 time frame.  We told you at analyst day last December that our cash generation and the ability to deploy that cash to drive shareholder value is a critical underpinning of our next strategy. This is where we expect to drive tremendous value for our shareholders. We will provide more detail later in the discussion. Slide 6 provides a summary of strategic transactions. We completed three acquisitions that diversify our revenue streams to help us offset the cyclicality of the line haul markets. These acquisitions expanded our portfolio and customer base with new technology and products in off highway, severe service, and defense. AxleTech is the most recent acquisition that we completed in July. We still expect annual run rate synergies from AxleTech to be more than $15 million by 2022. Our integration process is moving along well and our belief in the strategic value of this transaction has been reinforced in the past several months. As you know, we sold our interest in the former Meritor WABCO joint venture in 2017 and recently announced that we have exercised our option to terminate the exclusive aftermarket distribution arrangement. Under the terms of this agreement, WABCO will pay us between $225 million and $265 million, which provides further flexibility for capital allocation.  Finally, our investment in TransPower has served as an accelerant for many of the electric programs we have with major OEMs. We look forward to our continued collaboration as customers show increasing interest in electric drive train solutions for a range of applications. Slide 7 shows a few examples of the 21 products we have launched during M2019 for a variety of applications. Our current launch cycle is one of the most aggressive in the company’s history. New products include front and rear axles for medium and heavy applications, line haul, construction, buses and trailers, in addition to an optimized air disc brake and a transfer case for the medium duty all-wheel drive market.  Moving to Slide 8, you see that new business accounted for 16% of our revenue outperformance, largely driven by new product offerings. We are designing and manufacturing for a wide range of applications and end markets, and our efforts to grow our business in these areas is gaining traction and will continue under M2022. Slide 9 reflects our efforts to position the company as a market leader in electrified drive train solutions. During M2019, we introduced Blue Horizon, which consolidates Meritor’s advanced solutions under a single brand, reflecting more than 20 years of technology leadership. In the past two years alone, we have progressed through a third generation of the 14XE and are delivering preproduction samples to major customers. We have accumulated thousands of testing miles across a range of applications and duty cycles.  We have been awarded 22 e-mobility programs and expect to deploy over 130 vehicles by the end of 2020 in addition to the electric vehicles Volkswagen in Brazil will launch over the next few years. This program award, which we announced at the North American Commercial Vehicle Show, for 1,600 trucks will begin with the OEM’s 11-ton e-delivery truck equipped with Meritor’s 12X with e-optimized gearing and will be substituted with our 12XE electric power train as it becomes commercially available.  We also announced at NACV the introduction of two new e-axles, one for medium and the other for heavy duty applications. With the addition of these two new axles, we believe Meritor now has the most comprehensive e-axle portfolio for medium and heavy duty trucks of anyone in the world. With that, I will turn it over to Carl for more detail on the financials. 
Carl Anderson: Thanks Jay, and good morning. On today’s call, I’ll review our 2019 financial performance along with our fourth quarter segment results. I will then provide you with an overview of our fiscal year 2020 guidance. Overall, we had another outstanding year of financial performance and we successfully completed our M2019 plan that we committed to almost four years ago. In the last year of the plan, we expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 60 basis points, increased adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $3.82, generated $153 million of free cash flow, and deployed over 60% of our free cash flow to repurchase $95 million of common stock.  Let’s turn to Slide 10, where you’ll see our full year financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were up $210 million from last year driven by higher North American truck production, increased aftermarket industrial and trailer volumes across North America, and continued revenue outperformance. From a segment perspective, we saw the largest increase in revenue from our aftermarket, industrial and trailer segment, which was up $137 million from the prior year. We benefited from a strong all-wheel drive market, the launch of the first ever gear driven transfer case for Navistar, and a 7% increase in trailer production. The commercial truck segment was up $80 million in revenue. In North America, Class 8 truck production was up 17% from the prior year. We also saw strong demand in medium duty, increasing almost 10% to 288,000 units driven by demand for last mile deliveries. In fact, our revenue since 2017 in North America truck has grown by over 50% compared to growth of 35% for the combined heavy and medium duty market. We were however negatively impacted by lower sales in both India and China. In India, the pending implementation of a new emissions standard significantly impacted sales in the back half of the year. In China, we have seen a slowdown in the economy which significantly impacted sales in our fourth quarter. For the full year, China’s revenue was $165 million, down 18% from our expectations when we started the year. The overall increase in revenue was partially offset by an approximately $100 million unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies.  Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see on the line labeled volume performance, mix and other, we had $51 million of higher adjusted EBITDA on $306 million of revenue increase. That translates to net underlying conversion of approximately 17%, which we view as a very good result in markets like these as we were faced with higher layer capacity and net steel costs as well as other inefficiencies, primarily in the North America truck market.  Additionally, as we compare 2019 results to the previous year, we had a one-time $9 million environmental charge related to a legacy site which occurred in 2018 and did not repeat. Given the FX headwinds in the year, adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $14 million. These items provide the walk to our adjusted EBITDA of $520 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9%. In the table on the left, you can see that our operating performance drove an increase in adjusted income from continuing operations to $330 million or $3.82 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.  In addition to the higher overall adjusted EBITDA generated this year, we also had a lower tax expense. Our effective tax rate was approximately 9%, which is lower than the 13% rate we saw last year as we benefited from a higher percentage of earnings coming from jurisdictions which have net operating losses or tax credits to offset taxable income. Finally, due to our continued focus on capital allocation, we had approximately 5 million less diluted average common shares outstanding, which drove about $0.20 of adjusted diluted EPS. All of these items allowed us to exceed our M2019 target of $2.84 of adjusted earnings per share by almost a full dollar. Additionally, on a GAAP basis we recognized approximately $8 million related to restructuring. This was primarily driven by costs incurred as a result of the $20 million restructuring plan announced in September to reduce hourly and salaried headcount globally in anticipation of market declines. We expect the remainder of the restructuring costs to be incurred in fiscal year 2020. We also recognized a $9 million charge to impair certain customer relationship intangible assets related to the AA gear business we acquired last year.  Finally, we generated $153 million of free cash flow in 2019. This is inclusive of the $50 million cash contribution we made as part of the bankruptcy reorganization for the non-operating entity, Maremont, that was completed in July. Exclusive of this transaction, we generated $203 million of free cash flow, a $56 million increase from the prior year. Slide 11 details our fourth quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our commercial truck segment, sales were $728 million, down 11% from last year. The decrease in sales was driven by lower production in India, Europe and China. While segment adjusted EBITDA was $69 million, down 7%, our segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck increased 40 basis points over the same period last year.  As we previously discussed, higher costs associated with record markets in North America began to abate in the third quarter, and this quarter’s results continued this trend. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by lower net steel premium and freight costs and material performance, which more than offset the impact from lower revenue. In our aftermarket trailer and industrial segment, sales were $31 million, up 11% from the same period last year. This was driven by the inclusion of revenue from AxleTech. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $44 million, up $2 million compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 80 basis points compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the consolidation of AxleTech. We expect this acquisition to be decretive to margins through the end of the calendar year as certain targeted synergies, primarily from the elimination of cost overlap, have not yet been fully realized. Next, I’ll review our fiscal year 2020 market outlook on Slide 12. In the North America Class 8 market, we are projecting production levels between 240,000 to 250,000 units. Fundamentally, this is due to continued lower order intake over the past several quarters combined with higher current dealer inventory, which is driving the step-down we are seeing for production in 2020. As we look to our other markets, we anticipate that Europe will be in the range of 450,000 to 460,000 units, down approximately 6% from last year. Overall economic conditions are pointing to a modest slowdown in 2020 following several years of strong truck markets in Europe. Moving to India, we are seeing the continued impact of the transition to the BS6 emission standard along with continued liquidity constraints in the credit market. Ahead of the April 1, 2020 deadline when all new vehicles registered must comply with the new regulations, we expect significant headwinds impacting the first half of our fiscal year compared to the prior year. The impact of BS6 should abate in the second half of our fiscal year as we pass the implementation deadline. Overall for the full year, we believe the market will contract and be in the range of 330,000 to 350,000 trucks, down approximately 17% from last year. Also, while we have not included China on our outlook slide, I did want to briefly discuss this market. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen a significant economic slowdown in the region which is impacting the off-highway market where we compete. As a result, we expect our sales in China to be down approximately 35%, which is between $55 million and $65 million from the previous fiscal year. On Slide 13, I’ll review our financial outlook for fiscal year 2020. Our forecast for sales is expected to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. We are projecting most of our markets to be lower in 2020. The call-out box to the right walks to this number from our 2019 actuals. We expect lower global markets to reduce revenue between $625 million to $725 million. We are also seeing continued headwinds from foreign exchange, which we estimate to be the in range of $50 million to $75 million.  Additionally, we anticipate terminating the WABCO aftermarket distribution agreement in the second quarter of our fiscal year, resulting in an approximately $75 million revenue headwind in the second half of the year. Offsetting the impact of global markets and the WABCO distribution transaction will be a full year of revenue from AxleTech. Moving back to the table on the left, we forecast that our adjusted EBITDA margin will be in the range of 11% to 11.2%. As you can see in the call-out box, we expect our operating performance, lower net steel prices and layer capacity costs to significantly offset declining markets. Additionally, we expect an approximately 20 basis point impact from the termination of the WABCO aftermarket distribution agreement.  We are also planning to double our investment in electrification in 2020 given the significant opportunities we are seeing in the market. This does result in a 30 basis point margin impact as compared to last year. Overall, our downside conversion, even including the increase investments in electrification and termination of the distribution agreement, is approximately 16%, which is well within our typical downside conversion rate of 15% to 20%. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, we expect 2020 to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, which does include the impact of our share repurchase plan that Jay will discuss coming up. Additionally, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of around 15%, consistent with the M2022 planning guidance we previously provided. Finally, we expect to generate $165 million to $175 million of free cash flow, an increase of $10 million to $20 million from last year. This increase will be driven by the one-time funding of the Maremont trust not repeating in 2020, and improvements in working capital due to market normalization. Based on this, we expect to achieve our M2022 target of 75% free cash flow conversion in the first year of our new three-year plan. From a financial perspective, the bottom line is this: we delivered and achieved the second consecutive three-year strategy with M2019, and even as global markets are softening, we expect to deliver solid results in 2020, continue our investments in electrification, and aggressively deploy capital as we pivot to M2022.  Now I’ll turn the call back over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks Carl. Let’s look at Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we highlight the competencies we have demonstrated during M2019 from strategic transactions, product launches and new business awards to our exceptional operational management through the peak Class 8 cycle and global market upturn. These competencies have positioned us well for M2022. We have shown that we have the ability to flex the organization up or down as needed to adjust for major fluctuations in production. We have diversified outside of the Class 8 line haul market in North America by growing our business in adjacent markets. We have improved our balance sheet and set in motion a capital allocation plan that is returning value directly to our shareholders. The transformation we have undertaken since we launched M2016 has been dramatic and will allow us to effectively manage even the most negative economic environments profitably. For example, our modeling indicates that even if the North America Class 8 market were to decline to a level of 215,000 units and Europe to 400,000 units, we would expect to generate $3.5 billion in sales and maintain a 10.5% EBITDA margin. We also would expect to generate $120 million of free cash flow in this type of environment while maintaining our investments in increased productivity and new advanced product capabilities. Therefore, we fully anticipate that our earnings and cash flow will ensure our ability to take advantage of future capital allocation opportunities that we have established under our M2022 plan. Let’s go to Slide 15. As Carl indicated, our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for fiscal year 2020 is in the range of 11% to 11.2%. Our M2022 target is 12.5%. We have demonstrated our ability to improve adjusted EBITDA margin during each of the last two plans. Through continued focus on material costs, labor and burden, along with execution of synergies from the AxleTech acquisition and additional new business wins, we expect to achieve the 12.5% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2022.  Let’s take a minute to discuss our M2022 capital allocation strategy, as shown on Slide 16. Our board of directors recently increased our current $250 million share repurchase authorization to $325 million, which we intend to fully utilize in 2020. We have already repurchased $60 million of shares in October in addition to the $25 million executed in the fourth quarter of 2019. We are planning to repurchase another $240 million in the remainder of fiscal 2020. The adjusted diluted EPS guidance that Carl referenced for the year includes the impact of these anticipated repurchases. Given our free cash flow expectations going forward, we also have an opportunity to utilize another $400 million for future repurchases in 2021 and 2022.  We strongly believe that we have a significant opportunity to aggressively deploy capital to take advantage of current market prices in our equity, therefore we plan to continue and in fact accelerate our commitment to share repurchases. We will execute this plan through strategically timed open market purchases. We are also committed to strong credit profile and retaining flexibility to invest for the long term. We intend to hold leverage in a similar range through the three-year period. The company retains a significant liquidity buffer should additional investment opportunities, internal or external, present themselves over the coming years. Moving to the last slide, we look forward to the future as we ramp up for M2022. In every area of the company, we are executing well due to the talented dedication we have around the world. I want to recognize our employees in every region of the world for their role in what Meritor has become. Each one of our 9,000 employees is responsible for our success.  We also have excellent relationships with our customers, suppliers and investors. Over the past month, our management team has worked with one of our largest long-term shareholders, Glenview Capital, who has provided input on our capital allocation plans which are fully aligned with our M2022 strategy. We appreciate the support and feedback from them and all of our long term owners as we drive performance for our customers, opportunities for our employees, and value for our shareholders. Now let’s take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from James Picariello with Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
James Picariello: Hey, good morning guys. 
Jay Craig: Morning James.
James Picariello: Just digging in on commercial truck and the expectations around the decremental margins for the year, this fourth quarter decrementals came in as promised - you know, solidly at 10%. It does sound like you plan to almost double your electrification spend. Just wondering the cadence of the year and maybe just the timing on the electrification spend, if there is any lumpiness there.
Carl Anderson: Yes James, it’s Carl. Good morning. I think as it relates to electrification, I think as you look at the planned spending on that, it’s relatively ratable each quarter as we go forward in 2020. Then in the commercial truck segment, if you look at where the margin performance and some of the tailwinds we had in the fourth quarter as it related to lower steel costs as well as freight cost and layer capacity costs, that will be offset by obviously just the lower revenue volumes as well as we go forward.
James Picariello: Got it. Then thinking about your other segment, the decrementals in this fourth quarter were pretty elevated. Just wondering what might be one-time related or what’s the favorable offset into next year related to the AxleTech synergy pull-through, and just your thoughts again on decrementals for that segment as we think about next year.
Carl Anderson: Yes James, if you look at the performance and margin, actually it’s all really attributable to AxleTech, so if you were to strip out the AxleTech revenue, margin performance would have been very similar on a year-over-year basis within the quarter. As we said in the prepared remarks, we think AxleTech, we’re right in the process of continuing to execute on the various synergies that we outlined previously, and we fully expect as we get out of the first quarter that that will be more in line with our expectations as we get into Q2 and beyond.
James Picariello: What was the AxleTech contribution, revenue contribution in the quarter?
Carl Anderson: It was right around $30 million.
James Picariello: Okay, thanks guys.
Carl Anderson: Thanks James.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jason Stuhldreher: Hi, this is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian. Going to the guidance quickly, if I look at the revenue guidance, end markets are guided for a little more conservative potentially than third party estimates, which I think is fine. I guess I was looking at any potential for revenue outperformance in 2020, and I know the key tenets of the M2022 plan was some pretty significant, at least $300 million or so of revenue outperformance driven by new wins. Just wondering if we’re seeing any of that in that global markets bucket, or if the cadence of that outperformance is maybe a little more back end weighted.
Jay Craig: Thanks for the question, Jason. This is Jay. I think first of all, we’re seeing the full year benefit of AxleTech revenue, which again we included in our new revenue targets, so you’re seeing that benefit flow through. I think we are expecting some significant downturns around the globe, and I know that’s difficult at times for people analyzing us from outside the company because of how global we are. We’re also looking to hold the vast majority of our North American Class 8 penetration increase at or above 7 out of 10 trucks now running on our axles in the Class 8 market, so we’re continuing to see revenue outperformance but these step-downs in some of our markets, particularly in China off-highway, some of our contractual return obligations for declining steel prices and productivity, tamped down that a bit, but we’re still continuing to bring on new business that’s increasing penetration as well.
Jason Stuhldreher: Okay, that’s helpful. Then just secondly, as we think about steel costs next year, which I know was guided to be a tailwind and is sort of within that first bucket you mentioned, offset by lower layer capacity costs, steel costs, just wondering if you can help us--you know, if we assume the indices and the prices stay flat from here, I was wondering if you could help us with maybe the cadence of the steel tailwinds next year, because I know it’s a little complicated with any sort of escalation clauses and pass-through clauses you have with customers. So, should we assume tailwinds are sort of evenly spread throughout the quarters next year, or is there any strange cadence we should be aware of?
Carl Anderson: I think on steel, most of it will be in the first half as we expect kind of the tailwinds from that. As we’ve assessed it, it’s probably high-single-digit millions is what our expectations is for the tailwind in 2020 as you compare to ’19.
Jason Stuhldreher: Okay, understood. Thanks a lot.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. One moment while questions queue up.  I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to Mr. Todd Chirillo for any closing remarks.
Todd Chirillo: Thank you. This concludes our fourth quarter call. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions. Thank you very much for joining. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q3 2019 Cummins’ Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. James Hopkins, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hopkins, you may now begin.
James Hopkins: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2019. Participating with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Smith; President and Chief Operating Officer, Tony Satterthwaite; and retiring Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation, are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. With that out of the way, we'll begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.
Thomas Linebarger: Thanks, James. Good morning. I just want to start one correction of James remarks. Retiring Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland, has said he will not be available for questions after the call, unless it's about how cute his grandchildren are or about golf. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2019. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full-year. Revenues for the third quarter of 2019 were $5.8 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA was $958 million or 16.6% compared to $983 million or 16.5% a year-ago. Positive pricing, lower variable compensation, material cost reduction activities and lower warranty expense partially offset the impact of lower volumes and increased investments in research and engineering. Engine business revenues declined 11% in the third quarter compared to a year-ago. Revenues in North America decreased by 6% as we began to see the impact of OEMs preparing for lower production of heavy-duty trucks in North America, as well as declines in shipments to construction markets. International revenues declined by 25% primarily as a result of lower demand in China light-duty truck and construction markets. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 14.1% compared to 14.9% for the same period in 2018, and included a $33 million charge related to ending production of our 5-liter ISV engine for the U.S. pickup market. Improved pricing and lower material costs partially offset the impact of lower volumes, reduced joint venture income and the $33 million charge. Sales for our Distribution segment grew by 4% year-over-year driven by higher demand for power generation equipment in North America. Third quarter EBITDA was a record $186 million or 9.3% of sales compared to 8% in the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA margins benefited from higher volumes, positive pricing and lower variable compensation costs. Third quarter revenues for the Component segment declined by 6%, sales in North America increased 2% driven by higher demand in the U.S. pickup market, while revenues in the international markets declined by 18% as a result of lower truck demand in Europe, India and China. EBITDA for the third quarter was $286 million or 17.3% compared to 16.4% in the same quarter a year-ago. The increase in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower warranty costs and the benefit of material cost reduction programs, which offset increased investment and the development of new products to meet advancing emission standards in China and India as well as the impact of lower volumes. Power Systems sales in third quarter increased by 2%. Demand in industrial markets increased 3% with lower sales to oil and gas markets offset by increased sales to marine, rail and mining customers. Power Generation sales increased 8% in North America, driven by continued strength in data center markets, offset by a 4% decline in international markets, mainly in Europe and the Middle East. While sales increased compared to a weak third quarter last year, sales declined 6% sequentially with lower demand in power generation, oil and gas and mining markets. EBITDA in the third quarter was 14% compared to 14.7% a year-ago. The decrease in EBITDA percent was largely due to the impact of higher material costs, including tariffs, and lower sales of industrial engines. In the Electrified Power business, EBITDA was a loss of $36 million in the third quarter and in line with our expectations. We completed the acquisition of Hydrogenics, a leading producer of fuel cells and electrolyzers for the production of hydrogen, on September 9. Our third quarter results included $2 million EBITDA loss related to Hydrogenics. Now I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the third quarter of 2019 starting with North America, and then I'll cover some of our largest international markets. Our third quarter revenues in North America were flat at $3.6 billion. Increased sales of power generation equipment, especially the data center customers were offset by lower shipments of heavy-duty truck and construction engines. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks increased 3% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to a year-ago and decreased 4% compared to the second quarter of this year with low truck orders, a declining industry backlog and historically high levels of new truck inventory driving lower industry production. While industry truck production increased compared to last year, our shipments declined as OEMs prepared to ramp down production in Q4. Our market share through September was 32%. Production of medium-duty trucks increased 4% in the third quarter. A growing U.S. economy, coupled with high levels of consumer spending, low unemployment and low interest rates continues to drive demand for medium-duty trucks. Our market share in the medium-duty truck market was 78% through September compared to 81% a year-ago. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased for the third consecutive quarter to over 41,000 units supported by strong demand for the Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks. Engine demand for construction equipment in North America decreased 30% in the third quarter. While non-residential construction spending remains high, we are seeing industry participants take steps to reduce their equipment inventory, which currently stands at a historically high levels. Revenues for power generation grew by 8% due to higher demand in data center markets partially offset by lower sales to recreational vehicle OEMs. Demand for engines in oil and gas markets declined by 86% due to continued low purchases of new fracking equipment. Our international revenues decreased by 8% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to a year-ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 2% over the prior year. Lower demand in construction and light commercial vehicle markets was partially offset by increased demand in medium- and heavy-duty truck markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China increased 1% compared to a year-ago and was positively impacted by a prebuy of natural gas engines, ahead of the move to NS VI standards. We estimate the impact of this prebuy to be approximately 27,000 units this quarter, increasing market size by 10%. This increase, in addition to the 20,000 unit prebuy that occurred in the second quarter. Our market share improved to 16.1% this quarter from 15.6% a year-ago as we increased our share at Foton and saw a shift towards over-the-road trucks versus construction-related dump trucks. Industry sales of light-duty trucks declined by 3% in the third quarter and 15%, sequentially. Our engine market share was 7.4%, 0.2 percentage points higher than a year-ago. We continue to be impacted by increased enforcement of loading regulations where truck models that has historically been registered as light-duty trucks are now to be classified as medium-duty trucks, which limits access to urban areas and requires additional licensing for drivers. OEMs did begin to launch new light-duty vehicles in the third quarter, resulting in higher industry productions than we had originally forecasted. Third quarter demand for excavators in China increased 16% from a year ago. Our market share also increased from 15% to 15.4% driven by the strong performance of our local partners. While industry sales and our market share increase compared to a year-ago, our sales for the quarter including joint ventures declined 29% due to OEMs and dealers reducing inventory built primarily in the second half of last year. Demand for power generation equipment was flat in the third quarter with lower demand for standby power, partially offset by growth in demand for data center markets. Third quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $344 million, a reduction of 29% in the third quarter a year-ago with lower demand in all of our major end markets. Industry truck sales decreased 52% year-over-year and even larger decline than we'd expected, driven by continued lack of credit availability. Credit availability also started to impact other markets during the third quarter with construction revenues down 75% as companies struggle to finance construction projects, placing pressure on equipment purchases. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2019 and then comment on individual regions in end markets. We now expect company revenues to be down 2% for the year compared with our prior guidance of flat. We are lowering our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America. Hopefully, we’re off mute now. Okay. More concerning, the industry backlog declined 31% or 61,000 units [technical difficulty] to 133,000 units from its peak of over 300,000 units a year-ago. Inventory remains elevated at 81,000 units and third quarter orders of 34,000 units were the lowest since 2009. Industry production decreased monthly as we [technical difficultly] third quarter and we expect monthly declines to continue through the end of the year. We expect our market share for the year to be at the low end of our forecast range of 32% to 34%. Market share is being negatively impacted by lower shipments to OEM's ahead of truck production cuts. Demand in our parts and remanufacturing business remain stable in the third quarter. As we continue to see the impact of increased capacity of fleets and lower freight demand resulting in lower utilization of available equipment in the industry. We continue to expect parts demand to be relatively weak through the end of this year as dealers reduced parts inventory and anticipation of lower market activity. In the medium-duty truck market, we're lowering our forecast for industry production to 138,000 units are up 5% compared to our prior guidance of 140,000 units are up 6% year-over-year. While retail sales of medium-duty trucks remained strong, up 13% year-to-date, industry truck production has now been above order intake for seven months, lowering the industry backlog to levels that will result in lower build rates. We continue to expect our market share to be in the range of 74% to 76% unchanged from our prior guidance. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for 2019, compared to a very strong 2018 and unchanged from our expectations three months ago. Shipments of construction engines are now expected to decline 5% compared to our prior expectations of 10% growth as OEMs and dealers reduce inventories from historically high levels. In China, we now expect domestic revenues including joint ventures to be down 1% in 2019 and improvement compared to our prior guidance of down 2%. We are increasing our outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand to 1.23 million units or down 7% compared to our prior guidance of down 10% due to the additional prebuy of natural gas trucks that occurred in the third quarter. In the light-duty truck market, we now expect a 7% reduction in demand compared to our prior guidance of down 12%. This improvement is driven by OEMs launching new truck models in light of the more stringent enforcement of overloading regulations that began in the second quarter. We expect our market share and the medium- and heavy-duty truck market to be in the range of 13% to 14% and in light-duty we expect our market share to be 8% to 9%, both in line with our prior guidance. We now expect industry sales of excavators in China to increase 8% from the record levels achieved in 2018, compared to our prior guidance of flat. While industry sales are expected to increase this year, we are expecting lower levels of industry production in the second half of 2019, compared to 2018 as the industry prepares for lower demand in the spring 2020 selling season. In India, we now expect total revenue including joint ventures to be down 20% [technical difficultly] compared to our prior guidance of down 5%. We anticipate – industry demand for trucks to be 30% lower than the record levels experienced in 2018 compared to our prior guidance of down 17%. We now expect construction demand to decline 40%, compared to our prior outlook of 5% to 10% growth with a lack of financing for construction projects lowering demand for new equipment. Demand for power generation equipment is now expected to be flat compared to 5% to 10% growth. In Brazil, we are now projecting truck production to be flat in [technical difficultly] down from our forecast of 2% growth three months ago. While domestic demand in Brazil continues to increase from levels experience in [technical difficultly] truck production in Brazil for export markets is expected to decline 50% compared to 2018 – primarily due to weak demand for trucks in Argentina. We continue to project total revenues for Brazil to be down 10% this year. We now expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to be down 10% this year, compared with our prior guidance of down 5%. Demand for new oil and gas engines is now expected to decline 50%, compared with our prior guidance of just down 40%. We now anticipate sales in North America will decline by 85%, compared to our 75% expectations three months ago with lower demand for new equipment in the Permian Basin as well as reduced demand for engine rebuilds. The deterioration in our outlook for North America is partially offset by growing sales [technical difficultly] which have represented 61% of our oil and gas engine sales to-date. Demand from mining engines has moderated [technical difficultly] three months as commodity [technical difficultly] and capital budgets have been cut. We now expect mining engine sales down 7% lower than the prior guidance of down 5%. Demand for power generation equipment increased 2% compared to the low levels experience in the third quarter of last year and declined 3% sequentially [technical difficultly] primarily due to lower demand in India. We now expect full-year revenues to be down 2% compared to our primarily due to lower demand in India. For the full-year growth in data centers is being offset by lower sales of [technical difficultly] lower demand in backup power applications in China and India, and a drop in large prime power applications in Europe. In summary, we are now expecting revenues to be down 2%, for the year lower than our prior guidance of flat. This revenue decline is driven by lower demand and domestic international truck markets, weakness in Indian end markets and lower demand in several off-highway markets. Lower sales reduced joint venture income in India and the acquisition of Hydrogenics will impact our EBITDA for the year, which we now projected at 15.9% to 16.3% of sales, down from our prior guidance of 16.25% to 16.75% of sales. Strong execution across all of our businesses resulted in record revenues being translated into record EBITDA and operating cash flow in the first nine months of this year. Our strong and consistent cash flow generation continues to support our plans, return cash to shareholders and we returned $910 million of cash in third quarter [technical difficultly] 2.9% of outstanding shares. While we were pleased with our operating performance in third quarter, we've been working to prepare the company for what lies ahead in the fourth quarter and in [technical difficultly]. As we have discussed before, several of our end markets have been above replacement level for some time and we are now expecting cyclically reduced demand. Our third quarter revenues declined 7% sequentially and our guidance projects that they would decline another 8% in the fourth quarter. This steep level of decline resulted in a number of actions to align costs with production levels including a recently announced voluntary retirement package in United States, which we [technical difficultly] reduced headcount by 400 to 450 people. We are in the process of making additional structural changes in several areas of the business and we'll continue to drive actions to improve costs. As always, we will capitalize on the downturn period to improve our company and merge as a stronger and more profitable Cummins. We will also maintain our investments in the key [technical difficulty] and product development programs that will ensure leadership and sustainable growth in the future. During the third quarter, we announced new [technical difficulty] powertrains and launched an updated ISX15 engine for the North American heavy-duty truck market. These actions demonstrate our commitment to lead both in alternative powertrain technologies and continue to lead in traditional powertrains. We closed on our acquisition of Hydrogenics, one of the world's premier fuel cell and hydrogen production technology providers in September. Their expertise and innovative approach will strengthen fuel cell capability. This is another step forward as we continue to invest in a broad range of clean, fuel efficient and high-performing products and technologies that will deliver value to customers. [Technical difficulty] who designed manufacturer fuel cell range extenders and announced the partnership with Hyundai to jointly evaluate opportunities to develop and commercialize electric and fuel cell powertrains. While we increase investments on alternative powertrains, we continue to enhance our diesel and natural gas products delivering more fuel efficiency, power and lower emission. At the North American Commercial Vehicle show in Atlanta, we are currently showing our new ISX15 Efficiency Series. [Technical difficulty] an endurance transmission will provide up to 5% improvement in fuel efficiency for [technical difficulty] meeting 2021 greenhouse gas standards one-year early. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial performance in the [technical difficulty] for the full-year. Third quarter revenues were $5.8 billion, a decrease of 3% from a year-ago. Sales in North America were flat and international revenues [technical difficulty] 8%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%. Earnings before interest and tax depreciation and amortization were $958 million or 16.6% for the quarter, compared to $993 million or 16.5% of sales a year-ago. EBITDA decreased by $25 million driven by the negative impact of [technical difficulty] reduced joint venture income and [technical difficulty] partially offset by material cost reduction activities, lower warranty and decreased variable compensation expenses. Gross margin of $1.5 billion or 25.9% decreased by $57 million or 20 basis points. Benefits from favorable pricing actions, material cost reductions, lower warranty and variable compensation expenses mitigated the negative impact of lower volumes [technical difficulty] charges incurred to cease production of certain unprofitable product lines and higher tariffs. Our selling, administrative and research costs of $842 million, increased by $9 million year-over-year, driven primarily by new product development in the Engine, Components, and Electrified Power segments, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense. Joint venture income declined by $22 million due to weaker demand for light-duty trucks in China and lower truck production in India. Other income of $61 million increased by $34 million, driven primarily by $35 million of gains related to closing out certain derivative contracts associated with the Company's foreign exchange hedging program. Net earnings for the quarter was $622 million or $3.97 per diluted share compared to $692 million or $4.28 from a year-ago. Third quarter results were positively impacted by $23 million or $0.14 per diluted share and discrete tax items and the after-tax gains of $28 million or $0.18 from closing out the foreign exchange hedging contracts I referred to earlier. During the quarter, we also incurred after-tax expenses of $35 million or $0.23 per share related to actions taken to cease development and production of certain products. These actions will benefit future financial performance. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.4%. Excluding discrete tax items, the tax rate was 21.5% in the third quarter and in line with our full-year forecast. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record in flow of $1.1 billion. That's $208 million higher than last year. Year-to-date, we've generated a record $2.3 billion of cash from operating activities, up $955 million from the same period last year, driven by higher earnings and a much slower pace of working capital expansion. I will now comment on our revised guidance for 2019. For the Engine segment, we expect full-year revenues to be down between 5% and 6% compared to our previous guidance of flat at the mid-point. The reduction in sales is driven by declines in heavy-duty engine shipments in North America, weaker demand for construction equipment in North America or India, and the lower outlook for medium-duty truck engines in North America, Europe and Brazil. We revised our forecast for EBITDA margins for the engine business to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.8%, down from our prior guidance of 15% to 15.5%, driven primarily by the impact of lower volumes, weaker joint venture incomes and the costs incurred in the third quarter associated with ending production of one engine platform. For the Distribution segment, we now expect revenues to be up 2% to 3% compared to our previous guidance of 1% to 5%, due to lower sales of construction engines in North America and lower engine rebuild volumes with oil and gas and mining customers. We are raising our outlook for EBITDA margins by 35 basis points to be in the range of 8.4% to 8.8% as continuous solid operating performance and lower variable compensation expense more than offset – the slightly lower outlook for sales. For 2019, we now expect components revenues to be down between 4% and 5% compared to our prior projection of flat at the mid-point and this decline is – being driven by reduced truck demand in North America, India, Europe, and Brazil. As a result of the lower sales outlook, we've revised our focus for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 15.6% to 16.1%, down from our prior guidance of 15.75% to 16.25%. Power Systems revenues are forecast to be down 3% to 4% lower than our previous guidance of flat at the midpoint, due to lower demand for power generation equipment in international markets and weaker demand for engine rebuilds and new engine shipments in mining and oil and gas markets. We're also revising our forecast for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 12.5% to 13% down from our prior forecast 13.25% to 14%. In the Electrified Power segment, we now expect a net expense of $145 million at the high-end of our previous guidance range due to the completion of the acquisition of Hydrogenics. The net impacted the changes to Individual segment projections is that we now forecast total company revenues to be down 2% and company EBITDA margins to be between 15.9% and 16.3. This compares to our prior guidance of flat sales and the EBITDA in the range of 16.25% to 16.75%. Full-year operating cash flow is projected to be a record $3 billion due to the strong full-year earnings and lower working capital. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $153 million, bringing our year-to-date total investment to $395 million. We expect our full-year capital investments will be in the range of $700 million unchanged from our prior guidance. In the third quarter, we returned a record $910 million to shareholders. We repurchased 4.6 million shares after a total of $706 million. And for the first nine months, we have returned $1.4 billion through dividends and share repurchase activity. We still plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year while maintaining a strong balance sheet. To summarize, we delivered a solid set of results in the third quarter, including record quarterly operating cash flow and in response to a slowing global economy driving weaker demand in a number of our end markets. We have taken a number of actions to reduce costs and address some underperforming parts of our business. Consistent with prior downturns, we will continue to identify additional opportunities to drive efficiency and cost reduction whilst maintaining investment in the products and services that will deliver a stronger future. Finally, I want to remind everyone of our upcoming Analyst Day on November 21 of the New York Stock Exchange. I look forward to seeing you all there. Webcast of our presentation will also be available on our Investor Relations section our website. Thank you for your interest today, your patience with a difficult phone call. Now let me turn it back over to Tom before we move to Q&A.
Thomas Linebarger: Mark, with all the challenges we have in fuel cells and electrification, I did not expect to be flooded by a phone. There you have it. Just to conclude our prepared remarks. As you will remember, we announced on April 29 and then discussed in our first and second quarter earning calls that we are initiated an internal review of our emission certification and compliance processes for our pickup truck applications as a result of conversations with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board. Our review continues and we are proactively working with EPA and CARB as well as with the Department of Justice and SEC to address their questions and information requests. During conversations with regulators, they raise concerns that certain aspect of our emission system on the model year 2019 Ram engine may reduce the effectiveness of our emission control systems and thereby act as defeat devices. Based on these discussions, we've developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 Ram 2,500 and 3,500 trucks that has been included on all engines shipped since September. During our discussions, the agencies have asked us to look at other model years and other engines that the primary focus of our review has been the model year 2019 Ram. Consistent with the values and the history of our Company, which include a strong commitment to compliance, we will work with regulators and other agencies to address the issues identified in our internal review and develop future technologies that will advance our industry. We are already making changes to our process and organization structure as a result of our review. However, it's too soon to know what the response of our regulators or agencies will be to our review or to determine any potential financial consequences. Now let me turn it back to James for Q&A.
James Hopkins: Great. Thank you, Tom. Out of considerations to everybody on the call to ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up, and if you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. With that operator, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research.
Joseph O'Dea: Hi, good morning.
Thomas Linebarger: Hi, Joe.
Joseph O'Dea: Tom, I'm just curious about kind of what your assessment is of what's currently underway in terms of what we're seeing on slowing demand. I think there are pockets of these end markets that you've been talking about things slowing for at least a couple of quarters now, but whether or not you're seeing this more as we're coming off of a level of very strong demand or whether there's something else at play in terms of kind of how you're thinking about things slowing down here?
Thomas Linebarger: Yes. I want Tony to talk more specifically about what happening in the truck market. It'd be a good chance for him to – he's been very close to it and a good chance for him to talk about that. I would just say that broadly speaking, we've seen a number of our markets been at cyclical peaks over the last couple of years, which has been terrific for the company. We've generated strong earnings and cash flows as a result, but indeed some of those markets are beginning to turn down and we've been seeing signs of that. Typical signs that we're used to reading things like slowing orders, inventory build, et cetera. And now what we're seeing is those things starting to come to fruition. Maybe what's surprising to me is it's broader than I thought. Like we are seeing challenges in India, challenges in China, challenges in – even in Europe is slowing. We saw North America coming, that was all part of what we expected, but some of the challenges in some of the other markets, how quickly we've seen in the large engine markets sort of peak out and begin to turn the other way has been a little surprising. So maybe that's what's new, not the – not necessarily that things would turn down, but just how broadly and how quickly they have. And Tony, why don't you just talk about what you're seeing in North America?
Tony Satterthwaite: Yes. I would just add – thanks, Tom. Joe, I would just add, we are definitely seeing – freight growth has slowed. We are seeing orders slow and production has got to come down to meet – to match the backlog and meet those orders. And so we are seeing things slow. I agree with Tom. The surprise has been how quickly things have gone bad internationally and that was probably not expected at the beginning of the year. I do believe in North America it is a cyclical downturn. I don't quite know what you mean by anything else other than that, but that's basically what we're seeing. Construction has also slowed down in the U.S., as Tom mentioned in his remarks, which I think is another sign that perhaps it is a broader slowdown than just freight and truck markets. But we've been seeing this coming all year and it’s here.
Mark Smith: I guess the other thing I'd add to that, Joe, really, in North America, the pickup truck market is the only one that's been holding out steady and strong through the year.
Joseph O'Dea: That's helpful. And then just a cost related question, maybe in the context of what's implied on 4Q EBITDA margins. Can you give any sense of what the impact would be from related cost actions that you're taking right now? So what kind of margin lift you would anticipate if you got the full benefit in the quarter with some of the cost actions underway?
Mark Smith: I think you should think about the actions that we're taking is really setting up 2020. The biggest impact will be 2020, by the time we fully executed those actions. And again, we'll give a framework for 2020 at our Analyst Day. We're not going to give specific guidance today, Joe, but our guidance is the results without the cost of those actions. We will call out the customer benefits at the appropriate point in time. What's really driving our margins from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which I think is underlying your question. Number one, it's the significant decline in revenues. That's by far the biggest single impact. Number two, whilst we haven't changed our full-year outlook for warranty or product coverage as a percent of sales is a little bit lower than trend rate in Q3, they’re a little bit higher than the Q3 run rate and Q4 are unchanged for the year. And then the third factor is really that our variable compensation plan is working as designed. So our outlook is lower than our projected payouts, short-term compensation is going down through the third quarter and will move back to more of a normal run rate in the fourth quarter. And really those are the three main factors. So the key now is really talking about the cost reduction initiatives going forward. And again, we'll provide a framework. Tony will add some comments right now.
Tony Satterthwaite: Yes. I would just add. We’ve been ready for this all year. We are committed to flexing our costs down with demand. We're committed to managing the cycle. We've been tight on discretionary spending and hiring all year and we actually really started to take things out in the third quarter. We've been analyzing underperforming businesses and as Mark said, we decided to close one in the third quarter, we've launched a voluntary retirement program here in the U.S., and so these are all actions we're taking, the majority of which will bear fruit in 2020, but we are moving now to take out cost as demand drops. 
Joseph O'Dea: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Thomas Linebarger: Hi, Jerry.
Mark Smith: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you can talk about what level of restructuring is embedded in guidance, Mark, just to follow-up on the last question. So in the past, you folks have been able to put up 20% decrementals as you've got production now embedded in guidance, looks like you have restructuring. It sounds like price cost is positive, so can you just help us disaggregate it a bit more? And I appreciate there's a wide range of restructuring actions that can be taken, but what level of core decremental margins are you folks expecting?
Mark Smith: Well, we're going to give that core margin kind of framework Jerry in a couple of weeks when we're reviewing with all your peers in New York, so I'll defer that piece. But other than to say that the guidance really does not anticipate. There will be some cost in the fourth quarter associated with further cost reduction activities that Tony has talked about, but most of those benefits and even the benefits of exiting production and some of the products we've exited here, they're going to flow into next year. So we're incurring cost now, but actually even if we ignore the costs we're going to have a year-over-year improvement for those. But again, we'll come back and kind of bundle the overall picture together for you going forward. But as Tony said, we're committed to managing costs, managing well through the down cycle.
Thomas Linebarger: And I guess, Jerry, just to talk about decremental margins because we will get into the framework. But as you expect, the decremental margins in the fourth quarter are not where we want them to be. And that's just reflects the typical situation when the market starts falling quickly and we're still spending money on future investments. It doesn't work out in quarter one. And so that's one of the reasons Tony is really focused – he and his staff on how to take actions right away, so that we're – as we go into 2020, we bring those decrementals around to what our goals are and you know those as well. So we will be – as Mark said, we will be showing you the targets we have for the core business, why we're confident that we can hit them and then what are some of the other things in and around that, what are some of our new investments, et cetera, that we’re having to stretch to meet, how that all going to fit together. But needless to say, Q4 is not representing what our goal for our decremental margins is going to be. And that's just because the market is falling fast now and we're still doing the actions that were taken. So it's sort of hard to read core decremental margins from the quarter where all the revenues fall off.
Jerry Revich: Sure. I appreciate that. In terms of the light-duty diesel platform for you folks with exiting the 5-liter production here in the U.S., can you give us an update there, you folks finding that there are opportunities to source similar products from elsewhere, maybe the Isuzu joint venture or otherwise because you folks had been looking for light-duty diesel to be potential option value for you folks over the next couple of years. So can you just update us on the decision tree to discontinue production here in the U.S.?
Thomas Linebarger: Yes. I think it's – from a strategic point of view, we still think the light-duty diesel business is a good business for Cummins. And as you said, we are talking to Isuzu about how to cooperate fully across that market. It's a market that requires relatively high volume and scale to be successful. And so that's one of the reasons that we think the opportunities between Cummins and Isuzu are significant. I think one of the things that we recognized with the Nissan-related business, the ISV, is we just didn't reach the scale we needed to reach. And that was a function of the customers and the segments that we’re after. The scale wasn't there. But the scale across the light-duty segment for Cummins is significant. As you know, we have very large scale across our 3.8, 2.8, 4.5 and 6, 6.7-liter engines. We have a global scale, which is unmatched in the industry and that’s of course helping us get good profits, good returns off that engine. And we do expect by the way, electrification in the lower power segments to go faster and that in the higher power segments. Having said that, we think the transition is going to be relatively slow and we think the opportunity to consolidate and earn returns over many, many years to come is there for Cummins and ideally there for the Cummins, Isuzu partnership. So we are investing there and trying to see what we can do to consolidate in the industry in the light-duty segment. It’s just that, with the one – the ISV, we’re after a certain segment in the U.S., it just didn't appear to offer scale for the engine.
Jerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas Linebarger: You bet, Jerry.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.
Andrew Casey: Good morning and congratulations.
Thomas Linebarger: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Casey: Just a couple of clarifications and then a question on China. In the quarter, you'd talked about $35 million charges for the cessation of development and product exit, $33 million of that showed up in engines. Was the remaining two also in engines? Or was that somewhere else?
Mark Smith: Components.
Andrew Casey: Okay. Thank you, Mark. And then on China – I’ll come back offline for the other one. On China, you talked about the lack of credit availability, do you see that changing in the near future or in 2020?
Mark Smith: The credit availability issue is really in India. And just to kind of maybe provide a little more background, the credit market is supplied by non-bank credit institutions. Sometimes – in the country, they call it the shadow banking system, but it's these private credit institutions. And they had a couple of bankruptcies in there, in that segment and the market is largely closed, and to the extent it's opened up, prices are very high. So that's what's going up on India. So we do expect it to find its way through as things do in India. We do expect that to mitigate. We just don't think it's mitigating really fast. It's going to take some time because the financial problem, financial crisis not an economic one. So it is a significant issue in the country and there are other economic challenges in India. So we do expect that things are definitely worse than we expected at this time. And we expect some of those things to linger. The opportunity for us remember though, is BS VI is coming. So – and we are fully prepared for BS VI. Our technology, we believe is leading in the market. We think we have not only a technology, but we also have a cost and scale leadership as well as a service network, which we think is better than competitors. So we do hope to see that this BS VI gives us an opportunity to increase share and increase profitability in India. We just think next couple quarters are going to be rough. That's just the way I'd summarize it.
Andrew Casey: Okay. I'll leave it there, and thanks for the correction.
Mark Smith: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.
Jamie Cook: Hi, good morning and congratulation, Rich. I hope you have a fantastic retirement and thanks for all your help throughout the years. I guess sort of first question, I appreciate the color you guys gave on sort of what impacts the margins going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But I think everyone was also trying to get their arms around just the magnitude of the revenue step-down in the fourth quarter. So I know you talked the markets globally being weaker, but how much of that is just demand versus you guys also making adjustments relative to what your customers are doing sort of on the production cuts size to rightsize inventory? And then I guess my second question, Tom, as you look to 2020, can you sort of talk about cost conversations you're having with customers? Are they sort of reevaluating where their investments are going and how that could potentially be an opportunity for Cummins? And if so, should we think about that is a 2020 opportunity? Thank you.
Thomas Linebarger: Great, Jamie. So let me let Tony to talk a little bit about what's happening in North America. And I think it's applicable in some other markets, too, about inventory and inventory corrections.
Tony Satterthwaite: Hi, Jamie. This is Tony. We have OEM supply chain where we don't hold a lot of inventory for our OEM customers. We pretty much deliver to their schedule. As they adjust their schedules, they move their inventory around a bit or just their production flow. And we think that's part of the challenge we're seeing in the market today. Those adjustments are making it difficult to kind of pin down exactly what our numbers are going to be versus the market. But we are seeing a little bit of that. I would say none of our OEM customers have significant engine inventory, but there is inventory of trucks in the fields that we see peaked here at the end of September. And so that's just another signal I think that we're going to see demand coming down. The vast majority of the revenue drop into the fourth quarter is from the North American truck side though rather than all the other markets. They are down bit, but it's really North America that's down the most.
Thomas Linebarger: And we do expect market share – our market share to be impacted Jamie to some degree in the fourth quarter as well. I mean it happens every downturn. What happens is that the OEMs basically keep building to fill orders and they slowdown shipments of our engines and they use up their engines more than our engines. We see it, that market share move just as we see it move our way when things start to get busy or in fall. These quarter-to-quarter variations smooth out pretty quickly and we still expect to be in our normal range 32% to 34% or there thereabouts. But in the short-term, we expect we'll see some short-term market share numbers, which are lower just because – this is just what happens every time. So we expect it at this time too. I think with regard to your question about conversations with OEMs. There is no question that every OEM I talked to is wondering where they want to put their investments. Their decisions are still in front of them for many of them, but they are wondering because they're looking at autonomous vehicle investments. They're looking at, of course, a whole new set of truck ranges, very competitive markets. They're looking at where they want to go internationally and what that takes and what joint ventures and partnerships and they want to do. They're thinking about telematics and other information technology investments. They're thinking about electrification, fuel cells, other CO2 related investments, especially for the European truck makers of CO2 regs are really, really tough. So they just look staring down the barrel of a set of investments that look 2x or 3x their average R&D spend and asking themselves what they want to do. They're mostly making money selling diesel engines today. So the difficulty is, do I keep selling and investing the things that I'm making money today or do I prepare myself for the future where money is going to be made tomorrow? Those are hard set of discussions and we are in discussions with them all the time trying to demonstrate to them that we can help partner with them, take some of those diesel investments off the table. We also of course have electrified powertrains and now fuel cell powertrains to offer them to. But all of this is to say we can take some of those investments and still partner with you, so you can do the rest and succeed in competition. And those conversations are hot and happening all the time. Where they'll come out? We'll see. But there's no question, you can hear in my voice that I think it's an opportunity for us to expand our relationships with OEMs and increase our opportunities to sell more of both traditional powertrains and alternative powertrains.
Jamie Cook: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.
Ross Gilardi: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Thomas Linebarger: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Gilardi: Tom, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on how some of your more stable businesses like after market components, distribution and power gen would perform in a downturn. I mean do you think they move sideways or do they actually go down on the aftermarket side or are you seeing much deferred maintenance at this point that's impacting that business?
Tony Satterthwaite: Yes. Ross, this is Tony. We expect distribution and our aftermarket business to mostly move sideways in a downturn. It's not perfect, but it does not go through the same cyclical ups and downs as our first-fit business. And we've been growing the aftermarket significantly over the last couple of years. We're seeing a little – as Tom and Mark said, a little slowdown this year, a little moderation of the growth, but we have strong confidence in the aftermarket, both distribution and the parts businesses are going to look really – perform really well on the downturn.
Thomas Linebarger: And part of that Tony is due to the growing population of Cummins engine out in the field and in a number of end markets, that means we've got to build in pipeline of aftermarket opportunity over time.
Mark Smith: Yes. So I think you have that right. We've got some – we think are going to remain relatively sideways while the others go down. The other thing going on, which you probably saw in the numbers is in the distribution business, especially in North America, there's been still quite a bit of improvement driven from our initial acquisition of all of our North American distributors. We spent the first four years making sure we consolidated, got the right managers in the right place, made sure we held on to customers and let them know that we're a good distribution business and care for customers. And now what we're beginning to do is figure out how to operate those businesses more or like a North American distribution business rather than a bunch of different branches. And so we're beginning to see some improvement in profitability. We'll see where that goes from here, but there's a lot of good plans in that distribution business. So my own view is I'd like to see it do better than sideways because I think there are opportunities for it to do better than sideways during the downturn. But I think Tony has called the aftermarket point just right. We always see a little bit of noise where utilization goes down here or there. We don’t go down a little bit, but we're talking about 5% drops as opposed to 30% or 40% drops.
Ross Gilardi: Got it. Thank you. And then just a related follow-up. I mean your biggest customers still seeing in mid single-digit growth for Parts and your Components business is down 6%. I know they're not apples-to-apples and it sounds like most of the weaknesses is international as opposed to North America. But are you losing share in any of your key markets for components and is the model changing at all, particularly with respect to that customer? They're focusing very, very heavily on their distribution business and seem to be stocking more parts from others as well, so just thoughts there?
Mark Smith: The best proxy for our overall Parts business is really the Distribution business. The Components business is probably 70% for us fit, Ross. So turbochargers what was going on the new equipment, obviously that's down quite heavily in some of the markets right now. Our underlying Parts business, we're confident in that. That's not the real issue here.
Thomas Linebarger: Yes. And by the way, we believe that with OEMs like our customers, them doing well in parts is not a detriment to comments because remember there's a whole group of parts players, secondhand parts players and rebuild parts builders and even people that are bringing in different makes of parts. And so what we are wanting to do is make sure our end customers get real quality parts and they get a good service experience. And if they do that Cummins and our customers grow their market share and we earn good parts revenue. So we earn good parts of margin selling through our OEM channels just as we do sell in through our own channel. So from our point of view, just gaining share in the market through our customers and through us all looks like a win to us in terms of both revenue growth and profit growth. So for us, them – our customers gaining share is not a bad thing, but a good thing.
Ross Gilardi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joel Tiss with BMO.
Joel Tiss: Hey, guys. How is it going? 
Thomas Linebarger: Hi, Joel.
Joel Tiss: I just wondered if you can talk a little bit about power gen. The revenues were up a little bit. You guys have been working on that business for four years or five years to lower the cost. And just any color on why the margins are under pressure there?
Thomas Linebarger: Joel, I'd love to throw that one to Tony, but probably isn't very yet. I'll give them a quarter or two. But no, you hit it on the head. I mean we're not where we want to be on the power gen business. The good news, of course, overwhelmingly been data centers. The data center business has continued to grow. We keep expecting it maybe to be built out, but it just turns out not to be. We're continuing to see more data center business. And of course, we've now got the Asian section of data center business also growing, which is, which gives kind of a second kick to the data center business. The basic standby business has not been good for some time. It's not that there isn't any, there is. It's a big business and it doesn't – it's a lot of business for our distribution system, but it hasn't been growing. It hasn't really recovered in any significant way. And we saw a little bit of recovery earlier this year and thought, well finally, and then it kind of tailed off. And then of course we had – we've had a couple of really bad areas like the Middle East has been really bad for a while, but I've just kind of pulled the life out of whatever growth we did see. So we're not exactly sure what that means about the market. We have a lot of market data about it and trying to understand what the future trend is. I mean, we understand what the past is really well, what the future trend looks like. It's hard to see, but it looks like, broadly speaking that energy demand while still increasing is increasing at a rate that's slower than energy capacity build. And that's mostly because while there's been growth since the downturn in 2008 and 2009, its growth has been relatively modest and infrastructure has kept up as compared to the high growth we saw especially in developing countries in the decade before. That said, we got a lot more work to do. It's still a profitable business for us and good returns, especially when you consider the fact we've got a distribution part to it, plus we've got all the industrial business engines that come from it, but we want it to be more profitable and we're disappointed with where we are. There's just nothing else to say about that.
Joel Tiss: Okay. And then so Tony doesn't feel left out. Can you give us your kind of best shot at, if you think the underlying demand for transportation is enough to absorb all the excess capacity that's in the channel now, by the time we exit 2021?
Tony Satterthwaite: That's a tough question. I probably was better prepared to answer the power gen, and this was given I ran that business quite a few years. That's a great question. And I don't think I have a good answer to be honest. I don't really have a strong view of that yet. So maybe in a very unfair thing, I'll see if Rich wants to have a shot.
Joel Tiss: Yes, that’s one of his babies.
Thomas Linebarger: He's going to bring out the pictures of his grandkids first, but then he'll answer the…
Richard Freeland: Just play back one more time, Joel.
Joel Tiss: The growth in transportation demand, the way you guys see it is enough that by the end of 2021, it can absorb all the excess capacity that we're seeing in the channel right now.
Richard Freeland: Okay. Yes, I mean I think so and what you have Joel, you know, when lead times get long, the order boards actually get over inflated because people are wanting to get, build slots and all that. And right now I think actually it's underrepresented what the demand is because I think – I mean what the future demand is. So like I talked to fleets, they're not putting orders in right now because they're saying lead time is low, I can put it in later, I can delay that. But eventually the trucks run and they need to be replaced. And so I just think we're going to have our normal shake out over a few quarters and then kind of get the backlog cleared out and the orders will begin to come back in.
Thomas Linebarger: And maybe just a little historical protective, Joel because it's always hard when you're here at the floor to figure out when does it all get right. But historically, you'd say what – I mean, you'd say in four quarters the market will be back. Again, there maybe something unique about this, but it isn't obvious that there is something unique. So we'd expect by the end of the year that we would indeed have absorbed whatever there is. There's one other trend underlying. You've probably seen this, but people like the new engines and trucks, they're seeing much better performance reliability out of new engines and trucks. So I think anything that's older than 2017 you're going to see no matter how, whatever we are in the cycle, people are going to want to switch out those trucks and engines just because they're getting such lower operating costs out of the newer engines and trucks. That'll be a little bit of a boost, I think as we start to get out to the back half of the year.
James Hopkins: Okay. I think we've got time for one more last question.
Operator: Okay. Our next question will come from David Raso with Evercore ISI.
David Raso: All right. Thank you.
Thomas Linebarger: You slipped in David. Way to go.
David Raso: I have a question about the JV income, really a clarification, but then I want to talk to the markets real quickly. I apologize with the phone cutting out, maybe I missed it. The JV incomes implied bouncing back in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Is that related to some of the emerging markets and how you're handling the upcoming emission standards? I'm just curious why it bounces back from $68 million to implied $79 million in the fourth quarter?
James Hopkins: Yes. Hey, Ross, this is James. So there's a couple of little things go on from the third to the fourth quarter, so most of the markets are relatively stable as we go from Q3 to Q4. China gets a little bit better than some of the on highway markets, like commercial vehicles starts popping up just a little bit as well. And so you've got a couple of positive things going in the right direction there. But it's a relatively modest on both from Q3 to Q4 in the grand scheme of things.
David Raso: But I was trying to think about is what you're implying about 2020 to have that bounce back because in the quarter the royalty and interest income really dropped down as just wasn't sure what was going on there. So we'll talk offline. What I wanted to ask about particular though, outside of North America truck and obviously Tom, you have great insight from your customers and markets, what they're telling you, different players do different things and getting ahead of the curve behind the curve outside of North America truck. Can you just take me around the horn quickly on which markets do you think what you're hearing from your customers? They're actually getting ahead of the curve on taking production down to almost leading things out by the end of the year, which ones are so clearly behind the curve and which ones look about just right. Just we'll get some level set on various geographies and end markets going into…?
James Hopkins: Yes. Let's start with China. So clearly in China, the construction guys overbuilt, in the second half of 2018 thinking they're going to have a great 2019. They overbuilt and they're clearly behind the curve, right. You saw that – you heard the numbers, like the markets up and we're down a pile and that's just because they're just selling dealer inventory and their own manufactured inventory, so that that's for sure. It won't take very many quarters before they're caught up, but they're in not at that stronger market, so it's stronger than we thought it would be today, but it's not so strong. So we're hopeful they'll catch up in a few quarters. But again, it just really depends on end markets. I think truck markets a little bit better than we thought. I think people are pretty much caught up. Nobody's really far ahead. The only thing as you heard was there some prebuy done, which means they'll have some inventory, but it's mostly in gas. It's pretty small markets I'd say. China, we got the construction markets to catch up and they're behind and the truck market's kind of on. In India, it's just – we just got the rug pulled out. The whole finance thing means it's all underwrite. There's nobody carrying a bunch of inventory or anything. There are some, but that's not the big problem. The big problem is the demands all completely flatness back. So there's really, I mean who's behind the head is kind of the side story. In Europe by the way is straight on. So Europe has got no big challenges in inventory a little bit here and there, but generally speaking, Europe has kind of moved from pretty good, okay, they're not – it's not a disaster. It's just, okay. And I see pretty quickly everybody's adjusting hourly rates in Europe. I was just talking to a bunch of the OEMs they're all adjusting down. Everybody's making the adjustments. There'll be down to the right numbers in a quarter or two. So I'd say that's right. On the mining side, they adjusted super quickly. I mean, in my opinion too quickly maybe, but mining is not a disaster or anything. It just rose up and it kind of leveled out pretty quickly and they're not overbuying and for obvious reasons they already did and it's bad. So mining is one where I don't think we have a lot of – they're on plan. In fact, maybe keeping costs lower than they would have in the past segments. And then Latin America, I guess broadly speaking, things aren't very strong. We thought Brazil would be better than it is. And the big issue has been export markets. The domestic demand is about where we thought, it's up a few percent in GDP. I mean, and then underlying demands up. But the export market, because Argentina is a big wreck. And frankly all around, Latin America what you're having is used to be Brazil was the problem. Now you got every other economy is a problem. And so there is a little inventory there, but the numbers have been so low that it's nothing to worry about. So I guess the only place I'm really worried about is China construction with regard to inventory and we're already reporting those numbers thereof. And in North America, Tony talked about this, but there'll be a couple of quarters where our market share will fall while they use their own engines and get all those, get their truck production down and get everything leveled out. But then it will be right back to normal.
Mark Smith: And then just a smaller market, but marine feels like it's on a bit of an opportunity…
David Raso: Is there a pick up in marine or is it production just getting back in line with a flat business?
Mark Smith: Yes. I think demand is picking up.
Thomas Linebarger: Demand is picking up a little. Again, it's in a weak set of markets. It's just that it started, came off the bottom basically.
David Raso: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Thomas Linebarger: Thank you, David.
Mark Smith: Thank you, David.
Thomas Linebarger: Thank you. Bye-bye.
Tony Satterthwaite: So thank you, everybody.
Mark Smith: Yes. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-30 09:00:00) =====

With that out of the way, we'll begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you, James. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter results and finished with a discussion of our outlook for 2019. Mark will then take you through more details of our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year. Revenues for the second quarter of 2019 were a record $6.2 billion, an increase of 1% compared to the second quarter of 2018. EBITDA was a record $1.1 billion, or 17%, compared to $897 million, or 14.6%, a year ago. Lower campaign costs, positive pricing and lower material costs more than offset our increased investments in research and engineering, the impact of tariffs and lower joint venture income in China. Engine business revenues were flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago. Revenues in North America, increased by 7%, driven by higher industry production of heavy and medium duty trucks, as well as continued strong demand in construction markets. International revenues declined by 15%, primarily as a result of lower demand in Chinese light duty truck and construction markets. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 15.4%, compared to 13.4% for the same period in 2018. Lower campaign costs, improved pricing and lower material costs more than offset lower joint venture income increased investment in research and engineering, and the negative impact of tariffs. Sales for our distribution segment grew by 2% year-over-year, driven by higher demand for power generation equipment in North America. Second quarter EBITDA was a record $172 million or 8.5% of sales, compared to 7.3% in the second quarter 2018. EBITDA margins benefited from higher volumes and positive pricing. The second quarter revenues for the component segment declined by 2%. Sales in North America increased 5%, driven by higher truck build rates, while revenues in international markets declined by 12%, as a result of lower truck demand in Europe, China and India. EBITDA for the second quarter was $297 million, or 16.1%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in EBITDA margins was primarily due to lower campaign costs, and the benefit of material cost reduction programs, which more than offset increased development and increase investment in the development of new products, aimed at emission standards in China and India. We are currently selling a limited number of national standard six products for specific urban applications in China, such as sanitation vehicles and will ramp up production in 2020, and again in 2021, when all medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles are scheduled to comply with NS6 standards. In India, we will begin producing new products later this year, as we prepare for a transition to the broad stage 6 standard in April 2020. Power system sales in the second quarter declined by 3%. Demand in industrial markets declined 11% due to lower sales of oil and gas and mining engines, while sales of power generation products were flat. Power generation sales increased 12% in North America, driven by continued strength in the data center markets offset by 11% decline in International markets, mainly in Europe and the Middle East. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by 2%. EBITDA in the second quarter was 14.4%, compared to 14.9% a year ago, the decrease in EBITDA was due largely to lower joint venture income in China, where we experienced declined demand for standby generator sets. In the Electrified Power business, EBITDA was a loss of $33 million in the second quarter, in line with our expectations, as we invest in the development of new products for commercial launch, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. Now, I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the second quarter of 2019, starting with North America, and then I'll cover some of our largest International markets. Our second quarter revenues in North America boost 7% to a record $3.9 billion driven by higher industry build rates of medium and heavy-duty trucks, continued growth in the sales of construction equipment and increased sales of power generation equipment to data center customers. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks grew 19% in the second quarter of 2019, compared to a year ago, and 4% compared to the first quarter of this year, supported by a strong, but declining industry backlog. Our market share through June was 35%, compared to 33% a year ago, representing our highest market share in five years, and reflecting the strong performance of our products in the eyes of our customers. Production of medium duty trucks increased 14% in the second quarter. A growing U.S. economy, coupled with high levels of consumer spending, low unemployment and low interest rates continues to drive demand for medium duty trucks. Our market share in the medium duty truck market was 78% through June, compared to 80% a year ago. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 20% compared to a year ago, as we increased production of a new engine for RAM2500 and 3500 pickup trucks. Year-to-date shipments for pickup truck customers have increased 6%. Engine demand for construction equipment in North America increased 10% in the second quarter and remained that historically high levels supported by non-residential construction and infrastructure spending. Revenues for power generation grew by 12% due to higher demand and data center markets partially offset by lower sales to recreational vehicle OEM. Demand for engines in oil and gas markets declined by 91% due to a sharp reduction in purchases of new fracking equipment. Our international revenues decreased by 6% in the second quarter of 2019, compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.5 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year. Higher power generation equipment sales to datacenter customers and engine sales to oil and gas markets were partially offset by lower demand and on Highway in construction markets. Industry demand from medium and heavy-duty trucks and China decreased by 9% compared to a year ago, even though the market was positively impacted by a pre-buy of natural gas engines ahead of the move to NS6 standards in July. We estimate that the impact of this pre-buy was approximately 20,000 units, increasing market size by 5% in the quarter, our market share improved to 12.8% this quarter from 10.9% a year ago, as we increased our share at full-time. We expect further improvement in our market share in subsequent quarters due to further share expansion at our OEM, and a shift in the market towards over the road trucks versus construction related dump trucks. Industry sales of light duty trucks declined by 9% in the second quarter, and our engine market share was 8%, which is 1% higher than a year ago. This increase was driven by our new joint venture with JAC, which launched in late 2018. In the second quarter, the light duty market was impacted by increased enforcement of loading regulations, significantly reducing both second quarter industry demand and our projections for the remainder of the year. Some truck model has historically been registered as light duty trucks are now to be classified as medium duty trucks, which limits access to urban areas and requires additional licensing for drivers. Second quarter demand for excavators in China increased 4% from a year ago. Our market share increased from 15.3% to 15.6%, driven by the strong performance of our local partners. Demand for power generation equipment was down 3% in the second quarter, with lower demand for standby power, partially offset by growth in data center markets. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures was $516 million, a reduction of 1% from the second quarter a year ago with lower industry truck production and the impact of a week a rupee partially offset by increased demand for power generation equipment. Industry truck sales decreased 21% year-over-year in line with our expectations with lower demand driven by the timing of elections, as well as challenges in the truck financing industry. Within the truck market, we saw more severe decline in heavy duty applications where we have the highest share. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2019 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We now expect company revenues to be flat for the year, which is at the low end of our prior guidance range. We're maintaining our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America at 300,000 units, up 5% compared to 2018. The industry backlog declined this quarter to below 200,000 units from its peak of over 300,000 eight months ago. While inventory is elevated at 80,000 units. Our guidance assumes lower industry production of trucks in the fourth quarter, driven both by fuel workdays as well as reduced build rates. We expect our market to be at the high end of our prior forecast of 32% to 34%. The combination of the increased capacity of fleets and lower freight demand has resulted in lower utilization of available equipment in the industry. Because of this reduced utilization, we've seen lower demand in our parts and remanufacturing business. We expect parts demand to continue to be relatively weak through the end of the year as dealers begin to reduce parts inventory in anticipation of lower market activity. In the medium duty truck market, we are maintaining our forecast for industry production of 140,000 units, up 6% year-over-year and we expect our market share to be in the range of 74% to 76% unchanged from prior guidance. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for 2019, compared to a very strong 2018 and unchanged from our expectations three months ago. In China, we now expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 2% in 2019. We are maintaining our outlook for medium heavy new truck demand at 1.2 million units, representing a 10% decline from last year. In the light duty truck market we now expect a 12% reduction in demand, compared to our prior guidance of 7% down, this decline is driven by the more stringent enforcement of overloading regulations I discussed earlier, we expect our market share in the medium and heavy duty market to be in the range of 13% to 14% and in light duty, expect our share to be 8% to 9%, both in line with our prior guidance. We now expect industry sales of excavators to be flat with the record levels achieved in 2018. This compares to our prior guidance of down 10%, and it's driven by increased exports of excavators developing countries primarily in Southeast Asia. In India, we now project revenue, including joint ventures to be down 5% compared to our prior guidance of flat. We anticipate industry demand for trucks to be 17% lower than the record levels experienced in 2018 and compared to our prior guidance of down 5%. Truck demand is being negatively impacted by the continuing high cost and low availability of credit in India shadow banking system, which has been under pressure due to defaults by non-bank lenders. We continue to expect power generation and construction to grow 5% to 10% due to continued infrastructure investment. In Brazil, we are now projecting truck production to increase 2% in 2019, down from 13%, three months ago. Economic growth has not accelerated Brazil as much as we anticipated this year. The GDP growth now projected at 1%, lower economic growth has resulted lower demand growth in truck, construction and power generation markets, compared to three months ago. We now project our revenues in Brazil to be down 10% compared to our prior projection of flat. We continue to expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to be down 5% this year, we project demand for oil and gas engines will decline 40%, which is unchanged from a prior guidance. However, we now anticipate sales in North America will decline by 75%, compared to our 60% down expectation three months ago with lower demand for new equipment in the Permian Basin, as well as reduced demand for engine rebuilds. This deterioration in our outlook for North America is offset by increased sales to China. The demand for mining engines has moderated over the last three months as commodity prices have fallen and capital budgets have been cut. We now expect mining engine sales to be down 5% lower than our prior guidance of up 5%. Demand for power generation equipment was flat in the second quarter, and we expect demand to remain at second quarter levels to the remainder of the year. We expect revenue to be flat for the full year with growth and data center markets and increased military revenue offset by lower sales of generator sets to the RV market, lower demand and backup power applications in China, and a drop in large plant power applications in Europe. In summary, we're now expecting revenues to be flat for the year at the low end of our previous guidance, driven by lower demand in international truck markets, moderating aftermarket demand in North America, and the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollars, we are maintaining our EBITDA guidance of 16.25%, to 16.75% of sales as lower joint venture income and the impact of lower volumes will be offset by lower material and other costs. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 15%, the 10th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. We continue to project returning 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. In June, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the majority of shares a fuel cell systems provider Hydrogenics Corporation for $290 million. This agreement is still set to Hydrogenic shareholder approval, as well as other customary closing conditions. Strong execution across all of our businesses resulted in record revenue being translated into record EBITDA and operating cash flow in the first half of the year. As we move into the second half of 2019, our guidance projects that revenues will decline from second quarter levels as several of our end markets experience lower levels of industry production. The company is well-positioned as we move this period to repeat our track record of increasing cycle over cycle earnings and returning significant cash to shareholders. We will continue to invest in technology to ensure the future success of our stakeholders, while reviewing areas for additional cost reduction and efficiency gains, as we have in prior cycles. Now let me turn it over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. I'll start with a quick summary of the drivers of our strong financial performance in the second quarter, and then comment on our revised outlook for the full year. Second quarter revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 7%, and International revenues declined by 6%, currency movements negatively impacted overall company revenues by 2%. Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization or EBITDA were a record $1.1 billion or 17% of sales for the quarter. EBITDA increased by $161 million over the second quarter last year, as a result of stronger gross margins and higher other income, which more than offset increased research and development expenses and lower joint venture income. Gross margin of $1.6 billion, or 26.4%, improved by $201 million. Results for the second quarter of 2018 included a $181 million charge for an engine system campaign. In addition to lower campaign costs, improve pricing benefits from material cost reduction programs more than offset the impact of higher tariffs year-over-year. Our selling administrative and research costs $880 million increased by $48 million year-over-year, driven primarily by new product development in the engine components and Electrified Power segments. Joint venture income declined by $14 million, driven by weaker demand in light duty truck and power generation markets in China, in addition to some increased expenses in China associated with the launch of new on highway products, to meet the new National 6 emissions regulations. Other income of $43 million increased by $18 million, primarily driven by $18 million of mark-to-market gains on the investments that underpin our non-qualified benefit plans. The mark-to-market gains were recorded other income in the income statement, and with eliminations in our segment reporting. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.4% down from 22.5% in the second quarter last year, and in line with our full year forecast of 21.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.27 in the second quarter, up from $3.32 last year, resulting from stronger earnings, a lower effective tax rate and the positive impact of share repurchase activity completed over the prior 12 months. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $808 million, bringing the year-to-date total to a record of $1.2 billion, up $747 million from the same period last year, driven by stronger earnings and a much slower pace of working capital expansion. I will now comment on our revised guidance for 2019. For the engine segment we expect full year revenues to be down 2% to up 2%, compared to our previous guidance of growth of 1% to 5%. This lower revenue outlook is the result of a weaker projection for parts sales in North America, weaker demand in that Chinese light duty truck market, and a slower pace of economic growth in Brazil. We've revised our forecast of EBITDA margins in the engine business to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% down from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16% driven primarily by the impact of the lower sales outlook, and weaker joint venture income in China. For the distribution segment, we now expect revenues to be 1% to 5%, compared to our prior guidance of 2% to 6% with a slight adjustment driven by a stronger dollar, and therefore a higher currency headwind. We are raising our outlook for EBIT margins -- EBITDA margins to be in the range of 8% to 8.5% compared to our prior guidance of 7.5% to 8.5%, driven by stronger operational performance, which more than offsets the negative impact of a depreciating dollar. 2019, we now expect components revenue to be between down 2% to up 2%, compared to our prior year projections of growth of 1% to 5%, driven by a lower demand in China and India. We've raised our forecast for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 15.75% to 16.25%, up from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16.25%, driven by stronger operational performance year-to-date. In Power Systems, revenues are forecast to be down 2% to up 2% unchanged from our prior guidance. We're also maintaining our focus for EBITDA margins, to be in the range of 13.25% to 14%. In the Electrified Power segment, we continue to expect the net expense of $120 million to $150 million, as we continue to make targeted investments and that advance new product development towards commercial launch. The net impact of the changes to individual segment projections is that we now focus total company revenues to be flat in 2019 at the lower end of our previous range of flat to up 4%. Tom said, we are maintaining our forecast for company EBITDA margins to be in the range of 16.25% to 16.75% full year operating cash flow is projected to exceed 10% of sales. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $133 million, bringing our year-to-date, total investment to $242 million, and we still expect our full-year investments to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. In the second quarter we have returned $179 million to shareholders, for the first six months we have returned $458 million through dividends and share repurchase activity. As Tom mentioned our board recently approved a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, which reflects our confidence in the long-term performance and commitment to strong shareholder returns. We expect to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year through share repurchase and dividend. To summarize, we delivered a strong second quarter, and record first half of the year in terms of sales EBITDA and operating cash flow. These results extend our track record of improving earnings cycle over cycle, delivering first quarter return on invested capital and enabling us to invest in future growth, while maintaining strong cash returns to shareholders. Now, I'll turn it back over to Tom.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you, Mark. As you remember, we announced on April 29th and then discussed in our first quarter earnings call that we'd initiated an internal review of our emissions certification and compliance processes for our pickup truck applications as a result of conversations with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board. Our review continues, and we are proactively working closely with the EPA and CARB and other agencies to address their questions. During conversations with the EPA and CARB about the effectiveness of our 2019 pickup truck applications, the agencies raise concerns that certain aspects of our emission systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emission control systems and did not fully comply with the requirements for certification. As a result, our internal review has been largely focused on the agency's concerns. We are working closely with the agencies to enhance our emission systems to improve the effectiveness of our pickup truck applications, and to fully address the agencies requirements and meet the expectations of our customers. Consistent with the values and the history of the company, which include a strong commitment to compliance, we’ll work with regulators and other agencies to address the issues identified in our internal review and develop future technologies that will advance our industry. It's too early to conclude on any changes that we will make to our processes and organization as a result of our internal review. It's also too soon to know what the response of the regulators will be to our view, or to determine any potential financial consequences. Now, let me give it back to James to open for Q&A.
James Hopkins: Thanks, Tom. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Michel, we're now ready for our first question.
Operator: Our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Jamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess two questions, one for Mark one for Tom. Mark, just on the change in engine guidance understanding you took your sales down a little -- the margins I guess were down a little lower than what I would have thought, so if you could just help me understand the puts and takes there? And then Tom, a question for you on 2020 understanding you probably want to frame that more, when we get to your Analyst Day or the fourth quarter, but can you just -- given you touched so many markets, can you give us some view on how you're thinking about 2020 given the macro concerns out there, and then any positives and negatives, investors should think about outside of the markets that could help or be a drag on Cummins that are within your control? Thank you.
Mark Smith: Okay, Jamie, so quickly the two main drivers of the lower margins for the engine business, lower top-line outlook which in part is due to a kind of leveling off of parts demand in North America, and then of course the lower outlook for joint venture, it is principally driven by China, especially driven by Canada lower outlook for the light duty market, which is really all negative impact the JV earnings which constrict off the EBITDA percent. So those are the two primary reasons otherwise everything else is pretty much in line.
Tom Linebarger: And with regard to next year I will just make a few general comments, Jamie and of course we'll be very detailed when we get to the Analyst Day about what we're seeing. But broadly speaking, as you know many of our markets are either at or near cyclical peaks in our view, which means that inevitably we will start to see some of these markets decline. We don't know the exact quarter, we done a fairly detailed projection for the U.S. truck market because there's a lot of data and it’s easier to do. But even that has some variance depending on who in the industry you ask. Most of the other markets have more variance as to when people think they thought but many of them will inevitably fall at least to some degree, so we are prepared for 2020, and even into 2021 for markets to be relatively lower cyclically, at least many of our major ones and we are prepared in the following sense. We are already managing our cost to make sure that our capacity levels and cost levels will be at the right place when it's time and making sure that we're the first to be ready and the first to react. And so, a lot of our focus is on ensuring that were prepared from a cost structure point of view for that cyclical downturn that's how we ensure that in the next downturn we have better margins than the prior downturn. The second thing is that our products are performing incredibly well, that's why you see many of our market share projections sort of tipping towards the higher end of our estimation for the year as because we think our products are performing very well. We think that serves us well in downturns because a few points of market share can make up some cyclical downturn. So, we will continue to emphasize the quality and performance of our products and we will continue to launch new products. So that when we're in downturn, our competitors will see us continues to go from strength to strength because in downturns as well, we also think we can gain market share and commitment from customers. Also, we will be seeing some gain hopefully from the SS6 and NS6, we've been investing significantly in engines and components for those launches and we think we'll be ready. We feel ready now and we think our products will outperform competitors and we think that will give us a chance to step up our market positions in both India and China, which we think will be lasting positions. So those are just some of the puts and takes, again, not all markets will follow the same time, we have a very global market and as you know, not all the cycles of the same, but we are just prepared for cyclical downturns are turning into this mode. It says while this is lower and we're going to make sure our cost structure right and we will gain share from competitors and continue to launch new products in a way that conditions are better for the fall the upturn.
Jamie Cook: Thank you. That was helpful. I will get back in queue.
Operator: Our question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is now open.
Steven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. On your down 10% earnings from JVs in your guidance. I think that implies around flat for the second half versus down 15% to 20% in the first half that, how much of that is easier comps or is it an expected pickup in sales, emission guidance for something else.
Mark Smith: So, I think we will start to see a tail off certainly on a system side of our joint venture earnings towards the back half of the last year, so your method is exactly right, Steve. There is no assumption [ph], it is just kind of leveling out in aggregate and flat in the second half of the year.
Steven Fisher: Okay. And then could you just clarify the parts outlook to what extent are you already seeing a lower demand exiting the quarter, I think you had 2% growth disclosed in the distribution segment. So, has that already started to turn negative or are you just adjusting production and anticipation of lower demand later this year and the next year?
Rich Freeland: Steven, its Rich. Let me give just a little background on parts, some perspective. We are parts and service business for last three years which has grown about 10% a year, since we put more and more product out there and more complex power trains, we've seen some pretty rapid growth in that. What we forecast about 4% to 5% growth again this year, including pricing and what we've seen is bit of a fall back on that. And mostly in North America as we look to truck utilization, the data is not a strong here, but our hypothesis is that older trucks are not being run as heavily and so therefore our parts and service down a bit. And when that happens, we've seen -- there will be some adjustment, kind of in dealer inventories and adjustment there. We don't think inventories are bloated at this time or excessive. I think just some prudent trimming of inventories is what I would expect to see. Again, this reduction that we put on our forecast basically says we will still be flat to last year. So, at a record levels and so it remains bullish going forward. We're putting out about 1.5 million engines a year, so over the last three years. So those engines move into the parts consuming business. So, we think a little bit of adjustment second half of the year, bullish long term.
Steven Fisher: Great, thanks, Rich.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer of Melius. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Actually, yeah. My question was on parts, and that that was fantastic color Rich, on the past growth rate, et cetera. Just out of curiosity, I mean, you mentioned it all tickets bloated, how much of your sales goes to non-Cummins, I guess distribution? If you're willing to give that number? And then, do you think is the six-month adjustment? And then, were kind of all clear. Part of the reason I'm asking is just we didn't see this sort of slowdown as you had in pack car, obviously selling to someone markets.
Mark Smith: Yes, so I would say, I don't have exact numbers in but more than half, the channels putting split more than half going to through non-OEM channels. So, there is a wide range of customers buying inventory.
Tom Linebarger: What Mark is saying is more than half of go through OEM dealer channel versus our own channel. And that's in the truck side. And as you said, the adjustments, the adjustments in parts, they're kind of hard to predict this time. Because there relatively small adjustments in grand scheme of parts inventories, but they can have an effect on a quarter. And we see this every downturn there are some adjustment. And frankly, we're not that good at predicting much quarter it is. So, we're now kind of we were surprised that it was now, but it was. And I think what Rich is saying is that every time we see this, we see it every downturn, it tends not to be lasting very long. Parts is a very stable business, our services business, so, we don't expect it to keep going down, we expect it to level off. And then we expect to see it continue to increase in future quarter. So, we're just trying to be prudent that it seems inevitable in a downturn that dealers will adjust some inventories. And we saw a little bit of that in this second quarter and we expect to see a little bit more of it as we go on second half of the year. But we'll see, right what happens. And like you said, everybody is going to have different circumstances depending on where they're holding inventory, how much they're holding and all that kind of. I think we should just expect variability, but it's inevitable if you just look over the cycle that parts inventory dropped some in the downturn, and then they rise up again as things start to rise.
Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thanks, Tom.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ann Duignan: Hi, good morning.
Tom Linebarger: Hi, Ann.
Ann Duignan: Maybe you could walk us through the different regions of your business and comment a little further on which one markets you see as being at peak. I mean, everybody understands North America heavy duty, and maybe the impact that has on components also. But what other end markets do you feel are post peak?
Tom Linebarger: In, most of the truck markets are at or near peak. I mean, Brazil is a notable exception, because it's kind of running along the bottom, but most of the others. So, India is already on the way down, China look like it's on the way down. Heavy duty, you talked about, medium duty is holding strong, but it's been up for a while. So, it just, and Europe is the one we are not sure about. But even that showed a little weakness in this last quarter. It's hard to say exactly how much what that means. But we've heard some rumblings out of Europe that some of the truck makers are getting concerned. So, it's sort of hard to find a truck market that doesn't feel peakish, if not already headed down the other side. It looks to us like mining is a little bit of a different story. It doesn't look like it's at peak, but it's definitely leveled off. I mean, there's just nothing else to say about that. Now, whether it's going to turn back up again or just sort of steadily grow we're not sure that's kind of our view is that it's going to have a slow growth from here for a little bit longer, but there's no question that compared to a year ago. It's leveled off. And so that that doesn't look like it's got a whole bunch more left in it. And then I'd say construction markets. U.S. construction markets still strong but at some point, if after the truck market, it feels like construction market has to also tail down and we already think China's got to start tailing down because China has been up for a while and unless they continue to stimulate the market is likely to head down. India, India has got some -- the government has continued to invest and stimulate there, and we think they probably still will. So, India might hold up a little longer on the construction side. But again, that's some of them. But you remember and we show where we kind of put all the markets up there. We'll bring that that to the Analyst Day, and we'll kind of put all the markets on there. But suffice it to say those we look at that there's more kind of up and around the top of the that little hills and then there are at the bottom on their way up. So, we're just being realistic about what that means for revenues in 2020.
Ann Duignan: Okay, I appreciate that. I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs, your line is open.
Jerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Mark Smith: Jerry, hi. Good morning.
Jerry Revich: Tom, I'm wondering now that you folks have Isuzu joint venture setup, can you just update us on the market share opportunity for you folks on light duty diesel globally. I'm wondering, if you could flush out what the opportunities set is and what the strategy is now with the joint venture and how it fits in for the company's overall opportunity set.
Tom Linebarger: Sure, it's early days in that joint venture, but we're really pleased with our conversations. It's a terrific company, I mean it's not a company that we had done a lot of business with until we started having conversations with them. But although we've always been impressed with them from afar, they we kind of feel like at least in the off-highway market where we see each other, they're the one the engine that we think is actually competitive to ours, and we think highly of them. So anyway, we've had terrific conversations, but we are early days as to kind of what the market share opportunity. But here's how we're thinking about it together, is that the two companies are both spending a lot of investment -- putting a lot of investment into the various technologies that will occupy the commercial industrial equipment space. So, think about not only diesel but natural gas and hybrid and electrification and fuel cells and start to think about what that means. Then they also have a truck business which has to identify -- also has to do autonomous safety, other integration of their vehicle. So, they're thinking about all the investments they need to make in that all the investments they need to make in power train and coming up and thinking that tips us over a company our size. So, but they need to be leading, there's no room for laggards, there is not going to be any second place is there, I mean, they're the strongest truck company in Japan, they have a terrific market share in Southeast Asia and they're the second largest and diesel engine maker with us. So, what we're going to try to do is figure out how we can make sense and rationalize these investments in these various technologies, and it's my sense that they would like to figure out a way to do that, so that Cummins can do a lot of the investments in the power train, and they can focus more investment on the truck. And if they can do that in a way that allows them to ensure supply, make sure they're leading utilize the technology and assets they have, I think that's going to be a solution that they like. But there -- there's a lot of conversations about to have about how you do that. And the reason we think this is really a great opportunity for both companies is if we can figure this out, I think a lot of other OEMs around the world would like to figure out something similar there. There all of us are stuck with the same problem of a lot of investment in new technology for essentially the same markets and essentially the same size, which looks like an equation that again, keeps most of us over unless we can figure out some solutions to either add content and or find new ways to rationalize investment. So, I think it's a really important set of work that we're doing, that could be indicative of how some of the other industry discussions go.
Jerry Revich: That's really interesting. And on the shorter-term side, you folks are preemptively looking at markets where demand could be weaker. Can you just update us on your framework for detrimental margin, so the detrimental margins were really in the teams on this revision, which was nice to see, are you optimistic that you can achieve better detrimental than the mid-20s that I believe you’ve targeted in the past?
Mark Smith: Well, we will give you a more precise of that in the Analyst, Jerry, as we get a closer view on those markets, but as clear goal of improving cycle-over-cycle earnings, and you're right, yes, in the second half of this year, we will be in the kind of mid-teens, I think we've got to balance that against just some of the investment needs in the near-term on some of the new technologies. So, we'll come out and give you a clear answer, but you should be clear, that we committed to improving those earnings on the down cycle as well as the up.
Jerry Revich: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Leiker of Baird. Your line is open.
David Leiker: Good morning, everybody.
Mark Smith: Thank you, David.
David Leiker: I wanted to talk a little bit, how you get a great amount of detail in terms of year-end markets and what you're looking for. I was wondering if we could dig into a little bit further in terms of that pace of production going into the third quarter and fourth quarter. We're hearing different things from different folks that, build rates may hold up through the end of the year. But just you're seeing lower -- you're thinking that daily build rates actually fall as we go through Q4. That something you're thinking that might happen? Are you seeing that in some of the schedule says you look further out towards the end of the year?
Rich Freeland: Okay. Hey David, this is Rich. So, a few things. One, we're not seeing it in the short-term schedules, they remain strong. We see out our visibility through Q3. And what we're doing just planning for a scenario, where production begins to fall off as the backlog goes down. And so, we have no visibility to that. We've just seen it in past cycles that some OEMs don't run at this elevated rate, because people are working pretty close to capacity right now. As a backlog comes down, what we've seen in past cycles is people begin, don't run full steam all the way to the backlog is gone. They begin to moderate their production schedules. So, we haven't seen a lot of that, we built that into our guidance, but that will happen in Q4. And of course, there is a scenario where that doesn't happen. And we're prepared for that also. But that's the vision we have is more on what we've seen in past cycles, David.
David Leiker: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just one additional item on the balance sheet. The working capital numbers pretty high. It looks like receivables and inventory. Mostly just any thoughts on that and where you think that trends over the second half of the year? Thanks.
Mark Smith: I think, when we look at our metrics business. There are pretty similar to where we were last year, our inventory hasn't certainly kind of leveled off in the second quarter. So, I would expect to be in that kind of the 20% of sales range for working capital overall, past dues were in pretty good shape, collections are in good shape. So yes, but to the extent we're facing some weaker outlook then would expect to bring it down. And there would be some positive cash flow impact from that earlier in the downturn.
David Leiker: I was looking on the cash flow statement and your pretty significant use of working capital in this quarter versus the same quarter last year?
Mark Smith: Yes, that's just Q2 this one of the strongest quarters ramping up from Q1, which I don't see…
David Leiker: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
Adam Uhlman: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Mark Smith: Good morning, Adam.
Adam Uhlman: I had a follow-up on David's question on the cash flow. I guess, the share repurchase has been kind of low so far this year. And you reiterate the plan of returning 75% of the operating cash to shareholders this year. I'm just wondering, if any depending deal activity or potential deal activity could lead to a pause in that share repurchase plan for the second half of the year?
Mark Smith: I guess, there are a number of factors that go into share repurchase in any given quarter. But we just restarted our current expectation is we'll get to around 75% of operating cash flow item. I guess there are some scenarios in which that could be a little bit different. Those are not the ones that we see right now for this year.
Adam Uhlman: Okay. Got you. And then on the power gen markets, it sounds like the data center demand has been holding up relatively strong. I wonder, if you could talk through what you're seeing with your order rates? Have you seen any kind of -- any softness within the data center market and just how much visibility do you really have on the global gen set market at this time?
Rich Freeland: That remains -- that look strong, as far out as we can see. And then the core activity is good. Our hit rate on getting market share on that. So, I mean, the general consensus is, we're not giving 2020 guidance, but that looks strong through the end of the year into next year at least.
Tom Linebarger: And the bright spot, Adam has been this China side. One of the things we've always been worried about is how big is the data center market relative to the total, because we've kind of been looking at it as a U.S. and maybe European phenomenon. But now we're seeing starting to see developing countries, especially China, build out data centers and because of our position in that market that had kind of the premium end of the market. We've been actually been able to develop quite good share. And our team in China has done a terrific job ensuring that as these data center markets start to build out that come in since the player that they look to. So, I think, again, that's a big reason why you're seeing continued strength in data centers is that although it's just one segment of the market, we're seeing it build globally. So, it's -- I think that's steadied out the growth and kept it robust for longer.
Mark Smith: Yeah, we're seeing a little bit of increase in our military business, and then a little bit of weakness in the all these segments in North America, which has been on a multiyear strong run. So that's feels like it's cycling down a little bit.
Adam Uhlman: Great. Thanks.
Mark Smith: Thanks, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Raso: Hi, good morning. I'm just trying to gain comfort with the margins. Obviously, the downside operating leverage which is really critical to the story looking into 2020. So, I'm just trying to understand like say the engine division. If a year ago, we adjust for that campaign charge. We just saw the engine business year-over-year have up sales a little bit, but profits down over $40 million. While the second half of the year, engine business supposed to have revenues down over $200 million, but profits only down about $40 million to $50 million. So just coming off that second quarter performance, it obviously is implying the second half is a lot better, despite somewhat notable sales decline. Can you help build some confidence on what is changing in the second half? I assumed materials, -- I'm just trying to understand after that second quarter, our comfort with the second half margin for engines.
Mark Smith: Yes, David, it's Mark. So, I think we've just got some moving parts in some of those different comparisons. So, number one, the first a tougher compound China JV earnings partly due to adjustment in light duty, I think that comp gets a little bit easier in the second half of the year. And then we're lapping with a higher tariff run rate, remember the actual tariff expenses in the first half of the year close to zero. And so, we're just kind of lapping on those higher numbers. And then of course, we're doing relatively well on certainly on the heavy-duty market share. So, I think by and large, there is nothing heroic in the second half of the year, we've taken down our outlook for part, as Tom said, some of the actually weaker outlook are leveling off, maybe a better way to describe it already occurred in the second quarter. So, we're not expecting a significant down shift. For those, I think, are the major moving parts, not a significant amount of change in price, or material cost, first half to second half.
David Raso: Yeah, I guess, I pushed back a little bit on the JV income. I mean JV income was down about 10% in engines year-over-year. It seems like the second half is not terribly different, in the context of your overall company JV income for the second half. So, is there some number around the materials or something about mix that we can again, gain comfort that we can handle that biggest sales decline in the second half with ...
Mark Smith: That was just really back up to the overall company guidance, we've delivered something like 71% for the full -- for the first half of the year, we're at 16.25% to 16.75%. We've kind to maintain the margin guidance on a slightly weaker revenue outlook. So generally, things are going pretty according to plan on the cost side. So, I've got I think we would what we know today, that's our best guidance, and I don't think there's anything heroic in the numbers.
David Raso: I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you very much.
Mark Smith: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Alex Potter: Yeah, hi, guys. If you could comment a bit on the light duty policy changes that you're seeing impact demand in China in the truck markets and the reclassification from light duty to medium duty? Is there -- well, first of all, I guess any qualitative commentary you can offer on that policy would be helpful. But then secondly, is there a reason to think that you could have demand shifting to the medium duty side of the market as a result of this and if so, presumably, the Domfront [ph] joint venture should be able to capitalize on that?
Tom Linebarger: Thanks, Alex. Just a couple of qualitative points and I'll let Rich add if he has more. This is the -- if you're in China, they call this the blue-plate issue, you get a blue plate if you're light duty. And if you -- and what this means is you have easier driver licensing requirements. It's closer to a car license, and you can access the very inner parts of the city, you can imagine why that would be a smaller vehicle, lighter vehicles, less congestion, et cetera. And the rules were already in place, it's just that they didn't enforce them quite as tightly in every city, and so now what they've done is they've, just picked the day and all of a sudden enforcement started. To say that it had disruption in the market would be an understatement. So, I, when I was in China recently, there wasn't a single OEM that didn't complain about this, because it just all of a sudden happened and it created absolute havoc in the market. So, my -- I'm wondering, in part, if there'll be some sort of compromise proposal to kind of rationalize this a little bit, because it really takes a lot of vehicles that were previously being sold and used in cities and brings them outside of the city. And again, it's not just the fact that you have to spend more money to get more licenses that you can't actually get into all the spots. So that there's a significant change and the ones that can get in have to be very lightly loaded. And so, you're now you're afraid moving capacity has just reduced significantly. So anyway, there that there's a bunch of that going on, I'd say there's only so much you can figure out about that in China and how fast that's going to move like you know, from your experience. But my sense is that if there's quite a bit of consternation, and there's some -- some potential outcome where things get compromised or rationalized that whether or not this demand moves to medium duty is another question. My feeling is that there's not a lot of movement there. Because really, this is the part that takes the final -- it is the final mile delivery stuff. And most of the larger cities anyway have restrictions on vehicle size, doing that final mile delivery. So, a medium a bigger medium duty truck is not really going to solve your problem. And they maybe don't need so many more of those. But, you know, could be -- there could be some substitution. I think the biggest impact for us was, we got this new JAC JV, we've got Foton going and they're both going gangbusters with great products and great -- great trucks and so it just kind of came to a screeching halt for a second while, this thing is getting rationalized. We think we still have a great line-up in either case, it's just that it, it had a pretty abrupt hit in the second quarter.
Alex Potter: Okay, thanks. Thanks very much. That's super helpful. And then I guess one you mentioned the relationship for Foton there, I noticed that you Yuchai just announced the joint venture partnership of some kind with, with Foton, is there a potential for overlap there with what Cummins does? I guess any commentary there would be helpful as well.
Tom Linebarger: So I -- here's the situation as you know, each of the OEMs has a number of businesses and another number of segments that they're trying to make sure that they're competitive and, and, you know, they use domestic engines and some of those segments and they use joint venture engines with us in other segments, and then a fair bit of those for export. And so, they always have to have multiple partnerships to cover themselves. Not to mention there are a number of government programs where they need to have domestic engine supply to comply with it. So we are, you know, we're now after, after many, many years there, we're now getting more used to this kind of thing where we, we think we've got the engine thing, good to go. And then all of a sudden, there's another partner in, but again, al-in-all, we still feel very good about our partnership with photon. And Rich, I know has spent some recent time with him, so I want to let Rich comment to on the photon partnership.
Rich Freeland: Yes, so I would say our relationship with photon is as good as it's been in recent years. In fact, both relationship there and then the customers view of the Foton Cummins product. So, in fact, our share of Fotons so is up from 46% a year-ago, to in the mid-60s now. And so again, I think it's just as Tom says, the nature of the business there's going to be multiple options, always and so our strategy remains the same to work with the partners develop the best power train product and let customers choose, since we've kind of get used to it there will be customers will have multiple options, but right now I feel really good where we're positioned with Foton.
Alex Potter: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Tom Linebarger: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Noah Kaye: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First a shorter-term question on 2019 pricing, I believe you've been expecting about an 80-bps growth from pricing and I think a lot of that had to do with the parts business. You know, what are the current expectations, and can you still get that sort of price growth in parts if we're seeing lower activity levels?
Mark Smith: I think this puts and takes around the business. But that's round about where we said at the start of the year. So yes, a little bit lower on parts. But overall, we're in that 80 basis points range for the year. Again, the pricing hasn't gone down, just a little bit a little volume gain.
Noah Kaye: Okay, that's helpful. And then longer-term I mean that you just formally adopted the CO2 regs, for the first time for heavy duty trucks. You already talked about potential Euro 7. Can you talk a little bit about the potential tailwind there for new components business over the coming years and how you think you are positioned? And maybe even kind of contextualize some of your recent investments, electrification, fuel cells, in light of those red?
Tom Linebarger: I think, thanks for that. No, I do think those are just those regs. By the way, those are tough and draconian. There isn't a single OEM that is feeling nonplussed about those. But here's what I say is it they are just -- they are emblematic of what we're going to see across the world. And so, and especially now that regulators have in their sights, some of these new technologies, which look like they have lower, at least local emissions and the potential to potentially be economically viable. Things like of course, electrified power trains, or hybrids, or fuel cells, et cetera. Once they have those in their sights, and they think they can be economically viable, they are going to shove regulations harder, for obvious reasons. And Europe is, of course, one of them. But we will see them inevitably in the U.S. and elsewhere. So, we think that the content - and that's kind of linked back to my conversation, when Jerry asked me about Isuzu. I think all of our customers, and Cummins are all seeing significant investments required in power trains, power train components, and systems. And as well as in vehicles in order to be competitive and at the front end of their markets. Everybody has a good view of what those kinds of might be. But the amount of investment, the number of models that have to be covered, the different regulations that they're going to have to meet cities, countries regions, it looks daunting. So, what we're -- what we think is that that's the space where Cummins has historically been most successful. When that's kind of the technology challenge in front of us, we've made a bunch of investments, as you know, in EV, in hybrid in diesel and natural gas. And if we can complete this transaction with Hydrogenics will also have the beginnings of fuel cell offerings. So, our intent is to have the power train of choice for each of these, these providers, and including providing components in those technologies for them to integrate their own systems. So, we think, again, we will be at the forefront of technology. So, we are talking to every European manufacturer about the role they'd like us to play in their system, and everyone has a different view about that. We're clear that they are the system provider, and we're there to support them technically. And we think as you said it, whenever there is technology change, whenever regulations are challenging, that's the tail when to come in, because that's essentially what we make, that's what we differentiate on. That's where we our meals are made. So, we will invest you will lead there, we will ensure that that we're ready when they're ready to, to use us. And again, a lot of people are wringing their hands, figuring out how they're going to meet all these requirements. And we're just we show up every day and say, we're ready to help let us know what you want us to help.
Noah Kaye: Right. And it would seem to me just that in a market where you're providing a lot of subcomponents currently. And you're going into alternative power trains, where not every OEM is going to do a vertically integrated, power train. I mean, they may spec their motors outside or something like that. I mean, there's more of a gain opportunity, it would seem to me at lease.
Tom Linebarger: It seems to me too. Although I'm sure there'll be plenty of others that also see that. So, we'll show up with others there too. But I agree with you that it looks like an opportunity to us. We just don't want to get our cart in front of the horse. It's up to our OEMs to announce what they think. But we will be pushing hard to help those OEMs meet that standard with technology and components that we have.
Noah Kaye: Thanks so much.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you.
James Hopkins: Great. So, with that, it looks like we're at the end of our hour. So, I'd like to thank everybody for your interest in Cummins today. And as always, I'll be available for any follow up questions this afternoon. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-01-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2019 Meritor Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Carl Anderson, Group Vice President of Finance. You may begin.
Carl Anderson: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor’s first quarter 2019 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and President Trailer & Components and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today’s call are available at meritor.com. We’ll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we are recording, is a property of Meritor, Inc. It’s protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the express written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you’ll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I’ll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Carl, and good morning. Let’s turn to Slide 3. We had a great first quarter, with total company revenue up $135 million from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5%, and we generated $0.79 of adjusted diluted EPS. Higher truck production, combined with market share gains in North America, drove the majority of the revenue increase. But we also had year-over-year sales growth in South America and India as well as in North American Aftermarket, Trailer and Industrial. Kevin will give you more color on the quarter, but we are obviously pleased to begin the year with such excellent financial performance. With our strong first quarter performance and a higher Class 8 market than previously expected, we are raising our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook for the year. On Slide 4, we provided an update on the $200 million equity repurchase program we announced in November. You’ll recall that our Board of Directors had just approved this additional share buyback program following the completion of our previous program. In the first fiscal quarter of 2019, we utilized $50 million under this recent authorization to repurchase another 3 million shares, which now completes 25% of the new program. As we referenced last month at Analyst Day, since 2014, we’ve invested about half the Company’s free cash flow in share buybacks. With the strong cash flow we expect to generate for fiscal 2019, we will continue to be opportunistic in buying back our shares. As Kevin told you in December, we firmly believe that our ability to generate cash flow and deploy that cash to create shareholder value is the most underappreciated aspect of Meritor’s story. On the next couple of slides, we want to highlight the growth in our trailer, off-highway and specialty businesses. We have recently signed three significant contracts for new trailer business, as you’ll see on Slide 5. Last month, we told you about the three-year renewal with Wabash that maintains Meritor’s loose axles in standard precision on all Wabash Dry and refrigerated van trailer products. Also with this contract, the Meritor Tire Inflation System is the preferred automatic tire inflation system. Optional products for all Wabash configurations include air disc brakes, the trailing arm suspension and our recently launched MTec6 trailer axle. We’re also excited to announce today that we’ve signed a two-year agreement with Great Dain. This is a conquest win that gives us standard position for loose axles and automated slack adjustors. This is a meaningful award that allows us to strengthen our relationship with Great Dane in these product lines and also provides further revenue opportunity with this important customer. In addition, we now have standard position with Stoughton for loose axles and preferred position for MTIS. With these agreements, Meritor has solidified its position with three of the top six trailer manufacturers. Moving to Slide 6, you will see some examples of the growth we’ve achieved in off-highway and specialty. Growing these businesses is a key priority for us and our M2019 and M2022 plans. We announced in December that we had completed a strategic supply agreement with Manitowoc to supply a variety of drivetrain products for several types of cranes under its Grove brand. This conquest win is another step towards establishing Meritor as a leader in the commercial off-highway industry in North America. To that end, we’re also seeing more heavy haul fleets specking their vehicles with Meritor’s P600 planetary axle, which we specifically engineered for heavy haul oilfield, logging and mining applications. RyTy Developments, which provides heavy hauling and off-road transportation services for the Canadian gas and oil industry, recently became the first fleet in the region to order their Kenwood trucks with our P600 axle. The strength and reliability of Meritor’s off-highway products, combined with our vertically integrated short lead times, ready access to service and support with 24-hour part availability and our long-standing relationships on the line haul side of the business, are driving demand for Meritor’s off-highway drivetrain solutions. On the specialty side of the business, we mentioned in December that we are supplying a unique transfer case for Navistar on the launch of its international CV Series Class 4 and 5 truck. These trucks will feature Meritor’s two-speed, gear-driven transfer case with 3,000 pound per foot capacity and electric shifting controls. We are the first to market a gear-driven transfer case for this class of trucks. We have started production of this product in our Laurinburg plant in North Carolina where we have made a significant investment to support the expansion of our Industrial business. Shifting next to electrification on Slide 7. We were proud to be featured at the recent CES technology show as Peterbilt unveiled its new Class 6 pickup and delivery truck. With CES being the global stage for next-generation innovations, it was exciting to be highlighted as the supplier in collaboration with TransPower of Peterbilt’s 220 elective drive system shown here with Peterbilt’s Head of Engineering. Our relationship with TransPower continues to grow with an additional investment we recently made into the company. The full system solutions available through TransPower as well as our own proprietary eAxle currently in development makes Meritor an excellent choice for electric vehicle manufacturers around the world, which is evident by our growing customer base. In closing, I’m pleased with our performance in the first quarter and with our outlook for the fiscal year. We are on track to achieve another successful year in 2019. Now I’ll turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on the financials, and then we’ll take your questions.
Kevin Nowlan: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today’s call, I’ll review our first quarter financial results and our updated 2019 guidance. Overall, as you heard from Jay, we delivered a strong start to the final year of our M2019 plan. We drove increases in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. Let’s walk through the details by turning to Slide 8 where you’ll see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $1,038,000,000 in the quarter, up $135 million from a year ago, driven primarily by higher truck production and increased market share. The largest increase came from North America with Class 8 production up 24% compared to last year. In Brazil, the truck market recovery continues with Q1 production up 21% this year. And finally, growth in our other North American businesses, Aftermarket, Trailer and Industrial also contributed to the rise in sales. As you can see from the causal on the right, we converted on this revenue at about 16%, which is in line with our normal expected range. Included in this conversion is higher earnings performance at our unconsolidated joint ventures, which are also capitalizing on the global market conditions. This conversion was partially offset by FX headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar, which reduced sales by $26 million and adjusted EBITDA by $6 million compared to the prior year. The result is that we generated adjusted EBITDA of $119 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%, a 50 basis point expansion over last year. Gross margin came in at 13.6% this quarter, down from 14.6% a year ago. Operating at these production levels and in this overall market environment, we have seen some pressure on gross margin, primarily driven by higher material, freight and other premium costs. We do expect gross margin to recover throughout the year as we have not yet fully recovered the increases in steel costs that we experienced in the latter half of 2018. Additionally, we expect to see some benefit from pricing actions in our Aftermarket business that were implemented in January to mitigate such costs. One more point on gross margin. Due to a recent accounting standard update that we implemented this quarter, you’ll notice that our gross margin for both this year and last year now reflects the removal from operating expenses of the non-service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense. These amounts have been reclassified to the line item other income on our income statement. As you move down the table on the left, you’ll see that we’re reporting $90 million of GAAP net income from continuing operations, which is significantly higher than last year. There were two key drivers to this increase. Last year, we recognized $77 million of non-cash tax expense arising from the enactment of U.S. tax reform. And this year, we recognized a $31 million gain from remeasuring the Maremont asbestos liability. I’ll be discussing this in more detail in a subsequent slide. Adjusted income from continuing operations, which excludes the impact of both of these items, was $69 million, resulting in $0.79 per adjusted diluted share, a 27% increase over last year. And finally, free cash flow was negative $12 million this quarter compared to an inflow of $15 million in the same period last year. Higher adjusted income was more than offset by increased incentive compensation payments due to our 2018 financial performance, investments in inventory to support stronger revenue and increased capital expenditures as we invested more in supporting our growth opportunities. Let’s move to Slide 9, which details our first quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Trailer segment, sales increased by 16% to $824 million. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher truck production in North America and increased market share. Unfavorable foreign currency impacts due to the strengthening dollar only partially offset these gains. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $79 million, up $10 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Trailer came in at 9.6%, roughly flat compared to last year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue, partially offset by higher material and freight costs, SG&A expense and FX. In our Aftermarket & Industrial segment, sales were $257 million, up 12% from last year. This increase was primarily driven by our North America aftermarket, specialty and defense businesses. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $38 million, an increase of $6 million or almost 20% compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin grew 80 basis points to 14.8%. This growth was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue. On Slide 10, I wanted to provide an update on the actions of our non-operating subsidiary, Maremont. Recall that in December, we announced that Maremont was seeking to create a trust under Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to resolve all correct and future asbestos claims. Last week, we announced that Maremont and its subsidiaries voluntarily filed cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The remaining key actions include confirmation of the reorganization plan by the courts and funding of the trust, primarily with a $28 million contribution and the repayment of an approximately $21 million intercompany loan by Meritor. As a result of this initiative, we recorded a $31 million gain in the first quarter as we remeasured Maremont’s net asbestos liability to the terms of the reorganization plan, which now represents the best estimate of the liability. Once the bankruptcy process is complete, these actions are expected to eliminate approximately 70% of net asbestos liabilities from Meritor’s balance sheet. Next, I’ll review our updated fiscal year 2019 global market outlook on Slide 11. Although we saw some softening of Class 8 truck orders in December, the backlog is still almost 300,000 units. This gives us confidence that production levels should remain elevated for the rest of our fiscal year. Therefore, we are increasing our production estimate by 10,000 trucks to approximately 330,000, driven primarily by our expectations for a stronger fourth quarter than we were previously anticipating. Our forecast for the remainder of our market is unchanged, so we are keeping volume assumptions at our prior guidance levels for all of these other markets. Overall, solid to strong global end markets continue to support our positive outlook for 2019. Based on these updated assumptions, you can see we are raising our guidance on Slide 12. We now expect revenue to be approximately $4.3 billion, up $50 million from our prior guidance. We are maintaining our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 11.5%. In light of our stronger revenue outlook and the incremental conversion we’re able to generate, we are modestly increasing our investment to support our electrification initiatives. This incremental investment is offsetting some of the margin conversion from our higher-revenue guide. In addition, as you think about Q2, we do expect to see our normal seasonal trend of increasing revenue sequentially. However, with the strong production levels we experienced in our first quarter, we expect the sequential step up to be much more modest in the next couple of quarters than we see in most years. For that reason, you should expect any sequential step-up in EBITDA margin to also be relatively modest. With stronger top line revenue, we expect to generate an increase in adjusted income from continuing operations. This higher income, coupled with the repurchase of 3 million common shares we executed in Q1, is expected to drive adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $3.30 per share, an increase of $0.20 from our prior guidance. This puts us close to $0.50 above our M2019 target. And finally, we are maintaining our free cash flow outlook at $175 million to $185 million. The increase in earnings from revenue growth expected in Q4 is expected to be largely offset by a corresponding increase in working capital investment, which yields no change to our free cash flow guidance for 2019. As we discussed at our Analyst Day last month, this is the level of cash performance you should expect from Meritor to generate as we transition from M2019 to M2022, and it’s this level of cash generation that supports our M2022 capital allocation priorities as we focus on investing in strategic growth and returning value to our shareholders. We’re excited about the positive start to this year, which puts us on the path to successful conclusion of our M2019 plan. Now we’ll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Ryan Brinkman: Hi, great, thanks. I was wondering if you could provide some more color in your business in China, including after Caterpillar missed earnings the other day, setting a slowdown in that market. I see on Slide 6 that your sales in China actually surged in 2018, but just curious if you’re seeing any of the same slowdown more recently. And maybe if you could remind us of some of your more unique customer end market exposures within China we should be thinking about in the current environment.
Jay Craig: Yes, good question, Ryan. We’re still expecting the market to be flat this year as compared to last year. The segments we’re involved in, such as with XCMG, in construction are holding up similar to what we saw last year as far as the infrastructure projects and their product support. And then we tend to be at the higher end of the quality spectrum on the on-highway. And so far, that’s performing very similar to what it did last year.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay, great, thanks. Just lastly for me too, I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on the market share gains. You’ve had several in the Trailer segment. Just curious who you’re winning these from, and what the outlook is going forward.
Jay Craig: Well, I’ll begin that. I’m actually going to ask Kevin to talk a little bit about Trailers since he’s leading that business for us. And he and the team have done an excellent job of getting our product development strategies aligned with what the customer markets are demanding, and I think that’s starting to show in that three wins we talked about today.
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, as it relates to Trailer, I mean, the performance that we’re generating in terms of seeing some market share gains are being driven by our strong delivery performance as well as our high-quality product. And so we continue to be the leader in that trailer market in terms of supplying loose axle and among the market leaders in tire inflation. So strong product, strong delivery performance and strong quality have been supportive of us gaining share there.
Ryan Brinkman: Very good, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Joe Spak: Thanks. Good morning, congratulations.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Joe.
Joe Spak: Just maybe we could start in Commercial Truck. First of all, I’m sorry if I missed this, I was wondering just how much of an FX headwind was in that segment this quarter. And then back at the envelope, it looks to us like maybe 75% to 80% of the organic growth was from what I’d call market and then maybe the rest was sort of your new business and end market share gains. Is that – do you roughly agree with those numbers?
Kevin Nowlan: On the market share gains, I have to come back to you. It’s probably in the ZIP code. I mean, we had tens of million dollars – tens of millions of dollars of revenue outperformance as I look Q1-to-Q1 on a year-over-year basis. I didn’t do the math to see is that 25% or so, but it’s probably in that ZIP code somewhere.
Joe Spak: Okay.
Kevin Nowlan: And with respect to the question on FX headwind, the bulk of that headwind is in the Commercial Truck & Trailer segment because the Aftermarket & Industrial business is predominantly in North American business. They have some European exposure, but it’s predominantly a North America-based business.
Joe Spak: Okay. And you said it was $26 million. Is it what? For the total company? Was that the number?
Kevin Nowlan: Revenue of the whole company, $6 million of EBITDA. That’s right.
Joe Spak: Okay. And then just in Aftermarket, if I recall correctly, I think you were sort of taking some pricing actions there because that was sort of the area where you were able to offset some of the raw material movements. Is that what occurred? And how – and if so, how much did that contribute in the quarter?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, I mean, part of what we executed in the middle of last year, in July of last year, we did execute some pricing actions to mitigate some of the costs that we were seeing from a steel perspective and a freight perspective. And as we started this new calendar year in January, we’ve continued to execute pricing actions to reflect any market economics that we’re seeing. I’d also point out in that segment, the Industrial business is performing well as well and saw some growth and contributed to margin growth there.
Joe Spak: Okay, and maybe just a follow-up then. And I think you were sort of – previously, sort of talking about this business that could get sort of 14%, 15% margins, but I think that was before you made some reporting changes. So is there any additional sort of color you’re willing to provide on sort of what you think the right or the ultimate sort of margin potential of the Aftermarket Industrial business is?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes. I think you, obviously, saw a big step-up in margin on a year-over-year basis, 80 basis points. We expect that business to operate north of 14% each quarter as we look ahead through 2019, and that’s a step-up from what we saw a year ago because we did have a couple of quarters in the middle of the year where we operated below 14% on a fully loaded basis. So we are expecting to operate north of 14% in that business for the year.
Joe Spak: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Picariello of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
James Picariello: Hey, guys. So for your joint ventures, I mean, you had a solid quarter for equity income. Just wondering if you could talk about – you have, I think, four primary joint ventures at this point. Can you talk about what drove the upside in the quarter and how are you think about the rest of the year?
Jay Craig: Yes, I think – thanks, James. I think you can think about those joint ventures really seeing the benefit of the end market increases and market share gains that we talked about. So we have our Mexican joint venture, Sysmex, for example, that shared in the growth we saw in North America. We’re seeing the recovery in Brazil, and that bring Masters, our braking joint venture’s results along with that. And then we’ve talked about the strength of India as well, and so we have our significant joint venture there with the Kalyani Group. So it’s pretty widespread, just those joint ventures participating both in our market share gains and the end market increases.
James Picariello: Yes. On the topic of India, you have new missions, standards hitting. You also have a mandatory forced aging of the fleet of replacement greater than 20 years or older. So what’s your outlook on the timing of when you might see some significant prebuy ahead of both of those factors in the market? And are you already seeing it? Or right now, is this – would you chalk this up to just strong market demand?
Jay Craig: I think it’s really primarily strong market demand, I think, if we would expect may be late in 2019. But remember, India does have some history of pushing off those deadlines because the market at times cannot ramp up capacity to meet the demand required for those changes in regulation. And we are making some modest increases in our capacity through our joint venture to make sure we’re ready for that. But I would say it, we would expect at earliest to see the impact of those changes in late 2019.
James Picariello: Got it. Appreciate it. Just last one, if I could. Have you guys quantified the commodity headwind that you expect for FY2019 in terms of the incremental impact? That’s it. Thanks.
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, I mean, in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis, it had a few million dollars of negative impact on us. Remember, steel indices are actually up, particularly in North America, year-over-year anywhere from about 20% to 30%. Now most of that increase happened in the latter part of 2018, so it’s really just a delay as our recovery mechanisms start to kick in. And we’ll start to see some sequential tailwind from that heading into Q2. But if you take a step back, in totality for the full year, 2019 versus 2018, we expect steel to be a headwind on a net basis high single-digit millions, and that’s embedded in our guidance.
James Picariello: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mike Baudendistel: Thank you. Can you give us some sense, I mean, these contracts seem pretty significant on the trailer side, just what – how big those contracts are in terms of revenue? And sort of how that fits into your plan to outperform the market?
Kevin Nowlan: It’s – this is Kevin, I’ll speak to that. It’s a mix. I mean, a couple of those are solidifying existing positions that we have, particularly with Wabash and Stoughton, although they position us to grow with certain product categories with those key customers. In the case of Great Dane, there is some conquest business there that we achieved on loose axles and slack adjustors. So important growth opportunities for that trailer business.
Mike Baudendistel: Got it. So it’s a mix of the two. I guess, can you also – just getting back to the materials cost, can you sort of explain why that seems to be impacting the margins on the Commercial Truck & Trailer side but not the Aftermarket side? And when does it start to be a neutral or – on a year-over-year basis?
Kevin Nowlan: Well, for Commercial Truck, remember, we have recovery mechanisms with our OE customers that kick in generally on about a six-month lag. So as we saw steel indices increasing towards the back half of our fiscal year 2018, those mechanisms simply haven’t had a chance yet to kick in. With Aftermarket, Aftermarket updates its pricing periodically once or twice per year based on overall macroeconomic conditions inclusive of steel. And so the Aftermarket started pricing for that back in January – or back in July of last year and started to see some recovery from the mechanisms from the increase in steel indices that we were seeing last year. So they saw a little bit of an improvement sooner than the truck business.
Mike Baudendistel: Got it. That makes sense. That’s all I had this morning. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Colin Langan: Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter.
Kevin Nowlan: Thank you.
Colin Langan: More of an accounting question, but there was $11 million of other income, which typically, that’s only a couple of million or zero. Any color on what that is in the quarter and whether that’s a sustainable number?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, Collin, this relates to an accounting standard update that we had to implement this quarter. So it’s actually the reclassification of non-service cost component of our pension and retiree medical expense. So that’s about $9 million that we moved out of gross margin or cost of goods sold that’s actually income and moved down to other income. We actually recast 2018’s numbers as well. So you’ll see that went from a number that was de minimis to now it’s a positive $8 million in Q1 of a year ago. So that’s simply an accounting change that we had to make that impacted both last year and this year.
Colin Langan: Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then when we think of share repurchases, those $50 million in the quarter, is that the pace that we should be thinking about for the rest of the year? Is that – or will it move around through the year?
Jay Craig: I think you should remember, Colin, as our cash flows tend to be seasonal, where we generate a meaningful portion of our free cash flow in Q3. And then we do have some other obligations, one of which Kevin spoke to, the funding of the Maremont liabilities that we think are upcoming. So we saw a great opportunity in Q1, given the price at which our shares were trading and we felt highly confident on our free cash flow projection for the year. So we decided to lean out a little in Q1 and take advantage of that market disconnect in our valuation.
Colin Langan: Got it. Any – can you just remind me of the $200 million authorization for the next two years? Is there a time line on that?
Kevin Nowlan: The $200 million authorization is open to be able to support repurchase activity through our 2022 planning horizon. And so it’s just the initial approval that we’ll execute on as we generate free cash flow and we see the opportunity to deploy cash accordingly. So at this point, we’re $50 million utilized of that full $200 million, 25% done, but we’ll continue to execute as we see opportunities to deploy cash accordingly.
Colin Langan: Got it. And just lastly, any update – we covered most of the regions other than South America. I mean, any update on that business? I think you were expecting a small increase. Is that still on track? And how should we think about the potential there with maybe higher incrementals because of the low base you’re off of?
Jay Craig: Well, we are seeing a pretty measurable increase year-over-year, over 20%, and what we expect in the market, 18% to 19%. And we still feel confident in that. So I think we’re feeling good about that. And the market with the new government in place, the confidence seems to be developing in the country. And I would say, we’re considerably more optimistic on that market recovering to more normalized levels.
Colin Langan: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Brian Johnson: Yes, good morning. I have question is on two fronts, just some of the margin in Aftermarket and then on EVs. On the margin, I think you alluded to this, but what – is what we can take away from the lack of freight, SG&A and material offsets in Aftermarket – in the Aftermarket Industrial business that it’s just shorter cycle pricing and you’re able to move those factors up and down, so you just – it’s just basically straight incrementals there?
Kevin Nowlan: No, I’d actually say it’s more because we’ve reacted to what we’ve seen in the market from escalating costs throughout 2018, and we executed some pricing actions in July of last year to mitigate the impact of those. So we have seen increased freight costs last year in 2018 and other economic factors, and we’ve been pricing for it.
Brian Johnson: Okay. Secondly, over on the EV front, we know you guys have 22 prototype programs out there. Is there any kind of way to bucket what you’re spending the EV money on? Is there kind of a core technology that you spend on across all those programs? Is it just on each prototype? Or kind of any way to kind of think about that? And then how that might progress if any of those actually move closer to production?
Jay Craig: Yes, I would say, Brian, we’re spending, you could say, approximately $10 million this coming year on both our pure R&D and also prototype development where we’re not receiving reimbursement from customers. So in certain cases, we do receive reimbursement from the customer for partial reimbursement of the cost we’re incurring. But as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we’ve seen such great opportunities there. We’ve ramped up the spending a bit from what we had initially expected because of how well the company is performing and the opportunities we’re seeing.
Brian Johnson: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.
Neil Frohnapple: Hi, thanks and congrats on a great quarter. First, I just want to round out the EBITDA margin discussion for the year. So I mean, you guys just delivered an 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin, well above expectations in, again, what is historically, I think, the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, so great performance there. So could you just talk about some of the puts and takes from a margin perspective for the remainder of the year to get to the 11.5% full year guidance. I know you guys cited the increased investment in electrification, but on the flip side, it sounds like you’ll get maybe a sequential tailwind in Q2 from steel, the pricing initiatives in Truck & Trailer and then expect higher gross margins, I think you said so. Again, just wanted to round that out, and if you could provide more color, that would be great.
Kevin Nowlan: Okay. Thanks, Neil. Definitely, I mean, we’re pleased with the fact that we started the first quarter strong. 11.5%, up 50 basis points year-over-year is a strong first quarter for us. As we look ahead, the first thing I would just mention is that, typically, our second and third quarter, we see a much more robust step-up from a revenue perspective than what we would expect this year because Q1 was so strong from a revenue perspective. And take last year, going from Q1 to Q3, revenue was up $200-ish-plus million from one quarter to the third quarter. This year, we expect it to be up less than $100 million. So there’s a lot less conversion opportunity as you go from one quarter to the next. But we are expecting to continue to convert on that incremental revenue. So you see a little bit of upside in margin from that, but then being offset by some of the additional electrification investment that we’ll be making over the next couple of quarters, starting in our second fiscal quarter. So net-net, we still expect to be around approximately 11.5% for the full year, but pretty pleased with the start to the year.
Neil Frohnapple: Okay, thanks for the color, Kevin. And then with NAFTA Class 8 production this past quarter coming meaningfully higher than expected due to a surge in build, I think, in the month of December, did that require you to more over time and things like escalated freight cost to serve the market, which may have laid on Commercial Truck & Trailer margin in the quarter? And I guess just curious on relative to what you’d expect for the rest of the year.
Jay Craig: The short answer is, yes. We continue to see – so continuing less-than-optimal efficiency in our operating plans and also some additional premiums as we expedite freight. They were within our planning assumptions. So – and we do have some expectations for the rest of the year that we are running some layered capacity as we speak to it on the margins of our supply relationships. And we have embedded in the guidance that Kevin updated the cost of those additional expedited freight and layered capacity suppliers.
Neil Frohnapple: Okay. Great, thank you so much, guys.
Jay Craig: Thank you, Neil.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Alex Potter: Hi, thanks. Good job in this quarter, guys. I guess, I have one additional question on electrification. Deploying more capital for that opportunity, which is a good sign. I’m interested to know if this is something that you’re doing opportunistically because you’re doing better than what you thought, revenue is higher, margins are higher, so you can redeploy some capital. Or is that something that you would have likely done anyway?
Jay Craig: Well, that’s a good question. I think we, in my mind, probably would have done it anyway but would have had to allocate where different investments would have been reduced. I think with the good news we’re seeing in the business, we’re able to continue to deploy capital to all the opportunities we’re seeing and increase that investment in electrification. I think, as you know, under this leadership team through M2016, 2019 and now 2020, we take the targets that we set very seriously and try to manage all our different puts and takes within those targets. But certainly, because of the strength we’re seeing in our business, we were allowed to continue to make all the investments required.
Alex Potter: Okay, very good. And another question on China also. I know that historically, you’ve got more of an off-highway focus. You mentioned more – when it comes to the on-highway side of the business, there’s more premium high end. But my understating is that that’s also – one of the goals of the company, I suppose, is to increase exposure to the on- highway segment there. It’s a area that you’ve historically been under indexed. Is that – has there been any development in that regard? What do you expect over the next one, two, three years?
Jay Craig: Yes, there have been developments. What I’m pleased with is, we have an excellent disc brake offering in China. So we’re starting to see opportunities there that are coming forward. In our core axle business, we continue to see opportunities on the premium side of the market. So the one caution I would give us, we will not derogate the margins of the overall company by chasing opportunities in spaces in that market that just don’t have the returns required. And that’s been our challenge over the years is that market has not had the returns for suppliers in our segment that have been acceptable to us. So we’d – that’s why our growth strategy has been more measured maybe than others.
Alex Potter: Okay. Yes, that makes good sense. And then my last question, I guess, related to the supply chain in the U.S. Still, there’s, as you mentioned, expedited freight, over time, things of that nature. Do you think the supply chain is properly capacitized at this point? Or when do you think that people have their upstream or downstream or whatever the supply bottlenecks are, do you think that more investment is likely to be earmarked to address those bottlenecks? Or do you think we’re basically just going to be dealing with the current situation indefinitely until the backlog runs down?
Jay Craig: I’ll give a few brief comments and ask Kevin to provide additional detail. But as we spoke to previously, we’ve increased some capacity in North America just beginning coming online here in January. And that capacity, directed at the Class 8 market, was – the investment was primarily directed at our supply base just trying to bring on more capacity and different suppliers. So we continue to monitor very closely but have to make some incremental investments to bring on that additional capacity.
Kevin Nowlan: And this is Kevin, I’ll just – I don’t have much to add. I mean, it’s – I don’t anticipate seeing a significant step-up in investment beyond that. I think the modest investments we made in some supplier tooling to support the strong market that we anticipate, at least through the balance of this fiscal year, I think that’ll carry us through this year. But I’m not expecting to see more from the way of capacity investments beyond that at this point.
Alex Potter: Okay. Nice job again, guys.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Faheem Sabeiha of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Faheem Sabeiha: Hi, good morning guys and congrats on a good quarter. Just wondering, with the acceleration in share repurchases in Q1 and the funding of the Maremont trust coming up soon, can you maybe talk about your appetite to maybe use debt to make an acquisition if one were to come up over the next quarters?
Jay Craig: Well, I think the question we ask ourselves is and the answer we provided in the rollout of the 2022 plan is we’re very pleased with the core business and our ability to grow organically. So we continue to look at opportunities and acquisitions that are more bolt-on in nature. And really, we do not believe we are interested in a transformational acquisition of the scale that would take us off track on our capital allocation strategy that we laid out in the December Analyst Day. So we have a significant number of opportunities we’re constantly evaluating, but those tend to be bolt-on in nature.
Faheem Sabeiha: Okay. And final question for me. Can you talk about other opportunities for your gear transfer case within the Class 4 and 5 market, given the success you had getting on the platform with GM and Navistar, or maybe any other adjacent markets to that?
Jay Craig: Well, we do see the investment we’ve made and the development of that transfer case and also a brand-new assembly line in our Laurinburg facility that I spoke about on the call as an opportunity to look at additional market share gains in that area. So we don’t – I don’t see anything specifically that will be announcing in the near-term, but we certainly are continuing to make headway in that market. And I think it’s very unique technology that Navistar appreciated, and I think the end market will appreciate as that vehicles rolled out here over the next few months.
Faheem Sabeiha: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to hand the call back over to Carl Anderson for any closing remarks.
Carl Anderson: Thank you. This does conclude Meritor’s first quarter 2019 earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. That does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Jeffrey Craig: Thanks, Carl. And good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for a look at our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results.  Let’s turn to Slide 3. Let me start by saying we had another great quarter delivering on our financial and customer commitments and by all measures we also had an extraordinary year. For this, I want to recognize the Meritor team around the world. Our employees are doing a fantastic job driving excellent results in all areas of the company, particularly as we manage the challenges inherent to supporting strong markets and the volatility of material costs around the globe. The year is notable not only for financial results however, we did much more. We launched six new products for specialty linehaul, bus and coach and off-highway applications. We’ve positioned Meritor to be a leader in electric drivetrains and as part of that strategy we launched our Blue Horizon Advanced Technology brand. We successfully integrated two bolt-on acquisitions, each of which has contributed toward our revenue target for M2019. We’ve managed our business in Brazil through the severe downturn over the past several years and are happy to see volumes up almost 40% this past year as we launched new business with MAN, Mercedes Benz and Iveco. And as we remain focused on returning capital to shareholders, we bought back 4.5 million shares of common stock in fiscal '18 and are pleased to announce today that we plan to repurchase more. In 2015, we have -- since 2015 we have repurchased more than 17 million shares and significantly reduced the amount of convertible debt that was previously dilutive. In addition, we achieved our long-term leverage target of 1.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA.  Overall, these actions reflect the level of performance you've come to expect from Meritor.  Turning to our results in the quarter, we generated revenue of almost $1.1 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. In addition to higher production on all our major markets, we continue to grow share and win new business, driving the step-up in revenue. We also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 30 basis points and adjusted earnings per share by 32%.  In a few minutes, Kevin will walk you through our full year guidance for fiscal 2019. You'll note that we anticipate it to be another strong year for Meritor. A key message you will hear from us going forward is related to the free cash flow generation capability we now have in place due to deleveraging, legacy liability reduction and operating performance.  On that note, let's go to Slide 4. Over the past several years, Meritor's financial performance has significantly improved and our balance sheet is now in a great place. In fact, we received a credit upgrade last month from Moody's and have achieved our target leverage one year earlier than planned. We plan to generate strong free cash flow in 2019, and expect it to continue even with normal cyclicality that is characteristic of our industry. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we completed the execution of our $100 million repurchase program by buying back 4.5 million shares in 2018.  With that now complete, we are pleased to announce a new board authorized share repurchase program which is double the size of the prior program. We believe we are now in an excellent position to accelerate aggressive capital return to our shareholders, particularly in the form of increased share buybacks. We intend to share more around our capital allocation plans at our Analyst Day in December.  Let's go to Slide 5. We are now less than a year from completing our M2019 plan. As you look at this slide, the left column shows the three financial targets we’ve set for the company. You can see our status for each of the metrics and the contribution made towards each target in fiscal 2018. We realized $325 million of revenue outperformance during the year, driven by new business wins, increased market share and additional revenues from two bolt-on acquisitions. And we are on track to achieve $660 million for M2019 consistent with what we told you at Analyst Day last year.  In fiscal 2019, we will continue to evaluate strategic bolt-on acquisition opportunities to further accelerate our revenue growth. Also this year, we generated $474 million of adjusted EBITDA and achieved solid conversion in elevated markets with a challenging industry operating environment. Our M2019 goal was to increase adjusted EPS by a $1.25 which was an 80% improvement from our jump up point in fiscal year 2015. We have achieved our M2019 adjusted EPS target a full year early.  With regard to capital allocation, we said we would reduce our leverage to less than 1.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. As I just mentioned, we achieved that in fiscal 2018. We also said we would return 25% of free cash flow to shareholders. Since the launch of M2019 we have returned roughly double that amount. Overall, the bottom-line earnings of the company has dramatically improved over the past several years and our ability to generate significant free cash flow has never been stronger.  On Slide 6, we wanted to give you a few highlights from 2018 as we noted for revenue gains were driven by higher production in all our major markets. In combination with revenue outperformance through increased market share and new business wins. Top-line increases in South America, China and India as noted here and speak to with the first vacation of our business. You'll see later in the presentation that we expect this trend to continue as production volumes remain robust in these regions.  Also on this slide you'll note that we continue to maintain our operational excellence even as daily rear axle production in North America increased 20% during the cycle. With our markets have slightly lower levels in 2018 than during the last peak market in 2015 it is clear that we have driven market share growth over the past few years that is being realized in our bottom line results. In fact, we believe we are now operating at our highest North American axle production level in our history. That level of production requires a tremendous effort across the company but we manage delivery commitments exceptionally well throughout the year. And in order to continue our track record of supporting our customers' needs and delivering in this market environment, we are now making some very modest capacity investments in our supply base. We believe that will allow us to sustain our shares as markets remains strong in 2019.  Finally we wanted to highlight just a few of our business wins this year with some of the largest commercial vehicle manufacturers in the world. We have new business in every region across most of our applications with products like our dual light package in China, the hub reduction axle for DAF in Europe. Our new suspension business with Ashok Leyland in India and the optimized air disc brake that is standard on freight liners new Cascadian model and a preview to our new single piston disc brake we plan to launch next year.  We have a technology and product portfolio that is consistently evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers. Our aggressive new product lifecycle is the primary reason for our market share gains and we plan to keep the pedal to the metal in this area for the foreseeable future.  On Slide 7, you will see some of the investment we made this year to increase our capability and improve our portfolio and our off-highway business, we are winning new business globally. You'll remember when we launched M2019 we talked about growing our off -highway business and we really see that taking shape.  As I just mentioned we're excited about the launch of our new single piston air disc brake, disc brake is already in test on several trucks and we believe that it will allow us to grow our position as the market trends towards air disc brakes in North America and other regions. We have talked throughout the year about our position in electrification. We are now involved in 22 different electric programs with many of the world's leading global commercial vehicle manufacturers and expect to have at least 130 fully electric medium and heavy duty commercial trucks on the road by the end of 2020. Also in 2020, we intend to be production ready with Meritor’s 14X e-axle. Electric drive trains are an exciting area that we believe will grow in the short term particularly in bus [indiscernible] and pickup in delivery applications. With our own e-axle and the full systems solutions, we can offer through our strategic investment and transpower. We believe we have already established Maritor, as a leader in this area. That we plan to invest and grow appropriately to remain in that position as market adoption occurs.  Now I turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on the financials and then we'll open it up for questions. 
Kevin Nowlan: Thanks Jay and good morning. On today's call I'll review our full year financial results and then I'll provide you with an overview of our 2019 guidance. Overall we had an outstanding year of financial performance. We drove revenue growth of 25%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 90 basis points, increase adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 61% to $3.03 and generated $147 million of free cash flow.  Let's turn to Slide 8, we’ll see our full year financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were up $831 million from last year on higher production in all of our major markets and continued revenue outperformance. Starting with end markets, in North America Class 8 truck production was 38,000 units up 30% from the prior year. Sales in Europe were also higher, driven by continued strength in the heavy and medium duty truck market.  As Jay highlighted our operations in Brazil, China and India are providing additional tailwind to our sales as those regions made up about $180 million of the year over year sales increase. Revenue outperformance achieved primarily through market share increases in new business wins supplemented our sales growth and accounted for approximately $325 million or nearly 40% of the increase in sales from last year.  On the right side of the slide, you can see in the line item volume, mix, performance and other we have $114 million of higher adjusted EBITDA on the $831 million revenue increase. That translates the net underlying conversion of approximately 14% which we view as a good result in market 5Bs but is particularly strong when you consider some of the headwinds we faced in 2018. For example, steel cost were significantly higher during the year much of this increase came from strong market demand and trade tensions. Although increases in steel industries drove our cost sub year-over-year, these costs were up almost completely offset by the recovery mechanisms we have in place resulting in an insignificant to our financials. We also saw higher freight and layer capacity cost in addition to other inefficiencies that are inherent when you operate the market at these levels. We were able to substantially these address these costs through performance and pricing actions. In the end, all of these cost are embedded in the volume mix performance and other line which is why we are pleased with the conversion.  Next, you’ll see several items that impacted year-over-year performance which we have previously discussed during the year. These include $27 million in lower equity earnings and affiliates resulting from the sale of our interest in the Meritor WABCO JV at the end of last year. $39 million in lower in lower OPEB expense resulting from the modifications we made to our US retiree healthcare benefits in the prior year. $9 million in environmental reserves related to a legacy site and $10 million from a onetime legal charge for a settlement in 2017. These items provide the walk to our adjusted EBITDA of $474 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%.  In the table on the left, you can see that our operating performance coupled with reduced interest expense from the debt reduction actions we took earlier this year drilled an increase in adjusted income from continuing operations to $276 million or $3.03 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. Finally, we generated $147 million of free cash flow up from $81 million in the prior year. Higher bottom line earnings combined with lower retiree medical benefit payments and reduce cash interest to drove the increase. These contributors were partially offset by increase investment in working capital needed to support the revenue growth.  Slide nine details full year sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our commercial truck and trailer segment sales increased by 28% from last year to $3.3 billion, driven by higher production in all major markets, market share increases and new business wins. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $345 million up from 47% from last year, segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck and trailer increase 140 basis points. The increases in both segment adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA margin were driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue. In our aftermarket and industrial segment, sales were $1 billion up over $100 million from last year driven by higher volumes in our industrial business and revenue from the acquisition we’ve made in the fourth quarter of 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $142 million up $26 million compared to last year, segment adjusted EBITDA margin also increased up 100 basis points compared to last year. The increases in both segment adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA margin were driven primarily by lower retiree medical expense and conversion on higher sales. These increases were partially offset by higher material and freight cost primarily in the aftermarket business. Turning to Slide 10, I want to provide an update on our investors liability. During the fourth quarter, we updated our annual evaluations related to the estimate of pending and future as best as related claims. In prior years, we have used a 10 year horizon for estimating future costs, because neither we nor our valuation advisors believe that future probable expenditures beyond 10 years to be reasonably estimated.  As we reassess our valuation this year, we determine that a longer term horizon estimate is now both probable and reasonable, based on our history and experience managing as best as related litigation, diminish volatility and consistency in our observable claims data, and the maturity of as best as litigation overall, among other factors. As a result, working with our specialist, we move to a penultimate horizon for estimating claims, which means that we are now estimating the potential cost of as best as defensive indemnity claims through the year 2059. While they're changing horizon estimate lead to an increase in our as best as related claims liability, we also recognize additional anticipated insurance recoveries that will mitigate a portion of the costs related to those as best as claims.  The impact of moving to the longer horizon estimate of the liability, net of insurance coverage receivables was a onetime $56 million non-cash charge. The next bullet on page shows the impact of a new settlement agreement that we reached in Q4, with an insurer to resolve previously disputed coverage of claims. Over the past several years, we've been aggressively pursuing strategy to settle disputed insurance claims and have now settled all of the major outstanding disputes.  Pursuant to the terms on this new agreement, we receive $3 million in cash from the ensure and recorded at $28 million receivable that is expected to offset future claims resulting in $31 million of income that helped offset the projected time horizon change.  The net impact of these asbestos items was a $25 million charge, which was excluded from our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The chart on the right hand side of the slide shows the incoming cash impacts from expenses related items. You were called it in 2016, we reached a settlement agreements with several insurance which resulted in meaningful cash and income recognition. As you can see in our forecast for 2019, all of the settlement agreements are expected to mitigate the likely income statement and cash flow impact associated with feature as best as costs. Next I'll review our fiscal year 2019 market outlook on Slide 11. We’ve seen strong net orders for most of 2018 in North America Class A truck, with the backlog to build ratio now at 9 months. We believe elevated build levels will continue through our fiscal year, resulting in production of about 320,000 units.  As we look to our other markets, we anticipate that Europe will be relatively stable in 2019 at approximately 485,000 trucks. The economy is forecast to continue to grow and the solid fundamentals support a strong truck production market. Moving to Asia, we expect our sales in China to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis, primarily as a result of the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar. And the India should produce about 450,000 trucks slightly higher than the record levels we saw in 2018. Finally, we forecast South America production will expand to around 110,000 units. In Brazil, business confidence is improved and we are hopeful the new government will bring stability and continued growth to the economy.  On Slide 12, I'll review our financial outlook for fiscal year 2019. Our forecast is for sales to be approximately $4.25 billion up slightly from 2018. The callout box on the right walks to this revenue figure from our 2018 actuals. As you can see our market outlook is up $50 million with North America Class A production providing the largest year-over-year growth. However, we are also seeing headwinds from FX driven by the appreciation of the US dollars against most major currencies which we estimate to be approximately $100 million.  Our guidance also includes revenue outperformance of what $120 million to $150 million driven primarily by new business wins ramping up or coming online. As Jay mentioned this puts us on the path to achieving $660 million in revenue outperformance for M2019.  Moving back to the table on the left, we also forecasted our adjusted EBITDA margin will increase 20 basis points to approximately 11.5% which is what we guided to when we first launched the M2019 plan and again at our Analyst Day last December. We expect margin expansion from conversion on higher revenue and operational performance initiatives partially offset by modest increases in net deal cost.  Building on our strong adjusted diluted earnings per share performance in 2018. We anticipate 2019 to be approximately $3.10. Walking from our 2018 adjusted EPS of $3.03 Increased adjusted EBITDA should yield about $0.15 partially offset by higher adjusted tax expense of $0.11 per share. This reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of around 15% which is up a bit from last year but consistent with the longer term guidance we've previously provided.  Finally, we expect to generate $175 million to $185 million of free cash flow. In 2018, we invested a significant amount of cash in working capital to support $131 million in growth we experienced globally. As revenue growth moderates in 2019, that should reduce the amount of incremental working capital investment, which means we should see even stronger cash flow generation in 2019 as reflected in our guidance.  From a financial perspective, the bottom line is this. We delivered one of our strongest years on record and we expect even stronger results in 2019as we enter the final year of our M2019 plan.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Jay for closing remarks. 
Jeffrey Craig: Thanks, Kevin. Let's go to Slide 14. On December 6, I hope you can join us in New York for Analyst Day. At that time, we look forward to sharing with you our new M2022 plan. I think you'll find that plan to be as aggressive that to you before and driving shareholders value but no less achievable.  Before we go to Q&A, I want to recognize again the Meritor team around the world. Our employees have manage the challenges this year and the unrelenting work schedules its required with great success. This team has a remarkable dedication to meeting our commitments. From our manufacturing plants to our corporate offices we share the desire to be a leader which we demonstrated for many years now.  Now let's take your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Joseph Spak : I guess I just wanted to start on some of the outperformance stuff you reported and as a sort release of ’19. I think if we go back to analyst day last year you were looking for about $315 million of outperformance. It looks like you did a little bit better with the $325 million and then there was still if I recall correctly, like you had a gross opportunity of $625 million and you were putting in like a risk adjusted number of about $190 million to get to that $660 million. So you know now that we're a year forward I'm assuming that's not necessarily a risk adjusted or unawarded number at this point. Is that correct? like that were you able to actually execute on those opportunities that you saw in the marketplace?
Kevin Nowlan : Yes, Joseph you've got some of the numbers right. The $315 million we talked about was business that we had won but was not yet in the P&L and that wasn't an ‘18 number that was an ‘18 and ‘19 number. And if you look at the combination of those two columns from Analyst Day with 315 and a risk adjusted number of 145. So let's combine about another $460 million of revenue outperformance in ‘18 and ‘19. And so what we're saying is we achieved $325 million of that $460 million in ‘18. Frankly a little bit quicker than we were originally anticipating in our guidance at the midpoint suggests we'll get the balance of $135 million in 2019. So right on track for that $660 million in total revenue outperformance. 
Joseph Spak : Okay, of that $315 million I guess you're right which was sort of not in the P&L over and I know presumably most of that was or the line share that was in ‘18 versus ‘19. Is that fair? 
Kevin Nowlan : It's a mix. I think some of that still coming in ‘19 as we grow some of those new business wins that were we had won but they still might be ramping up in ‘19. So it's a mix. But I'd say the bulk of that column 315 was what we saw in 2018. 
Joseph Spak : And then I guess like you know if we sort of compare and contrast again like you know your outlook for Class 8 in FY ‘19 is now higher than you thought about a year ago. So how do we think about sort of volume adjusting some of those targets.
Kevin Nowlan : Yes, I mean when you think of that Class 8 truck market being up. You know if you look at just 2018 what happened to the truck market going from 237,000 Class 8 trucks to 38000 Class 8 trucks. What that effectively means it's about $280 million dollars of incremental revenue from ‘17 to ’18 from the Class 8 truck market. But obviously keep in mind we grew $830 million in the year with a big chunk of that being the revenue outperformance.  I think as you look at the outlook we provided at Analyst Day last year, I think the revenue was quite a bit lower than what we're now projecting for 2019. Now we're projecting $4.25 billion. I think we're a little south of $4 billion and a big piece of that is a Class 8 truck market is stronger and that's reflected in our guidance. 
Joseph Spak : Okay, maybe moving to the free cash like, if I look at your guidance for ’19, it looks like a free cash flow conversion is almost 10 percentage points sort of higher than what you realized in ‘18. It sounds like maybe you're going to talk more about sort of free cash flow and the path forward at the Analyst Day but given that you've already sort of given ‘19 guidance here, I was wondering if you could just talk about what are some of the drivers of that improvement and maybe like to have an ultimate goal on sort of conversion?
Kevin Nowlan : In terms of what's happening in '19, fundamentally, it's that as revenue levels off, we're making less investment in working capital. So, in 2018, we had $830 million of revenue growth. Our working capital tends to run 8% to 10% or so of revenue. So, we were making those investments in working capital, particularly inventory. But as revenue levels off in '19, we no longer have the overhang of incremental working capital investment which simply means that more of the earnings flow to the bottom-line as free cash flow. And so, that's what's fundamentally happening which is a good level of free cash flow and something, in a stable environment, we'd be able to throw off as we look forward. But you're right. We'll provide more guidance and more thoughts on how we see cash flow progressing and what we do with that cash flow beyond '19 when we get to analyst day in a few weeks.
Joseph Spak : Okay. And then just real quick, on the buyback -- and it sounded like Jay, in your opening comments, you want to try to attack that fairly aggressively. Although, it doesn't look like in the guidance you're assuming much of anything in terms of excess buybacks. Maybe some to offset regular dilution. So, how should we think about you attacking or executing against that? And is it really just opportunistic? And over what time frame should we think that you execute that entire plan over?
Jeffrey Craig: Yes. Good question and observation, Joe. I think you're right. Implied in the guidance is all of the share buybacks we executed in 2018. But we don't have anticipation of those buybacks in our '19 guidance. Please remember that our cash flow tends to be most significant in the middle of our year, so as you get into the end of Q2, Q3, and the beginning of Q4. So, that's when we tend to execute the bulk of our buybacks. So, for the impact on EPS, it tends to be back-end loaded. We obviously view the price at which our shares are trading right now as just a great opportunity if we look at our earnings multiples and the stability of our company based on all the deleveraging we've done. And I think what places us somewhat unique in our space is we have no calls on our cash flow. We're at the debt levels we want to be. Our legacy liabilities are really pretty well taken care of and behind us. So, all this free cash flow generation can be directed toward growth or share buybacks. So, quite frankly, we're very excited with the trading levels of our stock and potentially the opportunity it provides us in the near-term. Q - Unidentified Analyst
Joseph Spak : Okay. Thanks. Congrats. And look forward to seeing you guys in a couple weeks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line's open.
Joe Nolan : Hi. This is Joe Nolan on for Neil. Congrats on a great quarter. I know that you guys said that you almost completely offset steel cost in the quarter. But I was just wondering what that headwind was on a year-over-year basis.
Kevin Nowlan : Yes. On a full-year basis when we look at '18 versus '17, we almost entirely offset it. When you look Q4 to Q4, we did have a little bit of a headwind. Call it about $2 million or so. And sequentially, even going from Q3 to Q4 because we've seen steel cost ramping up in the back half our fiscal year. We also saw a sequential headwind probably of $4-ish million going from Q3 to Q4. But full-year '18 versus '17, the way steel moved and our recovery mechanisms kicked in, it was a push.
Joe Nolan : Got it. And then what is embedded in the fiscal year '19 EBITDA guidance for steel cost headwind?
Kevin Nowlan : Yes. The assumption is that we're going to be burying the cost of the movements that we saw in steel in the season, the back half of our fiscal year. And as you know, our recovery mechanisms in our OE contracts work on a lag. So, we'll have a little bit of a lag that creates a headwind from a steel perspective. Call it high-single-digit millions of steel cost on a year-over-year basis which is embedded in our guidance that we provided.
Joe Nolan : Okay. And then can you just talk about the success of the mid-year price increase within the aftermarket business? And did that benefit margins at all in the fiscal year fourth quarter?
Jeffrey Craig: Sure. I think we have been successful in executing the price increases we planned for. I think you see that on the fourth quarter results of our aftermarket group. We're achieving the objectives we set out for this year to return that business to more normalized margins. And we're very pleased with the run rate of the profitability of that business going into 2019.
Joe Nolan : Okay. That's it for me. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.
Jason Stulgrair : Hi, guys. Good morning. This is Jason Stulgrair on for Brian Johnson. I was just hoping to ask about the margins in the quarter. I guess I'll follow up from the previous question. The margins in aftermarket and industrial above 14%. It sounds like that's largely the effect of price increases. And you guys would expect that run rate to continue into 2014. So, just wanted to confirm that wasn't necessarily a one-time timing issue and that was a more structural change in that business.
Kevin Nowlan : No, you're correct. If you look at the full year, what we saw in the aftermarket business is we were incurring certain costs, freight costs, steel costs, other costs throughout the entirety of the year. And we didn't execute pricing actions to mitigate the bulk of those cost increases until Q4. So, we generated a Q4 margin in that segment of 14.7% which is obviously higher than what the full-year margin for the segment was. And there is nothing unusual about that. It's the fact that we're now recovering the cost that we were seeing throughout the year. So, as we head into '19, our expectation is we'll see a typical dip in Q1 as we normally do in the segment because that's the seasonal low point for aftermarket with fewer selling days in the quarter. But as we look at the last nine months or the last three quarters of the year, that we're expecting aftermarket industrial margins to be well north of 14% for each of those quarters going forward.
Jason Stulgrair : Okay. Yes. Terrific. And then I guess just moving to commercial truck and trailer, margins were a little lower in the quarter on top of strong volume. And I know you guys called out material and freight headwinds in both segments in the press release. And so, obviously, higher material and freight comes with growth. But was there anything that surprised you in the quarter like premium freights or spends of inefficiencies that surprised you for efficiency of growth?
Kevin Nowlan : Yes. I guess a couple things. When you look at the truck segment that you're talking about, truck and trailer, if you're looking at Q4 to Q4 as opposed to the full-year which is what our press release was focused on -- but Q4 to Q4, I'd say there are really three things. One is we do have currency impacting the business right now. The US dollar has gotten stronger in the last few months. You can see just on a year-over-year basis versus the Reais. The Reais depreciated almost 25%. The Swedish Krona's depreciated quite a bit. So, Q4 to Q4, we saw headwinds from that. Don't forget we also had the Meritor WABCO business that a year ago, we owned, and we no longer own. That's worth about 90 basis points to that segment in Q4 numbers. And then we did incur some premium costs as we were delivering on the strong markets and the peak markets that we're seeing. And as Jay mentioned in his remarks, we're investing in some supplier capacity, making some modest supplier capacity investments to be able to mitigate the costs as we look ahead.
Jeffrey Craig: Yes. Jason, I'd just add to that. One part of your question I think was were we surprised by that. I'd say quite the opposite. What we saw -- and you saw this in us being able to realize many of the M2019 revenue grains earlier than we anticipated -- we saw an opportunity to really lock in those market share and revenue gains. And so, we purposely incurred some premiums, bringing on some new suppliers to bring that volume in. And with the site investments we'll make in those suppliers, we're already seeing those premiums abate. And we should see them virtually disappear by the first calendar quarter or second fiscal quarter. The payback on those investments was a matter of months. And we just felt it was a great opportunity to lock in additional market share and still be able to hit both our near-term and mid-term financial commitments.
Jason Stulgrair : Okay. Great. And then just one more if I could. On the 2019 revenue target of $4.25 billion, obviously, it increased from 2018. But as I look at the end markets that you guys are forecasting, the increase in revenue target from where you guys were at investor day which, as you guys alluded to, was just under $4 billion to now is like a 7%-8% increase. But with end-markets like Class 8 trucks and Class 57 trucks in North America increased around the 20% range from investor day, it just seems like some of us might have been expecting a stronger 2019 number given where you guys ended up with your end-markets. So, are there any other puts and takes there? Is that pricing? Is it FX that we should be considering?
Kevin Nowlan : Well, I guess a couple things. One is keep in mind the Class 8 truck market going up from where we were in 2017 to even this year is worth $280 million. And we increased our revenue this year $830 million. So, while the truck market is stronger, that wouldn't drive something that's hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars higher. It's $280 million higher year-over-year. And you're seeing that in our guidance. But we are also seeing then an FX headwind as we head into 2019 of about $100 million. And you can see that with the strengthening US dollar against most of the European currencies, the Chinese currencies, the Brazilian Reais. So, it's really across the board that we're seeing that revenue headwind.
Jason Stulgrair : Okay. That's it for me. Congrats on finishing up a great fiscal '18, guys. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Faheem Sabeiha : Congrats on a great quarter. I was just sticking to the revenue outlook for next year. Wondering if you can provide a little commentary around your aftermarket industrial business. And it seems like that $50 million sales increase is primarily coming from the Class 8 market. Just wondering if you can provide some thoughts as far as what the guide implies for the aftermarket industrial business.
Kevin Nowlan : Effectively, that's right. The bulk of the market increase we're talking about is really Class 8. And if you do the math based on the guidance we've given before, every 5,000 Class 8 trucks translates to about $20 million of revenue. So, it's a little bit more than $40 million associated with the Class 8 truck market. So, it's the bulk of the increase.
Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And then your production outlook for North America Class 8 seemed a little conservative given where the industry's backlog sits today. Is your initial production guide based on current delivery schedules that's being communicated by your customers? Do you guys not have much confidence in the order or it's past the first half of calendar '19? Just any thoughts around there would be great.
Jeffrey Craig: Yes. I think our outlook is very consistent with the market services of ACT and FCR if you look at those in the first part of our year. I think we have a little uncertainty as compared to them in Q4. And that's not really based on current production outlook from the OE customers. It's really just looking forward. And I think we are a little more conservative in our outlook in our fiscal Q4 just given how long this upturn has lasted so far. So, obviously, we'll see how that Q4 turns out. But that's really the main difference.
Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And you guys talked a little about the material cost for next year. I'm just wondering what else is embedded in your incremental margin. It looks like it's gonna be at the high end of your typical range. Just any sort of commentary around freight costs and pricing. That would be great.
Kevin Nowlan : Hi. You're right. The implicit guidance we have there is that it's about 20% incremental conversion on a year-over-year basis. I mentioned that steel is a headwind in the single-digit millions of dollars. Remember, in our 2018 results you saw on the walk we did from '17 to '18, we did have a one-time environmental remediation reserve that we booked. So, as you look on a year-over-year basis, that should be a tailwind on the causal going '18 to '19. But when you net all the puts and takes out, it means that we're probably converting on normal incremental revenue growth in that 15% to 20%, probably closer to the 15% range with all the puts and takes.
Faheem Sabeiha : Okay. And just one last question. Regarding your braking business, as the market shifts to the single-piston air brakes, which, from what I understand, have lower payback periods over the next few years, just wondering if these next-gen disc brakes would be a net neutral or loss from a content standpoint versus the brakes that are --
Jeffrey Craig: Well, yes. Good question. The content on single-piston disc brakes is still markedly higher than a drum brake. It's less than our dual-piston brake which is currently being specked. But I think what we're seeing is you can expect configurations on trucks that they most likely will have dual-piston on the front axles and potentially single-piston on the two rear axles. So, overall, compared to the drum brake content, there's significantly increased content in that configuration.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Carl Anderson for any further remarks.
Carl Anderson : Thank you, Catherine. We thank you for your participation on today's call. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2018 Meritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Carl Anderson, Group Vice President-Finance. Please go ahead.
Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Eylea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's third quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and President-Trailer and Components, and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks Carl. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 3 for the financial highlights of the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 23% to more than $1.1 billion driven by higher production in all of our major markets, new business wins, and market share increases. In fact, we believe our market share in rear axles during the past two quarters in North America is the highest in our history. In addition, we expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 80 basis points to 12% which is also among the best on record for Meritor, and we generated $102 million in free cash flow in the quarter. We are raising our full-year guidance across the board driven by our excellent performance year-to-date, higher volumes around the world, and sustain strong conversion. Kevin will walk you through the detail later in the call. With the updated outlook for fiscal 2018, we're excited to tell you that we are on track to achieve two of our three M2019 targets, a full year earlier than planned. These are net debt to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. As you know, the financial metrics we established for M2019 were aggressive targets, so achieving them a year early is a significant accomplishment. Remember, our EPS target of $2.84 was an 80% improvement from our jump-off point in fiscal year 2015. We are proud of our employees and leadership team around the world for the focus and alignment they've shown. This was demonstrated to a great degree over the past year as we have successfully met our customers' production requirements while maintaining world-class levels of quality and delivery seen by few in the industry. In the third quarter, our higher absolute earnings and free cash flow generation combined with our balanced approach to capital allocation have enabled us to achieve our net debt to adjusted EBITDA target, and we did that while buying back an additional 1.4 million common shares. Since 2015, we have bought back more than 15 million common shares. On a go-forward basis through the balance of our M2019 strategy, we expect to continue to deploy capital in support of both strategic growth initiatives, including M&A and opportunistic share buybacks. Let's now look at slide 4 for a regional update. While North America is certainly our largest market, we want to keep you updated on the meaningful growth we're seeing in other areas of the world as the leading provider of drivetrain and breaking components to the commercial vehicle industry. In the past quarters, we've given you highlights on South America and China; today, we wanted to give you a more detailed look at our growing India business. First of all, you'll note that we've raised our production outlook again for India by approximately 30% year-over-year, and now expect to be in the range of 410,000 to 420,000 medium and heavy-duty units. If you've been following the economy in India, you know that GDP is strong and expected to get stronger next year. Increased infrastructure investment is having a favorable impact on the commercial vehicle industry. Meritorious volumes of on- and off-highway axles as well as military axles and brakes are significantly higher this year due to the surge in the industry and our expansion of business with major players and including Ashok Leyland, Tata, Volvo Eicher and Mahindra in the heavy-duty and medium-duty segments for a variety of applications. As we look ahead to next year, certain policy actions are also expected to continue to drive strong demand in India. These actions include mandatory scrapping of trucks that are more than 20-years-old which should trigger replacement purchases, in addition to the upcoming Euro 6 emission standard which we expect will create a pre-buy ahead of the regulation which takes effect in April of 2020. Through our Automotive Axles Limited joint venture with the Kalyani Group, we are investing approximately $20 million in the Mysore facility to add capacity for axle and brake production as we expect sustained growth for the foreseeable future. This joint venture is nearing its 40th year and continues to be an excellent partnership for us as we grow in this region. If you turn to slide 5, I'll highlight some of the great new business wins. First, we have a couple of exciting new awards in Europe. We've talked previously about our hub reduction platform for which we have a common design and standard production system around the globe. This has enabled us to successfully localize the product in every region of the world. We will be manufacturing our MT-32-610 hub reduction axle for construction and mining trucks for a major customer in Europe. And in Turkey, we have two new programs with BMC for construction and linehaul applications. Meritor will supply BMC with hub reduction axles as well as our 18X. In defense, we have a major content on the new heavy dump truck program for Mack Defense. For this we will supply rear beam and front steer axles as well as drivelines and transfer cases amounting to tens of thousands of dollars of content per vehicle. The initial contract award is for approximately 700 trucks. In addition to this business, we continue to opportunistically pursue and win other military programs. We anticipate these will provide an incremental revenue stream in the coming years. As we look at our position in commercial vehicle electrification, we recently earned new business with Ashok Leyland in India in addition to a program with a major OE that will use Meritor's e-axles in 14 of its electric trucks. Two of those vehicles will be completely equipped with content from TransPower through our strategic relationship. We are also working with Thomas Built Bus, a subsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America on the development of a battery electric powertrain solution for its school bus platform. Our first prototype has been on the road in California since April. This is the first commercial vehicle with a fully-functional Meritor 14X e-axle, coupled with TransPower technology. In June, we announced the appointment of John Bennett to a new position at Meritor as Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. We believe this will be a crucial role as we grow in the commercial vehicle electric space, whether through the evolution of existing products like our 14X axle for which we are redesigning gears and downsizing brakes, or through the development of all new products like the e-axle. We are taking the appropriate actions to remain a market leader and we will greatly benefit from John's expertise. One additional opportunity I wanted to tell you about is a significant award for our components business. This is a five-year contract (00:10:07) and one of the largest wins we've received since officially launching this business. Over the life of the contract, we expected to produce more than 3 million pieces and we expect production to start in early 2020. Now, let's turn to side 6. We wanted to acknowledge our global team today for recognition by several customers for outstanding performance in quality, delivery, customer service, field support, and new product development. These awards are always important to us but earning them in this timeframe is particularly meaningful considering the high demand requirements we've been successfully managing for many quarters, as I said earlier in the call. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on the financials and then we'll open it up for your questions.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I'll review our third quarter financial results and our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. As you heard from Jay, we had a very strong quarter of financial performance. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12%, saw revenue increase to over $1.1 billion, and generated over $100 million of free cash flow. Let's walk through the details by first turning to slide 7 where you'll see our third quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were almost $1.13 billion in the quarter driven by a combination of higher production in all major markets and continuing revenue outperformance. In North America, Class 8 truck production was 79,000, up 13,000 trucks from a year ago. We expect production levels will step up further in the fourth quarter as our order board remains at high levels. Sales in Europe were also up in our third quarter driven by increased volumes. As Jay has highlighted over the last several quarters, we are seeing year-over-year growth in our other international markets. In fact, we saw about $40 million of the sales growth in the quarter come from our businesses in Brazil, China, and India. In addition to strong end markets, revenue outperformance achieved primarily through market share increases and new business wins continues to supplement our sales growth and accounted for approximately $50 million of the increase in sales from last year. Driven primarily by higher revenue, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $135 million and increased adjusted EBITDA margin by 80 basis points compared to last year. As you can see from the chart on the right side of the slide, we converted on incremental revenue at just over 15% on an all-in basis, consistent with our expectations for this market environment. As we've discussed before, we have two items that will continue to impact year-over-year performance through the balance of this fiscal year. These include $8 million in lower equity earnings and affiliates resulting from the sale of our interest in the Meritor WABCO JV at the end of last year and $10 million in lower OPEB expense resulting from the modifications we made to our U.S. retiree healthcare benefits in September. Noticeably absent in our causal is the impact of tariffs and escalating steel costs on our financials. Let me speak briefly about each of these. In the case of steel tariffs implemented to-date, we import very little raw steel into the U.S. from abroad. As a result, the impact of steel tariffs on us has been de minimis thus far in 2018, but of course the landscape is changing frequently so we'll continue to monitor the situation including the potential late-August imposition of the new Section 301 tariffs on a broader set of imports from China. In this environment of strong market demand and escalating trade rhetoric, we have seen domestic steel prices increasing fairly significantly. In fact, the Hot-Rolled Coil Index has increased 44% since last year, inclusive of an 18% increase sequentially. The result has been an escalation in our steel costs. However this escalation has been mitigated by our recovery mechanisms which have been offsetting prior increases in steel indices thereby negating the year-over-year impact on our financials. In fact, on a year-over-year basis steel was a slight positive for us in Q3. Moving to the left side of the chart, you can see that we expanded gross margin by 30 basis points to 15.7% driven by conversion on incremental revenue and lower pension and retiree medical expense. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $80 million, or $0.89 of adjusted diluted earnings per share, a 39% increase over last year. And finally, we generated $102 million of free cash flow this quarter. In addition to higher operating earnings, we also benefited from lower retiree medical benefit payments and reduced cash interest due to the deleveraging actions we have executed over the last 12 months. Let's move to slide 8 which details our third quarter sales and EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Trailer segment, sales increased by 24% to $904 million. While the increase in revenue was driven primarily by higher market production in North America, we also saw increases in every other major market in which we operate. In addition, we saw continued benefits from new business wins and market share increases. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $103 million, up $32 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Trailer came in at 11.4%, a 160-basis-point increase over last year. The increases in both EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue and the favorable impact of changes to retiree medical benefits, partially offset by lower affiliate earnings from the joint venture divestiture in the previous year. In our Aftermarket & Industrial segment, sales were $273 million, up 15% from last year. The increase was driven by higher volumes across our North America Aftermarket business and higher sales in our Industrial business which included revenue from the business we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $35 million, up $5 million compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.8% compared to 12.7% last year. The increases in both EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by the favorable impact of changes to retiree medical benefits and conversion on higher sales, partially offset by higher material and freight costs. Next, I'll review our fiscal year 2018 global market outlook on slide 9. The North America truck market is showing no signs of slowing down in the near-term with Class 8 net orders over 40,000 units for four of the last six months and a backlog-to-build ratio of approximately eight months. We are maintaining our outlook for Class 8 and Class 5-7 production at 300,000 units to 310,000 units and 240,000 units to 250000 units, respectively. Trailer volumes have continued to show considerable strength during this fiscal year driven by more drop and hook activity due to driver shortages and the ELD implementation, as well as more frequent lighter loads resulting from increased e-commerce activity. We are increasing our estimate by 20,000 to 310,000 to 320,000 units in 2018. Europe remains at strong production levels and South America continues to recover. We've increased our outlook for Europe by 5,000 units and maintained our previous outlook for South America. As we've discussed on this call, the India market continues to expand. We have increased our 2018 outlook there by 12% to 410,000 to 420,000. This would be the first year that this market has exceeded 400,000 trucks. And finally, our revenue expectation for our business in China has increased by 8% to approximately $210 million to $220 million. Overall, end markets across the globe along with revenue outperformance are driving the strong top line growth this year. And importantly, we are successfully converting on this revenue opportunity. Based on these market assumptions, you can see on slide 10 that we are again raising our 2018 guidance. We are now forecasting revenue to be approximately $4.1 billion on the high end of our prior guidance. We're now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 11.3%, a 10-basis-point increase from our prior outlook. We are also raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a new range of $2.90 to $3 per share. Just to reiterate what Jay said earlier, we're excited that we are on track to achieve two of our three M2019 targets one year early inclusive of our adjusted EPS target. And finally based on our higher earnings expectations, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to be in a range of $135 million to $145 million. This cash flow guidance includes an approximately $60 million investment in working capital this year to support revenue growth. We would expect any incremental investment in working capital to subside as revenue level stabilize. As a result, we see the $135 million to $145 million in free cash flow in FY 2018 as the starting point from which we expect future growth in cash flow looking to FY 2019 and beyond. We are very pleased with our performance so far in 2018 as we continue to execute on our M2019 commitments. Now, we'll take your questions.
Operator: Our first question is from Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is open.
Gene Vladimirov - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Gene Vladimirov on for Colin. Would you be able to give us some color on your Aftermarket margin outlook for the rest of the year? And then when you think about the segment, what sort of timeframe should we be thinking about in terms of getting to that 14% target margin?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: With respect to Aftermarket & Industrial, we haven't simply revised the segments here. Last quarter, we haven't given a new guidance outlook in terms of what we expect the long-term run rate for that business to be. I think we're pretty pleased with the performance on a year-over-year basis. We saw margins up a little bit on a year-over-year basis, and we're continuing to progress as we look to Q4. We have been taking actions to make sure we improve the margin of the underlying Aftermarket business which is the majority of that business, inclusive of executing some pricing actions here on July 1st which should flow through in our fourth quarter results.
Gene Vladimirov - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. Helpful. And then with North America truck kind of at peak levels, just wondering how you're thinking about growth opportunities for next year?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think you should keep in mind of the $800 million of revenue growth year-over-year that about 25% of that is new business wins. So it's not just market growth and as I spoke to you on the call today, we continue to have meaningful new business wins in all our focused areas of growth, be it defense, off-highway, components, internationally, and Europe. A lot of our new product introductions in China are starting to take hold in the mid-market segment. So, we still feel we have a lot of headroom for growth in the areas we targeted as part of the M2019 program.
Gene Vladimirov - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. Good luck for the rest of the year.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Faheem F. Sabeiha - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats on a good quarter. Just wondering if you can provide a little more color around the increased market share in the quarter, were they share gains in the heavy-duty and medium-duty markets, or do they have anything to do with the industry supply constraints that allowed Meritor to achieve higher share?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: We certainly have been successful in meeting the demands of the market. We think we're – as I mentioned, we're among the best in the industry at that. And if you go back to some comments I've made in previous quarters, that's really no accident. We've proactively built inventory banks in critical component areas. We've invested in our manufacturing capabilities to respond to what we expected to be increased market share from our new business wins. So, we have reached what we believe is the highest market penetration we've ever had in North America, and are very pleased with that performance so far.
Faheem F. Sabeiha - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then regarding your components business, it felt like the focus with components was to drive a higher off-highway business, but you guys won business on a light-vehicle platform. So is the light-vehicle market the direction for this business? I mean, could we see more wins in the space, and do you have to make additional investments in the business to meet light-vehicle volume levels?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: No, the primary focus is not on the light-vehicle side, but as you know, the crossover between medium-duty trucks and then into some of what are classified as light-duty vehicles, there is some crossover on those components. So, we did target this particular market where we achieved a significant win this quarter when we set the strategy for the business, and it was a very intentional product development and focused sales effort on this particular segment.
Faheem F. Sabeiha - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it along.
Operator: Our next question is from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.
Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. I guess starting on the revenue guidance, so you called off NAFTA commercial vehicle production schedules implies a sequential increase from the FY third quarter, and I realize there are some summer shutdowns in Europe, U.S. dollar strengthened a bit, but curious on any other drivers and why the implied sales outlook for the fourth quarter is $125 million lower than Q3. And I can appreciate, you're being conservative in light of some of the supplier constraints and trade noise, but I want to make sure I'm not missing something there.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. Neil, this is Kevin. A few things. One is, as you alluded to we typically have the seasonal shutdowns in Europe which is probably the biggest driver of the revenue step-down we expect sequentially in Q4. But keep in mind that some of our other businesses typically hit seasonal peaks coming out of the third fiscal quarter, that includes Aftermarket, China, India, Trailer which all typically take a step down in Q4. And then on top of that, we're going to see currency become a little bit of a headwind sequentially as we look at what's happened with the euro heading into the fourth quarter. So, all those things are contributors to the step down in revenue in Q4.
Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And could you just talk more about the industry supply constraints that occurred this past quarter; any notable impact to results you would call out? And then, more importantly, how Meritor is managing any headwinds. I'm just curious if these are improving.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: We have not had supply constraints that resulted in us missing critical deliveries to our customers, so we have not incurred those. I wouldn't say that is without some Herculean efforts and at times some typical actions you see in an upturn like this expedited freight and things of that nature, but so far we have been able to deliver on our commitments to our customers even at these very high levels.
Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, great. And then if I could just sneak one more in. So the new business wins, Jay, continue to come through for you. You called out several in the presentation. So is the $260 million of incremental revenue from new business wins that's expected to hit the P&L in FY 2019 on a year-over-year basis, is that still a good number to think about irrespective of volume changes and the underlying end markets for next year?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: We're not ready to update our guidance for 2019 as of yet, but we're still confident in the level of new business wins that we're driving and you can see and as Jay mentioned a good chunk, 25% or so, of our revenue increases this year are related to the revenue outperformance and we would expect that to continue the trajectory that we're on heading into 2019. But we'll provide more of an update on that when we give our 2019 outlook in November.
Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Our next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
George Clark - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. This is George Clark on for Joe. Just a quick question on your incremental margin assumption in the fourth quarter, it looks like it's around 12%, but you guys have been executing around 15% over the past three quarters. So, can you just give us some color on what the drivers are for that, kind of, lower outlook?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. I mean the biggest driver of that is really that we have incremental steel headwinds as we go from Q3 to Q4. We've seen, as I mentioned in my remarks, certain steel indices even going up 18% sequentially from Q3 to Q4 and that's going to continue to hit us or start to hit us from a cost perspective in Q4 and we won't see the recovery benefit of that until we get into 2019. So, when you adjust for that call it about $4 million of headwind in Q4 sequentially then that puts us into our typical conversion on downside revenue driven by the revenue step-down we just talked about in response to Neil's question with Europe, China, India, and some of the other markets stepping down.
George Clark - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then kind of off of that steel comment, into 2019 as you guys start to see the recoveries from this year, could that be a little bit of a tailwind from a margin standpoint, if steel prices kind of start to level off a little bit?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I think it's hard to say at this point, and I don't think we're prepared to give a 2019 outlook yet. There's been so much volatility in steel prices and with the trade rhetoric that I think we need to see where things are going to settle down over the next few months before we can really give an outlook there. We do, of course, have those recovery mechanisms in place that tend to be on about a six-month lag. So, if steel prices were to level off at a particular level or steel indices were to level off, we would start to see the recovery benefit on that about six months later, but we'll give more fulsome guidance in the November call.
George Clark - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Baudendistel with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Michael James Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Just wanted to ask you, I mean, so much of the investor discussion has been around the Class 8 market peaking, and just wanted to get your perspective now that so much of the revenue development opportunities have been in international markets, and off-highway markets and medium-duty and defense, et cetera, what portion of your revenue now is tied to the Class 8 tractor market that is so highly volatile?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, we haven't disclosed that in the past, but I can tell you as we look forward to our future business plans, we think we can sustain a reasonable step-down in Class 8 production while holding revenue relatively flat because of all the significant new business wins that we've achieved, as you noted, outside the North American Class 8 market. And I think this quarter was just a great example of all those significant wins that are really around our diversified business.
Michael James Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's good. Just also want to ask you, just on the adjusted EBITDA margins now at record levels, over 12%, can you just walk us through a little bit about how much of that was a function of the higher volumes this year and operating leverage and how much of that is going to be sustainable if we were to go to, say, a mid-cycle type level where North American production is 220,000 to 240,000 instead of 310,000?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, as we look at jumping from last year's 10.4% margin for the full year to this year's 11.3% margin, we've obviously seen a significant uptick in revenue, about $750 million in our guidance on a year-over-year basis, and we've been converting on that at around 15%. And so, that's – there are some other puts and takes in there, but that by and large has been the driver to-date. But remember we were jumping off at 10.4% last year and expecting to continue to improve even with revenues not being as strong coming into the year. So, we continue to expect as we look ahead to be able to deliver material labor and burden performance in environments where the markets becomes – returns to more normalized levels. I think when we talk about our outlook for 2019 as well as our strategy for what's next at our December Analyst Day which we're targeting you'll hear us talk about what our expectations are for those margins over the cycle, but I think your expectation should be that this is not – 11.3% for 2018 is not the peak for our business.
Michael James Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then I think I missed earlier, the recovery on your steel prices, how long is the lag or when do you actually recover it from the higher prices, is it in a couple quarters or...
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: It's normally a couple of quarters, six to nine months lag from the time the indices start impacting us from a cost perspective. They tend to lag then in terms of customer recoveries on go-forward pricing about six to nine months.
Michael James Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's all I had. Congrats on meeting that multi-year EPS target.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yeah. Hi, guys. You mentioned the euro there briefly. Was wondering if you could comment, I guess, also on forex volatility elsewhere, obviously you've got some pretty severe currency movements in South America, the RMB has been moving in China; just wondering if you can update us generally on the extent to which that'll end up having any translational/transactional impacts on your earnings and revenue.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I mean, they had some impact in the quarter, for instance, if I look year-over-year, we did see a little bit of favorability, single-digit millions of dollars from a revenue perspective related to the euro primarily. But as we look ahead as I mentioned we see what the euro has done here the last month or so, it has strengthened which will create a little bit of a headwind sequentially. But all in, the biggest driver of the movements that we're seeing in revenue right now are by and far end markets as well as our revenue outperformance. And at the end of the day, currencies aren't that significant an impact as we look at earnings both Q3 and Q4.
Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. I noticed you took up the China revenue guidance again really nicely. Can you comment on how much of that was off-highway versus maybe some on-highway revenues starting to creep in?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think it's a mix of both. As I mentioned on the call, we are seeing penetration of the new products that we've developed and introduced into the Chinese on-highway market really take hold. And as we spoke to you previously, we also export to other areas in Asia. The products that we produce in China because of the quality levels that we produce them out we're able to export them into other Asian markets.
Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Great. And then last one, you mentioned expedited freight supply chain constraints, doesn't sound like that's impacting the OE side of the business at all, but perhaps you're seeing that maybe more so in the Aftermarket segment, was I reading that correctly?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think that is correct. And as Kevin mentioned in response to a previous question, we have executed some price increases here in Aftermarket to compensate for the increased freight costs we're seeing, the increased material costs. We do not have, for the most part, automatic pass-through mechanisms that we have on the OE side in our Aftermarket business, but we have pushed through these pricing increases recently which is part of our expectation why we continue to expect to see improvement in the margin of the Aftermarket business as the year goes on.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Carl Anderson for any further remarks.
Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you. This does conclude Meritor's Third Quarter Conference Call, and we thank you for your continued participation. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-05-06 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Carl Anderson - Group Vice President, Finance Jay Craig - CEO & President Kevin Nowlan - CFO, SVP & President Trailer & Components
Analysts: Mike Baudendistel - Stifel Nicolaus George Clark - RBC Capital Markets Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital Neil Frohnapple - Buckingham Research Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. Faheem Sabeiha - Longbow Research
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Meritor second-quarter 2018 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Carl Anderson, Group Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin.
Carl Anderson: Thank you, Takeeya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's second-quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call today we have Jay Craig, CEO and President, and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and President of Trailers and Components, and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we are recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc. It's protected by US and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the express written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Carl, and good morning. Let's turn to slide 3. We're happy to report today strong sales and profits for the quarter. For the second fiscal quarter of 2018, we had sales of more than $1 billion, a 32% increase year-over-year. This was primarily due to higher production in all our global markets, new business wins, and favorable foreign exchange. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.4%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. And adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 114%. As I said, these results reflect the higher levels of production in our end markets globally. You'll see later in the presentation that we are raising our market outlook for the year in nearly every region. Even as markets are growing, we continue to gain rear axle share with our largest customers. In high markets like these, our customers know they can rely on us to meet their demand. It goes without saying, however, that at these volumes we are seeing some stress in the system. The good news is that, although incurred some premium freight and higher labor and burden costs as a result, we are still converting well and consequently are raising our guidance for the year. I attribute this to the diligent execution of our team in effectively meeting the needs of our customers while at the same time efficiently managing the supply chain complexities and incremental costs inherent at these volume levels. I am pleased to tell you that with the revenue tailwinds we expect to continue in the second half, in addition to the new business wins and other outperformance to the market, our full-year guidance has improved measurably. Kevin will give you the details, but I want to highlight that, at the top end of our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, is now higher than the aggressive M2019 EPS target of $2.84, which you may remember was an 80% improvement from our jump off point in fiscal year 2015. Throughout the entire M2019 time frame, we have earned meaningful new business, increased our share with current customers and converted on increased revenue as global end markets have strengthened simultaneously. We have talked several times about our balanced approach to capital allocation that we have executed for the past several years. We are currently on track to achieve our net debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 1.5 times this year, a year earlier than planned. Our consistent free cash flow generation provides funding opportunities for strategic growth initiatives while also returning value to shareholders through share repurchases. We executed on both of these actions over the past several months. We bought back 1.4 million common shares in the quarter and earlier this week we acquired the business of AA Gear & Manufacturing. More on this important transaction in a couple of minutes. Also in the quarter, we announced executive repositioning. In addition to his responsibilities as Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Nowlan will now lead our Trailer and Components businesses and Global Purchasing. Joe Plomin will continue to lead Global Aftermarket business with additional responsibility for Industrial, which includes off-highway, specialty and defense. And Chris Villavarayan continues to run our global truck group, as we announced in January. He is also taking the lead on our electrical technology offering that we'll talk more about today. In conjunction with the organizational changes, we modified the Company's financial reporting segments, which are now Commercial Truck & Trailer, Aftermarket & Industrial. We filed an 8-K on Monday with recast results for these segments. Last quarter we gave you an in-depth look at our business in China. This quarter, as we turn to slide 4, we want to highlight the recovery we're seeing in South America and talk about the new business we recently were awarded with important customers in that region. From an economic perspective, Brazil's GDP is expected to grow between 2.5% to 3% this year. This improvement is accelerating truck sales. We anticipate growth in this market for medium and heavy-duty trucks to be approximately 35% year-over-year. And even with this significant increase, production volumes are still well below peak levels we saw in 2011, leaving us more room for market growth in the coming years. As trucks volumes rise, we are pleased to announce new business wins in Brazil with important long-term customers. First, we will supply front and rear axles for MAN's new delivery truck, in addition to supplying our hub reduction axle for the Constellation heavy-duty truck application. We have also been awarded axle business with Mercedes-Benz and IVECO for school buses. Obviously, this improvement in the market is a welcome change following the severe recession of the past few years. We have an excellent team in Brazil and look forward to continued growth in the region. If you turn to slide 5, you'll see more detail on the AA Gear & Manufacturing transaction. On April 30, we closed a deal to purchase substantially all the assets of AA Gear and its subsidiaries. We expect revenue from this transaction to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million next fiscal year. Most importantly, however, we believe it's suite of process engineering and production capabilities for gear and shaft components will help accelerate our growth strategy. AA Gear has strong customer relationships with some of the world's leading OEM and Tier 1 manufacturers across a wide range of end markets, including agriculture, construction, heavy truck and diversified industrials. Key customers include Caterpillar and CNH Industrial. We believe this is an excellent fit for Meritor and strongly aligns with our M2019 objectives. Let's turn to slide 6. On May 1, at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in Long Beach, California, we introduced our new Meritor Blue Horizon technology brand. We chose this venue to introduce Blue Horizon because of the significant presence of several OE customers in North America who are advancing their interest in electric drivetrain technology. The Blue Horizon brand reflects a move toward even more innovation and advanced technology. It also represents a product evolution and revolution to meet the different needs of existing and new customers. Most importantly, it supports the continuation of our leadership in engineering and advanced technology. All Blue Horizon products will be grounded in the Meritor tradition of reliability and durability, even as our solutions become lighter, more efficient and more technically sophisticated. Products launched under Blue Horizon will deliver flexibility in global platforms, integration of motors into axles and customized gearing for all segments of the commercial vehicle industry. In past quarters we have talked about the number of electric vehicle programs we have won globally. That number continues to grow. Meritor's experience and insight are vital to the creation of an entirely new electrical architecture that maximizes power, technology, efficiency and safety on the road. Whether it's battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, we will offer a completely integrated system that can be installed on an existing vehicle or glider, or a kit that can be installed on an OEM assembly line. Our new integrated eAxle system is the next step in the evolution of electric drivetrains, putting batteries between the frame rails and powering the axle directly for reduced energy loss and weight. As we said previously, we are confident that this expansion of our capabilities is one of the best opportunities for long-term growth. To that end, we are very pleased to announce, as we turn to slide 7, that Meritor, through its strategic alliance with TransPower, is collaborating with Peterbilt to equip 12 all electric Class 8 day cab tractors and three refuse trucks with all electric drivetrain systems. Meritor will supply high efficiency and lightweight axles, drive lines, and brakes that maximize system efficiency, extend range and increase payload. Electric drive train power and control systems, as well as batteries and accessories, will be supplied by TransPower. The 80,000 pound short-haul Peterbilt drayage trucks will support operations at ports throughout California, including Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego and Oakland. Two Peterbilt refuse haulers will be tested by Sacramento County and a waste hauler will operate the third truck. The Meritor and TransPower systems are expected to deliver a 125 mile operating range for the drayage trucks and up to 95 miles for the refuse haulers. Our understanding of customer needs enables us to create the products that can do what needs to be done regardless of the class, segment or rating. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on the financials, and then we'll take your questions.
Kevin Nowlan: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call I'll review our second-quarter financial results and our updated 2018 guidance. As you heard from Jay, we had a really strong quarter of financial performance. We saw revenue increase by $260 million, expanded adjusted EBITDA by $40 million and accelerated the progress toward achievement of our M2019 targets. Let's walk through the details by first turning to slide 8, where you'll see our second-quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $1.066 billion in the quarter, with every major region reporting stronger revenue relative to last year. In North America, Class 8 truck production was 73,000 units, up 22,000 trucks from a year ago. We believe that production levels will continue to expand for the remainder of the year due to strong net order intake in recent months. Sales in Europe were also up, primarily driven by an appreciating euro. Beyond North America and Europe, we're seeing our other major markets China, India and Brazil growing year-over-year. And while end markets are strengthening, we're also seeing the benefit of revenue outperformance globally. Driven primarily by the higher revenue, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $122 million and an 11.4% adjusted EBITDA margin. Overall we converted incremental revenue into EBITDA at the lower end of our historical range. As you can see from the chart on the right side of the slide, we are showing several discrete items that were part of the earnings walk year-over-year. First, we routinely reassess the environmental reserves required for all of our sites. As a result, we determined that we needed to accrue an incremental $8 million liability this quarter related to a legacy site. Additionally, last year you may recall that we settled a dispute with a joint venture and recorded a one-time legal charge of $10 million. As we've discussed over the last couple quarters, we have two items that will continue to impact year-over-year performance through the balance of this fiscal year. These include lower equity earnings in affiliates as a result of the sale of our interest in the Meritor WABCO JV at the end of last year. That resulted in lower year-over-year earnings of $5 million in the second quarter. And lower OPEB expense from the modifications we made to our US retiree healthcare benefits. That produced a $10 million year-over-year benefit in the second quarter. On the left side of the slide you can see that we expanded gross margin by 170 basis points over the last year to 16.7%, which is one of the highest on record. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $68 million or $0.75 per adjusted diluted share, a 114% increase over last year. And finally, free cash flow was $22 million this quarter. Expanding margins and higher adjusted income were somewhat offset by increased inventory levels as we support strong demand from our global customers. Let's move to slide 9, which details our second-quarter sales and EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. As Jay said, based on the new management structure we have modified our reportable segments to be Commercial Truck & Trailer and Aftermarket & Industrial. In our Commercial Truck & Trailer segment, sales increased by 38% to $854 million. The increase in revenue was not only driven by higher production in North America but also by significant increases in the rest of the world. In addition, we saw continued benefits from new business wins as well as favorable foreign currency impacts due to the strengthening euro. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $96 million, up $44 million from last year. EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Trailer came in at 11.2%, a 280 basis point increase over last year. The increases in both EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue and the legal charge from last year that I previously mentioned. In our Aftermarket & Industrial segment, sales were $256 million, up 13% from last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in our Industrial business, which included revenue from the business we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $36 million, up $4 million compared to last year. EBITDA margin was 14.1% compared to 14.2% last year. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the favorable impact from the changes to retiree medical benefits, partially offset by higher material and freight costs. On slide 10 I wanted to spend a few minutes discussing steel prices and tariffs since that has been a hot topic over the last couple months. In March, the US announced tariffs on raw steel imports. However, a number of countries granted exemptions from those tariffs. Our primary exposure to imported steel from nonexempt countries is on a small amount of raw steel purchases from China. We anticipate a relatively minimal direct impact on our 2018 earnings from these tariffs. However, since January, we have seen a significant increase in the hot-rolled coil index, which is up 27%, while the scrap index is up a modest 3%. These are two key indices for our North America businesses. In a majority of our Commercial Truck & Trailer sales contracts, we have recovery mechanisms linked to market indices that adjust prices on an average lag of six months. In our Aftermarket business, there is not a similar contractual mechanism to adjust prices. Pricing changes are usually made one or two times each year subject to overall market conditions. Due to the increases we are seeing thus far in steel prices, linked primarily to changes in certain indices, we're anticipating a second-half headwind of approximately $5 million, which is included in our updated 2018 earnings outlook. Next I'll review our updated fiscal year 2018 global market outlook on slide 11. Due to the level of first half production, combined with strong Class 8 orders, a healthy backlog to build ratio, and continued positive economic fundamentals, we are increasing our North America Class 8 truck production estimate by 15,000 units to a range of 300,000 to 310,000 in 2018. In Brazil, industrial production is continuing to accelerate as the economic recovery gains momentum. Business and consumer confidence are also improving, which is supporting the market's expectation of higher growth. As a result, we are increasing our production estimates for 2018 by 25%. India is also seeing increasing production levels driven by an improving economy and significant infrastructure investment. We have increased our 2018 outlook there by approximately 15%. And finally, we continue to see a significant revenue increase in China, both in our Chinese construction and mining business and in our export business. As a result, we now expect revenue in 2018 to be approximately $190 million to $210 million, up about 10% from our prior outlook and more than double where we were just two years ago in that business. Overall, we see growth continuing in most of our major markets around the globe. And that, along with the success of various revenue performance initiatives, is driving our strong performance. Based on these market assumptions, you can see on slide 12 that we are again raising our 2018 guidance. We are now forecasting revenue to be in a range of $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion, up $200 million from our prior guidance. We're expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 11.2%, which is at the high-end of our prior guidance. We expect that the higher adjusted EBITDA net of tax will drop right to the bottom line, so we are also raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a new range of $2.70 to $2.85 per share. Just to reiterate what Jay said earlier, we are excited that we are now on the cusp of achieving our M2019 adjusted diluted EPS target of $2.84 a full year ahead of plan. And finally, based on our higher earnings expectations, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to be in a range of $120 million to $135 million. We are very pleased with our performance so far in 2018 as we continue to execute on our journey to delivering on our M2019 commitments. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Alex Potter: Good quarter. I wanted to ask first about some of the supply chain stress you mentioned in the prepared remarks. If you could elaborate a little bit on where specifically you are feeling it, what parts of the supply chain seem to be pinch points, and then the extent to which you're able to capitalize on maybe pinch points elsewhere to win market share for yourself.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Alex. This is Jay. Very good question. I would say, as we typically see in strong upturns like this, we're seeing it in base forgings and castings. So, not unlike the past upturns we've executed successfully on. We have some layered capacity suppliers we bring online at slightly higher cost, and that's why you see even though we're converting at what I think are strong margins, strong incrementals, they are slightly lower than we have in previous quarters just because of bringing on that incremental capacity. We actually are right now backfilling for some of our competitors. So, we've once again been asked to step in and been able to successfully do that. I don't want to understate how the whole industry feels right now, though. I think the entire industry is operating very close to capacity, which we are as well.
Alex Potter: Okay, understood. Maybe a little bit more on China, too. Obviously there's strength there in off-highway and construction and infrastructure, and you touched on exports as well. I'm interested to hear the extent to which you are starting to get additional traction in the on-highway business in China. Maybe not now; I sort of doubt it was impacting the quarter, maybe I'm wrong. But have you any incremental evidence to suggest that you might be able to start capturing more revenue in that segment going forward?
Jay Craig: Sure. Yes, another good question, Alex. We talked about China, focused on that last quarter, like we focused on Brazil this quarter. And we have had market share gains and wins in the on-highway, particularly in bus and coach, continuing with Yutong and our other bus and coach customers, in bringing forth a tool light product that we've been integrating into China, which is taking our class leading Western axles and localizing them in China to get them to the right price points. So, we're seeing good progress. And I would say on path to the plan that we set out a year or so ago to increase our penetrations in that area.
Alex Potter: Okay. Thanks very much. Good quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Faheem Sabeiha of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Faheem Sabeiha: Congrats on a great quarter. Can you bucket the $200 million increase in your revenue outlook between higher end market growth, outperformance from new business wins and FX?
Kevin Nowlan: It's a mix of really those first two in particular. The markets are a big piece of the equation. As we've told you, when you look at Class 8 truck, just to put some dimension around that, taking the midpoint of our guidance of about 15,000 trucks translates to about $60 million. So what that tells you is, hey, that's a big contributor, but there's a lot of things going on as well. Brazil production going up is a meaningful increase, as well as other markets and new business wins. So it's really a mix of those things across the globe.
Faheem Sabeiha: Okay. And then speaking of Brazil, in light of the more positive outlook in South America, can you guys tell us what your market share is in South America? I mean, you highlighted a few recent axle wins in your slide deck; I'm just wondering if there's additional share opportunity for Meritor in this market.
Jay Craig: I think we haven't talked about specific market share, but I think we have talked about that we have a market leading position in Brazil, and continue to grow upon that with the wins that we talked about with the various OEs during this call. And that's no surprise as we localize more products into that market, like the hub reduction axle, like our medium-duty product, the 13X. We expected to get market share gains as we expand our product offerings in the local market. So, I think as we stretch our product portfolio, even though we have strong market share positions in traditional Class 8 single reduction axles, we're starting to see the increased penetration from the new product launches we have there.
Faheem Sabeiha: Okay. And just one more question around EV. Now that we're seeing the benefit of your investment in TransPower, combined with your EV offerings with the recent Peterbilt program, is the long-term plan essentially to offer these platforms on a nationwide scale?
Jay Craig: Actually on a global scale. We are taking the technology solutions offered by TransPower and actually rolling those out globally. So, that partnership is much broader than just California or just the US. Quite frankly, we see more demand right now globally for our eAxle than we are able to meet in this prototype phase, so we're almost allocating them to individual regions and our major strategic customers. So, that's what one of the powers we saw that investment and partnership in TransPower, they saw as well, is given that we're one of the few true global brands in commercial vehicle supplier world, we could bring enormous value to TransPower by bringing their products globally.
Faheem Sabeiha: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
George Clark: This is George Clark on for Joe. You touched on this earlier, but are you confident that you will be able to continue to drive incremental margins in that mid to high teens range throughout the rest of the year despite some of the higher industry volume? And how are you offsetting some of those inefficiencies?
Kevin Nowlan: Our guidance assumes right now you can see we took our revenue guidance up $200 million, and implicit in that is that we took up our conversion on that about 15%. So, we're continuing to count on our ability to convert kind of at the low end of our historic range, which tends to be what we see in these types of markets. But we manage it very closely, and we watch the potential for layered capacity costs and other inefficiencies coming in, but we're managing that very effectively, like right now. It gets more challenging as markets continue to accelerate and to grow, but we've done an effective job at managing that thus far.
George Clark: Okay. And then you guys had another strong backlog quarter. Are you seeing some of these measures come on earlier than you had previously expected? Is that pulling forward from maybe 2019? What is the dynamic there?
Kevin Nowlan: I think by and large there's two things going on. One is we had a lot of volume, new business wins coming on that we anticipated would come on in the year 2018. We had big amounts coming on in 2018 and in 2019, and we're seeing those. Plus I think with the markets being stronger, we assume our new business wins linked generally to a more normalized market. So as markets are stronger we're getting a little bit of a tailwind on some of those new business wins as well, that they come in a little bit stronger than what we were originally planning for.
George Clark: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Buckingham Research Group. Your line is now open.
Neil Frohnapple: Jay, as you mentioned, you have a chance of achieving the M2019 EPS target one year earlier, which is very impressive. But could you just talk about your confidence level in achieving the target next year in FY19, given how strong FY18 is coming in from a global market outlook standpoint? And even if NAFTA Class 8 truck is down in FY19, sort of your ability to still achieve that?
Jay Craig: Well, thanks, Neil. That's a good question and obviously something we look at very closely as well. Because like M2016, these aren't point of time targets. This is transformational for the Company and we plan to grow on those achievements. It's a little early to talk about 2019 guidance, but obviously the significant number of new business wins we think will serve as a measurable dampener to any market downturn we see. And also, as Kevin just mentioned, we tend to convert at lower levels during peaks because of bringing on layered capacity and incurring some premiums. So as those markets step down, we could see further expansion of our conversion metrics as we're able to more aggressively manage those stepped-up costs during peak markets.
Neil Frohnapple: Okay, that's helpful. And then the incremental environmental reserve of $8 million in the quarter related to a legacy site. You would have delivered a 12.2% EBITDA margin in the quarter if that did not occur. And I know these things can be unpredictable, but do you feel like the $8 million is more one time and there won't be additional cost related to this in the back half of the year?
Jay Craig: Again, Neil, we highlighted that. That's one-time cost. It's difficult with some of these sites to say will we ever have another dollar of investment. I wouldn't go that far. But I think the actions that we accrued for that we're in the midst of taking, our very aggressive clean-up of the site, that we think will hopefully put this behind us. And so, we've taken a more aggressive approach towards this particular site to try and put that liability behind us.
Neil Frohnapple: Okay. And then one last one. I mean, just given where the stock is trading, can you just talk about the thought process of buying back your own stock versus doing additional bolt-on acquisitions? And you did buy back some shares in the quarter, but just given the increase again in the free cash flow outlook, could you potentially do more buybacks than previously anticipated with the stock trading significantly below intrinsic value?
Kevin Nowlan: Absolutely. I mean, we're going to be opportunistic and balanced as it relates to deployment of our capital from here on out through 2019. We anticipate obviously generating more free cash flow over the balance of the year and you can anticipate we'll expect to have strong free cash flow again in 2019. We will look at bolt-on acquisition opportunities that make sense for us and we'll look at continuing to be opportunistic in the market, just as we were in the second quarter repurchasing 1.4 million shares. So we'll be balanced and opportunistic.
Neil Frohnapple: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mike Baudendistel: Just wanted to ask you on this all-electric program with Peterbilt, is there more Meritor content on those all-electric trucks versus a similar piece of equipment that are diesel?
Jay Craig: At this point in time I would say is fairly neutral. As our eAxle comes online and gets through the prototype stage we'll actually be running one of those on a school bus application by the end of this month. I think the expectation is if that product proves out to be as efficient as we believe it will be, I think we could start to see that eAxle replace some of the components on the vehicle, because it allows for much more battery capacity than the architecture that we're moving forward with on those Peterbilt vehicles right now.
Mike Baudendistel: Got it. And then I just also wanted to ask you on this acquired assets of the AA Gear & Manufacturing, does that play into the EV strategy at all? Because I remember from your investor day that part of the additional content on some EVs would be the additional gearing near the wheel end. Is that - does that play into that - the thought process on the acquired assets there?
Jay Craig: Very insightful question, Mike, because of one of the capabilities AA Gear brings us is precision ground gears, which we think there'll be increasing demand for in an electric environment. Because those ground gears are quieter in operation and, obviously with the elimination of the noise from the internal combustion engine, the vehicle becomes much more sensitive to other components and the noise they generate. So, we are very excited about that capability as well. But I would say overall it's just clearly right in line with the strategy we laid out for M2019 in our components business. And we like Fabco's acquisition, like the investment in TransPower, hopefully you can see that our acquisitions are very logical and connected to our strategy.
Mike Baudendistel: Got it. Makes sense. And then just wanted to ask you one last one on China. You increased the guidance there and I think a lot have with sort of the fast start to China. Does it also include a thought that the Chinese market is going to slow down in the back half of the year? Or is it because it's less relevant to you because you do more off-highway in China?
Jay Craig: I would say it's somewhat less relevant to us because we're more heavily weighted towards the off-highway.
Mike Baudendistel: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Steven Hempel: This is Steven Hempel on for Brian Johnson. Just wanted to drill down a little bit on the long-term comp structure as part of the M2022 plans, longer-term comp plans here. Obviously the 2017 plan was focused really on EBITDA margins, which you guys did a great job of achieving. 2018 plan shifted more towards EPS and then the 2019 plan added an above market growth aspect to it, as well as leverage. Just thinking about kind of where we're at from a cycle perspective and where your margins are at currently, and then obviously the shift to electrified products and eAxles, how we should be thinking about the comp structure at a high level. I understand you can't disclose what they will be, but just strategically as we think about where we're at from a cycle perspective, what additional potential metrics might you be looking at? ROIC, free cash flow, et cetera, above market growth? I'll leave it at that.
Jay Craig: Sure. Well, first of all, I think our long-term comp structure is very clear in its alignment to the strategies, as you just articulated. Senior executive management gets compensated on hitting those three financial targets embedded in M2019, as we did on the M2016. As we spoke in the previous quarter, we're in the midst of developing the M2022 strategy and we expect to roll that out at an Analyst Day this December. And we will once again that strategy will result in defined financial metrics that we will set for the Company over that three-year period. And then our long-term incentive plans will then again be locked into those achievement of those metrics. Now, to determine those metrics, we're doing a lot of research. We've done a very detailed shareholder survey over the last few months, both on the buy side and sell side, and we're taking all of that input to develop what those metrics will be, that we're hearing will drive the most significant return on shareholder value. So, we're a little early to talk about specifically what they'll be, but just know that the input you've given is being heard, filtered down, and then we'll develop those metrics.
Steven Hempel: Good. That's great to hear. I believe that's fairly thorough relative to some other companies in our coverage particularly. But anyhow - so just want to shift gears here over to the PACCAR EV tests here. Obviously good to see some progress there and some announcements on that front. Is PACCAR working with other Tier 1 suppliers for these eAxles and electrified products? Or is Meritor going to be the exclusive supplier there moving forward?
Jay Craig: I think like all OEs, they have some projects with different customers. I know they have one particular project, I believe it's with Cummins and their system. I think the announcement we made today is certainly one on the largest block orders, if not the largest. But as you would expect in a rapidly evolving market right now, like I would do if I were running an OE, they are placing their bets with different providers right now. But I think clearly Meritor has established itself as one of the leaders in the future of that technology, which is our goal. And for example, we were asked to present - I was asked to present just Tuesday as the keynote speaker at the ACT Expo. No great complement to my great speaking skills, but more about how Meritor has been recognized as a thought leader in electrification, and they wanted to hear what Meritor's plans are for the future.
Steven Hempel: Okay. And then just to follow on that, how should we be thinking about the North American and EU European bus market? Obviously you look at China, that's - from an electrified standpoint, that's been the first market to move over to eAxles. Just wondering how quickly we can start seeing some announcements on the North American/European bus market.
Jay Craig: As I've stated previously, I think that's one of the markets globally you're going to see move the quickest and most aggressively. There were some very interesting applications out at ACT Expo this week, even on the airport shuttle vans and buses, moving fully electric. I think that the requirements on cities to meet clean-air requirements are going to drive the bus sector much more quickly potentially than any other sector.
Steven Hempel: Okay, so safe to assume that Meritor is - there's projects and whatnot in the pipeline?
Jay Craig: Yes. I feel very pleased with where we are positioned in our pipeline on different bus projects throughout the globe.
Steven Hempel: Got it. And just really quickly on the ramp up on RD&E here to support new business, particularly around electrification. I believe the expectation for 2018 here was roughly half of the $12 million increase was due to increased R&D, so to speak. How should we be thinking about that ramp into 2019 and beyond?
Kevin Nowlan: I think it's premature at the moment to comment on 2019, but I would say as you look first half to second half, there is a little bit of an incremental step up in the electrification investment that's embedded within our guidance.
Steven Hempel: Got it. And if I could just squeeze in one quick one. AA Gear & Manufacturing acquisition, Cat and CNH, like those two customers, obviously. Were those customers previously for Meritor? And I guess strategically this acquisition kind of, did this get you kind of above market growth, so to speak, more quickly, getting to the extent that Cat and CNH wasn't a customer to Meritor?
Jay Craig: Well, I think to answer the second half of your question, yes. We believe so, that this will work towards getting us the above market growth. Caterpillar and CNH were small customers of ours in components, but this significantly expands our penetration. Obviously IVECO is a subsidiary of CNH, and we supply all the single reduction truck axles for them in Europe. But this moves us aggressively into the construction, ag, off-highway space for components.
Steven Hempel: Got it, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Carl Anderson for closing remarks.
Carl Anderson: Thank you, Takeeya. This does conclude our Meritor second-quarter earnings call and we thank you for your participation.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cummins Incorporated First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today, Mark Smith, Vice President, Financial Operations. You may begin.
Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2018. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We'll all be available for your questions at the end of our prepared remarks. Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in our slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly report on 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and today's materials are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Tom.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2018. Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.6 billion, an increase of 21% compared to the first quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $700 million or 12.6% compared to $705 million or 15.4% a year ago. During the first quarter, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $187 million for the expected costs of a product campaign. The charge was shared between the Engine and Components segments. This voluntary campaign is part of a proactive plan to address the performance of an aftertreatment component in certain on-highway products produced between 2010 and 2015 in North America. We disclosed in our third quarter 2017 earnings release that we identified an issue caused by the degradation of performance of this aftertreatment component and that further analysis was required to understand the extent of the problem and the appropriate remedy. The product campaign recorded in the first quarter represents the next step in our process to proactively address this aftertreatment degradation issue. We are working collaboratively with the regulatory agencies and we will need to get agreement from the agencies to finalize our action plans and only then we will know the full cost and timing to resolve the problem. The charge of $187 million reflects our best estimate of the cost of implementing our proposed plan. We have also estimated range of additional costs should the regulatory agencies ask us to replace more aftertreatment hardware than our proposed plan which we believe to be between $0 or $400 million in the worst case. It's important to note that this issue does not affect our current products, which are performing very well, and our market share remains strong. Excluding the charge for the campaign, EBITDA for the first quarter was $887 million, or 15.9%, reflecting an incremental margin of 19%. The strong operating performance in our manufacturing plants, positive pricing and the benefits of material cost reduction initiatives all contributed to the improved performance. Engine business revenues improved by 21% in the first quarter compared to a year ago. Increased production and strong market share in North America truck markets and strong demand from global construction customers, especially in China and North America, drove most of the growth. EBITDA for the quarter was 11.7% compared to 13.5% for the same period in 2017, due to $93 million of costs recorded in the quarter for the product campaign. Excluding the campaign, EBITDA was 15.5% reflecting an incremental margin of 25% year-over-year. Improved pricing, strong performance from our manufacturing plants, and lower operating expenses as a percent of sales, drove the margin expansion. Sales for the Distribution segment grew by 13% year-over-year driven by higher demand for new engines, parts and service in off-highway markets. First quarter EBITDA was 6.6% compared to 7.9% in the first quarter of 2017. EBITDA percent declined due to lower earnings in Africa and the Middle East as a result of weak demand and currency volatility and a lower mix of parts sales in North America. We do expect EBITDA to improve in dollars and as a percent of sales in the second quarter as a result of stronger parts sales, targeted price increases and cost control measures. First quarter revenues for the Components segment rose by 30%. Sales in North America increased 35% and revenues in international markets grew by 25% as a result of rising market demand, strong market share, and the success of new products aimed at lowering emissions. Sales of the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission business contributed 9% to segment growth. EBITDA for the first quarter was 12.9% compared to 16.1% in the same quarter a year ago and declined due to a charge of $94 million related to the product campaign. Excluding the campaign charge, EBITDA was 18.3%, reflecting an incremental margin of 26%. The improved margins resulted from strong operational performance and the benefits of material cost reduction programs. Power Systems sales in the first quarter grew 22% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in engine and parts sales to mining and oil and gas customers. Sales of power generation products improved year-over-year for the third straight year – third straight quarter. EBITDA in the first quarter was 13.2% compared to 9.6% a year ago, resulting in an incremental margin of 30%. The benefits of stronger volumes, cost reduction programs, better execution on power generation projects and stronger joint venture earnings in China all contributed to the margin expansion. In the first quarter, we reported results of our electrified powertrain business for the first time. EBITDA was a loss of $10 million for the first quarter and losses will increase in subsequent quarters this year as we accelerate our investments in new product programs. Now, I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the first quarter of 2018, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 22% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher levels of truck production, growth in sales of construction equipment, and increased demand for engines from mining, oil and gas and power generation customers. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks grew 44% in the first quarter of 2018, while sales of our heavy-duty engines increased 48%. Our market share through February was 34%, up 2% from last year. Production of medium-duty trucks improved 9% in the first quarter, while our engine shipments grew 26%. Our market share in the medium-duty truck market was 82% through February, up from 75% a year ago. Total shipments in our North American pickup truck customers decreased 22% compared to a year ago, due to a short-term adjustment in production by one of our OEM customers. Engine sales for construction equipment in North America increased 47% in the first quarter, reflecting increased customer confidence. Sales from engine shipments to high-horsepower markets in North America rose 79% compared to a year ago, driven by higher demand from oil and gas and mining customers. Revenues for power generation grew by 6% due to higher demand in the data center and recreational vehicle markets. Our international revenues increased by 20% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 3% due to lower sales in on-highway markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 9% compared to a year ago. Our OEM partners under-produced relative to the market in the first quarter and our share dipped to 12% from 14%. We expect the first quarter to mark the low point for our market share with improvement expected in subsequent quarters. Industry sales of light-duty truck grew by 7% in the first quarter and our engine market share was 7%. Demand for excavators in the third quarter increased 48% from a year ago in China. Our market share increased by 3% to 13% driven by strong performance by our customers, including LiuGong and Hyundai (09:32). Revenues for our Power Systems business in China increased 57% due to growth in engine shipments to mining customers and higher demand for power generation equipment for data centers. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $581 million, an increase of 43% from the first quarter a year ago due to growth in on- and off-highway markets and strong sales of new products in our Components business. Industry truck production increased 18% year-over-year, driven by growing industrial activity and government investments to develop infrastructure. Our market share in the quarter was 42%, up 300 basis points compared to the same period last year, largely due to strong market acceptance of our engine system technology for the Bharat Stage IV emissions regulations introduced last year. Our penetration at Tata rose to 90% in the quarter with both Tata and Cummins benefiting from strong product performance relative to the competition. Power generation revenues also grew 6%. In Brazil, all revenues increased by 46%, primarily due to a moderately recovering economy, resulting in improved demand for trucks and compared to a weak 2017. Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2018 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are now forecasting total company revenues for 2018 to be up 10% to 14%, increasing our prior guidance of up 4% to 8%, reflecting a stronger outlook for truck production in North America, India and Brazil and increased demand from mining and oil and gas customers. We've raised our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 286,000 units, up 29% compared to 2017 and above our prior guidance of 266,000 units. We expect our market share to be between 31% and 34%, unchanged from our view last quarter. In the medium-duty truck market, we are maintaining our forecast for industry production to reach 124,000 units, up 5% year-over-year and we expect our market share to be in the range of 72% to 75%, also unchanged. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for the full year compared to a very strong 2017. In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 2% compared to our previous guidance of being down 5% in 2018. We have raised our outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand slightly to 1.2 million units from 1.15 million units, representing a 10% decline from 2017. In the light-duty truck market, we expect demand to be flat in 2018, in line with our previous guidance. We expect our market share in the medium- and heavy-duty truck market to be 14%. In the light-duty, we expect our share to be 8%, both up from first quarter levels. In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to be at least 20% year-over-year relative to our previous guidance of up 15%, due to stronger truck demand. In Brazil, we now forecast truck production to increase 9% in 2018, up from our previous forecast of no growth. We expect our global high-horsepower engine shipments to increase 30%, up from our previous forecast of 10% growth, reflecting strong demand from mining and oil and gas customers and rising demand for power generation equipment. In summary, we've more than doubled our sales growth outlook for the year to 10% to 14%. And excluding the charge for the product campaign, we revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 16.2% to 16.6%, reflecting a full year incremental EBITDA margin of 28%. Demand in several of our core markets is improving, our products are performing well and we are excited about the investments we are making for the future. During the quarter, we returned $341 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Pat.
Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the company's first quarter financial results before discussing the performance of the operating segments in more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the rest of the year. First quarter revenues were $5.6 billion, an increase of 21% from a year ago, and a quarterly record for the company. Sales increased in each of our operating segments primarily driven by stronger demand in global on-highway, construction, mining and oil and gas markets. Sales in North America, which represented 58% of our first quarter revenues, improved by 22% from a year ago, due to increased sales of engines and components to meet higher levels of heavy- and medium-duty truck production and an increase in demand for industrial engines. International sales improved by 20% from a year ago, primarily due to stronger demand in on-highway and industrial markets as well as benefiting from a weaker U.S. dollar. Gross margins were 21.5% of sales, down from 24.7% a year ago, primarily due to the product campaign charge that Tom referred to. The campaign charge negatively impacted our gross margin by 330 basis points. This offset the benefits realized from stronger volumes, favorable pricing, material cost reductions and our lower base warranty rate. Selling, admin and research and development costs of $787 million or 14.1% of sales decreased as a percent of sales by 130 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017. Joint venture income of $115 million increased by $7 million compared to last year. EBITDA was $700 million or 12.6% of sales for the quarter compared to $705 million or 15.4% of sales a year ago. EBITDA as a percent of sales declined primarily due to the campaign charge, which more than offset the positive impact of higher sales, favorable pricing and cost improvements referred to earlier. Excluding the charge, EBITDA was $887 million or 15.9% of sales in the quarter. Net earnings for the quarter were $325 million or $1.96 per diluted share, compared to $396 million or $2.36 from a year ago. In addition to the product campaign charge which lowered earnings per share by $0.87, first quarter earnings were negatively impacted by $78 million in discrete tax items or $0.45 per diluted share, most of which related to the tax reform bill passed back in December of 2017. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.9%. Excluding discrete tax items, the effective tax rate was 23%, in line with our full year guidance and down from 26.1% last year. Now moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize our performance in the quarter and then I will review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and conclude with some cash flow highlights. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% from last year due to the 20% increase in on-highway sales as well as from stronger demand for engines for construction equipment in China and in North America, which led to a 23% growth in off-highway revenues in the quarter. Segment EBITDA in the first quarter was $286 million or 11.7% of sales. This compares to $273 million or 13.5% a year ago. The campaign charge and investments in new products more than offset the benefits from higher volumes and lower base warranty expense. Excluding the campaign charge, EBITDA margins for Engine segment was 15.5% of sales. We now expect full year revenues to be up 10% to 14% compared to our previous guidance of up 4% to 8%, due to an improved outlook in most of our markets. Our forecast for EBITDA margins for the segment is in the range of 13.5% to 14% of sales, which does include the campaign charge booked in the first quarter and that compares to 14% to 14.5% previously. For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, an increase of 13% compared to last year. The growth in sales was primarily driven by stronger demand for both new engines and parts and service in North America, Europe and in China. The EBITDA margin for the quarter was $123 million or 6.6% of sales compared to 7.9% a year ago. The EBITDA percent declined due to lower earnings in Africa and in the Middle East as a result of weak demand and currency volatility and a lower mix of parts sales in North America. For the full year, Distribution revenue is projected to increase 6% to 10% compared to our previous guidance of up 2% to 6%, due to stronger off-highway demand for engines, parts and rebuilds. As Tom mentioned, we do expect profitability to improve in the second quarter and are forecasting full year EBITDA margins to be in the range of 7.75% to 8.25% of sales, unchanged from our previous guidance. For the Components segment, revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, a 30% increase from a year ago and a quarterly record. Excluding revenues from Eaton Cummins joint venture, sales were 22% higher than a year ago. Sales in North America increased by 35% due to higher heavy- and medium-duty truck production. International sales increased 25%, primarily due to growth in sales of aftertreatment sales in India. Segment EBITDA was $227 million or 12.9% of sales compared to $216 million or 16.1% last year. The benefits of higher sales, favorable material costs and strong operational performance were offset by the product campaign charge. Excluding the charge, EBITDA margins were 18.3% of sales in the quarter. For 2018, we now expect revenue to increase 18% to 22% compared to our prior guidance of up 8% to 12%. Strong demand in the North American truck market and in Europe are the key drivers behind the improved outlook. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 15.25% to 15.75% of sales which again includes the campaign charge booked in the first quarter and that compares to 15% to 15.5% in our previous forecast. In the Power Systems segment, first quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 22% from a year ago. Industrial sales grew by 51% driven by stronger mining and oil and gas demand. Power generation sales also increased by 9%. EBITDA margins were $142 million or 13.2% of sales in the quarter, up from $85 million or 9.6% last year, driven by the positive impact of stronger volumes, favorable material costs and higher joint venture earnings. For 2018, we now expect Power Systems segment revenues to increase 7% to 11% versus our prior guidance of up 4% to 8% as a result of stronger demand across industrial and power generation markets. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 13% and 13.5% of sales compared to our previous guidance of 12.25% to 12.75%. In the newly established Electrified Power segment, EBITDA losses were $10 million in line with our forecast. For the full year, we expect a net expense of between $60 million and $80 million in line with our previous guidance, as we are in a period of investment in new products. And for the company, we are raising our outlook as Tom said for revenues to be up 10% to 14% versus our previous guidance of up 4% to 8%. This increase is driven by higher levels of truck production in North America, increased demand for both engines, new engines and engine rebuilds for oil and gas and mining customers; and the appreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency tailwinds are expected to increase our revenues by approximately $300 million this year. Income from our joint ventures is now expected to decrease by 10% in 2018 compared to our previous guidance of down 15%. The improvements in guidance reflects stronger market demand in China and India than we had previously forecast. We expect EBITDA margins to be in the range of 15.4% to 15.8% for 2018, down from our previous forecast of 15.8% to 16.2%. Excluding the impact of the first quarter charge for the product campaign, full year EBITDA is expected to be in a range of 16.2% to 16.6%, reflecting a 28% incremental margin at the midpoint. Finally, turning to cash flow. Cash used in operating activities for the first quarter was $117 million due in part to higher working capital requirements associated with higher revenues as well as a payout of 2017 variable compensation. We anticipate operating cash flow in 2018 will be within our long-term guidance of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $72 million and we continue to expect our investments will be in the range of $730 million to $760 million for the full year. For the first quarter, we returned $341 million to shareholders through dividends and from the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares. For 2018, we continue to plan to return at least 50% of our operating cash flow to our shareholders, which is in line with our previous guidance. Now let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Pat. We're ready to turn to the Q&A section of the call.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I'm wondering if you could talk about the size of the field population that's impacted by the field campaign, the cost per repair. And obviously, you've been leveraging the technology platform across markets and emission standards. Can you talk about if there's any other potential applications that could be impacted by the field campaigns that you're doing now? Can you just frame that for us?
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Okay. Hey, Jerry, this is Rich. Let me – couple of things here. You've got a few questions in there. So first, the piece we're looking at is a component on the aftertreatment system that we used only in North America. It was for engines 2010 through 2015, predominantly 2010 through 2012, okay, as we phased that product out beginning in 2013. What we've done is we've looked at the entire population over that, so it's a fixed amount of what the population is. And what we proposed here to the agencies and what we've recorded in $187 million is a combination of, in some cases, no action that these products are going to be fine; in some cases, a software fix; and, in some cases, a hardware fix, okay. So, that's what the charge is related to. Of course, we'll have to get approval from the agencies on this. The discussions are collaborative and good with the agencies. It does not affect any other products anywhere else in North America or any other part of the world. This is a very specific component that was used that is under evaluation right now.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then, separately, yeah, it sounds like within Power Systems, you're seeing an inflection in orders, within power generation for the first time, probably five or so years. Can you just give us some context on which applications for power gen that you're seeing the most momentum, which markets? And can you just give us a sense for how much visibility you have based on the order cadence so far this year?
Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Hey, Jerry, it's Mark. So we've seen an improvement in most parts of the world, except the Middle East which remains patchy. I would say the common theme across the regions is strong demand from data centers and then it varies by segment. But generally, a steady increase across those markets, and that's the third straight quarter of year-over-year increase. So, not – you know, it's not extraordinary acceleration, but it feels like we've got some momentum. Typically, we have an order board that runs multiple quarters, but, obviously, high confidence in the next 90 days.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And, Mark, just a clarification, it sounds like that order board has built in terms of the visibility, is that...
Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Yes.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ...am I parsing the comments correctly?
Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: You are. Yes.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to return to Jerry's question. I'm trying to assess the customer dissatisfaction risk related to the field campaign. Could you help us with the failure mode? Is it purely emissions falling out of compliance? Or are there any, what I'll call, operational performance degradation, like, seem to occur in the light vehicle campaign a few years ago?
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Okay, yes. So as far as performance either what the customer feels on productivity of the vehicle or fuel economy, there's no impact there. So it's purely an emissions issue, kind of late life emissions beyond even the warranty of the product that as the product degrade. So the impact on customers will be, like I said, in some cases, nothing. In some cases, we'll bring it in and do a calibration. In some cases, we'll bring it in and change the hardware out, and it'll be a voluntary recall.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you, Rich. And then within – we're all trying to figure out if the charge may get closer to $400 million and I'm sure you're not going to talk about that, given the discussions with the regulatory agencies. But, could you talk about the failure rate that you're observing in the field? I mean, is this pretty widespread, or is it at this point concentrated?
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Yes. I mean, what we know is what we're saying right now is the population that we've got today. So anything else, I'd be really speculating on. What I will say is we're driven to resolve this thing over the next two quarters and so we'll work with agencies and we'll get a final answer to this and kind of get this thing behind us.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: I think, Andy, just from my point of view too – this is Tom talking by the way – we wanted to make sure that the investors could at least put a box around what we think the total size could be. We have taken – as we have to, we had taken the accrual for what we think is the best estimate for what it will cost us across all this work. But because the agencies have the right to ask us to do other things, we have to be and we will have to respond to that. We want to make sure that investors could – after some quarters of uncertainty which is not terrific, we want to make sure these people could put a box around it. Again, we are very – we think our plan is a good one. That's why we're proposing it and we intend to take care of customers as well as take care of the environment. That's kind of our commitment to both. So, we're acting proactively on that both. Again, just to try to make sure everyone had a box to put it in, and again we are working really aggressively and we expect to be through these discussions relatively quickly in the six months or less. So hopefully, we'll have it – we'll have all of it behind us. But again, it's not – we are now at a spot where we are confident we can address this problem proactively, it will have minimal impact on customers and our products are performing well in the field. It's not going to impact the company's future or our ability to carry out our strategy plans, so, that's – we're feeling good about that.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then just to dot the I, does the $400 million include the $29 million from Q3?
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: No, the $400 million is not trying to sum up everything in the past, it's trying to say here is the maximum exposure that we could see in a worst case for what our actions going forward.
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: In addition to what we booked.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yes.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, it's in addition to the $187 million.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: So the $187 million is what we've already booked and the old ones we've already booked. And we're saying this is the maximum future exposure in addition to what we booked in this quarter and previous quarters.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Good morning, Jamie.
Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I've got a few questions. Hello. Tom, the product campaign cost, how do you guys think about this in the context of how it impacts incentive compensation for you guys? Are you guys excluding this? Do we include this? And then my second question, a lot of other industrial companies have talked about supplier constraints, higher freight constraints, labor constraints. Can you talk about to what degree this is impacting your customers or yourself? And how much that's constraining demand if at all? And how that sort of impacts your thoughts on 2019 as the market is concerned about sort of achieving the peak in 2018? Thanks.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, Jamie. I'll let Rich take the second one. I'll take the first one. So this charge along with all similar charges related to quality of our products, we take directly against our variable comp. So our view is our management and our people are responsible for producing quality products. When we have to take a charge against our quality, we take the hit in our bonus and other plans. So we will take this – this accrual we took this quarter and previous ones all account against us in both our one-year compensation plans as well as our three-year compensation plans.
Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: And Jamie, this is Rich. Then, on the constraints, we're certainly seeing all the constraints that you read about and everyone else sees. But what we are – I think we're positioned right now, we talked about over sometime our supply base is pretty flexible. And we're actually seeing, we're seeing some evidence of it today that if things have ramped up, we are ramping up a little better than other folks. It's actually an opportunity to pick up share. So, we're seeing some small bits of this. We are paying some incremental premium freight; those type of things, like everyone else is paying there. But so far so good. So nothing has caused us to increase lead times, put product on allocation, et cetera.
Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then to what degree, does that impact your sales (34:06) in 2019? Just as the markets concerned about, the markets are too good, we're getting overheated. Where does this impact to some degree (34:14) the cycle?
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: To be determined. I'd say the nice thing that we are seeing is we get the ramp up and we're seeing the back orders go up, we look particularly in North America. The underlying fundamentals are pretty good though, as to what freight – how freight is doing, what rates are doing, which we're all seeing, and we're seeing in some of those, but the underlying fundamentals look pretty good right now kind of supporting that increase in demand.
Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, Jamie.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks. Maybe a follow-up to that. I mean, I think certainly price cost trade-off has been kind of a key theme of earnings for the industrials so far this quarter. And if we just strip out the warranty charge, it looks like you may be expecting slightly lower incremental margins than before. Can you talk about how you are managing your cost input inflation?
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Noah, this is Tom. It's a great question. As you said, price cost is really the struggle for industrial companies, but I think we're in really good position on that. We are now as we showed in this forecast, we're expecting quite significant improvement in incremental margins. So, again, we think we're doing well there. We mentioned as we came into this year that we're going to have – we have benefits on warranty. The warranty rates this year relative to last year are improving. We've got strong incremental margins in our plants in both the Power Systems business and the Engine business. And you saw a very strong in the Components already. So we feel like we're not only doing well in incremental margins, but they're getting better as the year goes on both because we're able to get some pricing and we're moving costs down. So that – so we're feeling pretty good about that. Again, one way you might want to think about our incremental margins is to again even taking out the product campaign, if you also look at the costs associated with the Eaton Cummins joint venture and the new electrification view which are sort of long-term investments, if you take those out, you get a like-for-like comparison on an incremental margins across the years. And I think, again, you'll find not only was Q1 good, but the rest of the year looks very strong relative to Q1.
Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And actually anticipating my next question. If you could touch on some of those newer growth initiatives, it looks like you've increased your Eaton JV contribution expectations for the year. Our checks are saying AMT adoption is going quite well. Looks like you lowered electric revenue contribution a little bit for the year, again up a very small base, but could you give us a little bit of color on how you see both of those initiatives proceeding?
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Sure. I'll comment a little bit on electrification and let maybe Rich talk about Eaton Cummins and AMT. So on electrification, as you said, we did touchdown revenue a little bit. That just reflects basically the rate of new product introduction acceptance as very low level. Our programs are still going well. We're just very early days. And really the big launch has come sort at the end of next year. We'll see some – that's where our new electrified powertrain gets launched in the buses. And so – but we're feeling really good about where we stand. We've got small products going into forklifts. We've got these bigger powertrains going into buses. We're clearly – we're talking to nearly every customer out there about Electrified Power in some way. So our position from a few years ago where we have a lot of work in the lab and a lot of really good ideas to where we've got a pretty significant position now on the market in terms of what we're planning to offer and we're working with I think has been a really good change and really good transition. Now, of course, we've got to launch the products and see success in them. So, that's our big focus over the next two years or 1 1/2 years. So Rich, let me – this is to you.
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah. So on the Eaton joint venture, just a couple of numbers. So the AMT you asked about the transition, we're up to 73% now. So, that's coming along as we thought potentially little higher. Our market share is where we thought it would be. So the Cummins/Eaton joint venture market share is good. The transition has gone quite well. So the cultures anytime you're merging two things together, there's some risk. You just come together really well. The culture has been good, the team work is good and so really so far so good. The sales forecast, so last year $163 million will be over $450 million this year in revenues out of the joint venture.
Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning. First, on the mining side, I think last quarter you were looking for up about 10%, that's moved higher, but any context around how much higher you think mining is at this point? And then if you could talk specifically to equipment side of things versus parts side of things, and regionally where you're seeing some of the activity pick up?
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Okay. I'll take a first shot at this Mark, and make sure you get the numbers right. I think, right now, we're projecting 30% up on mining for revenues. So, improved from where we were last quarter. We pay attention to what utilization is, so what is – how is equipment really being utilized and we're seeing that continue to increase, which helps drive parts demand and rebuild activity, primarily the activity, the biggest increases are in North America and China, which wouldn't surprise you on that. Mark, anything you would add to that?
Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: No, just Q1 probably was the easiest comp of the year. We were up about 48%, (40:22) good, and we're seeing good growth in new engines and parts, that strengthened a little bit since the start of the year.
Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then some interesting news yesterday with the launch of a new transmission into frac rigs and just kind of a timeline for how long it'll take for you to get enough experience on the ground with that transmission for the expectation that you get some decent customer adoption? And then just a clarification on whether that's just a pair with Cummins' engines or whether that could be paired with competitor engines as well?
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: I think that's principally to be paired with Cummins engines at this point in time, yeah.
Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And I guess maybe just one more then. You're talking about market share and seeing opportunities for gains and maybe being a little bit more agile in terms of response to supply chain tightness. You're not really calling for increases in market share in medium-duty. It doesn't look like increasing market share in engines in North America heavy-duty. So should we just think about that may be now favors the high end of the range or a little bit of conservatism there?
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: I think primarily in the high end of the range, we bounced back pretty well. In fact, we've seen some share gains in surface mining whether it's only attributable to the ramp up. Again, we're keeping our lead times low in all of our high-horsepower markets. We're down in the eight-week range, which is good, which is better than the competition at this time.
Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is now open.
Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research: Thanks. Good morning. Wondering if you could talk about how the warranty issue might affect your thinking or execution of anything strategic that you've been thinking about. It seems like it will be a cash out the door issue at some point. But maybe it doesn't dramatically alter your balance sheet on what you might do, but just curious how you're thinking about that?
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Steve. Yeah, it hasn't really changed our strategic thinking. As you say, the cash flow and balance sheet is manageable. That's a little bit why we wanted to make sure we put a box around even the worst case. And again, we have a clear view about what we want to do, but we want to make sure everyone saw the worst case, it goes out over two or three years. We feel very, very good about where our strategic position is. But again, the way that we've been thinking about this, we talked about in previous quarters that the complexity of the systems that we're offering is pretty high and the quality tools that we're using have – needed to get more sophisticated as a result. So we've been making significant investments using analytics and other things to get a better system view of the quality of our products which we think is reflected in the products we're launching today and we'll continue to enhance those quality tools as we go forward. And again from the strategy point of view, it's difficult. We feel frustrated and disappointed, obviously, with the cost of this quality campaign. But again, we are pushing on the cutting edge of offering systems that meet emissions – very, very stringent emissions targets, have very, very good – strong fuel economy and high levels of performance at the very edge of technology. And I think part of what we're trying to do is make sure that we stay at the edge there while improving our quality costs. And that's the tough deal, I mean, that's not going to be easy and that's why a lot of people aren't going to make the journey. And we think by getting better in those capabilities, we can stay in it and make good returns for our shareholders by getting better at the sort of executions, small details of being there at that edge of technology. So, that's the way we're thinking about it strategically. And the harder the challenge, the less people want to do it. And so from a strategy point of view, that's a good thing as long as we can make – continue to improve how our system quality goes out the door and how customers experience our products.
Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.: And, Steve, and we expect – I think I said this in my remarks, but we expect another very, very strong year in terms of the free cash flow we generate through our operations. So as Tom said, this will have no impact at all on what we're going to do from a strategic perspective.
Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research: Okay. So just to follow up on the M&A angle here. How are you finding the competition for deals at the moment and how does it vary depending on size of the deals that you maybe looking at?
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah. As you guess, there is still competition for M&A today. There's some players in the market, valuations are still relatively high. Money, while getting a little bit more expensive, it's still pretty cheap. So there's no question that the cost of acquisitions still, especially if we were going to maintain the ROIC discipline that we intend to, that's going to play into it. We're going to have to be thoughtful about how that goes and that remains a challenge. But again, we continue to think about our strategy first. Where do we think Cummins can bring our capabilities into a new market and adjacent market and using capabilities we already have and leveraging them so that we can – whatever we acquire or joint venture with, we can add value to it, so that we can pay for the acquisition price as well as trying to get an attractive one. And that of course limits the field, right? That means there's only so many things that are going to work and we are making sure that we maintain patience with that. We are looking a lot of things, though. There are things to look at that are pretty interesting. And so, we're just trying to put those together. I feel better about it now than I have in the past. I mean, it was – the prices, while still high, are not nearly as bad as when we started looking at them. So I'm optimistic that they're beginning to come into the range where we think we could make it work.
Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research: Great. Thanks, guys.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, guys. I had a couple of questions I guess on the lighter-duty side of the on-highway business. First of all, in Europe, I'm wondering the extent to which you think you can pick up any business from OEMs that you maybe historically had struggled to do business with because of Dieselgate or any of the other stigma associated with diesel engines in general.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks for that question, Alex. So I would say that, we do believe that kind of to fall into Steve's question that indeed many of our customers are looking forward at the market and saying where do they want to place their investments strategically? Do they want – they've got a lot of challenges in front of them, autonomous vehicles, electrified vehicles, all of the investments they need to make for just the truck – making the truck work, telematics, you name it. And then, now with the challenges for diesels in some of the European cities, they are asking themselves how much investment do I want to make? In the light-duty side, it's the most challenged. It's one that have the most likely substitution from electrified powertrains. So again, each investment they make there, they're wondering how many more diesels they're going to sell. So if we have a product that's relevant to what they are trying to do, they're much more likely to buy from us than do it themselves these days than they were, say, 10 years ago. So we believe that this is a trend that will continue where OEMs will continue to wonder how many more investments, how many more platforms in the light-duty space and even in the medium-duty space, do I really want to make given I could buy this from Cummins, and I would, therefore, not have to make that investment and I can focus on my vehicle instead. So again, we'll see how it goes, but we are talking to a lot of people about that and more people than we are talking to for sure five or 10 years ago.
Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. I guess one maybe follow-up on that. You mentioned medium-duty. That market I know is – clearly, the cyclicality is less violent than it is in Class 8, but that market just seems to continually march higher and higher and higher. I'm wondering the extent to which you think there's been a structural change to the way that type of functions to the extent you can even call it a cycle. Or if you think it's a secular story there as a result of last mile and some of the changes that are occurring to the way the freight markets function in general? Thanks.
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Yes. Alex, so I'm not sure we know the answer to that. But it does appear, it has been less cyclical, it has been steadily growing, okay? And so our view is all the underlying cases I wouldn't want to speak – I wouldn't be able to speak to. But I do think it feels pretty sustained and it's tied to more than just the on-highways, it's tied to the construction market, infrastructure being invested in around the world. And so it does seem to have a more staying power and we're kind of reflecting that now, plus cyclicality more staying power. Has there been a fundamental step up I guess is still to be determined.
Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: Thanks. Your discussion on the EPA/CARB issue is fairly clear and thanks for bounding the lower end as well. Could you just give a more general overview of how you approach quality as the issues popped up over the last year and you mentioned a renewed focus? Have you changed monitoring or proactive looking at stuff? And do you feel that there's a less of a chance of future issues popping up as a result of what you're seeing? And how is your quality trending in general? Thanks.
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. Thanks for the question. As you could imagine, while this is – there's a specific cause here. We're using this as a call to action. So how do we make some incremental improvements on where we are now or even step function improvements where we are? So we are investing heavier in analytics, in modeling, in looking at all of our processes to drive improvement. We've been in the kind of the low-2% range for some time, okay. With warranty periods being extended, more expectations, we've maintained kind of that 2% to 2.5%. And so, we're doing a couple of things. One is, we're putting actions in place to how this would never ever, ever happen again, okay, the modeling. And so, we've got those in place, but we're also saying, let's bring an outside look in and say use this as a call to action to how do we drive this down over the next five years to a much lower number. And I think you know our track record and when we put our resources and put our efforts towards achieving (52:01) our track record and delivering, that's pretty darn good. And so, this one's getting a lot of attention as you can imagine, even though the one case is somewhat isolated.
Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.: And then just as a follow-up to that Rob, you recall last year (52:16), were around 3.1%, 3.2% of sales and we (52:21) drive that lower. We did see that in Q1, Q1 is right around 2.4% and we're still pretty consistent with the previous guidance and the full year forecast of 2.4% for the full year. So to Rich's point, we are making progress with the base one there.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: Great. Thanks to both of you.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. This is (52:49) on for Ann. All my questions have been answered. Thanks.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO. Your line is now open.
Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, guys. How is it going?
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Hi, Joel.
Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just can you give a little more granularity on China? It seems like most people were expecting it to be down this year and it's surprised to the upside in the first half and I think people are a little cautious about how the second half is going to flow and you guys have a great lot of feet on the ground there.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah. Joel, I think, we would agree with that caution. I think, we just look at the truck equipment purchases versus what we perceive trucking to be – growth rates to be doing and freight rates and everything. It just doesn't seem like the same rate of growth from the previous year can hold. So, that's why we sort of forecasted it tipping over and heading down. A couple of things that have driven a little stronger truck performance in the first quarter was more construction, which, of course, we saw in the excavator numbers. So dumper sales increased a lot, which is again one of the reasons that our OEMs kind of under-produced relative to the market. That's not their big segment, the dumper market. Those tend to be bigger displacement engines and older technology. But nonetheless, those sales were really quite good in the first quarter, the dumper sales, so again, which is towards construction market. So I think what we're seeing in China is, yes, there is the equipment being purchased for just on-highway trucking is likely to level out or head down. At least that's our expectation, we'll see what happens, but that's our expectation, but this construction market is definitely buoying the market. It's better than we expected and it's great news. I mean, we're seeing much – a lot of good demand for construction engines as well and these off-highway kind of dumper sort of truck engines.
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Just to put a number on that. So, on the off-highway, we're projecting an 8% increase. We're now saying 20% to 25%, which is what we said first quarter because that felt more sustained and less cyclical than what was going on in the truck market. And both of those seem to be playing out a little bit.
Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And maybe second, just maybe a little bit of a delicate question. But in terms of the rail business, obviously, the industry consolidation, it's not really happening or maybe it is a little bit. But I just wondered if you could talk about how you feel that like you are positioned in that market. And do you feel like you have the product lineup and kind of your toe in the water there enough to continue to gain share and really compete effectively in that market? Thank you. I'm done after that.
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Joel, thanks for that question. Not delicate, it's fine. We're pretty small in the rail market overall. If you just kind of think about rail globally, we're pretty small player and we have participated essentially in the diesel part of the rail rather than the diesel electric side, which was driving from much larger engines and again that trend has continued. So we have had a segment that we participate in. Now the introduction of the Hedgehog engines got us into more of that. But still we're really just getting into it. And I think what's helped us get a little bit of a toehold there has been the fact that we were ready with our tier four engines before other people and I think our solution is better. It's a better long-term total cost of ownership and so we have a bit of an advantage. We don't have the same advantage of being a large player already in the market. Everybody knows our product, and, therefore, a long history. So I still think – while we're excited about it because it's incrementally larger for us, it's still a small piece of the market. And I think if we don't add more products to our portfolio, that's kind of where we'll play sort of on the edge of the market, trying to grow our position with the business we have, but not a big player in the overall scheme of things globally.
Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you.
Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mark Smith for any closing remarks.
Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.: Hi, this is Tom Linebarger. Thanks for that. I just want to make a couple concluding remarks, especially given the fact that we did finally be able to put a box around that product campaign. And obviously, we're really disappointed about the financial exposure and we know that it's not the first one we've done the last two years, it's been a series of them. And again, as you'd guessed that, we feel disappointed and personally accountable for that. And we are, as we talked about in the call, working really hard to make sure that we do not see a repeat of that, and, of course, that's what we think the core of our business is. The good news looking forward though is we do have a box around this. We do have a proposed plan. We will get the full plan resolved in the next six months or something like that. And it's not going to impact either the long-term performance of the company or our strategy so – and it's not impacting customers today. Customers today are experiencing great quality, good performing engines, and continue to see Cummins as the technology of choice. We've raised our outlook for this year. Again, it'll be a second terrific year for the company. Our sales growth forecast is now doubled. Our incremental margins are strong. Our businesses are performing well. We had -three of our four had terrific incremental margins in Q1. The DBU, while not as good, will see much improved margins in the next three quarters. So we feel like we are in a really good position to generate strong cash flows and strong earnings this year and our strategy's right on track. So I just want to make sure that everyone knew that about where we feel about where the company is as we feel like we're moving right towards strength here and we're very optimistic about this year. And we're going to get this emissions issue behind us and customers are still going to see Cummins as the technology of choice. Thanks very much.
Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.: Thanks, everybody. We'll be available for questions later. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2017 Meritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.
Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we are recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Carl, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 3 for a look at the quarter. Kevin will take you through the full-year analysis later in the presentation. Our revenue in the quarter was $922 million, up 27% from the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher production in all regions and the traction we're getting with new business wins. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $98 million compared to $74 million in the same period last year. Margin in the fourth quarter was $10.6%, an increase of 40 basis points. While we've had good margin performance in past quarters, our margin this quarter reflects the benefit of the higher volumes and our continued excellent operational performance. The majority of the margin improvement was driven by conversion in our Commercial Truck & Industrial business where our margin expanded 280 basis points to 10%. We converted around 18% on incremental sales of $187 million in this business, with tremendous delivery and quality performance across the board. You may remember that we also demonstrated near-perfect execution in the strong markets of 2015. This speaks to the sustained level of operational excellence that has now become a competitive differentiator for Meritor. Adjusted income from continuing operations in the quarter was $56 million for the total company or $0.62 of adjusted diluted earnings per share, nearly double from the same period last year. Across the company, we have put a tremendous effort into ensuring that we deliver sustained improvement in our financial results, and we take pride in the fact that we are consistently meeting or exceeding our commitments to shareholders. We intend to continue that trend. Let's go to slide 4 for a brief update on progress towards our M2019 objectives. We will provide more detail at our upcoming analyst event in New York in December. As you know, our three M2019 financial targets are: to grow revenue by 20% above the market; increase EPS by $1.25 or 80% to $2.84, and achieve a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 1.5 times. As we scorecard ourselves against those targets, here is where we are, keeping in mind that our jump-off point was the end of fiscal year 2015, so we are now halfway through the M2019 cycle. We have earned more than 6% towards our revenue target of 20% outperformance. And if you look at what we've won in total, we are really more than 14% toward our goal, but still have work to do to get all of those wins fully into the P&L. We remain confident in reaching 20% outperformance and will provide more visibility on those opportunities in December. In terms of improving profit, we've earned $0.29 toward our objective of increasing EPS by $1.25 on our path towards $2.84. In addition to our strong performance contributing to this metric, we amended certain retiree medical benefits in the fourth quarter that we expect will reduce this expense by approximately $39 million annually. That should provide a tailwind to our EPS as we look ahead. For capital allocation, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times. However, on a pro forma basis, for the Meritor WABCO divestiture, we are at 2.1 times. With two years left in the plan, we believe we are on track to achieve all three objectives. In fiscal year 2017, we took the opportunity to initiate and complete several strategic actions, all of which we believe will contribute to success of M2019. I'll talk more about those in a few moments. Additional highlights from the year that position us as a market leader include receiving Navistar's Diamond Supplier Award, Ashok Leyland's first ever Gold Delivery Award, and excellent supplier recognition from XCMG and eight quality awards from major customers, six of which were from Daimler. We also developed electric drive axles and suspensions that we believe will position us as a leader in electric solutions for the commercial vehicle market; launched a new value brand called Mach that features all-makes products engineered to industry standards at affordable prices for our aftermarket customers; established a West Coast aftermarket distribution center in California that will enable us to fulfill aftermarket orders to customers in 24 hours or less; and achieved a safety rate of 0.48 injuries per 200,000 hours worked. Our target for M2019 is to achieve a rate of less than 0.65, which we beat this year. The safety of Meritor employees are top priority. And even though we believe this incident rate positions us among the best industrial companies in the world, we will continue to work with our employees toward even further improvement. On slide 5, you'll see eight products we've launched in fiscal 2017. This year's launch cycle included axles for truck and trailers, front and rear, medium and heavy, and on and off highway vehicles. We believe this aggressive launch cycle ensures we can offer our customers the broadest and deepest range of products in the industry. Meritor's robust product portfolio is a key element to winning incremental business and growing our top line at the pace we have committed to under M2019. Slide 6 represents some of the new business we were awarded in fiscal year 2017 with major truck, trailer, bus and coach, specialty and defense customers in several major regions of the world. We earned new axle business with Volvo Thailand and Volvo Eicher, as well as a new contract from Tata's Ultra trucks. We're now supplying JAC Motors and Qingling with our dual light family of products in China. We developed a tandem axle with hub reduction for a major customer outside of North America that will be used on a new series of construction vehicles. We have a new axle contract with Kenworth for our heavy haul customer in the Middle East and with Navistar Defense for its MaxxPro recovery vehicle program, as well as a contract to supply transfer cases for the new GM and Navistar Class 4 and 5 medium-duty truck. We also have standard axle position with Heil Trailer on its chemical trailer line. As important as these new business wins are to us, we recognize the importance of maintaining and growing the relationships we have with our long-term strategic customers, all of whom we continue to collaborate with on new opportunities for today and tomorrow. In that regard, we're excited to announce that we have extended our long-term European axle contract with Volvo through 2024. During the term of this contract, we will perform a technical upgrade to our axle offering that incorporates higher efficiency and higher gross combination weight capabilities. On slide 7, you'll see more detail on our acquisition of the product portfolio and related technologies Fabco Holdings and its subsidiaries. With this suite of products, particularly the addition of transfer cases and gearboxes, we now have an expanded portfolio of complementary products for medium, heavy and extra-heavy vehicles for on and off-highway, construction, defense, rail, and other industrial applications for both OE and aftermarket customers. This transaction allows us to offer global customers a wider breadth of capabilities and will help us diversify and expand into the rail and oil and gas industries. We expect this transaction to generate approximately $50 million of incremental revenue in fiscal year 2019. Let's turn to slide 8. Also in fiscal year 2017, we closed the sale of our interest in the Meritor WABCO joint venture for a total purchase price of $250 million, and also received the final partner earnings distribution of $8 million just prior to closing. We believe this transaction allows us to further sharpen our focus on the strategic priorities of M2019 and beyond. We will also remain the exclusive distributor of certain WABCO aftermarket products in the United States and Canada and a distributor in Mexico through an aftermarket distribution agreement. Either party can terminate these distribution arrangements at certain points during the first three and a half years at an exercise price between $225 million and $265 million based on the earnings of the business. In the end, we believe this was a good transaction for the company and our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on our financials.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I'll review our full-year financial results and then I'll provide you with an initial look at our 2018 guidance. Overall, we had an excellent year of financial performance as we expanded adjusted EPS by 15%, drove revenue growth of approximately 5% and generated $81 million of free cash flow. We also significantly improved the balance sheet as we reduced our total debt and retirement liabilities by more than $600 million. As a result, we now have positive book equity for the first time since 2008. With this strong performance and improved capital structure, we are well-positioned to deliver on M2019 financial commitments and to continue driving value for our shareholders. Let's turn to slide 9 where you'll see our full-year financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were up $148 million from last year on higher production in Europe, China and South America. But more importantly, we increased revenue from new business wins coming online. These factors more than offset the 6% decline in Class A truck production in North America during the fiscal year. We expanded gross margin by 90 basis points as we converted on incremental revenue while also continuing to achieve strong material, labor, and burden performance that more than offset the impact of higher net steel costs. You can really see the impact of this performance in the line item Volume, Mix, Performance & Other on the right side of the chart, as we have $59 million of higher adjusted EBITDA on $139 million of higher revenue. Embedded within this line item is approximately $26 million of steel headwind so you can get an idea of the strength of our conversion and operating performance. As we have discussed during the last couple of quarters, we did have a $16 million unfavorable year-over-year impact from two discrete items. First, we had a one-time unfavorable $10 million settlement with our joint venture partner in Mexico in 2017 related to disputes between the parties. And in 2016, we had a favorable supplier litigation settlement of $6 million that did not repeat. Next, you'll see the foreign exchange with a slight tailwind to revenue in 2017. The EBITDA impact from foreign exchange was a $12 million benefit on a year-over-year basis. This favorability was primarily driven by hedged mark-to-market gains this year and a corresponding hedge loss a year ago. All of these transactions were executed as part of our hedging program to mitigate the risk from currently fluctuations. Moving down the (15:18), you can see that SG&A, excluding the various litigation settlements, increased by $35 million this year. Due to strong financial performance in 2017, our variable compensation expense was $21 million higher than in 2016. In addition, we have $15 million in higher asbestos expense this year. This was driven by the favorable insurance settlements related to asbestos we executed in 2016 which did not repeat. These were the two main drivers of our higher SG&A expense in 2017. As we look ahead to 2018, we do expect to see more normalized incentive compensation accruals. However, we are starting to strategically add head count and other investment in support of our M2019 revenue growth initiatives. So, while you will see a step-down in SG&A for incentive compensation, it will be partially offset by this increased investment going forward. These items provide the walk from an adjusted EBITDA of $327 million a year ago to $347 million this year, which resulted in our reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.4%. This also allowed us to drive adjusted income from continuing operations of $170 million or $1.88 per share, which is an increase of $0.24 per share from last year. We did see a relatively low effective tax rate of 5% in 2017 due to several favorable tax items in the year. That rate is lower than what you should expect going forward. Slide 10 details full-year sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales for full-year 2017 were just over $2.6 billion, up 7% from last year, driven by nearly $100 million in new business wins that were in the P&L as well as stronger end markets. Europe and Brazil truck production levels are up approximately 5% and 20%, respectively. While in China, our revenue increased by more than $40 million due to a stronger off-highway market. In India, we expanded revenue by $30 million even as truck production was down 9% in the fiscal year. During the year, we benefited from one of our largest customers gaining market share, and we increased our share with that customer as well. Finally, in North America, Class A truck production declined 6%, but our revenue was roughly flat due to the impact of our new business wins. Segment-adjusted EBITDA was $244 million, up $36 million or 17% from last year. Segment-adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Industrial came in at 9.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from a year ago. The margin improvement was driven by conversion on the higher revenue and continued material, labor and burden performance, partially offset by higher net steel costs and higher variable compensation accruals. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $853 million, down $7 million from last year. Our aftermarket business was up slightly in 2017. However, this was more than offset by lower production in the trailer market. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $106 million, down $9 million compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 12.4% compared to 13.4% in the same period a year ago. The decrease in margin was driven by the $6 million prior-year supplier litigation recovery I referenced earlier, as well as higher variable compensation accruals. Turning to slide 11, I wanted to provide more detail on a couple of important items we announced in the fourth quarter. In September, we received a favorable court ruling that dissolved the 2006 injunction previously barring the company from making healthcare benefit changes to certain retirees. As a result, we announced our intention to modify these benefits, which was the primary contributor to the $343 million reduction in our OPEB liability at year-end. We expect our retiree medical expense to improve by $39 million going forward from $24 million of expense to $15 million of income in 2018. Additionally, we expect to see a $13 million reduction in corresponding cash payments in 2018. On the right side of the chart, I wanted to highlight the convertible debt transactions we executed. We funded the repurchase of $236 million of convertible notes with a new $325 million convertible note issuance and with $93 million of cash on hand. The new security was issued with a 3.25% coupon and a 60% conversion premium, which pegged the conversion price at nearly $40 per share. As a result of these transactions, we were able to lower interest expense by $3 million annually, eliminate more than 5 million shares of dilution at today's stock price, and extend the debt maturity profile such that there are no significant bond maturities until 2024. Next, I'll review our fiscal year 2018 market outlook on slide 12. Building on strong fourth quarter production, combined with an improving freight environment, we are planning for higher Class A truck volumes in 2018. As you know, October can be a bellwether month for truck orders, and this year, the orders came in at more than 36,000 trucks. As a result, we are projecting North America Class A production of 260,000 to 280,000 units in 2018, up 10% to 18% from 2017 levels. We also believe the medium-duty market will be between 230,000 to 250,000 units in 2018, similar to last year. As we look overseas, Europe should be relatively stable in 2018 as economic indicators continue to show solid freight fundamentals. Looking to Asia, we expect the market in China to be roughly flat on a year-over-year basis and, in India, we are seeing some moderate growth in our end markets. Finally, our outlook for Brazil is that the market will be up slightly. Market optimism appears to be returning and GDP is expected to be positive for the second year in a row. Based on these demand assumptions, you can see how that translates to our fiscal year 2018 outlook, which is summarized on slide 13. We expect sales to be between $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion, up 8% to 11% compared to 2017. Higher class A truck volumes in North America coupled with new business wins are expected to drive a meaningful step up in revenue for us. We are forecasting that our adjusted EBITDA margin will expand again in 2018 to a range of 10.8% to 11.0%. There are several components that drive our margin expectations for next year. On the positive side, we expect margin expansion related to the $39 million improvement in retiree medical expense and from normal conversion on higher revenue. Partially offsetting this are the $27 million of lower earnings resulting from the sale of our interest in the former Meritor WABCO joint venture as well as the planned increase in SG&A and engineering investment to support our M2019 revenue growth initiatives. We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to increase to a range of $2.20 to $2.40, a meaningful step-up from last year. Included in this guidance is our expectation that we will return to a more normalized effective adjusted tax rate of approximately 15%. In part, that's because we are expecting to generate cash tax expense in certain European jurisdictions where we have now fully utilized our net operating loss carry-forwards. And finally, we anticipate generating free cash flow of approximately $90 million to $100 million. This is even after investing another $100 million of CapEx in 2018 in support of our M2019 growth and operational performance initiatives and investing in working capital to support the $250 million to $350 million in revenue growth. Overall, you can see that our 2018 guidance suggests continued improvement in the financial performance of the company as we drive toward achievement of our M2019 targets. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay for closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. Let's go to slide 14. On December 7, we'll host an Analyst Day event in New York. At that time, we look forward to a more detailed discussions with you about M2019 and our financial outlook. We hope you will be able to join us. Also, before I close, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the excellent work by our global leadership team and the efforts of every Meritor employee over the past year. The alignment and dedication of our 8,200 employees is reflected in the results we shared with you today and the noteworthy transformation of the company over the past several years. So to our employees and to the investment community, Run With The Bull. Now, we'll take your questions.
Operator: And our first question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Good morning.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Good morning.
Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC: The first question, I guess, is just on the Aftermarket & Trailer business, which kind of gets a little bit less attention. I know you had a tough comp in the quarter with the insurance settlement last year, but I guess what I want to better understand is sort of really for the year, what happens? I think early in the year, you were talking about sort of a 14% target. It obviously came in below. And I guess, more importantly, how we should think about that segment heading into 2018.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yes. Good question, Joe. I mean, we continue to expect that this is a business that will operate north of 14% margin. So that's the start point. Obviously, we came in at only 12.4% for the year. Now, one of the big headwinds that the aftermarket business face is because of the total company performance for the year, we outperformed relative to our incentive compensation plans. So there is about $7 million, $8 million of allocation of variable compensation accrual to that segment which drove the margin down about a point versus what we would normally expect. So as we jump into 2018, we would expect with normalized incentive compensation accruals to already be a point higher than that. The rest of the gap between call it low to mid-13%s and getting to north of 14% where we expect really comes from revenue growth. As part of M2019, we're driving new business wins into that business, as well as many other businesses, and we contribute at a pretty healthy rate in aftermarket because it is a scale business. So we would expect the revenue growth that we're anticipating to ultimately drive us to 14% or more where we expect the business to operate.
Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And sort of moving on to the overall 2018 outlook and guidance, appreciate some of the color on sort of the puts and takes there. I was sort of trying to follow along. So I guess this is somewhat back of the envelope. But it would seem like the SG&A step-up and increase you talked about for investments would either have to be fairly hefty, or should the incremental margin on the volume, the assumption there is sort of a little bit below sort of what you realized over the past couple of quarters. So I'm assuming it's some conservatism built into the latter or is there something that we're not thinking about on the incremental margin, maybe perhaps steel costs, et cetera.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. It's a couple of things and you've touched on them, and I'll just give a little bit more color. But, keep in mind, we are talking about expanding our margins, again, 40 to 60 basis points year-over-year. So it's a pretty healthy expansion. The two things I would guide you on is, one, as you think about revenue growth, we typically convert 15% to 20% and we've been at the higher end of that range really for the last year. As the markets step up in a pretty aggressive way, particularly here in North America, you can have some inefficiencies in the system that really drives us to the lower end of that range. So as you're modeling the walk from 17% to 18% on revenue, I would model us closer to the 15% than the 20%. So that's point number one. And then second, as it relates to some of these investments, some comes through the SG&A line in the forms of additional head count and other costs we're adding; some comes through the gross margin line in the form of engineering-related expense, both of which are intended to support revenue growth M2019 and beyond M2019. And so those are really the key offsets to may be some of the other math that you're doing that still get us though to 50 basis points plus of margin expansion.
Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And the higher steel costs or other commodity costs, have you embedded in that incremental margin range you've talked about?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, ultimately, steel is a little bit of tailwind as we go from 2017 to 2018 as long as steel costs moderate. The last quarter, they were up modestly, but as long as they hold flat where they are, steel should be a year-over-year tailwind, but we'll see how steel costs play out for the year.
Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Good morning, Brett.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Good morning, Brett.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Let's see, a couple of quick questions here. First of all, again, back of the envelope math, if I look at your 2019 target, it seems like you're going to be able to hit your net leverage ratio of 1.5 just by expanding your EBITDA or increasing your EBITDA and maybe a minimal amount of debt paydown. So it seems like a large portion of your free cash flow goes towards share repurchase, am I incorrect in that?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I think a couple of things. As we sit here today, we think we are on the path to hitting 1.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA with the combination of EBITDA growing as well as our cash flow expectations because that impacts net debt. But where we sit today in terms of driving toward our solid to strong BB credit metrics, we don't think there's any additional gross debt paydown that we need to do to accomplish those objectives, which means any of the incremental capital that we're generating over the next couple of years we can use to support our M2019 growth initiatives or longer-term growth initiatives as well as opportunistically buying back shares in the market. And so we'll deploy capital in both ways as we look ahead.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: As I'm looking at kind of like the little subtitle here, return 25% of free cash flow to shareholders, what would the other 75% in your mind go towards?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Well, the other 75%, that's a measure over the four-year period from 2016 to 2019 and some of it goes for debt reduction that's allowed us to hit our net debt-to-EBITDA target and some of it will continue to be invested in the business to support our new business win objectives. As we look at that 25%, I mean, keep in mind, we deployed a lot of capital – a lot of cash, $93 million in September to execute convertible security repurchases which eliminated 5 million shares of dilution in the marketplace. So it was actually a contributing factor toward helping us allocate capital toward share buybacks effectively.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. I'll swing back around and get back in the queue. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Neil.
Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Maybe a follow-up on the margin question. Is the outlook for the lower variable comp in FY 2018 going to fully offset the higher SG&A cost as part of the investment for M2019?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Not completely in the SG&A line. I think the benefit we'll see from the reduced variable compensation accruals will largely offset the increased investment which will come through SG&A and the ER&D or engineering line. But it's not a complete offset, but it's a substantial offset.
Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then could you provide more granularity on the sales bridge from FY 2017 to FY 2018 cause for (31:50) $300 million increase at the midpoint? Are you able to provide the revenue contribution to the FY 2018 revenue guidance from new business wins that will be realized this year, I guess, both carryover from M2016 and then for the wins from M2019? And then I think you guys called out certainly the higher North America Class 8 production. That probably adds over $100 million at the midpoint. But if you could just talk through any other revenue tailwinds and headwinds that underpin the sales guidance, that would be helpful.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Sure. I mean, I think if you look at it, there's really two big drivers. The first is you touched on the NA truck, the Class 8 truck market, which, if you do the simple math that we guide you to, every 5,000 Class 8 trucks being worth $20 million, that suggests in our guidance a step-up in revenue of between $90 million and $170 million given the range that we're giving of 260,000 to 280,000 Class 8 truck point. As it relates to new business wins, including the Fabco revenue coming into the P&L this year and including M2016 carryover that's coming into the P&L still, we expect that to be north of $160 million going from 2017 to 2018. And then we get a little bit of a tailwind from our India guidance as well, probably another $20 million there. So when you add it all up, that gets you to our range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion.
Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on that, Kevin. What's the Fabco implied in that $160 million that you called out?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: It's roughly about $35 million.
Neil Frohnapple - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. At the North America Commercial Vehicle Show during the quarter, we heard a lot about electrification of commercial vehicles from both suppliers and OEMs. I'm curious if you could highlight what you think is the content per vehicle opportunity for Meritor from this trend.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. This is Jay. I think you had the opportunity to visit our booth and see our product offerings there. We displayed three specific offerings. The most significant of which was the e-axle. So we believe if the e-axle is adopted, obviously, the overall content would increase because we're replacing with that single product, the internal combustion engine, the transmission and the existing drivetrain. So we think there are opportunities for additional content. But our main focus is to at this point make certain that we're as represented in the future in the marketplace as we are today in drivetrain. So we'll be talking a lot more about that at the Analyst Day including our different strategies around with it, whichever vehicle architecture is the one that ends up dominating different vehicles certainly in the future.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. I appreciate that. I think later today there's going to be or should be a Tesla Semi truck unveil. I'm just curious how you see – which vehicles do you think are you targeting that there is the most opportunity? Is it more of that kind of long-haul Class 8 stuff or Class 8 or is it – which types of electric vehicles do you think that there's the most opportunity for you?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, I think it would be interesting to see Tesla's unveil today. We're excited for them. And, certainly, that segment as I understand what they're addressing which is the day cab segment primarily on their initial launch, has a lot of opportunity. I think when you can push vehicles upwards to 300-mile range, you can do a lot of day cab delivery. Again, our thesis is the most aggressive markets near term to grow will be the medium-duty delivery, the transit bus, and refuse sectors. And so when you look at our different product offerings, those are the markets they're being initially directed toward.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks for the color, and congrats on the quarter.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Carl Anderson for any closing remarks.
Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Chelsea. This does conclude Meritor's fourth quarter earnings call. If you do have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-08-05 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Carl Anderson - VP and Treasurer Jay Craig - CEO and President Kevin Nowlan - SVP and CFO
Analysts: Ryan Brinkman - GP Mobile Samik Chatterjee - JP Morgan Brian Johnson - Barclays Mike Baudendistel - Stifel Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2017 Meritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.
Carl Anderson: Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor’s Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today’s call are available at meritor.com. We’ll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we’re recording, is a property of Meritor, Inc.

We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you’ll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Over the next few months, we plan to participate in the following investor conferences: the Jefferies industrial conference on August 9, the Longbow investor conference on August 29 and the RBC global industrial conference on September 13. In addition, we are always happy to host investors at any of our facilities. Please contact me directly to schedule a visit. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Carl. And good morning, everyone. On Slide 3, you’ll see this was another excellent quarter for Meritor. Sales were $920 million, up 9% from the same quarter last year. This increase is due primarily to the stronger Class 8 market in North America as well as higher production in Europe and China and the continued positive benefit of new business wins. Adjusted EBITDA was $103 million this quarter, the highest the company has reported in over the past 7 years, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.2%. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.64, and free cash flow increased to $94 million. Higher-than-anticipated volumes in most of our end markets and continued operational performance across the company are improving our outlook for the full fiscal year. In past quarters, our margin performance was strong despite the revenue challenges associated with weaker end markets. Now that we’re seeing higher volumes come through in North America, Europe, China and even South America, our results are reflecting that benefit as we successfully convert on the incremental revenue. So as a consequence, we are raising our outlook again for the full year; and are particularly pleased to announce that we are taking our revenue guidance up by $150 million, with about 1/4 of that being driven by market outperformance. We’re driving increases in share beyond our prior expectations with key customers around the globe, particularly in North America, Europe and India. And we’re delivering new business wins as part of our M2019 program that are starting to come into the P&L this year. Take a look at Slide 4. We remain confident in our ability to meet the financial objectives we set for M2019. We are increasing our market share with key customers, renewing long-term contracts and winning new business in all regions around the globe across both of our operating segments. In addition to the wins we outlined for you on our last call, we continue to execute on new revenue opportunities that should contribute another $45 million of revenue outperformance in 2019. As we said in the past, these wins vary in size but are all important and are beginning to flow through our financials this year. With regard to contract renewals, we’ve recently finalized agreements with IVECO to continue supplying axles for its trucks in Europe. We also announced a new three year agreement with the REV Group. Under this agreement, REV will continue to equip its bus, fire and specialty vehicles with Meritor’s fully dressed axle assemblies. In addition to our current product offering, we’re looking forward to working with these customers on new products and the development of future designs. This is consistent with the strategy we’ve talked about now for a few years, which is to ensure we stay closely aligned with our customers in the development of new technology and forward product programs. We also continue to look at opportunities to invest in future products and technologies like the electric drive train solutions we told you about a couple quarters ago and which we will profile at the upcoming NACV Show in September. On Slide 5, you can see four important recognitions we received this quarter from Daimler, Ashok Leyland, PACCAR and Hino. You’ll also remember that, last quarter, we received the Diamond Supplier Award from Navistar and the excellent supplier award from XCMG. Our global team is working hard to provide all of our customers with excellent quality and on-time delivery. This has been and will remain our top priority for us. We know that being a reliable partner in an industry with such rapid demand changes is absolutely critical. If you turn to Slide 6, I will give you some color on the changes we see in our end markets. We meaningfully increased our production outlook since the last quarter for Class 8 trucks in North America from a midpoint of 210,000 units to approximately 230,000. While longer-term indicators remained mixed, we are seeing strong production right now in our facilities. As a result, we do expect the second half of fiscal 2017 to be stronger than the first. In terms of Class 8 builds, we were encouraged to see the largest quarter-over-quarter increase in recent history occur from the second fiscal quarter to the third, a 29% increase or close to 15,000 units. Meritor delivered exceptionally well during this demand cycle in which we experienced not only higher market volumes but also increased share in certain product lines. Excellent execution in all cycles is now a distinguishing characteristic of this company and one that our customers consider when selecting strategic partners. We tightened our range for medium duty this quarter, with the midpoint remaining the same from last quarter at 240,000 units, essentially flat to last fiscal year. In Western Europe, we slightly increased our midpoint for medium- and heavy-duty production. The economic outlook in the region remains as strong as it has been in six years, with growth expected at 3% this year. Heavy truck registrations were up more than 13% in May year-over-year, contributing to a stable upward trend. We increased our revenue forecast in China approximately $25 million for the year. This is primarily driven by increased activity in the construction segment and new products that we’ve launched in the region. China continues to be important for us -- as we believe our opportunities for growth in this market as we look ahead to 2019 and beyond. We are now offering a broad range of axle and brake solutions for truck, bus and coach applications that are specifically designed for the Asia Pacific market with localized manufacturing that provides optimized cost savings for our customers. In India, we lowered our production range for the year as third quarter production dipped below previous expectations. This was due to a decrease in heavy truck registrations related to the introduction of emission regulations that took effect on April 1. We still see strong demand, however, with GDP expected in the low 7% range this year and next. And with the growth we’re seeing with our largest customer in the region, our revenue is actually expected to be up year-over-year. Finally, we are maintaining our forecasts for South America, 60,000 to 70,000 units. No real change from last quarter, but as we’ve said, this remains an important market for us. And we’re encouraged with some signs of recovery, albeit as -- at a very slow rate. Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I wanted to give you an update on the OPEB litigation, as there were a few developments this quarter, which are shown on Slide 7.  In April, the Sixth Circuit court of appeals ruled in our favor and subsequently issued a mandate returning the case to the district court for any further proceedings necessary to carry out the Sixth Circuit’s judgment. At this point, we are waiting for the injunction to be lifted but cannot make any changes to retiree health care benefits until that time. So as I said last quarter, it’s premature to speculate on the outcome, but we’ll keep you posted. Overall, this was a great quarter for us. And as I said earlier, we remain on track, with the entire Meritor team aligned around achieving our M2019 objectives. We are particularly pleased to be in a position to significantly raise our full year guidance for the second quarter in a row. And we remain committed to sustaining the strong performance we’ve delivered throughout the year. With that, I’ll let Kevin give you more detail on the financials, and then we’ll take your questions.
Kevin Nowlan: Good morning. As you just heard from Jay, we had an excellent quarter across the board. We expanded bottom line earnings by 17%, generated significant free cash flow and continue to make good progress toward our M2019 targets. Let’s walk through the details by first turning to Slide 8, where you’ll see our third quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $920 million in the quarter, an increase of 9%. Roughly half of the higher revenue within North America, as we experienced higher Class 8 truck production. Our new business wins continued to come into the P&L, and our market share increased in certain product categories. We also had higher revenue in Europe and China as both of those markets continued to trend positively. As you can see in the line item volume, mix, performance and other, we had $22 million of higher adjusted EBITDA related to $81 million of revenue increase. We continue to see the benefits of our M2016 operational improvements, which are driving strong earnings conversion on incremental revenue. Also included in this line item are $6 million of higher net steel costs on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by $5 million of higher joint venture earnings resulting from the improvement in the North American market. Next you’ll see that we had a $6 million favorable supplier litigation settlement in the third quarter of 2016 that did not repeat this year. You’ll recall that this was an important contributor to last year’s margin exceeding 11%. Moving down the causal, you can see that SG&A was an $8 million increase this quarter, excluding the impact of the supplier settlement in the previous year. This can be explained entirely by an increase in variable compensation expense to catch up our accruals through nine months given that this year’s financial performance is now outpacing our annual plan. These items provide the walk from an adjusted EBITDA of $96 million a year ago to $103 million this year and to our reported 11.2% adjusted EBITDA margin. This resulted in adjusted income from continuing operations of $60 million or $0.64 per share, which is an increase of $0.07 per share from last year. Slide 9 details third quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $728 million, up 14% from last year. In our two largest markets North America and Europe, truck production was up 5% and 3%, respectively, but as you’ll see, we’re outperforming this end market growth because we’re realizing the benefit from our new business wins and we’re seeing higher market share in certain of our product categories. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $75 million, up $14 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Industrial came in at 10.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from a year ago. This margin improvement was driven by conversion on the higher revenue and continued material performance. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $228 million, up just $1 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $26 million, down $12 million compared to last year. As a result, segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 11.4% compared to 16.7% in the same period last year. The decrease in margin performance was primarily driven by the supplier litigation settlement we had a year ago. In addition, we had $4 million of higher allocated variable compensation accruals as well as higher steel costs that impacted the current quarter. Adjusting for the higher-than-normal incentive compensation accruals, our margin performance came in at just over 13% this quarter. Our margin expectations for this operating segment continue to be in the 14% to 15% range as we go forward. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow was $94 million, an $8 million improvement over last year. The increase is being driven by our stronger year-over-year earnings. That speaks to the quality of the earnings we’re generating. Earnings are translating to cash flow. Overall, for the first nine months of the year, we have generated $84 million of free cash flow, a $6 million increase over the same period last year. Next I’ll review our fiscal year 2017 outlook on Slide 11. As Jay told you, we are raising our fiscal year 2017 revenue, earnings and free cash flow guidance. Building on our performance in the third quarter, combined with stronger market expectations and continued success in driving our business wins into the P&L, we now expect revenue to be approximately $3.25 billion for fiscal year 2017. This is an increase of $150 million from our previous guidance. From an earnings perspective, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin expectation to approximately 10.2%, up 20 basis points from our previous outlook. We are also increasing adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.30 to approximately $1.70. The combination of higher revenue and increased margin is driving this increase in adjusted EPS. And finally, based on these higher earnings expectations, we are also raising our free cash flow guidance to a range of $80 million to $90 million, up from our previous range of $50 million to $70 million. Overall, we are very pleased with our results this quarter and over the first 9 months of our fiscal year. Our continued strong performance, coupled with improving revenue expectations, has provided us the ability to significantly take up our guidance expectations for 2017. Now we’ll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from [GP Mobile]. Your line is open. 
Samik Chatterjee: This is Samik on behalf of Ryan Brinkman from JP Morgan. The first question I had is on the commercial truck segment. Your revenues there rose 14% year-on-year in the quarter, so I was wondering if you could break out -- also, the end of market that I look at, like Class 8 and Class 5-7 were up mid-single here, so if you could break out for us: How much of the growth was driven by the industry? And how much will you attribute to sort of market share gains in that growth?
Kevin Nowlan: I think, big picture, you can see -- I mean, when you look at the 2 big markets we have in commercial truck, North America and Europe, they were up 3% and 5% roughly. And so the way to think about it is the bulk of the rest was coming from our business outperformance. That’s new business wins. It’s product penetration increases, expansion of share with customers.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. No, that’s helpful. And then in terms of probably strength here in terms of also the raising the revenue guide. You’re raising the revenue guide on the end market strength. How should we think about the sustainability of the end market strength going into 2018? Like, what’s your outlook in terms of how sustainable these end market strengths are going into the next year?
Jay Craig: Ryan, this is Jay. I think the way we’re thinking about it is, right now even with that increase in market expectations, for the full year, we’re -- or our fiscal year, we’re starting to push towards replacement demand. And I think, as we look longer term at the U.S. economy and its health, we see no reason that the Class 8 market shouldn’t be able to sustain that replacement demand level going forward. Obviously, we’re not giving our guidance yet for 2018, but I think, as we look at the market fundamentally, we just think with a healthy economy that replacement demand expectation should be reasonable.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it, got it. And then just a last question. How should we think about sort of a typical incremental margin for the last quarter of the year? Because if I sort of look at what your guidance is implying in terms of revenue growth, which is sort of a $100 million increase; and put a 15% incremental margin on it, which you seem to have done this quarter as well, excluding the sort of backout of the benefit you had last quarter from the supplier payment, the math then sort of indicate that you could sort of outperform the 10.2% margin guidance you’re sort of issuing today for the year. So can you just help me in terms of is there anything that could depress incrementals in the last quarter?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, I think, as you think about sequentially going from Q3 to Q4, the first thing I’d say is that supplier litigation settlement isn’t relevant to this year. That was a last year good news item. So that’s not embedded in our Q3 2017 guidance or results. As you think about what’s implied in our guidance for Q4, our expectation is that revenue from Q3 to Q4 drops by about $95 million, and that’s predominantly driven by the fact that we have the European shutdown, which always brings our revenue down sequentially from Q3 to Q4. We’ll also see some seasonal -- we’re coming off our seasonal peaks in our aftermarket and China businesses as well, so we tend to see a little bit of pullback in revenue in the fourth quarter there as well. But all told, it’s about $95 million of revenue step down sequentially. And we’re assuming, if you cut through the guidance, about a 20% conversion on that roughly $20 million of EBITDA lower. That’s what’s implied in our Q4 guidance.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open.
Brian Johnson: Yes. You seem to have stronger end markets and new business wins, but you lowered your CapEx guidance. Is that timing of investments? Is that going to be added to next year’s CapEx? Or just how, given the growth, should we be thinking about that?
Jay Craig: Yes, yes, Brian, this is Jay. I think that’s right. It’s really a timing issue. A lot of our projects are quite large. And although we’re encouraging the team to continue to invest, to achieve as much labor and burden and material cost savings as they can, it’s just a question of timing. And I think the run rate that you’ve seen us at the last couple years is what we think a go-forward picture looks like.
Brian Johnson: Okay. Can you help us refine in terms of bucketing or breaking down, obviously in the Commercial Truck & Industrial sector, just the growth between what was end market growth, what was market share wins, what was new business? And then were there some things either in industrial or military that kind of came through that we haven’t seen in prior quarters?
Jay Craig: I think we’ll be bucketing that at the end of the year and then at our Investor Day as we scorecard ourselves against our M2019 targets. So we’ll give you more detail at that time. As I spoke to in our initial comments, of the revenue guidance increase, roughly 25% of that was due to new business wins. And another data point that we called out was, even though the India market is down, we expect to be up because of the market share gains with primarily our largest customer but across the market.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel from Stifel. Your line is open.
Mike Baudendistel: I think that’s me. Anyway, in the REV Group deal, I just wanted to ask you. They do so many different product types, I mean. Is that really -- are you doing business with them throughout their sort of products portfolio? Or is it sort of concentrated in certain types of products that they’re manufacturing?
Jay Craig: No. Great question, Mike. In fact, that’s what makes us most excited about that announcement is, prior to this, we really didn’t have a single overarching agreement with the REV Group, so the opportunities were with each of the individual brands. This is the first consolidated agreement we’ve had with that group. So I think on both sides of the table we have expectations of increasing penetration with them as we become much more closely aligned with the engineering teams in the entire group.
Mike Baudendistel: Great. Can you give us a sense of how much revenue that they represents initially? I realize it’s going to ramp up overtime.
Jay Craig: Again, we’ll be scorecarding all the M2019 wins at the end of the year. And as we start to look at the opportunities individually, we’ll certainly highlight the larger ones individually, when we come through at the end of the year. But again, we’re very pleased with just being right on track with where we expected to be and wanted to be on that revenue growth program overall.
Mike Baudendistel: Great. And I also wanted to ask you IVECO. You said that it was a continuation of an existing relationship with them. I mean, was it any larger than the prior relationship in terms of what you’re supplying to them?
Jay Craig: No, it was a predual long-term agreement. We provide IVECO in Europe all their single-reduction drive axle needs that they require in Europe. But again, every major customer agreement that are long term is very critical to us and took an enormous effort by the -- by our team to make sure we execute it successfully.
Mike Baudendistel: Okay, great. And then sticking with Europe, can you just remind us if there’s market share changes within the OEMs in Europe? Are there more of the -- some certain ones that you’re more exposed to there and certain that are ones that are more of [Indiscernible]?
Jay Craig: Well, the big customers we’re exposed to are Volvo, Werner and IVECO. And then we’ve won recently the Scania disc brake business, a large share of that, so you can look at Scania. And we have another win that we alluded to last quarter of another European OE that we’ll talk about in more detail in the future.
Mike Baudendistel: It sounds good. And also just wanted to ask you quickly: I mean you hired a Chief Strategy Officer in the quarter. I mean, should we think of that person as primarily being someone that prospects for acquisitions, or just looks at corporate strategy overall? Or just any detail there would be great.
Jay Craig: Sure. The reason for that hire. We’re thrilled to have Cheri in our team. Cheri is someone we’ve worked with quite extensively before from the Boston Consulting Group, so we are excited to have her join us. It was primarily to support us in all our growth initiatives, both organic and through bolt-on acquisitions that we’re looking at. Obviously, a large part of our M2019, in fact, has come from revenue growth, and we want to make sure we go about that in the most thoughtful and organized way. And we have a lot of good opportunities that we needed to make sure we were sorting through properly.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Brett Hoselton: It doesn’t sound like you’re prepared to talk about your revenue target specifically or where you’re at. And I’m wondering what your -- what is your confidence level at achieving that 2019 revenue target?
Jay Craig: It’s stated, Brett. We’re -- so far, what we disclosed last quarter and this quarter, we’re at $115 million towards that target of $450 million. I think we are very confident in our ability to achieve that target. I think we’re right on the flight path we expected to be. We -- as you would expect, we have detailed meetings with all the operating teams, going through their risk-adjusted pipelines. And what I’m most pleased about is the overarching strategy of becoming closer to the marketplace and our major customers. And then having significant additional new product launches is really getting a lot of traction, and you can see that in this quarter’s results. And we’re also looking at some interesting bolt-on acquisition opportunities, and we’re hopeful that we’ll have some of those consummated in the not-too-distant future.
Brett Hoselton: And switching gears, can you talk a little bit about what are you seeing? You talked about near term the European market, commercial vehicle market; and the South American market. Can you kind of speak to those markets in terms of your outlook into 2018? Do you see strengths continuing in Europe? And where do you see South America?
Jay Craig: I think it’s premature for us to give 2018 guidance, but if I look at each market individually, I think Europe is keeping up with replacement demand. We’re finally just moving along in a replacement demand market, which is excellent for us particularly with our market share gains. And so it -- what’s encouraging to us about that market for the future? There’s not a pull-ahead of an emissions or safety required change. So with -- and GDP is healthy in Europe and moving along. And South America, it’s stable, as we’d said. They really need political stability there. Any time you see the political environment becomes stable, you start to see a strong pickup in business activity, but then there’s a step back as another issue arises in that arena. So I think the bellwether we look for in that market is just political stability. And we think the underlying business demand will be quite strong.
Brett Hoselton: And then finally, from a commodity standpoint, have you seen any particular headwinds, particularly from a steel standpoint?
Jay Craig: Steel for the year has been a headwind, but I think we’re starting to see stability recently in that. So obviously I think the company has done an excellent job of dealing with that this year. And if you’ll recall, the majority of our contracts have pass-through mechanisms that have on average a six-month lag in them, so -- but we’ll recover the vast majority of those increases over time. But I think, during this time period where we’ve seen the headwinds in this fiscal year, I’ve just been very, very pleased with how the team has responded in getting additional material cost-downs since quite a while.
Kevin Nowlan: And to dimension that numerically, Brett, it’s the quarter year-over-year, it’s about $6 million headwind. And year-to-date, we’re about $21 million headwind, but as we sit here today and look at the full year, we’ll be in about $25 million to $30 million full year headwind, which is really unchanged from what we were thinking a quarter ago. So we’ve seen a little bit more stability in the steel indices in the last few months than what we saw in the early part of the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Joseph Spak: Just to follow up on that last point on steel. So if steels moderates here, it sounds like, at least for the fourth quarter, a little bit less of a net headwind. And then as we go into ‘18, again if things flatten -- if steel prices flatten out, you would be -- expect to sort of have a little bit of a potential benefit from a recovery. Is that the right way to think about it?
Kevin Nowlan: That’s right, because the steel recovery mechanisms will start to kick in at the tail end of this year and really into the beginning of next year for the steel price increases we’ve really seen in the last quarter or 2.
Joseph Spak: Okay. And then I don’t know if I’m reading too much into this, but look, I noticed you’ve called out steel more in the aftermarket segment, as opposed to commercial vehicle, so is there something -- is that because more of the recoveries are -- contractual recoveries are in that area in the commercial truck segment?
Kevin Nowlan: It’s a really good point. The -- as you think about the $6 million headwind we had in the quarter year-over-year, about $3 million of it was in Aftermarket & Trailer. $3 million of it was in commercial truck. And the reason we saw a little bit of a disproportionate hit to the Aftermarket & Trailer business relative to its revenue is because of pass-through mechanisms. Commercial Truck & Industrial, with the OE customers, has the traditional pass-through mechanisms with lag on about a 6-month basis. When you think of aftermarket, the aftermarket business in and of itself doesn’t operate with the same types of pass-through mechanisms. We tend to go out with pricing periodically maybe once a year, it could be more often than that, on a general basis, but the pricing is established, whether it’s up or down, based on a whole set of market dynamics, not just steel. So when we look at a particular quarter that we saw year-over-year we had a steel headwind in the segment but we didn’t have a specific recovery mechanism to offset that in the segment.
Joseph Spak: That’s helpful. And then just bigger picture, Haldex, with respect to their deal, they -- there was a release today that talked about some disruption in their business and order book. And I didn’t know if you were sort of seeing any benefit there on air disc brakes. And then it looks like -- I don’t know if that deal goes through, or not. It looks like it might not. I mean, is that something that would be of interest, or at least elements of that business of interest, to Meritor?
Jay Craig: Well, Haldex, as far -- we compete in the foundation brake business. And Haldex’ share of that, particularly on the truck side, is fairly de minimis. And the -- so we haven’t seen any significant impacts. They’re more heavily weighted towards the trailer foundation brake side, which we’d certainly have meaningful share in North America but not so much in Europe. So I think I haven’t seen any near-term impact. As far as M&A opportunity, we don’t comment on specific opportunities, and so we will just hold off on any further comments on that.
Joseph Spak: Fair enough. And then last one, on the OPEB update. I mean, is it fair -- so it seems like the appeal could go through September, so in terms of thinking -- I’m sure you’re doing work internally, but in terms of thinking about an updated communication to the Street sometime around then, is that a fair thinking?
Jay Craig: Well, I -- obviously, our next quarterly call will be in early November. And so we’ll, at the latest, have an update at that point. We did file a motion with the district court in the -- on the 19th of July and have had a hearing scheduled for late August. If there is a ruling from the bench at that hearing, we’ll update the market at that point in time, but we remain optimistic that this will get resolved over the coming months. And when it does and once we’ve communicated to the company and any impacted retirees, we’ll then update the market.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today’s Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Carl Anderson for closing remarks.
Carl Anderson: Thank you, Danielle. This does conclude our Third Quarter Earnings Call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you for your participation.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-05-03 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc. Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc. Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.
Analysts: Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Meritor, Incorporated Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.
Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's second quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we are recording, is a property of Meritor, Inc. It's protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the expressed written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Carl, and good morning. On slide 3, you'll see that this was another strong quarter for us. Sales were $806 million, down slightly on lower production in the North American Class 8 truck market. Adjusted EBITDA was up $1 million from the same quarter of last year, resulting in a margin of 10.2% despite the fact that we booked a $10 million for a legal contingency accrual in the quarter. As a result of our performance in the first half of the year and our forecast for the second half, we are increasing our guidance for the full fiscal year. Continued operational performance combined with an expectation of higher Class 8 truck builds in North America and increased revenue in Europe gives us confidence that we will achieve full-year results at the top end of our prior outlook. Kevin will give you more color on our financial results and what we're seeing in the global end markets. In addition to our financial results, we also had several other highlights in the second quarter driven by our focus on customers and products. As we demonstrated consistently quarter after quarter, our global team is driving improved results. Alignment to M2019 and the drive for the success that I see in Meritor employees every day is continuing to differentiate us in the commercial vehicle business. In that regard, we are proud to tell you about three distinguished awards we recently received that are shown on slide 4. As you know, we have a long-term relationship with Navistar that we greatly value, particularly in terms of our mutual interest to look towards the future and collaborate on designing products that meet our customers' strategic priorities. In February, Meritor was among the top 2% of Navistar's supply base to receive the Diamond Supplier Award. We are proud to supply Navistar with a variety of products. Just last week, we announced that Meritor's 13X single-drive axle is now available to be spec'ed on Navistar trucks. The 13X designed specifically for medium-duty applications is 59 pounds lighter and 0.5% more efficient than our previous offering. It's engineered for multiple applications, including pickup and delivery, beverage, utility, school bus, construction, and ambulance. And a few months ago, we announced that Meritor's high-performance EX+L air disc brakes are now available on International LT Series tractors. XCMG is another important customer to Meritor. In addition to being our key joint venture partner in China, XCMG recently honored us with the excellence supplier award that recognizes its top supplier in delivery, quality, and product performance. We look forward to further enhancing our relationship with XCMG, one of the largest construction machinery companies in the world, as the construction markets in China begin to show signs of a slight improvement, which encourages us for the rest of the year. We also received an important industry recognition this quarter from Heavy Duty Trucking Magazine, which ranked Meritor's MFS+ Series front-steer axle as one of the top 20 products for 2017. This award honors the most innovative new products that address industry issues and help fleets improve their bottom line. The MFS+, which we launched last February, is 85 pounds lighter than our previous offering, providing fleets with a more efficient product. We appreciate each of these significant awards and recognize that continuous improvement is necessary to meet our customers' expectations in a constantly evolving industry. When we launched M2019, we told you we would be more aggressive in our product launch cycle than in the past, which would contribute to our revenue growth objective. We are on track to launch 20 new products across the front drivetrain, rear drivetrain, and specialty. On slide 5, we highlighted three products that were launched in the second quarter for three different applications. The 14X HE for linehaul, the P600 tridem for heavy-haul and off-highway applications, and the MTec6 for trailers. The 14X HE is designed to improve our axle efficiency up to 1.5%, while also reducing weight by 30 pounds over the current market-leading 14X design. Based on today's diesel prices, a fleet with 1,000 trucks equipped with the 14X HE could realize $1 million per year in fuel savings. The P600 Series tridem axle for heavy-haul, oil field, mining and logging applications begins full production in June at our Laurinburg, North Carolina plant. High capacity, reduced fleet time, aftermarket parts availability, and Meritor's leading field service and support make us a strong competitor in this market. And the MTec6 axle being produced in our Frankfort, Kentucky facility is now available for our trailer customers. This axle is 40 pounds lighter than the industry standard 5-inch axle, which reduces gross trailer weight to enhance fuel economy and available payload. These are three products from our pipeline that we've now launched. Slide 6 and 7 provide a look at some of the new business we're awarded this quarter. In total, the wins on these two slides are expected to amount to just over $70 million of incremental business in 2019. We continue to grow with strategic customers like Volvo, Daimler and PACCAR, whether through new products or the addition of existing Meritor products to applications in other regions. It was exciting to see Volvo launch its new UD Con Truck in Japan three weeks ago, which incorporates Meritor's global axle and brake platforms. Volvo is the first OEM to offer disc brakes as a standard feature in the Japanese market, and they are depending on the proven performance of Meritor's disc brake. We are also supporting Volvo in Thailand and India. Expanding our customer base remains a focus for us, and we are having success in that area. You can see a couple of examples of that here, with Veera Vahana, an India-based bus manufacturer and JAC Motors, a Chinese manufacturer of medium and heavy-duty trucks. And we are working hard to grow our Aftermarket business. This quarter, we earned a new private label business in Europe. We also recently launched a new e-commerce platform called meritorpartsexpress.com, that makes it easier for U.S. and Canadian customers to shop for Meritor aftermarket parts on their computers, smartphones, and tablets. In our components business, we have a small win this quarter, and we have a new specialty in off-highway contracts in North America for which we'll be supplying our MX-810 axle and P600 tandem. Also, while not incremental, we recently renewed a contract with Hino in North America, resulting in a five-year extension of our current business, which includes front and rear-dressed axles for Class 6 and Class 7 vehicles. As we said, the majority of our new business is back-end loaded in M2019. The wins on these two sides demonstrate the progress we're making to strategically grow our business in each of these areas. Now, before I turn the call over to Kevin, I wanted to make a few brief comments about the recent ruling related to our UAW Retiree Medical Benefits. On April 20, in a 3-0 decision issued Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the prior lower court decision was reversed, and the court held that our collective bargaining agreements did not vest the plaintiff retirees with lifetime medical benefits. We are encouraged by the Sixth Circuit Court's recent decision, which we believe will eventually provide us with the opportunity to amend our UAW Retiree Medical Benefit plans based on the needs of our business. But at this point, we're still in the midst of a litigation and the plaintiffs in the case have not yet exhausted the appeal's process, which includes the potential filing for a petition for a rehearing en banc with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. As a result, it's premature to speculate on the outcome. We will remain focused on executing our strategy, which includes investing in new products and technologies that drive top line growth, improving bottom line earnings, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Overall, we had another quarter of strong execution. We expanded margins, generated positive cash flow, and continue to make good progress toward our M2019 targets. Let's walk through the details by first turning to slide 8 where you'll see our second quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $806 million in the quarter, down 2%. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by a lower commercial truck volume in North America. This was largely offset by increased production in Europe, India and China in addition to new business wins coming on line. Although revenue was down slightly, we were able to expand gross margin as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points. We accomplished this by continuing to drive lower material, labor, and burden costs that helped to offset the impact of lower revenue as well as higher steel prices which were a $6 million headwind in the quarter. In addition, we have favorable mix in our truck business, which also helped to drive higher contribution margins this quarter. As you can see from the right side of the slide, we did book a onetime $10 million legal contingency charge related to a dispute with our joint venture partner in Mexico. We've been in litigation since 2014 with our partner over certain product manufacturing rights. The legal contingency charge reflects our best estimate of the cost to reach an agreement to resolve this issue. We expect that this matter will be settled in the coming months, but given where we are in the discussion, we accrued this expense in the current quarter. Moving down the (13:30), we had $2 million of favorability in the line item volume, mix, performance and other. This captures the strong operational performance and favorable mix I mentioned earlier which more than offset volume declines and the $6 million steel headwind. Foreign exchange was a tailwind in the quarter, driven by $2 million hedge mark-to-market gains in the second quarter of this year and the corresponding $2 million mark-to-market hedge loss a year ago. The hedge gains this year relate to foreign exchange options that protect against the strengthening Indian rupee as we have shifted some of our supply base to India over the last few years. The hedge losses from a year ago were related to certain earnings translation hedges we had purchased to protect against the risk of a weakening euro and Swedish krona. Next, you can see that SG&A excluding the impact of the legal contingency was a $4 million tailwind this quarter, driven by lower net investments expense. Income tax expense was $13 million in the second quarter of 2017, which translates to an effective book tax rate of 36%. Compared to last year, our tax expense was up $6 million on similar pre-tax income. The primary driver of the higher tax expense was increased earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions particularly those in which we're not currently a cash taxpayer. However, it's important to remember that given our current tax position, this tax expense does not reflect the actual cash taxes we pay. That's why from an adjusted income perspective, we continue to back out the noncash tax expenses associated with the utilization of our deferred tax assets. The impact of this in the second quarter was $6 million, which means that after this adjustment, our effective tax rate was 19%, in line with our expectations. Overall, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $82 million, which resulted in a 10.2% adjusted EBITDA margin, up 30 basis points from last year. And adjusted income from continuing operations was $32 million or $0.35 per share, down $0.06 from last year. Slide 9 details second quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for both of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $620 million, down only 2% from last year despite Class 8 truck production in North America being down 20%. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $54 million, down $2 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for Commercial Truck & Industrial came in at 8.7%, down slightly from a year ago. The margin decrease was driven primarily by the legal contingency charge and higher steel prices, which were almost entirely offset by material, labor, and burden performance, foreign exchange, and favorable mix. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $215 million, roughly flat compared to last year. In this segment, we experienced higher aftermarket revenue, which was offset by lower trailer production as the U.S. trailer market was down 10%. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, up $2 million compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 14.0% compared to 12.8% in the same period last year. The margin increase was driven by favorable labor and burden performance. Turning to slide 10, total free cash flow was $21 million, very similar to what we generated last year. As part of M2019, we continue to invest in the businesses, evidenced by capital expenditures of $23 million this quarter. In total then, we generated $44 million of operating cash flow this quarter, equal to our performance last year. This performance was consistent with our expectations and keeps us on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow guidance. Turning to slide 11, I wanted to highlight our debt maturity profile and liquidity position as we executed a few relevant transactions this past quarter. First, we refinanced our U.S. revolver, which resulted in an increase in the facility size to $525 million and extension of the maturity to 2022, and a reduction in both drawn and undrawn pricing. Second, we extended our €155 million Swedish factoring facility to 2020. And finally, we paid down a $6 million debt maturity in Brazil in the quarter. Under our M2019 strategy, we continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation and are driving to have strong BB credit metrics by 2019. As we continue to generate positive free cash flow, we will be opportunistic in repurchasing debt as well as buying back common stock. The main takeaway from this slide is that we continue to maintain strong liquidity and have limited funded debt maturities over the next four years. Turning now to slide 12, you'll see that we have revised some of our market assumptions for our fiscal year 2017. In North America, inventory levels appeared to have stabilized, while net order intake in our second quarter was up 25% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. We are seeing the effects of this coming through our order boards right now and believe that the next couple quarters will be stronger than we were anticipating. As a result, we are increasing our Class 8 production outlook to be in a range of 205,000 to 215,000 units this year. We are also increasing our production estimates in Europe to be in a range of 440,00 to 460,000 units, up 10,000 units from what we had previously thought. Truck registrations, replacement demand, and the current economic environment continue to have a positive effect on the demand for trucks across Europe. In addition, certain key customers in the region are performing quite well. All of our other market assumptions are consistent with our previous expectations. Next, I'll review our fiscal year 2017 outlook on slide 13. As Jay told you, we are raising our fiscal year 2017 revenue and earnings guidance to be at the top end of our previous range. Based on stronger U.S. and European markets and our continued success in driving new business wins into the P&L, we now expect revenue to be approximately $3.1 billion for fiscal year 2017. From an earnings perspective, we are now anticipating incremental steel headwinds of $10 million to $15 million relative to what we were previously expecting. So, we now believe steel will be a $25 million to $30 million headwind on a full-year basis. However, the increased revenue outlook combined with continued operational performance is driving earnings higher. That's why we're taking our guidance up with EBITDA margin of approximately 10% and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $1.40. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I did want to remind you that in our third quarter last year, we had $9 million in favorable supplier and insurance recoveries that we don't expect to repeat. So, as you think about our year-over-year performance for next quarter, you should consider that last year's results create a difficult earnings comparable. Finally, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged with a projected range of $50 million to $70 million. Even with our projected capital expenditures of $90 million and some investment in working capital to support higher revenue outlooks, we expect our cash flow to be solid for the full year. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter and in the first half of the year. We're particularly happy to be in a position to raise our guidance for fiscal 2017. On slide 14, we wanted to highlight for you a couple of important events coming up later this year. The new NACV Truck Show in Atlanta will be a great venue for us to showcase our products currently in production and those we will offer our customers in the future including electrified drivetrains. We hope to see you there. Then in December, we'll host our Analyst Day event in New York. We look forward to giving you a detailed M2019 update at that time. Now, we'll take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Neil.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Thanks.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: If we exclude the $10 million in legal contingency in the quarter from Commercial Truck & Industrial, I believe you would have delivered over a 10% EBITDA margin in the quarter despite Class 8 truck production being down over 20%. So, just curious on why the implied EBITDA margin for this segment wouldn't be higher in the back half of the year because I do believe that implied a meaningful step-down particularly in light of increasing NAFTA Class 8 production. And I appreciate the incremental steel headwind you called out, but versus the first half of the year, I don't think that's incrementally that materially different. So, if you could just help us out with some of the puts and takes there that would be helpful.
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Okay. Starting with your first point about the legal contingency, I mean, you're right, our results would have been considerably stronger if we didn't have the $10 million item in the quarter, and that would have impacted the truck segment. Now, keep in mind, if we didn't have that $10 million item, we probably would have been trending quite a bit higher relative to our internal target. So, we probably would have had some sort of an offset in our incentive compensation accruals that would have mitigated that a little bit. But directionally, you're right. We would have had a considerably stronger quarter both on an overall basis as well as in the Commercial Truck & Industrial segment. As it relates to looking forward, steel prices have escalated even in the quarter. If you look at scrap, for instance, it's up almost 50% sequentially from last quarter to this quarter. And if you look at a lot of the other indices around the globe, they're up anywhere from 10% to 30%. So, we have seen sequential step-ups in the indices, which is higher than what we were anticipating a quarter ago. So, we are looking now at the back half having a bigger headwind from steel in the range of $10 million to $15 million incremental to what we are previously expecting. But we are expecting to overcome that with a stronger revenue and a stronger performance. And so, if you cut through the math of what we're saying from a guidance perspective, through six months, we're at 9.7%. In the back half of the year, we're effectively guiding to something in that 10.2%, 10.3% range even with that steel headwind coming into the P&L.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just want to ask a bigger picture question. I mean, it's been almost a year-and-a-half, I believe, since you launched M2019, and it certainly will require some significant earnings growth in 2018 and 2019 versus the guidance for this year. So, maybe, Jay, can you just talk about your confidence still in hitting the EPS target of $2.84 and whether any of the key buckets within the earnings bridge are performing better than are worse than expected. And again, look, I believe expectations are that North America truck should be up a lot in 2018, so that will certainly help close the gaps, but just curious more from an aspect of things at Meritor if you control. And certainly, it does sound like you guys are launching new products on schedule, but any more color there would be helpful.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, I still have a high degree of confidence of achieving targets we set out for M2019. I think there are some areas where we seem to be overperforming to-date, and that's on the cost improvement side. I think we're seeing a little higher cost reductions than we anticipated and our planning cycles on material and labor and burden. I think we're very pleased particularly this quarter with the new business wins of $70 million. So, we're starting to see our initiatives take hold in almost all markets around the world, as I mentioned significant new business wins not only here in North America but in Japan and in India and in Europe. So, I think we're starting to see the fruits from the investments we're making in new products that are targeted at specific markets. And also, the global market recoveries are falling right in line I think with what our market expectations are for the end of that planning cycle. So, overall, I think we still remain very confident of achieving the targets, and everything so far has fallen within what we expected when we set the plan up.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Great. Thanks very much. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is open.
Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. In your commentary, you mentioned the legal settlement. Can you just remind us if you do get that reversed, how much of a benefit in terms of reduction of OPEB that would be? And any color on how long it might take to get through the final review?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, I think it's probably premature, Colin, for us to speculate what the benefits could be until we get a final mandate from the courts that allows us to start to consider what the adjustments to the benefits could be. Just for your recollection, at the end of the year, we sat with a total liability of $447 million, and the annual cash and expense charge for that is about $30 million a year. Now, how much of potential benefit we could achieve from the ruling, again, it's too premature for us to speculate on that until we get the final ruling. As far as timing, the current appeal process could be resolved in any wide range of timeframes, anywhere from a couple of weeks to many months, upwards of six to seven months, depending on how the appeals court wants to proceed with an appeal from the UAW. And we'll obviously keep people updated as the issues transpire out of the courts.
Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC: And that $447 million, is that everything – does that include different sub-segments of retirees or is the $447 million all the UAW related that's under (28:23)?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Of the $447 million, about 95% or maybe about $430 million is U.S.-related. And I'd say the bulk of that, almost the entirety of that is really related to UAW. Now, the portion of that that's subject to the actual litigation itself is less than half of that number at the moment. We're hopeful that once the court resolves the issues and hopefully rules in our favor that it will give us the opportunity to reassess all of those retiree healthcare benefits in the U.S.
Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Very helpful. And then in terms of the commodity exposure, can you remind us if you have any hedging or indexing mechanism that you get some of those $25 million, $30 million back? I mean, do you get recovery on that eventually or is it on a lag?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: We do. It's on a lag in terms of our recovery from customers. So, as we're seeing an increase right now in steel prices, that increase is starting to come through from the supply base to us. And then we have pass-through mechanisms with our OE customers around the globe that allow us to pass those back to them, generally on about a six month or so lag. So, some of the potential offset to that, we won't see in the current fiscal year. It will slide into next year.
Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And are all your contracts under pass-through? Any percent that protects that or...
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I mean, the overwhelming bulk of our OE contracts and relationships are governed in practice by contract with these recovery mechanisms, so yes.
Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. And then lastly, the one-time, the $10 million legal charge in the quarter, why is that not sort of pulled out as a onetime charge?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: Well, consistent with some of our recent practice, we've been absorbing the positives and minuses in our P&L. So, even last year, just two quarters ago, we had a $10 million favorable legal litigation settlement related to asbestos, for instance, and we didn't adjust that out. And so, as we look at it, in terms of maintaining consistency with recent practice, what we saw even in the last year, we thought it appropriate to just keep that in the baseline results and just absorb it and outperform and hit our results even with that headwind.
Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. A few follow-up questions. First, with the litigation, since the Sixth Circuit has already ruled, are you talking about either a potential en banc appeal or requesting that it go back to the Supreme Court?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think the first step, Brian, is an en banc appeal.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: We should (31:05) to UAW's intention here most likely before the end of the week. But they're asking for an en banc appeal, but that's the first step in the process.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Second question, there certainly been some tweets out of Tesla on all-electric semi trucks, as well as your partner Volvo AB is piloting some hybrid electric long-haul trucks. Setting aside the debate on where it makes sense, where it doesn't make sense, but if you just think of the potential Meritor content on a hybrid electric truck and then on a electric truck, maybe differentiated between long-haul and in-town delivery, how would you see that evolving?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, great question, Brian. This area I'm spending quite a bit of time on having our electrification team, in fact, is reported directly to me. And so, I think on the Class 8 linehaul, what we're seeing is much of the industry is looking at solutions that are prior to the drive axle, probably with the exception of Nikola and Tesla, which are looking at wheel-end applications. Where there is wheel-end applications, we've been deeply involved in many of those, as you know, with Nikola in developing independent suspension solutions really out of our military applications derived from those applications to help them with those designs. Where it is prior to the drive axle, so many of them are a series or parallel hybrid applications coming through the transmission and replacing that transmission. It still uses a traditional drive axle, but in fact, as you may recall a number of years ago, we've been updating this product ever since. We had a series in parallel hybrid solution that Walmart was running on a Navistar vehicle. So, a lot of the OEs are looking to us for some design expertise there as well.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just maybe – you mentioned military, and I know you always discuss this at the annual meeting. We certainly have a new administration, not much happened to defense budget in the continuing resolution. But just where do you think discussions are vis-à-vis the various land vehicle programs that you are involved with, could be involved with, could be accelerated, and how do you see that shaping up?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think the timing is still unclear. But obviously, the next one appears to be on the road map is the recapitalization of the FMTV fleet, which we are involved with some customers on and looking at providing certain products and either varying levels of content. And then we expect shortly after that the HMMWV recap will be revisited, which we, again, have potential for significant content.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And thanks for the update on the Sixth Circuit decision. Most of my questions there have been answered. But I thought to ask what your understanding or your council's understanding is of the likelihood of success on the UAW's part in the appeals process. I think it's quite low, but I thought to ask.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Very difficult for us to speculate on that. I think we obviously asked that question, and as a client of our firm, we've remained – for our legal firm we've remained bullish on that but very difficult for us to speculate. As you know, this is a highly politicized issue. So, I think there are a lot of puts and takes in the courts that we can't always control. So, we'll just have to wait and see and continue to perform on our current plan and just hope that the ruling is upheld.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just a question on the outlook. It looks like you're raising your guidance for most items although FCF didn't tick up. I was just curious what the puts and takes are there this year relative to...
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Is this on (35:32) cash flow, Ryan?
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. Yeah.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: I think the primary issue is like how we dealt with the last upturn in North America that we experienced, we preemptively built inventory banks (35:42) to make certain that we responded to (35:46) uptakes and order demand. And so, we've taken that same strategic approach this time because we think it builds enormous long-term franchise value for Meritor in the last upturn. And so, we are beginning to build some targeted strategic inventory bank (36:07) so that's why we're not expecting the cash flow performance to near term mirror the uptick in earnings and revenue.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then just lastly from me, there was that earlier question about the electrification of commercial vehicle drivetrains. You've talked before about the 14X HE (36:24) axle which has the potential to improve the payback period of truck and bus hybrid systems. How far along in development would you say that this product is, this axle is? And then are you coming to the point now where you can begin to quote it out to commercial vehicle manufacturers and whether or not you are that far along? Are you able to sort of gauge initial customer interest?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, we're having many meetings with potential customers and integrators. In fact, earlier this week, I was out in Silicon Valley meeting with a few electrification integrators who were very interested in the product because of the packaging it allows the vehicle manufacturers to put more battery capacity compared to some of the current designs that they're looking at deploying. We will have a prototype at the NACV Show here in September, and we are in preliminary discussions, I would say, with most of our OE customers and some new partners about potentially launching that axle.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Very interesting. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel with Stifel. Your line is open.
Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. You called out in your press release that increasing your share of the aftermarket is one of your strategies. Could you just sort of explain how you expect to do that at a high level?
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Sure. What we've done is we've looked for categories where we believe we have a stronger right to play, for example, some gearing and drivetrain categories, for example, and looked at filling out our portfolio in those areas and launching new products and also looking at improving our delivery and distribution network. So, we're evaluating whether we – and are beginning to launch the execution of some new warehouse and delivery sites so we can shorten the speed to market in terms of delivery of product. We also, as I mentioned on the call, updated our website and our online capabilities to be much more user friendly. And as I mentioned on the call, we're starting to see these very focused efforts begin to generate revenue in line with our M2019 objectives.
Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. And I also wanted to ask you, if you had thoughts on the trajectory of the OEMs, production rates, as we go throughout the calendar year. Do you expect the second half to tail off at all or just sort of accelerate from the second quarter?
Kevin Nowlan - Meritor, Inc.: I think we're expecting – I mean, what we're seeing right now is production levels in the current quarter are ramping up, and we're expecting to see that through at least the balance of our fiscal year. So, we're seeing a strong uptick here in the third quarter that we're now sitting in.
Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. And just wanted to ask you one on China, I know it's not too big of a part of your revenue business, but there is some conflicting things we've heard from other companies here. And do you think the sort of surging activity sort of early this year was more of a first or second quarter event and do you think it's sustainable through the end of the year? (39:52)
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Well, frankly, I think it's been sustained longer than our initial expectation, so we're seeing the housing construction market remain strong, for example, which is driving XCMG's revenues and also pulling demand on our axle products. What we're also very encouraged long term is that the market seems to be moving up to that mid-tier more rapidly than we may have expected on the on-highway products, which is, if you recall, in our M2019 strategy, is a significant component bringing our on-highway drive axles to that market. So, we're also very encouraged with the long-term prospects in that market for us.
Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks very much.
Jeffrey A. Craig - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that ends our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer, for closing remarks.
Carl D. Anderson - Meritor, Inc.: Thank you, Heather. This does conclude our second quarter earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. And again, we thank you for your participation.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you all may disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cummins Inc. First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the call over to Vice President of Financial Operations, Mr. Mark Smith. Please go ahead, sir. 
Mark Smith: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2017. Joining me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We'll all be available for your questions at the end of the prepared remarks.
 Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the meaning of Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available on the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the SEC, particularly the Risk Factor section of our most recently filed annual and quarterly reports.
 During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures. Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements, and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading Investors and Media.
 Now I'll hand it over to Tom. Thank you. 
N. Linebarger: Thank you, Vice President Smith. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide you a summary of our first quarter results as well as some comments on our outlook for 2017. Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.
 But before I provide my comments in the quarter, I'd like to talk about a recently announced agreement with Eaton, to form a joint venture to design, develop and manufacture automated transmissions. We are very excited about this joint venture with Eaton, and we have provided some additional slides on our website, which lay out why this joint venture presents a significant opportunity for Cummins. 
 The strategic rationale for the joint venture is simple. Since fuel is one of the largest cost drivers for our customers, fuel efficiency will be a primary differentiator of commercial powertrains across our global markets. Cummins and Eaton have been partners for decades and today, offer the leading combination of engine and transmission performance in the North American heavy-duty truck market. We believe that the next-generation of transmissions designed, developed and manufactured by the joint venture, combined with Cummins capability and system integration, can yield significant improvements in fuel efficiency for Cummins and our OEM customers and partners.
 Cummins will invest $600 million for a 50% share of this joint venture. And in return, we'll be able to develop integrated powertrains that offer a significant performance advantage, add to our portfolio of technology offerings to our customers and benefit from the value created by the joint venture as it leads the secular shift to more automated transmissions. 
 Eaton will contribute the current design for the next-generation heavy-duty automated manual transmission if current automated manual transmission meet for medium-duty markets call to precision specific manufacturing assets as well as intellectual property and people associated with the development, testing and assembly of automated transmission. 
 The joint venture has a clear path to profitable growth, and we'll benefit from accelerating transition from a fully manual transmission -- excuse me, to automated transmissions from fully manual transmissions in global markets. We expect that the next generation of products with advanced performance will gain market share, and a joint venture will leverage Cummins' strong position to grow in international markets where the penetration of automated transmission is currently very low.
 The joint venture will also capture aftermarket revenues. We project that the joint venture can more than triple its current sales of approximately $300 million over the next 5 years. Cummins will consolidate the results of the joint venture within the Components segment, and we expect that the joint venture will be operational in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals.
 Now let me turn to our first quarter financial results. Revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the first quarter of 2016 and stronger than we anticipated 3 months ago. EBIT was $566 million or 12.3% compared to $484 million or 11.3% a year ago. All 4 operating segments increased sales, EBIT dollars and EBIT percent. Our incremental EBIT margin was 28%. 
 Engine business revenues increased by 2% in the first quarter due to strong sales to construction customers, especially in China. EBIT for the quarter -- for the first quarter was 11.3% compared to 10% for the same period in 2016, with the increase due to profitable growth in our off-highway business and strong performance in our on-highway joint ventures in China.
 Sales for the Distribution segment increased by 12% with organic sales growth of 6%, driven by stronger demand for engine rebuilds, parts and new engines on on-highway markets. We acquired the last remaining joint venture distributor in North America in the fourth quarter last year, and this acquisition contributed 6% to growth. First quarter EBIT was 6.1% compared to 5.9% in the first quarter of 2016 and improved as a result of the higher organic sales. 
 First quarter revenues for the Component segment increased by 9%, primarily driven by strong growth in sales to Chinese truck OEMs. EBIT for the first quarter was 13.3% compared to 13.2% in the same quarter a year ago and much improved from the fourth quarter last year when we incurred additional launch cost associated with our new single module aftertreatment system in North America.
 We made clear progress in reducing the cost of the single module and improving supply chain performance in the first quarter. And we expect to see further improvement in the second quarter. Our system sales increased by 9% in the first quarter, primarily driven by an increase in new engine and aftermarket sales to mining and oil and gas customers. EBIT in the first quarter was 6.5% compared to 5.7% a year ago due to the benefit of higher sales and lower operating costs. 
 During the quarter, we had disappointing performance on a large power project in the U.K., and excluding the impact of this single project, first quarter incremental EBIT margin was 40%. We expect profitability to improve for the rest of the year and again in 2018, as we get the full benefits from the restructuring of our U.K. generator set -- assembly operation, which continues to progress on schedule.
 Now I will comment on our performance in some of our key markets for the first quarter of 2017, starting with North America, and then also discuss some of our largest international markets.
 Our revenues in North America increased 1% in the first quarter with higher sales from the distribution -- distributor acquisition more than offsetting lower Engine and Component sales to the North American heavy- and medium-duty truck markets. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks declined by 20% in the first quarter of 2017 while our sales of heavy-duty engines declined only 12%, as our market share for the quarter improved to 32.7% from 29% a year ago. Production of medium-duty trucks declined 6% in the first quarter while our engine shipments declined 9% with our market share of 72%, down from 76% a year ago.
 Our shipments of engines to pickup truck customers in North America declined by 1%, but we remain on course for a strong year in this segment. Engine sales for the construction market in North America increased 10% in the first quarter, reflecting increased customer confidence after a challenging couple of years in which the market had to absorb an excess supply of used equipment, resulting from the slowdown in oil and gas markets. Shipments to high horsepower markets in North America increased by 42% compared to very weak levels last year due to the higher sales to oil and gas and rail customers. Revenues for Power Generation declined by 1% with growth in consumer markets, offset by lower sales to data center customers.
 Our international revenues increased by 17% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.1 billion, an increase of 49% due to growth in our on-highway and construction businesses. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 73% for the first quarter, driven by a higher pace of infrastructure investment and truck replacement in response to overloading regulations introduced last year.
 Our market share for the first quarter was 14%, down from 15% last year. Sales of our ISG heavy-duty engine to Foton grew in line with the market, but growth in Dongfeng's truck sales were not as strong as the industry as a whole. Last quarter, we discussed actions that we were taking to improve performance of the ISG engine in some applications, and we have made good progress in executing on our plans to support customers who are able to reduce the cost of these actions below our initial expectations.
 Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 22%, well ahead of the overall market growth of 12% as Foton continued to increase the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engines, displacing local competitor engines. Our market share during the quarter was 7.6%, up a further 60 basis points from a year ago. 
 Demand for construction equipment doubled from a year ago in China in response to stronger infrastructure investment. Our construction engine volumes increased by over 300% as OEMs ramped up their production of excavators. Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 3% due to continued weakness in Power Generation, marine and mining markets.
 First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $408 million, a 5% increase from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production declined 3% compared to a strong quarter a year ago while our market share increased 1% to 39%. Revenues for Power Generation equipment increased by 9%. We also grew sales in marine and rail markets as a result of growing infrastructure investment.
 In Brazil, our revenues increased by 13%, all driven by appreciation of the real as end markets remained very weak. 
 Now let me provide an overall outlook for 2017 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are now forecasting total company revenues for 2017 to increase 4% to 7%, higher than our prior guidance of flat to down 5% with a modest increase in our projections for a number of regions and end markets. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 195,000 units, up from our prior forecast of 178,000 units in 2017 but still down 3% from last year and below replacement demand. 
 We expect our full year market share to be between 29% and 32%, unchanged from our previous projection. In the medium-duty truck market, we have raised our outlook for the market size to be 112,000 units, up 4% to 2016 and up from our prior guidance. We project our market share to be in the range of 73% to 75%, consistent with our view 3 months ago. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to increase 1% for the full year.
 In China, we expect full year domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to grow 11% compared to our previous guidance of up 3%. We have raised our outlook for demand for medium- and heavy-duty truck markets to exceed 1 million units, a 7% increase from our previous guidance. Our forecast anticipates the demand for trucks will slow from first quarter levels due to normal seasonality and a slowing of truck replacement. We expect the light-duty truck market to grow 3% in 2017 compared to our previous guidance of flat. 
 Our market share in the medium- and heavy-duty truck market we expect to be 15%, flat with 2016. And in light duty, we expect our share to exceed 8%, up from 7% last year. We currently project 10% to 15% growth in off-highway markets in China compared to our previous guidance of up just 5%, primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment. 
 In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat compared to our previous projection of a 5% decline, due mainly to a stronger rupee. We currently project 5% growth in off-highway markets, offset by an expected 10% to 15% decline in truck demand. 
 In Brazil, we expect truck production to be flat in 2017, unchanged from our previous projection with no clear signs of improvement in the near term.
 We expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to grow 10% to 15% compared to our previous guidance of no growth in 2017. Demand has picked up in mining and oil and gas markets compared to extremely weak levels last year.
 In summary, we expect full year of sales to increase 4% to 7% compared to our prior forecast of flat to down 5%. We are experiencing an increase in some commodity costs, which we are working hard to mitigate. Rising commodity costs should be supportive of growing demand for capital goods but in the near term, will likely reduce our net material cost savings in the second half of the year compared to our original expectations. 
 Our forecast for EBIT is now in the range of 11.75% to 12.5%, above our previous guidance of 11% to 11.5% of sales. During the quarter, we returned $222 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plans to return at least 50% of our operating cash flow this year. We're off to a solid start, and I look forward to updating you again next quarter.
 Now let me turn it over to Pat. 
Patrick Ward: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the company's first quarter financial results before discussing the performance of each of the 4 operating segments in more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the rest of the year. 
 First quarter revenues were $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% from a year ago after 6 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines, the longest period of year-over-year revenue decline since 2002. The sales in North America, which represented 57% of the first quarter revenues, increased 1% from a year ago primarily due to increased revenue in the Distribution segment, which more than offset lower Engine and Component revenues due to a decline in heavy- and medium-duty truck production compared to the previous year. International sales improved by 17% from a year ago primarily due to increased sales in China and in Europe, which offset weakness in the Middle East.
 Gross margins were 24.6% of sales, unchanged from last year. The benefits from increased volumes were offset by warranty expense, which was a 50 basis point headwind, as we increased accrual rates with new engine introductions and recorded   non-favorable change in estimates on older engines. 
 Selling, admin and research and development costs of $695 million or 15.1% of sales decreased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points but increased by $39 million from a year ago mainly due to higher compensation expense.
 Joint venture income of $108 million increased by $36 million compared to a year ago as a result of strong market demand in China for both on- and off-highway equipment.
 Earnings before interest and tax improved to $566 million or 12.3% of sales in the quarter compared to 11.3% a year ago, and this reflects a 28% incremental EBIT margin.
 Net earnings for the quarter were $396 million or $2.36 per diluted share compared to $1.87 from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%, in line with our full year guidance of 26%.
 Moving on to operating segments. Let me summarize their performance in the quarter, and then I will review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and conclude with some comments on cash flow for the quarter.
 In the Engine segment, revenues were $2 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 2% from last year. International revenues were up 11% primarily due to growth in off-highway markets in China. Revenues in North America declined by 1% due to lower on-highway revenues as a result of the lower production of heavy-duty trucks. 
 Segment EBIT in the first quarter was $229 million or 11.3% of sales. This compares to 10% of sales from a year ago. The margin improvement was driven by higher joint venture income, favorable pricing and material cost savings, which were partially offset by a higher warranty cost and an increase in current product support expense to support recently launched products.
 For the Engine segment in 2017, we now expect revenues to be up 2% to 6% compared to our previous guidance of down 3% to 6% with -- due to an improved outlook in most of our markets. Our forecast for EBIT margins is to be in the range of 10.25% to 11.25% of sales compared to 9.5% to 10.5% previously. 
 For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.6 billion, which increased 12% compared to last year. Organic sales for the quarter increased by 6%, and revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 added an additional 6%. The EBIT margin for the quarter was $100 million or 6.1% of sales compared to 5.9% a year ago. The improvement to margins from an increase in sales during the quarter was partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs from the integration of previous acquisitions.
 For 2017, Distribution revenue is now projected to increase 4% to 8% compared to our previous guidance of flat to up 4% with the increase driven by improvements in off-highway markets and higher parts sales. We still expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 6% to 6.75% of sales as higher variable compensation and benefits offset improvements to operating margins.
 For the Components segment, revenues were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, a 9% increase from a year ago. International revenues grew 25% primarily due to a 60% increase in sales in China, which more than offset a 2% decrease in North American revenues due to the lower heavy- and medium-duty commercial truck production. Segment EBIT was $179 million or 13.3% of sales compared to 13.2% of sales a year ago. As mentioned in our previous call, we did incur additional expenses to support the launch of our Single Module aftertreatment system, but we were able to mitigate part of the cost we previously forecast while still meeting the delivery commitments in the quarter.
 For 2017, we now expect revenue to be up 6% to 10% compared to our prior guidance of a 2% to 6% decline. The change in guidance reflects stronger-than-anticipated demand in the China truck market and improved outlook for the North American heavy- and medium-duty truck market. EBIT is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of sales compared to 11% to 12% in the previous forecast. 
 In the Power System segment, first quarter revenues were $882 million, an increase of 9% from a year ago. The increase in revenues for the segment was driven primarily by a 28% increase in industrial markets led by mining and oil and gas with growth in new engine and rebuild revenues. Global Power Generation markets remain weak despite a slow revenue gain in the quarter. EBIT margins were 6.5% of sales in the quarter, up from 5.7% last year due to the increase in industrial engine shipments. 
 For 2017, we expect Power Systems segment revenues to be up 1% to 5% versus the previous guidance of flat to down 4% due to increased customer demand from mining and oil and gas engines in addition to higher part sales. EBIT margins are still expected to be between 7% and 8% of sales with this segment experiencing a more significant increase in commodity costs than we anticipated at the start of the year. 
 For the company, we are raising our outlook for revenues to be up 4% to 7% versus our previous guidance of flat to down 5%. The increase is primarily due to improving off-highway market demand, stronger-than-anticipated growth in China and a more resilient North American truck market.
 Foreign currency headwinds are expected to reduce revenues by approximately $180 million, slightly lower than the $200 million impact in our previous forecast. The guidance provided today does not include the impacts from the announcement of the Eaton-Cummins joint venture. We will provide a forecast upon regulatory approval of the deal. 
 Income from the joint ventures is now expected to be relatively flat from last year. Our strong results in China will offset the impact of the acquisition of the last remaining North American distributor in the fourth quarter of 2016.
 We now expect EBIT margins to be between 11.75% and 12.5% for 2017, up from our previous forecast of between 11% and 11.5%. The increase in profitability reflects increased outlook for both the global off-highway markets and the North American truck market. 
 Finally, turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities for the first quarter was $379 million, which was a 42% increase from a year ago.
 We anticipate operating cash flow in 2017 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditure during the quarter was $81 million, and we still expect investments to be in the range of $500 million to $530 million this year. And as Tom said, in the first quarter, we returned $222 million to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. And for 2017, we plan to return at least 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders, in line with our long-term commitment.
 Now let me turn it back over to Mark. 
Mark Smith: Okay. Thank you, Pat. And we're now ready to move to the Q&A section of the call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. 
Steven Fisher: Wondering if you can give us a sense of the visibility you have on oil and gas and mining rebuilds for the rest of the year. Clearly a source of strength in the quarter, and obviously an ideal scenario would be that you get these Power and off-highway going at the same time as you have on-highway. Would that be a scenario that we see later in the year? 
Richard Freeland: Okay. Steven, it's Rich. Yes, we're off to a good start on the oil and gas rebuilds. In fact, they're off some relatively low numbers that is up 300% right now. And it's pretty broad-based. So we're seeing that kind of across geographies, although primarily North America, but across geographies in North America. What we also saw in Q1 is some new orders for new frac rigs. And so that is a little less broad-based. We've seen that with 1 or 2 customers, and that's the one kind of yet to be determined is kind of the rate of new versus putting idled equipment back to work. But I think the rebuild piece will continue through the year. 
Steven Fisher: And that's what you have baked in your 10% to 15% for high-horsepower for the rest of the year? 
Mark Smith: Well, that's the engine shipment, Steve, not rebuilds but the overall -- it's embedded in the Power Systems guidance. 
Steven Fisher: Okay, and just, Tom, last quarter, you stated a lot of dealer inventory in construction in China. So, I guess, how surprised are you that the China construction was so strong? Was this further building of inventories? Or is it all getting deployed on projects? And then what does that imply for your second half expectations? 
Richard Freeland: It looks to be not an inventory build. It appears to be that of the inventory we -- is a little higher than what we thought. It seems to be, again, a little more broad-based on the construction side. We were surprised by it. Okay, it was not in our forecast. But there seems to be a little more sentiment, maybe not data, that says that this could continue on the construction side, in the excavator side in particular. 
N. Linebarger: Steve, utilization rates are definitely up, and so that's a good sign. That means people are using the equipment there in addition to buying some new. So that's a good sign. I think it's worth us being cautious just to see where dealer inventory levels are and to understand all that, but we definitely saw sell-through higher and we saw utilization rates higher, both of which are a good sign. Question is how lasting is it, and how healthy are the dealers and how's the inventory looking? We've still got some more work to do to understand that because frankly, we were surprised by the uptick. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Crédit Suisse. 
Jamie Cook: I guess a couple of questions. One relates to your full year guidance. When you guys guided last quarter, you said the first quarter should be the lightest for a number of different reasons. Yet, if we look at your margins for the quarter, they came in at like 12.3%, which is the midpoint of your full year guide. So something doesn't seem right. Maybe we're conservative, maybe the cost on ISG and the single modular treatment system was lower in the first quarter than we thought. So if you could just sort of walk me through the guidance and whether there's potential for upside. And then, I guess, my second question, Tom, specifically on the Eaton-Cummins joint venture, just a little more color, I guess, I'm looking at it, you're paying $600 million for potentially $900 million or more of revenues 5 years out, which just seems, I don't know, light or expensive to me. So are there incremental positives that perhaps the market is underappreciating? And I don't know what... 
Patrick Ward: Jamie, this is Patrick. Let me start -- Sorry, let me start with... 
Jamie Cook: Sorry, I don't know what your assumptions are behind that. So sorry, go ahead. 
Patrick Ward: Sorry, I interrupted you there. Let me take the first question, and then Tom can take your second question that I rudely interrupted. So on the full year guidance, the first quarter includes very strong earnings from China and our China JVs in particular. And traditionally we tend to see a mix of 60% of China revenues in the first half of the year, 40% in back half of the year. We are a little bit hesitant to assume that the strong demand that we're seeing through the first quarter, what we'll probably expect to see in the second quarter and will continue into the second half of the year. It's close to [ the announcements ] overloading regulations come into play that's clearly been a factor that'll be driving that. So we are saying second half earnings will drop in China from first half. And that's probably the #1 reason why we are -- maybe our guidance feels a little bit weaker in the second half of the year. The other fact that is material cost, which drove 80 basis points of margin improvement in the first half of the year as we see rising commodity prices through the year. For the full year, we expect that to be nearly in line with a 50 basis point improvement. So other than that, everything else should continue much as we've seen so far. 
N. Linebarger: Jamie, thanks for your question on the Eaton JV. So here's the -- and again, in simple terms, we're convinced that leading powertrains will be integrated. That will be industry-wide, that will be whether you have a diesel engine driving at a fuel cell or a battery. We think integrated powertrains will win. So and that's basically performance quality, all the elements that we think make a difference. And as you know, as a company, we have continued to invest in the components that we think are essential to driving performance in fuel efficiency and emissions for powertrains because we think that's what made us successful in differentiating in a market of integrateds with a powertrain focus. So we think we have to have an integrative powertrain. So as we discussed in New York a couple of years ago, that we've been focused on figuring out ways to do that, and we looked at every single option available to us and explored every option in detail. And we felt like, given the consolidation of the industry, it's already highly consolidated and it's going to consolidate further, both strategically and technically, we needed to figure out a move into powertrains. And our view is that this is by far the most attractive entry point that we could find. And we looked at everything. And so we feel really good about this. Good because we think we're getting leading technology that's implementable right now, that we are partnering with a customer -- I mean, a partner that we feel we have a strong -- it's just cultural share -- we share cultural values, we operate successfully in the past, we know each other well so we can ramp up very quickly. And lastly, we see opportunities for growth outside of the base plan internationally as those markets begin to ramp up into automated transmission. And then we think by providing a better powertrain, our view is we can grow engine share. And of course, that's the big variable in the mix. The variable that's hard to calculate in here is what happens to our engine share with and without this joint venture, and we are 100% convinced that when you start looking at that, this deal looks not only attractive to Cummins but essential to our strategy. 
Jamie Cook: Is there any way you could provide a range of how the range of where market share should go? Like just the variability around that? So the joint venture could make more sense. Can 30% go to 40% in heavy-duty? Or is it in China? I'm just trying to think about how to justify the investment. 
N. Linebarger: I think we will as the joint venture begin to talk about what our growth plans are, et cetera. We need to complete the transaction. As you know, there's a series of regulatory approvals in front of us. And before those are completed, we need to -- we just need to say the main things and then do our legal work. When that's done, I believe we'll be able to say a lot more what we plan to do together. And I'm 100% convinced that the shareholders of Cummins will believe that this was an essential move and a good move for the company. And I believe the shareholders of Eaton will agree with that. So I feel again very excited about this joint venture. And again just from a financial point of view, it doesn't take a lot of math to figure out how this could be attractive for Cummins. Again, you basically have to understand that or agree with the basic premise that this is essential to being successful in powertrains. But once you do that, I think it works -- it's pretty straightforward. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. 
Ann Duignan: Could you do us a favor and just comment on a little bit more on pricing versus input costs? Could you quantify the impact of higher input costs and when you would expect to be able to offset the higher input costs? And then as a follow-up, I get a lot of questions recently on penetration of electric vehicles and autonomous driving, et cetera, et cetera. Could you just maybe comment on Cummins perception of the penetration of electric vehicles in particular, particularly in long hauls? 
Mark Smith: Ann, this is Mark. So on pricing would be probably closer to net neutral for the year on pricing across our various segments. Where we're having the biggest challenges is, as Pat mentioned, the cost is rising particularly in the Power Systems business, and as you know, we're experiencing still weak global demand in Power Generation. So it's -- when you've got persistent weak demand, you've got that balancing act to choose, Ann, which you want to press the price lever. So we'll continue to evaluate what options we've got there. And as we've said, well, hopefully that's going to be supportive of growing capital goods demand going forward. But definitely, less of a net favorable in the second half than the first half. 
N. Linebarger: And Ann, this is Tom. Thanks for your question on the technology area. So not surprising, I guess, in our strategy work, we've done several years of work now developing both projections and analysis of substitute technologies that might play a role in our end markets. And we are convinced that electrification, specifically, will substitute in some of our applications over a period of time. And again, our projections for that depend on large degree, as you guess, on how battery and power electronics costs come down and performance goes up, especially the energy side, how much I can store and then also the cost of fuel and other kinds of environmental-related costs. But assuming most of our scenarios come up with electrification playing significant role in cities, especially stop-and-go applications, bus, maybe refuse, pickup and delivery trucks, we think it will play a significant role, especially after it makes major substitution in cars since that will drop cost and increase volume. And we intend, by the way, to compete in that business and win. So we have already launched a electrification business development area in our company, it's people dedicated to not only launching the fully electrified powertrains but are currently selling those powertrains to some customers. So we intend to compete and win. These are our markets, buses, refuse vehicles, we are the leader in those markets. So we intend to be the leader in those markets when they're electrified. And we already have pilot products running with fully electrified powertrains designed and built by Cummins. So we will compete in those markets, and we believe we'll win. And so the fully integrated powertrains, as I was mentioning to Jamie, we think are Cummins' future be they diesel-driven, battery-driven, or otherwise. We also think, by the way, fuel cells could potentially play a role in longer haul. One of the challenges for battery driven longer-haul trucks, which is I think might be obvious in your question, is that you use most of the weight that you would otherwise carry goods for batteries. And so right now, it doesn't look like that's a winner based on the technologies that are available now or in the foreseeable future. Whereas fuel cells, I think, do a better job of -- still heavier than diesel because the fuel necessary but closer and some of the same advantages as other electrified powertrains. But there's a long way of development to go on fuel cells. They're not nearly as close from a cost performance and quality point of view as batteries are. So both of those technologies, by the way, I mentioned electrified powertrains and fuel cells, are feasible and could play a role. But both are relatively modest sellers today even in the car side. So it'll be a number of years. We know from a natural gas front that even when things are very attractive, it takes a long time to substitute in mature markets. And right now, neither of those technologies is attractive. So there's work to do to make them more attractive, and then there's work to make them work in commercial operations in a sensible way that will work for commercial operators, who, as you know, are very sensitive to capital returns. So I think they'll definitely play a role. It's going to be some time before the markets are large enough to make a big dent, but we intend to lead in both. And we are putting together the technologies and the customers to be able to do that. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich: Tom, for your significant joint ventures in the past, you folks have been able to deliver mid-teen margins by leveraging SG&A. And I'm wondering in the Eaton-Cummins joint venture, would you folks expect a similar profile once that business ramps? Or is there anything structurally different on the joint venture either in pass-through calls or R&D intensity that we should keep in mind as we move towards hopefully the 5-year revenue targets that you laid out? 
N. Linebarger: Absolutely the same approach, Jerry. As you said, this one because we have a lot of upfront development to get the products to markets. It'll be heavier on R&D expense in early years, but as the revenues ramp up, we expect to be at very similar margins. And again, that's a little bit why we feel confident with this. It looks like a lot of things we have done before with a partner that we really like working with and know very well. So we have every expectation we'll be able to operate at similar margins as JVs we've operated before. 
Jerry Revich: And Tom, how back-end loaded is the ramp? Do we have to look for a significant new product introduction cycle so we're -- see a bigger contribution in terms of the growth rate 2020, 2021? Or can we see it kick in potentially sooner? 
N. Linebarger: There's at least 18 to 24 months of developments dominating the expense ratios in the joint ventures, so that is awhile. I mean, from that point of view, we have a lot of work in front of us to do. Again, a lot of the work has been done on the base transmission, but there's a lot of work to do for integrating with customers. And I think that's, again, likely to take us 18 to 24 months, and then we'll start to see the ramp up more significantly. So again, we'll be able to say more about that as the joint venture closes and then we can talk a little bit more about who our customers are and all those sorts of things. But I think just generally speaking, it's first couple of years with more light development, and there'll be sales, of course, but there's going to be pretty heavy development costs. 
Jerry Revich: Okay. And then, Rich, China Foton Cummins that you folks had warranty issues that you're working through last quarter. Can you give us an update on how the business performed this quarter? Were there any warranty or product introduction-related costs and the outlook for those costs over the next couple of quarters? 
Richard Freeland: Yes, thanks, Jerry. Just to remind you, we talked about we had some specific issues in some different regions and different markets, duty cycles we're working through and incurred some cost. And the good news is we've worked through those faster and actually been able to reduce the cost of doing that. As I talked last quarter, I said we'd be living with those through the first half of the year. And so we're really pleased that we got through it well, took care of customers and generally, by the end of Q1, have any unusual cost behind us. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America. 
Ross Gilardi: I'm just wondering if you could talk about capital allocation from here. I mean, you made an investment that you think is very attractive, but you haven't added the leverage that you initially identified that you'll be willing to consider. So should we be anticipating other acquisitions from here? Are those leveraged targets you talked about a year, 1.5 years ago still kind of in the game plan? Or is it just the valuations across a lot of the areas of interest have become too expensive, and we should sort of expect Cummins to go back to returning more cash? 
N. Linebarger: Thanks for the question, Ross. So the answer is we are still pursuing our strategic areas that we talked about 1.5 years ago. I think maybe as you saw in the Eaton joint venture and our powertrain expansion, we think to do a good deal takes more time than to do a lousy deal, or at least that's what we're seeing in the market. To your point, valuations are pretty high in some places. So in typical fashion, to do the things that we think adds strategic growth and profitable growth to Cummins and good capital returns just turns out are taking us some effort to work through. And that's, I guess, that's probably to be expected. But we intend to continue to pursue those areas. And yes, the leverage targets we laid out to you are still what we think makes sense for the company. We haven't changed that at all. And we have a number of things that we're pursuing right now that we hope to be able to turn into attractive projects for the company. But as you suggested by your question, we look through a lot of things that turn out to be less attractive, frankly, from a return point of view and therefore, pass them by. So I think we are active still. I'm confident that we're going to find other good things that will add to the growth and profitability and return profile of the company. But it's taken some effort and some work to grind through those, and we're still active in them though. 
Ross Gilardi: And then just as a follow-up on that. There were some news reports a couple of months ago about the potential sale of, I believe your filtration business. And I don't know if you can comment on that, and if you can't, just wondering is there any reason to anticipate that Cummins would ever consider a sizable divestiture if you don't actually have a larger target on the horizon, given the strength of your balance sheet today? 
N. Linebarger: Yes, thanks. That's a great question, Ross. The filtration business is not for sale as we said then, so I'll just repeat that. The second thing is that we don't -- we would not link our sale of a division with the need to acquire another division, another business. And the reason is as you remember from the strategy discussion 1.5 years ago, we have enough debt capacity and capital raising ability to acquire a company that we would be interested in, at least the ones that we're considering. We have enough with our existing balance sheet and cash. So we just don't see that as necessary. We would consider selling parts of Cummins in the same way as we always have, which is if we believe that a division is no longer strategically essential to the company, in the sense that it's not making the whole greater than the sum, which has been kind of the way we thought about our business for a long time. If it's not doing that, then if we think the shareholders would benefit from the price that we can get versus what we can generate internally, we'd sell it. And we do a review of our big divisions across the company every single year with that exactly in mind. So we believe that the shareholder -- we owe the shareholders that work to say are -- is the current portfolio of Cummins best owned by Cummins and by the shareholders or should we sell something to realize value and then put it to work in a new and better way. So we go through our divisions and look at those, and so we would always -- we always do that. And if one of them ended up in that box that said it's not strategic and we think we can get a better valuation, at the very least, we would go test to see if we can get that valuation. And if we could, we would sell it. And if we couldn't, we would not. So that's something we do as a matter of strategic practice. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. 
Nicole DeBlase: So my first question is around mining. So I thought it was good that you guys went through with [ Reynolds ] in oil and gas for rebuilds versus OE, but we've heard from some mining OEMs that OE activity's actually picking up a bit so I'm just curious if you're seeing something similar? 
Richard Freeland: Yes, Nicole, we are. So it's -- again, like in oil and gas, we're seeing it first on parts, which we started to see, in fact, last year. And that's continued. So our part sales are up double digits in the high-horsepower space, mostly driven by mining and oil and gas. And so from the engine side or the OEM side, we're now projecting up 10% to 20%. So we are seeing some of that kind of come through and a little less of the idled equipment to deal with that we have in the oil and gas business. So early days, commodity prices are up. And so there's certainly more activity and more discussion, and we're starting to see it in some orders. 
Nicole DeBlase: Okay, got it. That's really helpful. And, I guess, my second question is just around China. So last quarter, you guys talked about a competitive pricing environment within China truck. I'm just curious if that's continued into the first quarter? Or if you've seen that eased? 
Mark Smith: I don't think it's impacting our results right now. So that probably there hasn't been significant change at this point in time. 
N. Linebarger: Yes, most of that was related to market share acquisition by one OEM of the other that launched some new models, that we're trying to acquire. And with the new regulations that are requiring -- on overloading, that are requiring some fleets to actually purchase new trucks, our expectation is that pricing competition will ease. But frankly, we were even surprised by the size of the growth in the truck market in the first quarter as we were with the excavators. So we have some work to do to understand how well that's going to hold up and how pricing markets are just reflecting back on the first quarter. But right now, we expect the pricing to ease under the circumstances. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. 
Stephen Volkmann: Just a couple of quick follow-ups, and Tom, I apologize, I'm a little bit slow this morning, but I want to make sure I understand with this Cummins-Eaton joint venture, what does this allow you to do that you weren't doing before because I think you already had a pretty close relationship with them previously, and I'm curious why you felt the need to sort of allocate all this capital to this? 
N. Linebarger: Yes, it's a great question, Steve. From our point of view, like with most of our Component businesses, we always have the choice of purchasing outside or bringing something inside. And we typically bring it inside if there's -- if 2 conditions are right. One is that we believe that because of our knowledge of engines and systems, we think we can make a better product for ourselves and for others. And we believe that's true. Now we believe that in integrated powertrains that we can impact the design of the transmission in a positive way by what we bring to the table in terms of engines. Now we can't, of course, do that through partnerships, it's just not as efficient and not as effective to do. So when we think we can make a big positive impact technically, then we want to be bring them in. Second thing is that we believe, in this case, that together, we can offer an integrated powertrain with features that are harder to negotiate on when it's commercial negotiation. We're adding software features, control features, which, frankly, are difficult to price across markets, and we want to make sure that we can do that and win market share in the market and come up with an effective package that includes those features, and which is hard to do so with a commercial arrangement only. I think -- and on the same front, we want to invest in those technologies and features, but we want to make sure that our partners felt that investing was going to earn a return for them. And it wasn't as clear over the long run that they felt that way. So to make sure we could add the technology we want, develop the features, price for the features, et cetera, and to make sure that we can offer a better powertrain we felt the need to bring them in. And again, as I mentioned to Jamie, we spent a long time understanding this, looking at different ways to do it, everything from developing our own solutions to acquisitions and joint ventures in different parts of the world with different partners. And we decided in the end that this was by far the best choice. And I think from Eaton's point of view, they see it in much the same way. 
Stephen Volkmann: Okay, good. That definitely helps. And secondarily, I'm just curious, you talked a little bit about electric drivetrains and fuel cells and so forth, and interesting to hear that you're already sort of testing this stuff. But I'm wondering if you feel like you have internally that kind of core competency that you need there? Or is this a situation where ultimately, you're going to have to either acquire or a joint venture or something in order to be able to do what you need to do with those alternative type drivetrains? 
N. Linebarger: Yes, I think it's much like the situation we just spoke about. Our view is that we have the capability to integrate today, just as we have the capability to integrate a powertrain before. But we will likely want to acquire some subsystems of electrified powertrain to make sure that we not only can do it, but we can do it better than everybody else. So I think it's right what you said that the capabilities that we need to outperform everybody else, we will have to acquire or develop those capabilities in-house for some of the subsystems, things like battery control, packaging, power electronics, especially for the size of the commercial vehicle. These are things where there are suppliers today in the market, but those technologies will develop the fastest and our ability to have the best ones of those subsystem technologies and integrate them the best will certainly require us to invest more in those areas. Whether that means acquiring a company or joint venturing again or otherwise hiring and developing our own will remain to be seen. But we are active in all those spaces to figure out exactly that. Again, there's time in front of us, but we -- so we can produce one now and a good one. But we want be the winner, as I mentioned, which means we're going to have to be expert in some of those subsystem technologies just as we are with diesel, just as we are with natural gas. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer with Barclays. 
Robert Wertheimer: Thanks for the discussion on the sort of forward-thinking strategy. It's very interesting. Tom, if you were rumored to be spending 2/3 of your time on acquisitions, over the past year or 2, do you anticipate that to be just as intense now? Or does the Eaton JV fill a big enough hole that there's a total little bit less? And secondarily, and you've touched on this, but I mean, do you see more opportunity or more need in acquiring things related to hydrogen or related to electric or related to whatever versus maybe the upside of acquiring pools of revenue where you can operate the business a different way about? 
N. Linebarger: Thanks, Rob. I thought where you were going with that is since you spent 2/3 of your time, and all you've got is one joint venture to show for it that you weren't sure the time was well spent, but I'll just assume you didn't mean that. So there is no change in my focus in terms of time. So this joint venture with Eaton is a really important strategic move as I mentioned. We feel very good about it. It only addresses a portion of the strategy areas that we discussed, and so we have a lot more work to go. So I have not slowed down at all. And the answer to your question about which of those is more interesting to us is both. So the way that, I guess, I think about it is that we have things that we need to do to acquire capabilities in order to stay the course. In order to be the leading company in what we do now, we have to continue to develop technologies and in some cases, joint venture and acquire technologies in some of these new technology areas and things like that just as we were just talking to Steve and earlier with Jamie. But we also need to look at opportunities to leverage our capabilities that we have now and potentially expand into new revenue pools. Both of those things are essential for our growth and development as a company. So our -- we're thinking of growth and capability building, both as part of our strategic effort, and I think the Eaton joint venture demonstrates some of both. And so you'll see us continue to look at both as essential to the company's future. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Andrew Casey: Just a couple of follow-ups. The JV stuff has been asked and answered several different ways. But in the near term, it looks like your Power Systems outlook is not anticipating much over the next 3 quarters, and part of that might be this uncertainty that you described with respect to China. But I'm wondering why not more a follow-through given your comments on oil and gas and mining. 
Richard Freeland: Okay. Yes, Andy, it's Rich. Well, again, I think what we have seen is in the Power System area, our part sales are going to be up 16% this year. So we're seeing this kind of broad-based activity, which activity is a precursor, hopefully, to new equipment going in. And so, until we see it, I guess we're not putting that in the forecast. And like I talked in oil and gas, we've even had some indications that this was kind of a onetime bit until some equipment gets rebuilt and refurbished. So we're just paying attention. I think there needs to be some prolonged commodity prices staying higher for a bit longer for the people who are going to make the capital investment. Until we see that, we'll put it in the forecast. And lastly, you know we're prepared for it. So we've got capacity in place, and one of the things we always try to do is be the best at responding when it comes back. And even if we get surprises, if it comes back quickly, which it does sometimes, we'll be ready for that. 
Patrick Ward: The other challenges, Andy, at these low levels, even though mining and gas, oil and gas are improving, still 2/3 of the revenue are tied to Power Gen, which at least for now remain fairly muted. So that's what -- that and the commodity cost, these are the factors we're trying to weigh in the outlook for this year. 
Andrew Casey: Okay. And then another detailed question on warranty, the 50 basis point headwind that you called out in the quarter, and maybe you discussed this, but I missed it. How much of that was the adjustment, meaning the onetime? And how much is kind of go forward for the rest of the year? 
Patrick Ward: The onetime adjustment, Andy, was probably close to 2/3 of it, maybe a little bit more. So that's onetime that will not repeat, has been through for the rest of the year. We did anticipate higher rates, higher expense in the first quarter. As we launch some new engines and we do increase our rates when we launch engines, I think, you'll see warranty come down in the second quarter to more normalized levels, so to speak. 
Mark Smith: Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. Adam and I will be available for your call later. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-02-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2016 Cummins Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Smith, Vice President, Finance, Operations. Please go ahead. 
Mark Smith: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 Joining me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland.

 Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and today's presentation, are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading Investors and Media.
 Now I'll turn it over to Tom. 
N. Linebarger: Thank you, Mark, for that inspiring introduction. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2017. Pat will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. 
 Our references to EBIT and EBIT percent exclude restructuring and impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. EBIT was $526 million or 11.7% compared to $531 million or 11.1% a year ago. 
 EBIT increased as a percentage of sales as the benefits of our cost-reduction actions and the absence of a loss contingency charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 more than offset the impact of weaker volume. 
 For the full year, Cummins sales were $17.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Our EBIT margin was 11.4%, down from 12.5% in 2015. Our decremental EBIT margin for the year was 24%, consistent with our plan even after absorbing $138 million additional accrual for the loss contingency. 
 This solid performance reflects strong execution of our restructuring plan, material cost-reduction programs and quality improvements that helped mitigate the impact of lower volumes in very weak markets. 
 Engine business sales declined by 10% in 2016 due to weaker production of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and softer demand for construction equipment in North America. EBIT was 8.8% compared to 9.9% in 2015 due to the impact of weaker revenues and the increased accrual for the loss contingency in 2016. 
 Sales for our Distribution segment declined by 1% as weaker sales to off-highway markets and the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar offset growth from acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of our last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, bringing the total number of acquisitions to 13 since we announced our plan in September 2013. 
 Full year EBIT was 6.3% compared to 7% in 2015 due to weaker organic sales and the negative impact of currency. Full year revenues for the Components segment decreased by 6% as weaker truck demand in North America more than offset strong growth in China. EBIT was 13.3% compared to 14.5% in 2015, mainly due to the impact of lower sales. EBIT in the fourth quarter was 11.9% as we incurred additional costs associated with the launch of our new Single Module aftertreatment system in North America. 
 We do expect to continue to incur additional costs through the first half of 2017 as we resolve startup issues in our production supply chain for this important new product. 
 Power Systems sales declined by 14% in 2016, with weak demand in most major geographies and end markets. EBIT was 7.5% compared to 8.9% in 2015 as the impact of lower sales more than offset a 17% reduction in operating expenses achieved through restructuring and other cost-reduction activities. 
 We continue to make good progress with our plans to exit our U.K. generator set manufacturing plant in Kent, with high-horsepower generator set assembly now transferred to our Daventry engine plant. By the end of 2017, we will complete the transfer of the remaining wide variety of small generators currently produced in Kent to existing locations in China and India. These actions will position the business for further cost reduction in 2018. 
 Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2016 starting with North America, and then I will comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America declined 12% in 2016, primarily due to lower engine and components sales to North American heavy- and medium-duty truck market. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks declined to 201,000 units, a decrease of 31% from 2015 levels. Our market share clearly improved in the second half of 2016 and exceeded 31% for the full year but was down from 33% in 2015. 2016 marked the 10th straight year that customers have selected Cummins as the leading engine supplier to the heavy-duty truck market. 
 The market size for medium-duty trucks was 108,000 units in 2016, a decline of 13% from 2015. We remain the clear leading engine manufacturer in the medium-duty truck market with full year market share of 75%, down slightly from 78% a year ago. 2016 marked another strong year for pickup truck sales in North America, and we shipped 131,000 engines to Chrysler, slightly ahead of 2015 volumes and sold 19,000 units to Nissan in our first full year of production. 
 Engine sales to construction customers in North America declined 15% in 2016 as the market faced an overhang of equipment inventory and it drove OEMs to cut production. Engine shipments to high-horsepower markets in North America declined by 14% year-over-year, reflecting weaker demand in all end markets. 
 Revenues for Power Generation decreased by 4%, driven by lower sales to rental companies as they cut back their capital expenditures. Our international revenues declined 2% in 2016. Our full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $3.5 billion, an increase of 6%, as some end markets rebounded from weak levels in 2015. 
 Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 28% for the full year as the OEMs increased production, partially driven by new regulations aimed at combating vehicle overloading. Our market share in 2016 was 15%, down from 16% in 2015 as our partner, Dongfeng, lost share in the face of very competitive pricing in the industry. Sales of our ISG heavy-duty engine grew in line with the market. 
 Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 14% while the overall market declined 1% as Foton continue to increase the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engine, displacing local competitor engine. Our full year share in the light-duty truck market exceeded 7% in 2016, up 90 basis points. 
 Earnings at our Foton-Cummins joint ventures declined in 2016 while volumes increased. During the fourth quarter, we initiated actions to improve the performance and reliability of our ISG engine in some duty cycles. We incurred costs in the joint venture to make product changes and support customers. We expect the product improvements to be complete by the third quarter of this year and expect to incur additional costs associated with these actions until the actions are complete, albeit at a lower level than experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. 
 Despite these issues, we remain very confident that the ISG is a game changing-engine for the Chinese truck market, and customer demand for this engine remains strong. 
 Demand for construction equipment in China improved, with sales of excavators rising 19% in 2016. This marks the first annual increase in demand for excavators since 2011, but demand remains well below historical levels. 
 Our construction engine volumes increased by 40% as excavator demand increased and we picked up share in wheel loaders. Revenues for our Power Generation -- Power Systems business, excuse me, in China declined by 17% due to continued weakness in power generation, marine and mining markets. 
 Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, a 7% increase over 2015. Industry truck production increased 8% to 346,000 units, and our market share remained at 41% for 2016, with nearly 80% of Tata Motors trucks powered by our joint venture engines. Revenues for Power Generation increased by 2%. 
 In Brazil, our revenues decreased 19%, driven mainly by an 18% reduction in truck production in a very challenging economy. 
 Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2017 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2017 to be flat to down 5% from 2016. We expect market conditions to continue to be challenging in 2017, especially in the first quarter. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 178,000 units in 2017, an 11% decrease year-over-year. We expect our market share to be between 29% and 32%. 
 In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 108,000 units, flat compared to 2016. We project our market share to be in the range of 73% to 75%. 
 Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be flat compared to a strong 2016. 
 In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be up 3% in 2017. We currently project flat demand in light-, medium- and heavy-duty truck markets. We expect our market share in the medium- and heavy-duty truck market to be at least 15%, flat with 2016. In light duty, we expect our share to grow to 8%, up from 7%. We currently project 5% growth in off-highway markets in China. 
 In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to decline 5%, mainly due to weaker truck demand driven by the transition to Bharat Stage IV emission standards starting in April. Bharat Stage IV is the first major countrywide emissions change in the Indian truck market involving the introduction of aftertreatment systems. And as a result, it's hard to predict the impact on truck demand post implementation. 
 Truck dealers do appear to be well-stocked with new trucks, and we anticipate that any end user prebuy activity will likely be met with current truck inventories and without a significant increase in production in the first quarter. We do expect demand to drop off after the implementation of the new regulations, and we have factored in a decline in industry production of between 10% and 20% for the full year into our forecast. 
 We currently expect growth of 5% in off-highway markets in India. Demand in off-highway markets was growing at a faster rate in the first half of 2016, but the pace of economic growth has slowed following the introduction of the government's demonetization policy. We're optimistic that the government's focus on improving infrastructure will support growth in both our on- and off-highway businesses in the coming years. 
 In Brazil, we expect truck production to be flat in 2017. Demand is at very low levels. And while we are optimistic that the next move in production will be up, there's no clear catalyst for sustained improvement in the near term. 
 We expect our global high-horsepower engine shipments to be flat in 2017. We expect a modest improvement in new engine orders from mining consumers while demand in marine markets remains very weak. Orders for new engines for oil and gas applications in North America also remain very low, although demand for rebuilds of existing engines has increased. 
 In summary, we expect full year sales to be flat to down 5% due mainly to a weaker truck production in North America. We expect EBIT to be in a range of 11% to 11.5% of sales, with performance expected to be weakest in the first quarter. 
 Through our cost-reduction initiatives and focus on operational improvements, we have effectively managed through a multiyear decline in some of our largest markets and delivered EBIT margins well above prior troughs. 
 We have continued to invest in new products in our Distribution network that position us to drive profitable growth when end markets do improve. Demand in most of our key markets remains below replacement levels. Having said that, for the first time in a number of years, there are some early signs that point towards improvement in 2018. 
 In addition to our strong focus on operational improvements, we have also continued to return cash to shareholders. We returned 75% of operational cash flow to shareholders in 2016, and we'll return at least 50% in 2017 through dividends and share repurchases. 
 Finally, we continue to make progress in advancing our strategy as we outlined in the last Analyst Day. And although I have nothing to announce today, we are optimistic that we will continue to make progress in executing our plans. 
 Now let me turn it over to Pat. 
Patrick Ward: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the full year 2016 financial results before moving on to our fourth quarter performance. All comparisons in the full year and the fourth quarter of 2015 for the company and for each of the operating segments will exclude the charges for impairment and restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 Full year revenues for the company were $17.5 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to the prior year. And as Tom just described, declines in commercial truck production in North America and the lowest level of demand for high-horsepower industrial engines and power generation equipment in more than a decade led to the overall revenue decrease. 
 Negative currency movements against the U.S. dollar reduced our sales by approximately 2%. North American revenues declined 12% in 2016 and represented 58% of our total revenues, down from 61% in 2015. 
 International revenues declined by 2% compared to the previous year, mainly due to foreign currency movements. Excluding the impact of the currency movements, international revenues grew almost 3%, with growth in China and in India being offset by weaker demand in Latin America, the Middle East and in Africa. 
 Gross margins were 25.4% of sales and are 50 basis points lower than last year. Material cost reductions and the benefits from restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015 offset most of the negative impact from lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. 
 Selling, admin and research and development costs were up 50 basis points as a percent of sales. They decreased by $145 million in the year due to savings from previous restructuring actions, which were partially offset by added expense through distributor acquisitions. 
 Joint venture income decreased by $14 million compared to last year due to the acquisition of the North American distributors and lower earnings from the joint ventures in China. Other income expense improved by $50 million, primarily due to the change in the cash surrender value on corporate-owned life insurance plans, gains recorded on the divestiture of a power system joint venture and an increase in royalty income. 
 In total, earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, was 11.4% of sales in 2016, down from 12.5% of sales that we reported in the previous year. The decremental EBIT margin was 24% for the full year. EBIT for 2016 and 2015 included charges for a loss contingency of $138 million and $60 million, respectively, as we previously reported. 
 Net income was $1.4 billion or $8.23 per share. This compares to $1.6 billion or $8.93 per share in the previous year. 
 The operating tax rate for the full year was 24.6% compared to 27.4% in 2015 due to changes in geographic mix of earnings. 
 Now let me comment specifically on the fourth quarter and provide some more details on our performance. Fourth quarter revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 6% from a year ago. Sales in North America, which represented 56% of our fourth quarter revenues, declined 13% from a year ago as a result of lower commercial truck production in North America and weaker demand from industrial engines and power generation equipment. 
 International sales improved by 6% compared to 2015 due to stronger demand in China and in Mexico, which more than offset the weaker conditions in the Middle East and in Africa. 
 Gross margins were 24.9% of sales, a decline of 30 basis points from a year ago. Warranty was an 80 basis point headwind due to the variable expense recorded in the fourth quarter of '15. The negative impact from the lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix were partially offset by material cost savings and the benefits from previous restructuring actions. 
 Selling, admin and research and development costs of $677 million or 15% of sales increased as a percent of sales by 60 basis points but decreased $8 million from a year ago. The benefits of previous restructuring actions offset the added expenses from the distributor acquisition.
 Joint venture income of $67 million was $8 million lower compared to a year ago. Earnings declined due to costs incurred associated with quality improvements in our Foton-Cummins joint venture in China, largely offset by earnings growth in a number of our other international joint ventures. 
 Earnings before interest and tax was $526 million or 11.7% of sales for the quarter compared to $531 million or 11.1% a year ago. Our EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2015 included a $60 million charge for the loss contingency. 
 Net earnings for the quarter were $378 million or $2.25 per diluted share compared to $2.02 from a year ago, and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%. 
 Moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the quarter and for the full year 2016 and then provide a forecast for 2017. I will then review the full year cash flow and conclude with the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year. 
 In the Engine segment, revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 6% from last year. On-highway revenues declined by 9% overall, with lower heavy and medium-duty truck engines sales in North America being partially offset by increased sales in bus and pickup markets. 
 Off-highway revenues increased 8%, primarily due to higher construction sales in all regions except in Latin America. 
 Segment EBIT in the quarter was $194 million or 9.9% of sales, an increase compared to the 7.6% that we reported a year ago. EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2015 did include the $60 million charge for the loss contingency. In addition, benefits from restructuring and material cost reduction helped mitigate the impact of lower volumes in the quarter. 
 For the full year, revenues decreased by 10% from a year ago, and earnings before interest and taxes declined from 9.9% to 8.8% of sales. 
 For the Engine segment in 2017, we expect the revenues to be down by 3% to 6% due to weaker demand in North America, and EBIT margins to be in a range of 9.5% to 10.5% of sales. 
 For the Distribution segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.7 billion, which decreased 2% compared to last year. The decrease was the result of a 6% decline in organic sales and a 1% unfavorable impact from the stronger U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by a 5% increase in revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter. 
 The EBIT margin for the fourth quarter was $122 million or 7.3% of sales, an increase from 6.5% a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a onetime gain of $15 million for the acquisition of the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor. 
 For 2016, full year sales for the segment declined by 1%, with a 5% organic sales decline and a 2% unfavorable impact from currency being offset by 6% growth from the acquisitions. EBIT as a percent of sales declined from 7% to 6.3%. 
 For 2017, revenue is projected to be flat to up 4%, with increased revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 expected to add approximately $200 million or approximately 3% to the top line, which will be partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. And we expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 6% to 6.75% of sales. 
 For the Components segment, revenues were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a decline of 5% from a year ago. Sales in North America declined 16% due to lower industry truck production, while international sales increased by 13%, primarily due to a 66% increase in our sales in China. Segment EBIT was $140 million or 11.9% of sales compared to $175 million or 14.2% of sales a year ago. 
 In addition to the impact of the lower volumes, warranty costs were higher against a very tough comparison a year ago, and we also experienced higher-than-expected startup costs associated with the transition to our new Single Module aftertreatment system, which are likely to persist through the first half of 2017. 
 For the full year, revenues were 6% lower than in 2015. Sales in North America were down 14%, partially offset by very strong growth in China. EBIT as a percent of sales decreased from 14.5% in 2015 to 13.3% of sales in 2016. 
 For 2017, we expect revenue to decline by 2% to 6% as a result of weaker demand in North America, and EBIT is projected to be in the range of 11% to 12% of sales. 
 In the Power Systems segment, fourth quarter revenues were $932 million, down 5% from a year ago. Sales of Power Generation equipment declined 7% compared to a year ago while industrial engines revenues were down 4%, primarily due to weaker marine and mining engine sales compared to last year. 
 EBIT margins were 7.3% in the quarter, up from the 6% we reported last year. Lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix and the project cost overrun in the U.K. were more than offset by the benefits from cost reductions, favorable currency impacts and the gains recorded on the sale of some assets. 
 For the full year, Power Systems revenue declined 14% from 2015, and EBIT margins declined from 8.9% to 7.5% of sales. The focus on cost reduction is key to holding decremental margins in the segment to 18% despite a significant drop in revenue. 
 For 2017, we expect Power Systems segment revenues to be flat to down 4%. EBIT margins are expected to be between 7% and 8% of sales, which is relatively similar to 2016, given no significant improvement in our end markets. 
 And as Tom discussed, we are on track to complete the exit of manufacturing from our site in Kent in the United Kingdom, which will yield net savings in 2018. 
 Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operations for the full year was just over $1.9 billion. We anticipate operating cash flow for 2017 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. 
 We lowered our capital expenditures by more than $200 million to $531 million in 2016, and we expect that our 2017 investments will be in the range of $500 million to $530 million. 
 Last year, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders or 75% of operating cash flow. We repurchased 7.3 million shares, and we increased our dividend by 5%. For 2017, we plan to return at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders, in line with our long-term commitment. 
 As Tom described, the majority of our businesses have experienced multiyear declines in demand. We are forecasting company revenues to be flat to down 5% this year, primarily driven by the lower demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market and modest declines in power generation and off-highway markets. Foreign currency headwinds are expected to reduce our revenues by approximately $200 million. 
 We expect EBIT margins to be between 11% and 11.5% of sales this year. We do face lower volumes again in 2017, which will negatively impact our margins, especially in the first half of the year. We remain focused on cost reduction, with improvements in material costs, plant productivity and the quality of our current products helping to offset the impact of the lower volumes, cost inflation of some commodities and increased variable compensation, merit and pension expense. 
 We do expect EBIT margins in the first quarter will be at the low point for the year and below fourth quarter 2016 levels on lower sales. Income from our joint ventures is expected to decline by approximately 8% in 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of the last remaining North American joint venture distributor. We expect our effective tax rate to be 26% this year. 
 As we outlined in our Analyst Day back in November of 2015, we expected a period of weaker demand ahead of us. We have managed effectively through this decline in sales so far and have taken actions necessary to improve our cost structure while continuing to invest in new products and services that will help drive profitable growth when the markets improve and continuing to return value to our shareholders. 
 Now let me turn it back over to Mark. 
Mark Smith: Thank you, Pat, and we're now ready to move to the Q&A section. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. 
Timothy Thein: First, maybe, Tom, for you. I'm just curious maybe with respect to the kind of the tone of your conversations here and with North American customers and distributors just given what's transpired here over the last, say, 90 days or so. Just curious with respect to their overall set -- tone regarding underlying investment and just kind of a broader question. Just curious if you can address maybe what -- if there's any meaningful change in terms of their attitude. 
N. Linebarger: Thanks, Tim. Let me just say at a high level, as I mentioned in my remarks, our markets are at historically-low levels. We're way below replacement in nearly all of our major markets, and you heard our forecast for the numbers for North American truck. It's really weak, and that's clearly a big headwind going into 2017. And we've been sprinting for quite a few years now to keep costs under control. In fact, improve productivity and cost in all of our facilities and still be able to invest to make sure that we can grow faster than the market when things improve. So we feel like 2017 is one of those years. On the other hand, as you also heard me say, it looks like the move, next move in many of those markets is likely to be up, which I don't think we've been able to say until now. And that -- again, we're planning conservatively. We are, this year, we are assuming that we're going to get very little benefit from any of that. We are planning our costs accordingly, et cetera, but there are some good signs. I think Rich is a little closer to the -- what OEMs are saying in North America. So I'll probably ask Rich to talk a little bit about the truck market specifically and then what other signs that you're seeing, Rich. 
Richard Freeland: Okay. Thanks, Tom. Yes, we're hearing as I talk to fleets, more and more people talking about getting back to replacement levels, where they kind of sat out a years, their mileage was lower, and so that tends to be a common theme, not in every fleet but often. The data -- pre data looks good or at least improving a bit. Dealer inventory looks at a pretty good level. And in fact, there's room to grow the dealer inventory, which we haven't been able to say. And I think the big overhang is just used truck values are still a bit of an issue, but generally, pretty positive on the next move up. We've had 3 months in a row where the production has been less than orders. So the backlog is growing. Again, the future order board is growing for OEMs, and we're already starting to see as those order boards were getting filled out, people are increasing orders. I think maybe in some of the off-highway, I'll do quickly, but oil and gas, we actually are starting, not engine orders, we're seeing a lot of activity in the parts side. The rebuild is coming back in. And I think we mentioned in the comments, the mining business, again, I think the next move will be up there, again, a little bit. It started with parts, which is normal for us, starting to see some improvement there. So generally, I guess, positive. A couple we talked about maybe down would be India truck market, and the marine business does not look like -- that's one we'd say, we don't see that recovery coming yet. 
N. Linebarger: So hopefully that helps, Tim. Sentiment, good; orders, low. 
Timothy Thein: Yes, understood, okay. And just back on Rich's comments on part -- on off-highway parts, maybe a little bit more color on Distribution. It sounds like within that flat to up 4% -- up 3% contribution from the last acquisition. So just maybe a little bit more color in terms of -- I would have thought you would -- the outlook there would have been a little bit more positive. So maybe just some more color on specific drivers within Distribution. 
Mark Smith: Tim, it's Mark. We are expecting some growth in parts. The one market where we're seeing continued weakness globally is really Power Generation. So that's what's kind of tempering the outlook in the near term. 
Richard Freeland: Well, target range [ph] in sales is generally through the Distribution business, and I think we're looking at that being down again this year, I think 3% to 4%, something like that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Crédit Suisse. 
Jamie Cook: I guess, 2 questions. One, on the guidance, then the second, more strategic one. If you look at your engine sales in the margins and implied decrementals, the decremental seemed normal. But then if you back out the charges that we had in '16, the implied decrementals, I think, are in the mid to high 30s, which seems -- it seems like it should be better than that. So I'm just wondering if I'm missing something, if you could explain that. And then my second question, Tom, relates more to you. If you look at the past 3 quarters, the repos really falling off, we're not really doing much. So are we -- can you give us an update on sort of where we are? Are we closer to doing a deal? And I guess, as I also think about how you're thinking about the company going forward, I always thought maybe you'd potentially just acquire a business, but I never really thought about whether the parts of the business that don't make sense for Cummins to be in anymore and if so, why would that be? Is it for because you want to do a larger deal for cash because certain businesses aren't generating the proper returns? So I guess those 2, and if you could help [indiscernible] 
Patrick Ward: Jamie, I'll take the first one, and then Tom can take the second one. So on decrementals, let me kind of give you a high-level dredge for the company. It really applies to the Engine segment as much as the company. So if you start from the 11.4% of EBIT that we reported in 2016, we do have headwinds coming through in the form of the lower volume, the unfavorable mix and some of those launch costs that we're talking about with our new products. That's about 70 basis points of a headwind between those 3. We do have higher inflation cost in terms of people costs in 2017, and they're coming through in the form of higher pension expense given the lower discount rates, higher variable compensation in 2016 and then merit increases, so -- and people cost inflation. That's about 120 basis points year-over-year. And then we had some onetime gains in 2016 over about [ph] 30 basis points, and they came through in the form of some of that fair market value gains in Distribution and the gain on sale of the Power Generation asset in the fourth quarter. Offsetting most of that are cost reductions really coming through material costs. We're looking at 80 basis points this year. That's down from 150 basis points last year really given the swing in metal markets. We had 50 basis points of improvement last year in metal markets, 20 basis points negative this year. So net, 80 basis points on cost reduction. The loss contingency that we pointed out is worth 80 basis points. And then pricing, we're thinking some modest pricing improvements that would add around 30 basis points. So when you net all that together, that leaves us somewhere in the midpoint between 11% and 11.5% of sales. 
Jamie Cook: Okay. That's helpful. On the M&A front, any potential for divestitures? 
N. Linebarger: Yes. So let me first just talk about the repurchase of shares. We have continued with our plans on repurchased shares. As you know, we set a goal at the beginning of the year. We drive that program to achieve that goal. We have guidelines that we run with the board about price ranges that we're acquiring in, and we try to make sure that we stay within that, and we run programs through the year. So when you see differences in repurchased shares by quarter, that's more to do with just when we're taking the actions and more the mechanics of it than it is to do with where we've lost interest. We're still hitting our targets for the year of how much we want to repurchase, and so that wouldn't change our strategy at all on that. That's continuing. And then secondly, with regard to the acquisition front, as I mentioned, we are actively working on those strategy areas that we talked about in the Investor Conference, and I'm feeling like we're making good progress. And as I've said before, the problem with describing progress in this publicly is until I have something to announce, I can't announce anything, which is very frustrating to you and other investors I know and frustrating to me, too. But again, all I can do is share my sentiment, I think, at this point, which is I feel like we're making good progress, which means that I think we'll be able to add to our growth platforms at -- within our very tight constraints about making sure they're strategically good and also helps investors with returns over the medium and long run, if not the short run as well. And then last thing, you asked about divestitures. And as we described in the Investor Conference, we review our portfolio of businesses every year. And often times, that review doesn't yield very much. And sometimes, it makes us think more. But always, what we're looking at is what are the businesses that we have, and we have a 3-part criteria. One is, are they a strategic fit? Meaning, are we able to create more value with that business because we're the owner, because of the things that it links with and the competencies that we share across the business? Two, is it meeting our return guidelines? Or do we know, through management action, how to get it to that place? And three, is there some way that we can potentially add to our growth platforms or otherwise by reconstituting that business in some way? So we're pretty active at reviewing that portfolio, and we do it every single year. So we did it again this year, and we're always active on that and very much like the acquisition front, of course, until we are actually doing anything, there's actually nothing I can say publicly. It's bad for our employees. It's bad for everything else. So we aren't going to say anything until we do something. But again, I just want you to know, as someone who writes about us, and I want our investors to know that we always think we should evaluate our portfolio to make sure, as a management team, that we are actively managing the businesses that we're in as well as managing each one we have for success. 
Mark Smith: I'm just going to respond to your first question, Jamie. My calculation shows in the low 20s decrementals on the engine business. We can maybe follow up on that later, but those are pretty normal levels, I think. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo. 
Andrew Casey: A couple of kind of cleanup questions, I guess. The contingency charges, you had some in a few historical quarters, are we clear of those? Or is there some risk those could come back in 2017? 
Richard Freeland: Okay, yes, Andy. Yes, we believe we're clear of those. So the process is we booked what we think was the estimated charge, and there's been no change in that. 
Andrew Casey: Okay, Rich. And then on the Beijing Foton JV, you talked about the costs incurred to improve some productivity and other stuff. How are those going to -- first, could you quantify those in the fourth quarter, because it was pretty sharp falloff? I just want to make sure there wasn't anything else going on. And then how should we expect that JV contribution to kind of play out through 2017? Does it start out weak and then get back to where it should be through the year? 
Richard Freeland: Okay, let me take that, and Mark, if you need to correct any of my numbers, jump in. But yes, so on the ISG, we did take a charge in Q4. And to quantify it, it's roughly $25 million. And so just reminding folks where we are on this product, we remain very excited about it. In fact, our share of Foton now is over 75%. But frankly, we've run into issues in certain duty cycles as we've added more applications in certain regions where either fuel quality or service practices or things we've learned. And so we wish that wouldn't have happened. That hasn't changed our fundamental view. And so I think there will be a charge in Q1 but to a lesser degree, think of kind of half that and all that eliminated as we go into kind of Q2 and Q3 -- on the ISG. And so our strategy hasn't changed. Just like we did on the 2A, 3A, went in China with a brand-new product for the market, compete there and then take the product globally. So we've done that on the 2A and 3A. We're producing 150,000. Quite frankly, we went through a little bit of an issue on introduction as we entered new markets on the 2A and 3A inside China, but we're now selling 50,000 of those outside of China even at Euro 5 and Euro 6 levels part of our strategies. We'll do the same thing on ISG. It hasn't changed our approach. 
Mark Smith: And I would just add, we've assumed flat markets in heavy, medium and light duty in our guidance. Even in that environment, we'd expect earnings growth in light duty with projected share gains. But as Rich said, improving earnings as the year unfolds. 
Andrew Casey: Okay, Okay, great. And then lastly, a similar question that I think Tim asked with respect to North America. Could you kind of discuss what you're seeing in China at this point? You clearly indicated construction equipment's coming back. Truck had a fairly good second half to the year last year for market basis, yet you're talking about, as you just said, Mark, kind of flat markets for truck in China. What's kind of going on over there? 
Richard Freeland: Yes. So we're projecting flat although I would say our sentiment, even as weeks go by, gets a little bit more positive more than negative, Andy, on this. And there's been -- the new weight restrictions that were put in place are healthy, and so they're being enforced. So I think there are some signs of positiveness, but we just haven't -- we're staying fairly conservative on our forecast just on what the sustainability of that is. There's still some questions. I know there's some ranges. There's people who are more positive than us in the truck market right now. We're going to plan around flat. From a capacity standpoint, of course, we can flex up, and we'll beat it if it's better than. 
N. Linebarger: In the construction market, Andy, it is improving. But just remember, where we're starting from is a far, far cry from where we've seen good markets there before. So yes, we're pleased to see them move up, but it's got a long way to go. And I think it's going to be pretty gradual in its improvement, too. It's just that in the overall market, there's a lot of overhang of equipment still. There's still a lot of dealer inventory. There's a ways for the industry to go. But again, we're happy to see the improvement up. 
Mark Smith: Yes, there's not a lot of momentum in the high-horsepower side, I would say. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. 
Jerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could talk about your updated timing of the 12-liter engine production ramp in U.S. truck. It sounds like the quality issues in China are unrelated based on the description that you laid out, Rich, but maybe you can update us on the time frame. And also, do you have new platform opportunities with Volvo now that they're exiting their 16-liter engine in the U.S.? 
Richard Freeland: Okay, yes. Jerry, yes, so first, they clearly are unrelated -- the quality issues. We're going out taking care of customers, again, kind of related to specific -- either regions or duty cycles in China. Nothing's changed on our schedule. So we'll begin some -- you'll see some trucks here late in the year. It'll be not material in 2017, but we do have agreements with multiple OEMs to begin offering it and remain very excited about it. From the question on heavy-duty on Volvo, we're exclusive on 15-liter with 2 customers with Navistar and PACCAR. And so I am pleased to say we'll now be exclusive on a third, with Volvo, with their announcement of discontinuing the 16-liter. 
Jerry Revich: And Rich, sorry, just the number of platforms that you'll be available on, can you give us just a rough flavor? 
Richard Freeland: I'll say -- at least 2. 
Jerry Revich: Okay, okay. And then coming back on the M&A discussion, you folks have been really focused on driving structurally-higher returns on capital over the course of your time leading the company. And I'm just wondering, are you signaling a longer-term focus on returns on capital, with potential to absorb lower returns near term as you build a sort of meaningful growth platform via acquisitions? Or maybe you could just talk about if you folks are changing the framework in terms of the time frame of which you're targeting the types of return on capital that you folks have generated internally. 
N. Linebarger: I'm definitely not trying to signal or change anything. We've always had a medium to long-term view on return of capital. That's never changed. As you know, we operate a cyclical company and things do go up and do go down even in our own returns on capital. We have long return cycles in our business, as a matter of course, which, of course, is frustrating and difficult to manage, frankly, but it is just the case that we have that. So I'm definitely not trying to signal anything. As we talked about when we talk about potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other partnerships is that we have high return guidelines. We believe that we serve investors well when we retain that attitude that we need to earn good returns on capital with new things we do, just like we do with existing things we do and that taking long ventures into things that don't generate a return would not be good for shareholders, and we're not going to do it. You also know that if we're going to do -- make investments in inorganic that we have to put together a plan that we think works for shareholders or it doesn't make sense. And what that means as far as short term and medium term and long term depends. We'll see when we get there. But just -- I just need you and everyone else to know that we are not backing off anything with regard to our view about generating strong returns for shareholders, and we won't as long as I'm here. I can tell you that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. 
Joseph O'Dea: Specifically on Power Gen and looking for another down year in '17, could you talk about just how depressed that business is. I think we're now looking at 5-plus years of declines -- so what the declines look like from peak. And then beyond the general macro, what signs you're looking at for conditions to start to turn there, whether it's by end markets or geographies, but where we can start to look for some hope in Power Gen given the multiyear declines that we've seen there? 
N. Linebarger: Maybe, I can start just from a high level. I would say that, as you quite rightly said, it's been a long term. We've got 5 years in a row really of very weak markets driven by low investment -- capital investment and especially in developing markets, where we have strong positions, but also nonres capital spending. So those 2 trends have been a strong negative for the business for some time. And with regard to how depressed it is, we're pretty depressed about it. I'll let Mark give you like the -- how much percentage down, but we have certainly have a lot of capacity and -- which is why we took the action we did last year, again, to restructure our capacity and try to reduce costs in a way that allowed us to ramp back up when things get -- turn up again. We still remain highly confident in the business's underlying economics as those economic drivers return. For one thing, we see that the demand for electricity in most of our -- most markets, certainly in developing countries, increasing in terms of the amount of the economy that depends on more reliable power. We also see investments in more reliable power declining as economies decline. So we still believe that in most world economies, they'll be relying on some form of grid support, either through standby generation, other more sophisticated needs for data centers, et cetera, or just in terms of straight backup power in some regions where they have much, much less reliable power. So we believe that those fundamental things are in place, but it has been a long, tough decline, and we've worked actively to try to reduce the impact of those declines, but it's been a tough run. Mark, do you want to comment on all about percentages? 
Mark Smith: Yes, you're talking about over 30% down from prior -- 5 years ago. And again, that sort of business that isn't depending on one part of the economy or on one particular cycle or down cycle. I think, as Tom said, in some cases, it's not always a lack of demand. Like in Latin America, there's a lot of demand. You've just got, in that case, a lot of customer liquidity issues that are holding back the movement of projects this year. And starting in early last year, we had the Middle East that was doing quite well and then that started to roll up. So it's just been a combination of circumstances. I would say Europe's stable. North America's stable but down a little bit. So it's really the emerging markets, as Tom said, over the last 3 years to 4 years. 
Joseph O'Dea: And then on the tax rate and looking for, I think, 26% in 2017, should we think about that as being more representative of the tax rate on a go-forward basis? Is there anything unique in 2017? But just you go back a year ago, I think you were looking for something more in kind of high 20s range. Just want to think about this on kind of a longer-term outlook and what the right tax rate is. 
Patrick Ward: Well, the only thing that's different -- There's 2 things are different in 2017 compared to what we said 12 months ago. One, we have a lower share of profits coming out of the U.S., which, as you look out, a higher tax rate today. And secondly, there has been some changes over the last few months in the U.K. and some legislation there that does impact our investment [ph] . So that's the real reason for the delta between the 24.6% that we reported for '16 and the 26% for 2017. The biggest factor is going to be the geographic mix of earnings over the long term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. 
David Raso: My question's about the component guidance. It appears to be implying a decremental margin of 55% on a 4% revenue decline. I just want to get more color on why do you think the decrementals would be that poor. 
Richard Freeland: David, this is Rich. I'll take that. Really 2 -- fundamentally, 2 things. One is, volumes down again in North America is what we're projecting. And then two is, as was mentioned, some startup costs associated with our new Single Module aftertreatment in our aftertreatment business. And so just to remind you, we're making a really big change there, and it's not a small change in our aftertreatment. One, it's at half the size, half the weight, taking the maintenance intervals up by a factor of 2. So it's a brand-new product, and we've had some startup kind of expedited costs and all that we had in Q4. And I mentioned those will continue into Q1. So those are the 2 things that are happen -- that are really dragging that down for 2017. 
David Raso: How much are those investments? Because even if I hit you with a 30% decremental, it adds almost $0.20 to your guidance for the year. So I'm just trying to think about how big those costs are just so I can get a better feel for how reasonable the guidance is. 
Richard Freeland: Well, the aftertreatment piece of the startup, we're talking in the $20 million to $30 million range for the year, and then you know what our incremental margins are, and you've seen before as volumes come back. So if volumes come back to more normal levels, when and if that happens, then you'll see that turnaround. 
Patrick Ward: Yes. The other thing I would throw in there, David, too, if you go back to my answer to Jamie Cook earlier on, we are seeing some inflationary metal markets, which is impacting the segment, and we are seeing some impact on compensation inflation, too. So there's 2 or 3 headwinds that's impacting us in 2017. We'll figure our way through then get back to normal markets. 
Mark Smith: But you should see improvement in the second half versus the first half. 
David Raso: Yes, and not to nickel and dime you. Even with that cost on the startup, you're still implying decrementals over 40? I'm just trying to make sure -- I mean, is the inflation problems particular to components more than other segments? 
N. Linebarger: No, it's not. So again, just thinking through your view of our guidance. Again, as I've said kind of as an overview, we're taking a pretty conservative view of bad markets. And so I think the biggest opportunity we have in the Components business is that North American markets strengthen more and faster than what we have in our guidance, and you probably have a reasonable view about your opinion on that. So that would be one thing that you could take a look at if you wanted to. But again, our view is that we're going to continue to manage conservatively. We're going to continue to find ways to take costs out. So again, as you know, we are not satisfied with decremental margins of that level. We're not pleased with that. We are working hard to figure out how to make that less of an impact, but we're giving you the forecast based on what we think we understand how to do right now. We'll continue to work on decremental margins in that business. That's a very -- it's a very profitable and good business for Cummins, and we're going to continue to make it so. 
David Raso: And last quick question on the M&A conversation. How do you think about strategically off-highway versus on-highway, just all the secular issues that we're all aware of on-highway as well as some of the benefits you've built up with your Distribution acquisitions? Just how should we think about those 2 markets and how they impact your strategy? 
N. Linebarger: Yes. So on-highway, as you said, it's a bigger volume. It's -- so it tends to drive a lot of the technology, and there's -- there is -- of course, we have a very strong position on on-highway, and the fact that we lead in emissions and other technologies has helped us build a strong position there. On the other hand, as you've quite rightly said, in off-highway, there is less vertical integration, and also our Distribution is well positioned globally to serve a bunch of markets that other people can't serve. So both have important roles in our strategy. And frankly, we think one of the advantages of Cummins is we're able to put the 2 together in a way that drives synergies that most others can't. So as I think about it strategically and I think about things we might do more of, I'm thinking about both those areas and how we can continue to use the synergy between the 2 to drive more returns to shareholders than others can. 
Mark Smith: I think we're at the top of the hour. Thanks, everyone, for your questions, and Adam and I will be available for follow-up later. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-08-03 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Eric Birge - Director of Investor Relations Jeffrey Craig - Chief Executive Officer and President Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Brian Johnson - Barclays Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research Colin Langan - UBS Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Meritor, Incorporated Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Eric Birge, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Eric Birge: Thank you, Sabrina. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's third quarter 2016 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc. It's protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without expressed written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in our slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jeffrey Craig: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us today. As you probably saw in our press release this morning, we had a great third quarter of financial performance. On slide 3, you can see the highlights. We reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.4%, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.57, and free cash flow of $86 million. The excellent operational performance that we've maintained for many quarters continues to drive real earnings growth and cash flow. We continue to win in the marketplace and are very close to achieving our three-year goal of securing $500 million of new business wins. I'll highlight a few of our latest awards in just a moment. We also completed our $210 million equity and equity-linked repurchase program in July, building on the many achievements associated with our M2016 strategy. We are now beginning to shift our focus to initiatives that will ensure the success under our M2019 plan. As part of this plan, we expect to have continued strong cash flow performance. With that in mind, we're pleased to announce today new debt and equity repurchase authorizations. Let's move to slide 4. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $39 million or 4.7 million common shares. Based on the trading levels of our stock price, we opportunistically finished the program a quarter early. Overall, we repurchased 12.8 million common shares onto this program which equated to approximately 13% of our total shares outstanding. In addition, we bought back a total of $74 million in convertible debt which lowered interest expense, improved our debt maturity profile and mitigated long-term equity dilution risk. We continue to believe that our stock has been excellent investment given our consistent earnings and cash flow performance, demonstrated during the M2016 program. At the same time, we are committed to reducing our debt levels as part of our M2019 strategy. With that in mind, our board of directors has delegated authority for us to execute up to $150 million of debt and $150 million in equity repurchases over the next three years. These authorizations provide us the flexibility to begin taking the capital structure actions but aligned with our M2019 goals. You should expect to see us start to execute such repurchases over the coming quarters. As you know, securing new business continues to be a primary focus as we finish out M2016 and turn our attention to M2019. On slide 5, we highlight some of our recent wins. In the third quarter, we earned $25 million of additional new business wins. Part of this in incremental business is based on an award we received to supply axles and brakes for a specialized vehicle that the Volvo Group will supply to the Canadian military. We expect that production to begin in fiscal year 2017. The remainder consists of incremental sales in various Aftermarket & Trailer product lines, including an award for remanufactured trailer axles and expanding our air systems business in the aftermarket. In our specialty business, we will be supplying our tandem heavy haul axle to an OE customer for an oil and gas vehicle. With our cumulative M2016 new business awards of $475 million, we are very close and motivated to deliver on our M2016 goal of $500 million. Slide 5 provides our view of the end markets for the remainder of the fiscal 2016 with some additional insight as we approach 2017. Overall, our global forecast is relatively unchanged. As we said last quarter, in North America, excess Class 8 inventory and declining used truck prices due to softer freight demand are causing fleets to adjust their orders for new trucks. This has led to reduced build rates and OE production levels. At this time, we are guiding to 245,000 to 250,000 units, basically unchanged from our previous forecast. Last night's release of July orders are in line with this estimate. We continue to believe we're in the midst of an inventory correction in the Class 8 market. One excess inventory is depleted, we expect to see the markets stabilized to relatively normal production levels to sustain replacement demand. While we are not providing guidance for fiscal year 2017 today, we do want to give you some insights of what we are anticipating in the next fiscal year for two of our major markets. For North America, we're expecting the current headwinds to continue to create some level of downward pressure on orders and subsequent builds, particularly, in the first half of the fiscal year until excess inventory clears. And in Europe, while Brexit is certainly an unknown, we are not currently seeing any production impact as we approach 2017. We will provide more detail on 2017 later this year following our fourth quarter earnings announcement. On slide 7, we have provided an update on our M2016 score card. And once again, the main take away from this chart is that we are on track to achieve all three financial objectives this year. We have continued to improve our margin throughout M2016 timeframe, and we ended last year with a 9.5% margin. Year-to-date for fiscal 2016, we are at 10.2%, and we're remained confident in our ability to achieve the 10% EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal year that we committed to three years ago. The second financial target was to reduce net debt by more than $400 million to less than $1.5 billion. We achieved that target at the end of fiscal 2015 and we're confident we'll stay at or below that level till the end of our fiscal year. Keep in mind, our net debt definition includes our pension and OPAT. Our unfunded pension position has remained very stable throughout the year even as interest rates has declined significantly. In fact, if we were to mark-to-market our pension liability as of the end of this quarter, we estimate that this would increase our net debt by only $30 million. We have benefited from derisking strategies and strong asset performance even through the most recent quarter just ended. Our third target was to achieve $500 million of incremental booked revenue. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental $25 million of new business, we are now at $475 million, 10% of EBITDA margin, $400 million in debt reduction and $0.5 billion in new business wins. Those were our M2016 objectives. And we are positioned to deliver on all three. Our ability to achieve these challenging objectives is driven by the expertise, passion, and commitment of the entire Meritor team. As a company, we are completely aligned around our priorities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more detail on the quarter and our outlook for the 2016 fiscal year.
Kevin Nowlan: Good morning. As you heard from Jay, we had a very strong financial performance in our third fiscal quarter. Let's walk through the details of our results by turning to slide 8. Sales are $841 million down 7% compared to last year. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower Class 8 truck production in North America which was down nearly 30% year-over-year. But our new business wins have significantly mitigated the impact of this sizeable market decline in North America. Gross margin was 15.1% this quarter which is an increase of 150 basis points over last year. Lower material labor and burden cost continue to drive gross margin performance. SG&A was $6 million lower compared to the third quarter last year. The decrease was driven by a $6 million cost recovery from a supplier associated with the product liability damages matter. This settlement partially offset related cost we've incurred over the last few years. We also recognized $3 million related to an asbestos insurance recovery from an insolvent insurer which partially mitigated our asbestos related cost in the quarter. While both of these cash recoveries are discrete to this quarter, they are part of our continuing focus in mitigating all costs impact in the business. Income tax expense was $8 million in the third quarter of 2016 which translates to an effective tax rate of approximately 16%, in line with our expectations. For the full year, we're expecting an effective tax rate of between 15% and 20%. The bottom line is that we generated $42 million of income from continuing operations attributable to Meritor. And after adjustments for non-cash tax expense and restructuring cost, which we've detailed in the appendix, we generated adjusted income from continuing operations of $52 million and $0.57 per diluted share, an increase of $0.15 or 36% over last year. Let's move to slide 9 which compares our sales and EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 to 2015. As you can see on the right side of the slide, the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange has finally moderated and with only a slight headwind on both revenue and EBITDA of this quarter. As we look forward to our fourth quarter, we don't expect FX to have a material impact on our results. Next, as I mentioned previously, we had two discrete recoveries in the quarter. These yielded $9 million of good news earnings. Further down the [indiscernible], you can see the volume and mix drove revenue lower between by $61 million compared to last year. Despite this, we were able to increase EBITDA by $3 million related to volume, mix, performance and other. This was driven by a combination of lower steel indices and strong material labor and burden performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenue. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.4%, up 180 basis points from last year. Even if you were to exclude the impact of the supplier and insurance recoveries, we still would have generated an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3%. Either way, a strong quarter performance. Slide 10 details third quarter sales and EBITDA for each of our two reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $640 million, down $65 million or 9% from the same period last year. Our new business wins significantly mitigated the 30% decline in North America Class 8 truck production. We also benefited from slightly higher revenue in India as that market continues to increase on a year-over-year basis. Segment EBITDA was $61 million, up $3 million from last year, which drove an increase in EBITDA margin to 9.5%, 130 basis points higher than last year. This increased margin was primarily driven by strong cost management and lower steel indices, both of which continue to favorably impact our earnings. However, we have seen certain steel indices increased the last couple of quarters, so as we look to Q4, this will be a modest headwind to earnings. In the Aftermarket & Trailer segment, our North America Aftermarket business continues to be a little softer than we were originally anticipating. However, with the new business wins that Jay mentioned earlier, overall revenue in the segment was down only 2% from last year. Segment EBITDA was $38 million, up $7 million compared to last year. This increase was driven primarily by the $6 million supplier recovery we mentioned earlier as well as favorable material costs. Overall, EBITDA margin was 16.7% in the quarter, up 340 basis points over last year. If you were to exclude the supplier recovery, our margins would've been just over 14%, consistent with what we previously said you should expect for this business. Now, let's turn to slide 11. We generated $86 million of free cash flow this quarter, which was up $15 million from last year. We are converting our strong earnings and solid working capital performance into meaningful cash flow generation and are well on track to achieve our full year free cash flow guidance of $90 million. And importantly, we're producing this level of cash flow even as we're increasing our year-over-year capital spending to support our growth initiatives and operational performance objectives. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook on slide 12. With a couple of months left to go in our fiscal year, we now expect our full year revenue to come in at approximately $3.225 billion, down slightly from our previous guidance. Aside from the modest step down in our Brazil production outlook, our market expectations are relatively unchanged. However, as we look at the last couple of quarters in the fiscal year, we are seeing some modest mix shift in customer production that are causing a slight decline in our revenue outlook. From a margin perspective, we continue to remain on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA margin target of 10%. Implicit in the full year margin guidance is that we expect lower margins in Q4 than we've seen year-to-date. This is almost entirely due to the anticipated step down of revenue from Q3 to Q4 which is caused by two things. First, our European revenue will decline due to the normal impact of European summer holidays. Second, we expect that North America class A truck production will step down sequentially as we see the continuing effect of the inventory correction that is underway. As a result of these two factors, we're expecting fourth quarter revenue of around $750 million. We're also maintaining our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance of approximately $1.60 for fiscal year 2016, the midpoint of our prior guidance. Even though lower revenue will drive slightly lower bottom line earnings, we expect the EPS impact of that to be completely offset by the impact of lower outstanding shares resulting from the completion of our repurchase program. And finally, we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $90 million. We generated $78 million through nine months and have clear line of sight of finishing the year strong. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide closing remarks.
Jeffrey Craig: Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 13. As we wrap up fiscal year 2016 in less than two months, we are proud of what we've accomplished during the last three years. Most importantly, we have shown that when we make a commitment, we deliver. And as we go forward, we will maintain that focus. Looking ahead to 2017, we're not expecting to see a rebound in end markets. In fact, we anticipate that the global markets would likely remain under pressure particularly as inventories continue to correct in the North American Class 8 truck market. In spite of this, we will continue to drive performance in 2017. We will maintain our focus on margin, EPS and cash flow, and we will begin executing on our capital allocation priorities. 2017 will also be an important year as we have remained committed to an aggressive product life cycle that is part of our M2019 program. These important new products represents a critical element of the revenue objective we established to grow sales more than 20% above market. Also, as part of M2019, we plan to increase EPS, achieve our leverage target for net debt, and return 25% of free cash flow to shareholders. We're confident in a strong finish this year and look forward to beginning our new three-year plan that will shift the pendulum towards growth. We demonstrated with M2016 that we know how to develop and deliver on our strategy to drive shareholder value. We plan to do it again with M2019. We'll provide more details as we begin next year. Before we take your questions, I'm pleased to share with you that our board of directors recently elected Jan Bertsch as a new Director. Jan has been Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer of Owens-Illinois since November of 2015. Prior to that, she held executive financial positions with Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, BorgWarner and the Chrysler Group. We are pleased to add Jan's experience and expertise to our board as we enter the next chapter of our success through the execution of our M2019 strategy. Now, let's take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Brian Johnson: Yeah. I've a couple of questions. First, vis-à-vis Europe, your major customer has been doing well in terms of share and it's beginning to call out some capacity constraints. Are you seeing that at all and where are you capacitized versus where you think those markets and your customer share could go?
Jeffrey Craig: Thanks, Brian. This is Jay. Thanks for the question. You're right. We're happy to be part of [indiscernible] group success in Europe. We have not experienced any capacity constraints on our end. I think as you know, we've made some significant investments in all our manufacturing facilities around the world, and in particular, in our Lindesberg, Sweden plant that is the primary supporting facility for [indiscernible] Europe. And we're also pleased, I should mention as well, that IVECO is doing quite well, which is also a significant customer of ours in Europe. So, we're benefiting from both of those customers having very strong performance right now.
Brian Johnson: And second question also EU, the EU is tightening up CO2 standards supplying them to trucks. What are you working - what's in your portfolio and what are you working on to help your customers meet those challenges particularly around disconnecting axles and also, again, back to the key customer because overall they're trying to drive fuel efficiency technology? How will that partnership evolve as these - as they have to meet tighter fuel economy goals?
Jeffrey Craig: That's great question, Brian. I think overall, as I look it at 30,000 feet, what it's done is driven our relationship closer on the technical side because if the needs to meet those requirements on both sides to the Atlantic. We've made investments in new lab equipments to help our customers measure the benefits of fuel economy increases. In addition to all the new product development we're pushing forward, you mentioned that Detachable Tandem certainly have those types of products in our future product program of plans. We talk about here on this side of the Atlantic to 14X EVO which will increase fuel economy. And also, we have a similar product on the European side called 17X EVO, which is driven as having market improvement in fuel economy. But it all fits in to what I spoke about at the Analyst Day of us doubling the pace of our product introduction over the next few years. We think we are not only meeting but exceeding our customers' expectations in that regard.
Brian Johnson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Ryan Brinkman: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question.
Jeffrey Craig: Good morning.
Ryan Brinkman: On slide 9, you mentioned that volume, mix performance and other was a positive year-over-year contributor to EBITDA. And now this despite revenue declining $61 million year-over-year ex FX indicating volume was a big headwind. If you assume like a 20% detrimental, maybe $12 million. So, what are the other elements of these combined category that are still positive, and what additional color can you provide on what is possibly benefiting mix performance or other?
Kevin Nowlan: Okay. Hey, Ryan. It's Kevin Nowlan. There are really two things. First is material, labor and burden performance. And second is really the benefit of steel indices. And so, if you look at the $61 million, I think you've done the math right. You would expect ordinarily upwards of a $12 million headwind. We've seen a three positives. So, we're up $15 million of performance items. And it's really those two things more than anything else that are more than offsetting the lower volume.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay. That's great. Would you expect more tailwind from steel indices going forward given - or less given some of the uptick, how do you think about that? I'm sure there's some sort of lag between spot and P&L.
Kevin Nowlan: There is. And so as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, I think we're going to see a little bit of a sequential headwind coming from steel indices. Over the last couple of quarters, we've seen some of the indices particularly in the North American market creeping up. And so we would expect a few million dollars of headwind, and that's reflected in our guidance for Q4.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just a last question on the regional outlook. It looks like on page 6, so you're maintaining volume across most regions, except the U.S., a slight uptick - but except for in South America, right, where you're looking for a steel [indiscernible]. Can you remind us - I know there's been some dispositions and re-organization over the years. Can you remind us of the - and then of course, it's sort of organically declined. Can you remind us of your current revenue exposure to South America and then just the principal countries and types of vehicles that we should be mindful of that you're levered to?
Jeffrey Craig: As far as our revenue exposure...
Kevin Nowlan: Last year, we were at revenue of about $200 million in Brazil.
Jeffrey Craig: $200 million.
Kevin Nowlan: And you can see what's happened in the market there. So, our revenue this year will be down about 30% in Brazil, probably in the 130s.
Jeffrey Craig: And our exposure is primarily on the heavy side and less on the medium duty side in Brazil as you look at those markets. We particularly have exposure on the extra heavy side, which is doing slightly better in a very weak market right now with the wins with DAF most recently. Their product is focused on that extra heavy side and we have a little more exposure on that side.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay. Helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Neil Frohnapple: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter, guys.
Jeffrey Craig: Thanks, Neil.
Neil Frohnapple: Hey, are you able to provide an update on the amount of incremental revenue expected to be realized in FY 2017 from the new business wins already achieved? I know you won't provide initial FY 2017 revenue guidance that's on November. What I'm just trying to get at whether you think you have enough revenue in the pipeline from new business wins to offset the further cost you alluded in your global line market?
Jeffrey Craig: Neil, this is Jay. Just let me give you a couple of data points. Approximately $300 million of that new revenue win we expect to be in fiscal year 2016. And then we expect the remainder to flow through over the next couple of years. So, relatively near-term improvement. Obviously, we're repositioning, focusing on M2019 objectives and starting to refocus to develop a similar pipeline as well for that period.
Neil Frohnapple: Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just talk about the increase in your North American medium-duty forecast. I mean, is that just fine-tuning the outlook based on year-to-date performance or is the outlook for underlying demand getting better? And then just is your comments about continued pressure on FY 2017 also applicable to this market? And then, I guess, just finally, can you just talk about how the launch of the 13X Axle for the medium-duty market tracking versus your expectation? Thank you.
Jeffrey Craig: Sure. Thanks. Yeah. The medium-duty market, you even saw on some of the information coming out last night, has been more stable than the Class 8 market. Right now, down a bit but still even on last night's information, but it has been more stable. Our exposure to that market is relatively small compared to our Class 8 exposure. We have a couple of large customers who are associated with Navistar and Hino. We are in the process of launching the 13X Axle with Navistar and it's going very well. And we would expect to plan that launched with Hino here in the future as we go forward. And we continue that discussions with other OEs about that product because of our belief that it's a superior product in terms of performance in fuel economy and durability.
Neil Frohnapple: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is now open.
Colin Langan: Thanks for taking my question. Any color - can you just remind us how you're hedged for commodities? I mean, is it something impacting margins [indiscernible] on a rolling basis or do you have actual direct exposure to [indiscernible]?
Jeffrey Craig: With the bulk of our OE customers we have pass-through mechanism that allows us to pass through increases or decreases as steel indices move. And those are intended to match up with our purchasing activity from our suppliers. Now, there is a lag between the cost coming through favorably or unfavorably from our supplier and the pass-through mechanism to our customer and that lag tends to be in the range of about six months. So, as we've gotten some benefit from steel over the course of the early part of this year with indices coming down we've been now giving that back to our customers through the pass-through mechanisms. And then as we look to the fourth quarter and we start to see the index tick up, we'll start to see some headwind from that, but then we would get the benefit of that from our customers back sometime during 2017, effectively on a six-month lag.
Colin Langan: And when you say bulk, you mean - I mean, any percent around that in terms of percent you're directly exposed to versus the percent on pass-through?
Jeffrey Craig: With our OE customers in the North America, European, Brazilian markets, really all of our OE business has done some sort of pass-through arrangement. The only businesses that aren't formally really on a pass-through mechanism would be our Africa market business with is really just more subject to the pricing pressures in that market.
Colin Langan: Got it. Any color - so you completed the - correct me if I'm wrong, you completed the $210 million repurchase. You now have $100 million repurchase authorized per stock. I mean, how should we be thinking about that going forward as you try to balance repurchases versus improving the balance sheet of the business?
Kevin Nowlan: [indiscernible]. I think you characterized it the right way. If you think about $150 million debt authorization and the $100 million of common equity authorization, they are authorization. They're not specific programs. They're authorization that allow us to execute on our M2019 capital allocation priorities. And you remember what those are from Analyst Day, maintaining strong liquidity, achieving BB credit metrics, returning 25% of cash flow to shareholders and supporting our strategic growth initiatives. So, what these authorizations do is they give us the flexibility to be opportunistic in executing against those capital allocation priorities which includes a mix of both taking out some additional debts to reduce our leverage because that's important to achieve BB credit metrics, as well as meeting our commitment to returning value to shareholders. You should expect us to start commencing on execution under those programs within the next few quarters.
Colin Langan: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Brett Hoselton: Good morning, gentlemen.
Jeffrey Craig: Good morning.
Kevin Nowlan: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Hoselton: I was hoping you can maybe delve into a little bit more the state of your end markets, in particular, North America and Brazil. I guess what I'm really looking for is kind of a from a 30,000 foot perspective, as you look at them and the puts and takes in the industry and drivers and so forth, where do you think we're at in terms of the cycle? And again, in particular, I'm interested in your thoughts on North America and Brazil.
Jeffrey Craig: Sure. Well, I'll start first with Brazil, Brett. I was down there just a few weeks back and I think what we're seeing as it appears to market has stabilized at this very low level that the inventory levels seem correct from what the demand is right now. So, if we see an uptick in demand, it should move relatively quickly into production. We're not seeing that at this point, but at least, the inventory levels seem to be balanced in the right direction. And if we move to North America, I think it's really an opposite issue. We still have excess inventory in the system. You could - depending on which figure you look at, it could be upwards to a month's worth of production, it's still an inventory that needs to clear the system. As the fleets are being very cautious, freight rates have become a bit unstable if you look at the release - the recent public earnings releases from Swift or on Knight. They're still seeing pressure on freight rates. And I think this is really going to take two things for us to see that market to begin to pick up back more to a replacement demand level. And that is that the fleets see stronger freight rates and we start to see that inventory get to a more normalized level. And so, what I'm looking towards is really to the ATA meeting in the first week of October that tends to be a good bellwether with a lot of the larger fleets placing their orders around that time period. And we should get a pretty clear view of where inventory stand at that point.
Brett Hoselton: So, in Brazil, it sounds like it's stabilized. Do you have any stance as to a possibility of an inflection point at any point in time? Is there any signs that you see in Brazil that caused you to think, I think that after the Olympics are over, for example, things are going to start to improve or something along those lines?
Jeffrey Craig: I'm not confident enough to stick my neck out on predicting the Brazilian economy yet. But, as I said, I think the good news is it appears the inventory levels have gotten to the right level of where we should see any upticks very quickly move in to production demand. So, that's the first step they needed to get to and they've gotten there.
Brett Hoselton: And it sounds like we're still working to do the inventory here in North America, and it's probably out into your 2017 timeframe before there's even a possibility that we could see maybe your production inflection. Is that...
Jeffrey Craig: I think as I've mentioned in my comments, we think the first two quarters, there remains some inventory to be cleared out of the system.
Brett Hoselton: Okay. Great. Thank you very much, Jay.
Jeffrey Craig: Yeah. Thank you, Brett.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Birge for closing remarks.
Eric Birge: Thank you, everybody. And this will conclude our call today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-05-04 12:45:00) =====

Analysts: Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Meritor Incorporated Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.
Carl D. Anderson - Vice President and Treasurer: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's second quarter 2016 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we are recording, is a property of Meritor, Inc.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Carl, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by saying that I continue to be proud of our team's performance this quarter and over the past three years since we launched M2016. We use the word transformational to describe the change that has occurred at Meritor. We've created a new way of working that is now characterized by a dedicated focus on our most critical priorities and disciplined execution toward achievements of our long-term objectives. Simply put, M2016 defined for us the areas we knew we needed to dramatically approve upon if we were to become a company positioned for growth and greater shareholder return. Those areas included safety, quality, and delivery, product development, improved customer relationships and better cost management. Driven by the discipline we've demonstrated during the execution of M2016, we've proven our ability to successfully manage the cyclicality inherent in our industry without impeding the investments required to fund our future growth objectives. Through excellent management of materials, labor and burden, in addition to growing our business with important customers and developing new products, we are on track to meet the financial objectives we set three years ago. And we accomplished this even as some of our largest markets have declined more significantly than anticipated. Before I go on, I want to take a moment to touch on our recent announcement. As most of you know, Ike Evans has stepped down from his position as Executive Chairman, but will continue to serve as a Director on our board. Bill Newlin has been elected to serve as non-Executive Chairman. Ike's decision to step down reflects the planned leadership transition that commenced last year with the separation of the Chairman and CEO roles. Ike played an integral role in our transformation and steered us through the launch and execution of our M2016 plan, which has greatly improved Meritor's operations and financial position. We are grateful that we will continue to work with Ike as a member of our board and benefit from his insight and experience. Now, let's turn to slide three and talk about the highlights from our second fiscal quarter of 2016. In the phase of rapidly changing end markets, we're continuing to execute well both in markets where we are experiencing increasing and decreasing production volumes. The softening market in North America, combined with the severe recession that continues in South America, is obviously putting pressure on our results this year, and is only being partially offset by strengthening markets in Europe and India. The new business wins and penetration increases that we've driven in M2016, particularly in North America, have further mitigated the effects of some of our weaker markets. Even in this environment, we reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.9%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.41 and revenue that is down 5% or $43 million from the same period last year. As I said earlier, strong value-added customer relationships continue to differentiate us in the market. In March, we were pleased to announce a contract extension with Navistar that I'll talk about on the next slide. In the second quarter, we also repurchased $55 million of our 4.625% convertible notes that were outstanding. Since the start of our $210 million equity and equity-linked repurchase program, we bought back 8.1 million common shares and are on track to complete the entire program by September this year, another commitment achieved in the phase of volatile markets. Let's move to slide four for a closer look at the Navistar agreement. As we announced, under the terms of this contract, we retained standard position for brakes and rear axles, as well as standard position for front axles in severe service, medium-duty and bus applications. Not only are we excited about the opportunity to extend our relationship and retain standard position for another five years, we also look forward to collaborating with Navistar on its Open Integration initiative. Open Integration will utilize future technologies and designs to provide improvements in the total cost of ownership for end users while also offering supplier expertise and the availability of a broader service network like we have at Meritor. If you turn to slide five, you'll see that we are also offering our customers integrated products and bundlings that will provide many benefits including lower costs, weight savings, ease of assembly and serviceability. Let me give you a few examples. In March, we introduced the MFS+ Front Steer Axle for 12,000 pound and 13,000 pound applications in North America. This is the next evolution in Meritor's front steer axle offering, with new advanced beam material and integrated torque plates and tie-rod arms that offers up to 85 pounds of weight savings and allows for easier installation. We'll take this as a step further over the next few years when we launch a fully integrated front axle system that optimizes form, fit and function. This system will include Meritor EX+ disc brakes and additional wheel-end options. In China, we're launching Meritor's DUALite Series of integrated systems for the bus and coach market. With more than 50% of our business in the region now being on highway, we're offering fully dressed axle options that are manufactured locally. Customers will benefit from lower life cycle costs and increased reliability. And for the Humvee recap program that could start in 2019, we will offer an integrated rolling chassis. It will be complete with front and rear high-mobility independent suspensions and fully dressed with wheel-ends and disc brakes, a transfer case and frame rails reinforced to handle the higher load requirements for the upgrade. We're going to do all the assembly in our plants and deliver the integrated chassis to our customers just like you see here. Again, the primary benefit is that like the others, it has been engineered as a system. Specific benefits include better ride and handling, improved driveline angles, reduced weight, and easier packaging into a Humvee capsule. We are also currently pursuing opportunities for this solution outside the U.S. market. We'll share more about this new integrated solutions in the future. Now, let's go to slide six, for a look at our end markets. Overall, we've reduced our outlook for North and South America. We're lowering our expectations for Class 8 volumes in North America by 8% to approximately 245,000 units, down from the 265,000 units we projected in February. We believe that excess Class 8 inventory and declining used truck prices are causing the fleets to adjust their orders for new trucks. This is leading OEs to reduce production levels. One data point we watch is the inventory to retail sales ratio, which is currently at 3.3 months, significantly higher than more healthy level of 1.5 months to 2.5 months. Based on various data points including truck ton miles, we believe we may be in the midst of an inventory correction in Class 8. And once excess inventory is used, we expect to see the market stabilize at a relatively normal production level. Also, we have been seeing lower than anticipated order activity in our North American aftermarket business. As we started the year, we expected the overall market in North America to be up modestly in 2016. However, during the first six months of the fiscal year, we have actually seen the market soften. We have been able to mitigate the effect on revenue through increased share in certain product lines like air systems (10:53), which is why our overall revenue for that business is roughly flat year-over-year. But the market softening that we're seeing this year is a headwind relative to our prior expectations. The medium-duty market continues to be robust, and as a result, we have increased our forecast for Class 5-7 to the top end of the range we gave you on our first quarter call at 220,000 units. This also makes us more excited about the introduction of the 13X axle that we've previously discussed which is specifically targeted at this market. Moving over to Europe, the market remains stable and is trending positive as we look at medium and heavy truck registrations and the road freight index, two market indicators in the region. We expect the European market to be up 4% to 6% year-over-year, consistent with our previous forecast. In South America, I'm sure you know the political and economic situation remains extremely challenged. GDP continues to decline. The political environment is uncertain, and we do not have any indication at this time that a recovery is likely in the near future. We are revising our outlook for the year to the low-end of our previous range at 70,000 units. On slide seven, we have provided an update of our M2016 scorecard. The main takeaway from this chart is that we are on track to achieve all three financial objectives this year. As we told you, we felt margin improvement was the most important target. When we launched this program three years ago, we had just posted an adjusted EBITDA margin of slightly under 6% for the first half of 2013. Our target was to increase our margin by around 400 basis points. And as you can see, we've been extremely successful in moving along that trajectory. We ended last year at 9.5%. This quarter, we're at 9.9% and we remain confident we're going to hit the 10% for the full fiscal year. The second financial target was to reduce net debt by more than $400 million. We achieved that target at the end of fiscal 2015, and we're confident we'll stay at or below that level through fiscal 2016. At the same time, we are returning value to our shareholders and are on track to complete the $210 million stock repurchase program. Our third target was to achieve $500 million of incremental book revenue. As of March 31 of this year, we are at $450 million. Building relationships with our customers and introducing new products to the market have provided us the opportunity to grow our share, particularly in our largest market, North America. We now have long-term contracts with the four largest OEs in North America and our partnerships with each of them have never been stronger. With the foundation established by our M2016 plan, we are now well-positioned to grow in the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for more detail on the quarter and our outlook for the 2016 fiscal year.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning. As you heard from Jay, we had another quarter of strong performance as we continue to execute our M2016 strategy. The consistency in our results over many quarters has established a solid foundation to build upon, as we begin our M2019 growth strategy. Let's walk through the details of our second quarter financial results by turning to slide eight. Sales were $821 million in the quarter, down 5% compared to last year. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower commercial truck production in North and South America and weaker foreign currencies, especially in Brazil, relative to the U.S. dollar. Although revenue was down, we expanded our gross margin by 140 basis points, reflecting our continuing ability to drive lower material, labor and burden costs. In fact, our 14.7% gross margin is one of the highest we've achieved since the launch of M2016. SG&A was $3 million higher in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to a favorable adjustment to our incentive compensation accruals last year. Income tax expense was $7 million in the second quarter of 2016, which translates to an effective tax rate of approximately 18%, up slightly from last year. The increased tax rate was driven by the fact that we now recognized tax expense in countries like Italy and Sweden, following the reversal of our valuation allowances in those countries at the end of last year. As we discussed last fall, we are now adding back non-cash tax expense in countries with net operating losses when reporting adjusted income and adjusted EPS. This accounted for $3 million in the quarter of the total adjustments you see on the slide. The bottom line is that we generated $33 million of income from continuing operations attributable to Meritor and after adjustments for non-cash tax expense from restructuring costs, we generated adjusted income from continuing operations of $38 million or $0.41 per share, down just $0.01 from last year. Let's move to slide nine, which compares our sales and EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 to 2015. Foreign exchange continued to be a headwind in the quarter on both revenue and EBITDA. Revenue was down $24 million due to foreign exchange translation driven by the strong U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and other currencies. As highlighted on the chart, we also had $6 million of lower EBITDA year-over-year caused by the one-time gain from foreign exchange hedges that we reported in 2015. Beyond foreign exchange, we saw revenue reduction relative to last year of $19 million due to lower production in the North America Class 8 truck market and in South America partially offset by increasing penetration in North America from our new business wins announced over the last couple of years. Despite this overall lower production, we continue to drive strong material, labor and burden performance. This, combined with lower steel indices, overcame lower production and drove $5 million in positive EBITDA from volume mix, performance and other. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.9%, down only 20 basis points from last year. And if you were to exclude the one-time FX gains from a year ago, then we really saw better cost management completely offset the impact of lower revenue on our reported EBITDA. Slide 10 details second quarter sales and EBITDA for each of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck and Industrial segment, sales were $631 million, down $50 million or 7% from the same period last year. Lower Class 8 truck production in North America, combined with lower production and a weaker currency in South America, drove the revenue decline in the segment. Again though, this was partially mitigated by our increased market share on axles in the Class 8 truck market. Segment EBITDA was $56 million, down only $1 million from last year, which drove an increase in EBITDA margin to 8.9%, up 50 basis points from last year. This increased margin was primarily driven by strong cost management that continues to favorably impact our earnings. In the Aftermarket and Trailer segment, sales were $218 million, up 3% from last year, driven by stronger sales in our North American trailer business. Segment EBITDA was $28 million, down $2 million compared to last year. The decrease was driven primarily by unfavorable mix in our aftermarket business, which brought our margin down 140 basis points to 12.8%. Now, let's turn to slide 11. For the second quarter, total free cash flow was $19 million compared to $27 million in the prior year. The biggest driver of the decline year-over-year was the increase in capital expenditures, as we remain committed to investing in new product development to support our M2016 and M2019 revenue growth initiatives. You can see this by looking at the bottom of the slide where our cash flow from operations, which excludes CapEx, was actually up by $6 million from the second quarter of last year. Now, let's turn to slide 12 which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchase program. As expected, investors exercised their put option on $55 million of 4.625% convertible notes. As a result, we repurchased these notes at par during the quarter. Consistent with what we previously communicated, this equity-linked repurchase is part of our $210 million buyback program, which means that our cumulative repurchases now stand at $171 million. With approximately $100 million of free cash flow generation expected during the second half of this fiscal year, we remain confident that we will complete the buyback program by September as planned. Given where market prices are for our common equity, our current expectation is that substantially all of the remaining $39 million will be used to repurchase common equity. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook on slide 13. Based on the demand assumptions Jay highlighted earlier, we've lowered our 2016 sales guidance to approximately $3.275 billion. Our current expectations of lower production levels in the North America Class 8 market and flat aftermarket sales are the primary drivers of this downward revision. Despite the decreased revenue outlook, we remain on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA margin target of 10%. We continue to drive margin performance just like we have consistently done throughout M2016. Although we're maintaining our 10% margin outlook with revenue lower by $125 million, we now expect to generate lower bottom line earnings. That's why we're reducing our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a new range of $1.55 to $1.65 for fiscal year 2016, down $0.10 from our previous outlook. We continue to expect another strong year for free cash flow generation, although slightly lower than previous guidance as a result of the lower bottom line earnings. In addition, as we head into the second half of the fiscal year, we anticipate that we will not be able to reduce inventory to previously targeted levels, because production had declined more rapidly than we anticipated when the year began. As a result, we're expecting modestly elevated inventory levels until the early part of next fiscal year. Nonetheless, we still expect to generate $90 million of free cash flow for the full fiscal year. Our execution of M2016 has fundamentally strengthened our earnings profile and cash-generating ability, and that has put us firmly on the path of achieving our third consecutive year reporting more than $100 million of adjusted net income. We successfully managed the North American truck upturn profitably and with strong cash flow generation, and we're doing the same as our largest market now returns to more normalized production levels. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 14. The message I want to leave you with today is that our continued focus on those parts of the business that we can control has allowed us to stay on track to achieve our M2016 financial objectives. Over the past three years, we have developed the core competencies needed to help mitigate the effects of the cyclicality inherent in our business. In other words, downturns are not as dramatic (23:29) to our bottom line as they once were. Cost management, customer relationships and new product development have led to an improved financial profile. This is demonstrated by the fact that despite taking our sales outlook down by $125 million for fiscal 2016, we are still tracking to the 10% adjusted EBITDA margin, and we continue to win in the marketplace. With these competencies in place, we are well-positioned to execute on our M2019 growth focus plan which could be further fueled if our global markets strengthen over the next few years. Now, let's take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Your line is now open.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Any color on what drove the negative aftermarket trailer mix? Is that just reflecting the trailer growing and aftermarket start being flat (24:45) or can you give any color on how aftermarket within that is performing?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hey, Colin, this is Kevin. I'll take that. Fundamentally, it's a change in the mix of our aftermarket North America portfolio that we've seen year-over-year where we really saw the increase in brake and wheel-end components which tends to be lower margin business for us, offset by a decrease in product mix of our higher margin business which tends to be our drivetrain components. So fundamentally, we saw that mix shift on a year-over-year basis.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. So it's within aftermarket. And how is the aftermarket trending? Your guidance for the year now is flat. How has it been? Within the results, is the aftermarket flat for the year-to-date or is that just a continuation (25:26) or does that imply getting better or worse for the rest of the year within Aftermarket and Trailer?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sorry. We were having a tough time hearing you, but I think, Colin, your question was is aftermarket down for the full year. Did I hear you correctly?
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Just what is the outlook for aftermarket, just broadly? I mean, because within – I'm trying to understand embedded in the Aftermarket and Trailer, how is the aftermarket actually doing standalone?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. So far this year, aftermarket is slightly down in North America. But overall, we were expecting actually the markets to be up in aftermarket. But we haven't seen that as we were anticipating. On a full year basis, we're expecting the aftermarket to be relatively flat year-over-year, but what that means is that we're going to see our typical seasonal increase in revenue in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year, particularly as we go into this third fiscal quarter.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. And can you give a – just remind us where you stand with market share in terms of the PACCAR win last year? Are you – when do you – have you been increasing shares sequentially? And when do you start to anniversary the gains that you got with that customer?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we jumped off as (26:39) we talked about head count on – this is Jay. We jumped off as (26:42) we talked about at the Analyst Day about 50% penetration. And so, I think that we're starting to – we certainly expect year-over-year increases, because that penetration level certainly wasn't at that same level at these quarters last year.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you very much for taking my questions.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. A couple of things. First, can you just help us think about when we think about the mix and performance? On our calculations, it's probably worth at least $9 million or $10 million in the quarter, within that volume, which is obviously a headwind I'm talking about Commercial. How do you – could you divide that between you're doing better gross margins and the products either through and then to the extent you're doing that is to what extent it's kind of moving to more differentiated products with our margins or is it materials? And then in terms of the major kind of cost takeouts or cost improvement outside of SG&A, the cost permits are going to COGS, how that played out?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Brian, this is Kevin. You're right. Your math is roughly in the right range as you think about that $5 million line item we call volume mix performance and other, and there is volume and mix is a negative in that number. So you're in the right area. In terms of what that $10 million or something in that range looks like, what's driving the positive numbers there, a piece of it is lower steel indices. That's worth about $4 million year-over-year. The difference between the good news we get from lower steel prices from our suppliers and passing that back through to our customers on a lagged basis. And the balance of that is really material, labor and burden performance, driving cost performance not really, in this case, to the SG&A line, it's really been through the material, labor and performance lines, which goes through the gross margin.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And second question. What's your expectations for the revenue tailwind from new business? You started out assuming $175 million, but obviously, the end market in North American Class 8 has moved downward. And so, where are you on that, or was it maybe not tied to the Class 8 market?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It was tied to the Class 8 market. When we originally announced that, it was based effectively on about a $260 million market when we're announcing new business wins. So effectively, in our guidance, we are seeing the effects of what we had hoped to achieve in terms of the new business year-over-year.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, good. And just final question, given the softness of the Class 8 market, how is that playing through in terms of the couple of factors? First, OEMs' desire to use the in-sourced solutions when available, and second, just in terms of the pricing environment in the marketplace.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Hey, Brian. This is Jay. Yeah, I think in answer to your first question, obviously, the one customer that has that alternative would be Daimler and we're seeing our penetrations remain stable there, consistent with the agreement that we have with them over the long-term. And then, secondly, on pricing, as you're well aware, we have long-term contracts with all our customers where the pricing remains relatively fixed other than the pass-through mechanisms for materials, which we do see. As market slowdowns occur, obviously that commodity price can decline and we can be passing a lot of those benefits to customers.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But no major attempt either from the OEMs or the fleets to push the pressures on their businesses upstream to you?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: No, I think everybody in the industry appreciates that this is a highly cyclical industry, and they expect us to perform on the up-cycles when they can generate significant revenue and profitability, but that also requires that we have some fixed level of expectations of what pricing will be on the down-cycles, so we can manage our business to it. So we are not seeing them.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, my main question is just on the margin trajectory. You're sticking with the 10%. You're running kind of in the 9.6%, 9.7% range in the first half, and it does imply – it's a little bit of an acceleration in the second half, I think, like year-on-year, like, up 80 basis points. I think we've talked about some of the factors that would help like the non-recurrence of that $6 million comp issue. But what are some of the other factors that we need to think about to get to that acceleration?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. Patrick, it's Kevin. I think your math is roughly right. I mean we're expecting to effectively average something around 10.4% for the back half of the year. Now, keep in mind, we're coming off a 9.9% quarter. But nonetheless, we're expecting the full back half of the year to be around 10.4%. To put that in perspective, what that means is we have to outperform 10% in the back half by about $6 million of EBITDA if you just do the math, so $3 million or so a quarter. And there's really two fundamental drivers of that. One is that revenue in the back half of the year is slightly stronger than the front half of the year. And so, we'd expect to contribute on that. And then second, we continue to reap the benefits from our performance initiatives, the material, labor and burden performance initiatives as they achieve full run rate for the full year.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. I mean for me, it's a little easier to think of it year-on-year rather than sequentially, but it sounds like aside from the comp issue, the burden initiatives will continue to produce pretty significant improvements year-on-year as well.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Absolutely. As they have even in the second quarter, and you can see that just in response to Brian's question, volume mix performance and other were showing a plus $5 million, but that has a negative headwind from the mix we talked about in the aftermarket.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Plus just volume being down $19 million, yet, we're still throwing off a plus $5 million in that line item. So our performance has been pretty significant year-over-year.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Yeah. I mean it sounded like you're pointing to something. And maybe my math is wrong, but it sounded like $8 million or $9 million of year-on-year just, I guess, performance is what I would've gotten based on that conversation. Is that right?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I mean there's a number of things going on in there. You have again the steel indices, which is a tailwind, about $4 million year-over-year. We have quite a bit of material, labor and burden performance. And there's even some negative from FX on transaction. We have some transaction purchases which is part of our material cost overall that's been negatively impacted. But the net of all of that plus the volume and mix is the plus $5 million.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, I know. Maybe I'll follow up with you online, because when I was just kind of disaggregating that plus $5 million, it sounded like performance was a pretty big number like plus $8 million or $9 million within that equation, but maybe we can follow up after.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. It's probably even a little bit north of that but that's right. It's a pretty big number.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple. Your line is now open.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Kevin, you mentioned lower steel cost, I think, was the $4 million tailwind in the quarter. Should we expect these benefits to begin to moderate or even become a headwind later this year? Can you just remind us what a typical lag is, the changes in steel indices?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think the answer is yes to that. I mean we got some benefit in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis and some more benefit in the second quarter. But as we look at the full year, we're not expecting to see much incremental benefit from it, because in some cases, steel prices have flatted or even in North America here in the last quarter, they've ticked up a little bit. So as we look at the full year on a year-over-year basis, we think we'll see a tailwind in total, but most of that tailwind is already in the P&L that we reported for the first half. The risk we have as we look out is if steel prices were to increase, because the cost coming through from our suppliers happens more quickly than the pass-through back to our customers. And so, our outlook right now is based on an expectation that steel prices roughly moderate at where they are, which is slightly up this past quarter in North America, although slightly down still in Europe overall.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. Thanks. And maybe a question for Jay. I mean just not looking for 2017 guidance by any means, but just given North America truck continues to deteriorate, again, with orders being weaker than expected out last night, just curious if you think this is more just temporary like mid-cycle slowdown, as the industry tries to work through this excess inventory, and you think we can kind of return to growth in 2017 for the North American Class 8 market. I mean just any more color you can provide on just conversations you're having with fleets and your customers.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: I think at this point we do still believe it is an inventory correction from the aggressive buy last year. I mean if you look at a lot of the underlying factors that stabilized and are starting to improve, I think the manufacturing index has been positive the last two months. We're seeing the outlook for ton miles to be slowly increasing over time. What we look at is over the long term, trucking moves almost exactly on a flat line (36:44) with GDP growth. So if the overall economy holds up, this inventory should clear the system and we should go back to more normalized levels. Now, will we get back to the peak demand we saw a year ago? Probably not. But can we get back to normal replacement demand orders and production? We believe so.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: All right. Got it. So I mean assuming that inventory correction works its way through and we get positive GDP growth, you're saying there's no reason why we shouldn't see some North American Class 8 growth next year?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, that's what we believe at this point, that's correct.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Thanks, Jay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. Can you just update us on any progress made during the quarter relative to your pursuit of the revenue opportunity you talked about at your last Investor Day, the components area or North America off-highway don't expect that they (37:43) contributed during the quarter, but discussions you're having with customers, et cetera.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Great question. On the components piece, we are working with several potential customers responding to quotes that we had developed the business stream for. And so, we're very optimistic on that. As far as the off-highway, it's a little different approach. We are developing the products necessary to address that market. We're having discussions with potential customers and getting a very clear understanding of what they would expect from us in terms of product attributes and offerings, and we're aggressively investing in those applications. And so, we're still very optimistic about that. We think we have a lot of competitive strengths to bring to both of those marketplaces, not the least of which is just a reliability of delivery, the cost of our products and also the quality that we have. So we still feel very, very optimistic about those markets.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Then – and just last question, it seems like Western Europe registrations have been coming in better. I'm curious if you're also seeing it with regard to your big customer over there, Volvo and is this offset already sort of included in your lower guide today?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'll start with the end of (39:11) your question first. It is included in our guide, but I think it's more than Volvo. We are seeing that with Volvo, but I think what is really heartening to us is that our customer (39:25) and Renault were starting to see strengthening in that Southern European market as well which we haven't seen for several years. So I think it's across our customer portfolio base there in Europe. We're seeing a pretty broad-based recovery.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Carl Anderson for any closing remarks.
Carl D. Anderson - Vice President and Treasurer: Thank you, Eric. We do appreciate your participation in today's call. If you have follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me directly. And this does conclude Meritor's second quarter 2016 earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Carl, and good morning. We appreciate you joining us today. It was great seeing you at our Analyst Day back in December. Let's turn to slide 3 and talk about the highlights from our first fiscal quarter of 2016. We had another strong financial quarter overall. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.4% reflects a 40 basis point improvement year-over-year, which further demonstrates the sustainability of the performance we have shown over the past 12 quarters. Also, at the end of the last calendar year, we are very pleased to announce an additional piece of business in our growing relationship with PACCAR. Starting on January 1 of this year, Meritor is now in standard position for rear axles on all linehaul Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks with our 14X product, as well as drivelines. Just 18 months ago, we were at approximately 12% penetration with this customer. As of December, we were over 50%. It has been a significant and successful ramp-up that we expect to continue to drive increased penetrations throughout this year. As we told you at Analyst Day, we have now achieved $435 million toward our M2016 goal of $500 million in new business. This puts us close to 90% of the way toward achieving our revenue target. We are proud of this accomplishment because it validates the success of our strategy to increase customer focus and execute a more aggressive product development and introduction cadence. From a balance sheet perspective, in the first quarter, we repurchased $42 million of common stock, bringing us to a total of $116 million. Since the start of the program, we have repurchased 8.1 million common shares and we remain committed to finishing the entire $210 million program this year. We also remain confident in our ability to achieve our three main financial targets under our M2016 program. Now, let's talk about the global markets, starting with a closer look at North America on slide 4. In December, we told you we expected Class 8 volumes to be in the range of 275,000 units to 290,000 units for fiscal 2016. Based on current market conditions and discussions with our customers, we've reduced our outlook to approximately 265,000 units. As you can see from this chart, this fiscal year production translates to a calendar year of 250,000 units. In our first fiscal quarter, production was approximately 72,000 units or 14,000 units higher than the current outlook for the fourth calendar quarter. This is an important data point to be aware of when comparing our projections for 2016, as compared to others in the industry. With the changes in order levels over the past couple of months, and concerns regarding inventory levels in the North American Class 8 trucking market, we have seen significant volatility in the equity values and companies in our sector. Our belief is that based upon the fundamental improvements we've made to the company over the past few years, we will continue to generate meaningful earnings and cash flow, even at volume levels lower than where we are today. As a result, we wanted to provide you with a data point that may help you model how volume changes in North America impact us. For every 5,000 unit change in Class 8 production, the revenue impact to us is approximately $20 million. We also expect to continue to manage our incremental and decremental earnings conversion on revenue at our normal historical levels of 15% to 20%. You can use this as a guide as you think about the impact of different Class 8 market assumptions on our earnings and cash flow. In addition to significantly increasing the profitability of Meritor through the execution of our M2016 strategy, we have also substantially reduced the breakeven points of the company. This has been accomplished through a reduction in debt and pension liabilities over the last three years. All of these changes make us confident in our ability to achieve both our short and long-term objectives, even in this current market environment. Let's go to slide 5. With the exception of North America, our outlook for the remaining global markets is unchanged from our previous guidance. We expect Western Europe to remain stable with moderate growth of 3% to 5% this year. As we've said, the average age of the truck fleet is about 7.5 years, which should help drive new truck production. Freight tonnage movement in the region also continues to gradually improve as well. India is showing signs of strengthening. Strong GDP growth is driving growth in truck production, and we expect that to continue this year. We are developing and introducing many new products specifically designed for this region so that we have a portfolio that continues to meet the unique needs of our growing customer base. South America continues in a deep recession, with no significant change expected in the near-term. We anticipate volumes to decline year-over-year by 10% to 20%, resulting in total production of 70,000 to 80,000 medium and heavy units in fiscal 2016. China also remains a difficult market, but we anticipate stabilization in bus and coach, and off-highway markets in fiscal 2016. On slide 6, we wanted to reiterate our commitment to increased results-oriented product development. The financial improvements that we've made at the company have enabled us to generate strong, sustainable levels of cash flow. This allows us to maintain our commitment to investing in a robust product portfolio that is market-directed toward specific customer applications. This is a high priority for us as we strive to meet the needs of our customers around the world and capitalize on the future recovery in the markets. In the past, we'd launched approximately three products annually. Over the past two years and going forward, we plan to launch six to seven every year. Here, you see the major product launches we have planned for 2016. This development and launch plan includes products for heavy and medium duty, as well as vocational and trailer products. Our product development focus is on advanced gear manufacturing and efficiency, which is reflected in many of these products and will continue to generate even more advancements down the road. This is the new Meritor, where you can expect this rate of development to continue. We will work with our customers to introduce products that meet their needs. As I said, we view this as a critical success factor to our future growth strategy. Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin for a closer look at the quarter and our outlook for the fiscal year.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I'll review our first quarter financial results, and then I'll take you through our updated 2016 guidance. Overall, we had another quarter of strong performance. While we face challenging global markets, we continue to execute and deliver on our M2016 strategies. The result is that we're driving margin performance, which is overcoming these macroeconomic headwinds, leading to a sustained trend of positive bottom-line earnings and strong EBITDA margins. Let's walk through the details by first turning to slide 7, where you'll see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $809 million in the quarter, down 8% from last year. The lower revenue was primarily driven by weaker currencies in Europe and Brazil relative to the U.S. dollar, and lower commercial truck production in Brazil. That drove gross margin to $104 million or 12.9% of sales. SG&A was $9 million lower in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. This quarter, we received $17 million of settlement proceeds related to certain asbestos insurance claims that were previously in dispute. Of this $17 million, we were able to recognize $5 million as income in the current period. This insurance settlement is another step forward in our strategy to mitigate the cost of our legacy liabilities, like asbestos. Excluding these insurance proceeds, SG&A was still lower by $4 million relative to last year, as we continue to maintain discipline in managing our cost structure. Interest expense was $22 million in the quarter compared to $19 million a year ago. You may recall that in the first quarter of last year, we had a $2 million one-time favorable impact from interest income in Brazil relating to a refund of a judicial deposit. Income tax expense was $7 million in the first quarter of 2016, which translates to an effective tax rate of approximately 19%. This relatively low effective tax rate is a reflection of the fact that we are starting to generate earnings in jurisdictions like the U.S. where we continue to maintain valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Because of this, we are currently booking no tax expense against such earnings. In addition, it's important to note that $2 million of the reported $7 million in book tax expense is non-cash, and relates to the use of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions like Sweden, Italy, and Mexico, where we have reversed our valuation allowances. As we discussed at our Analyst Day in December, our adjusted diluted EPS now excludes such non-cash tax expense associated with the use of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions with NOLs. This $2 million of non-cash tax expense is included as an add-back in the adjustment line that walks to our adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter. Bottom-line, then, we generated $28 million of income from continuing operations attributable to Meritor, and adjusted income from continuing operations of $31 million or $0.33 per diluted share. Let's move to slide 8, which compares our sales and EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to 2015. You can really see the impact foreign currency had on our financial results year-over-year, a $51 million impact on revenue and a $12 million impact on EBITDA. But with the good news we generated in SG&A, and with continued reductions in material, labor and burden costs, we largely offset the EBITDA impact of foreign exchange. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.4%, up 40 basis points over last year. Slide 9 details first quarter sales and EBITDA for each of our reporting segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $633 million, down $70 million or 10% from the same period last year. The revenue decline was driven by the currency translation and lower production in Brazil that I discussed previously. Segment EBITDA was $52 million, down $4 million from last year. With EBITDA dollars down only modestly, that drove an increase in EBITDA margin for the segment to 8.2%, up 20 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by lower material, labor and burden costs, which more than offset the margin impact of lower revenue. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $203 million, down 2% from last year. This decline was driven by currency headwinds in our European aftermarket business. Segment EBITDA was $20 million, down $5 million compared to last year. The decrease was driven by currency impacts and one-time launch costs discrete to the quarter, associated with a new warehouse management system. As we told you in the past, the first quarter is normally our weakest in this segment, as there are fewer selling days and certain seasonal trends that impact this business. As we head through the balance of the year, we do expect to see our margins in Aftermarket & Trailer segment return to the levels you've seen in recent quarters. So, we remain bullish in our ability to sustain those types of margins in the business as we look forward. Now, let's turn to slide 10. For the first quarter, total free cash flow was negative $27 million compared to negative $21 million in the prior year. As you know, our first quarter is typically the weakest from a free cash flow perspective due to fewer selling days as a result of the holiday season, which drives lower revenue; working capital trends as we build inventories in anticipation of the aftermarket spring selling season; and the payment of annual incentive compensation for our employees. With those things considered, this first quarter played out pretty much in line with our expectations, with two exceptions. First, our inventory levels are slightly elevated this quarter as we work to manage the supply chain with North American volumes coming in lower than we were anticipating. We do expect to drive these inventory levels down over the balance of the year as we adjust our purchasing activity and inventory banks to reflect the more normalized Class 8 truck volumes that we are now expecting. Second, as I mentioned earlier, we also received $17 million in asbestos insurance proceeds in the quarter. While $5 million was recognized as income, the remaining $12 million is a positive cash flow item that didn't flow through the P&L. You can see that highlighted separately on the cash flow statement. With this first quarter in hand, we remain confident that we are on track to generate more than $100 million in free cash flow for the full year. In fact, that means we anticipate we'll generate more than $130 million in free cash flow over the last nine months of the fiscal year, which is implied in our full year free cash flow guidance. Now, let's turn to slide 11, which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased $42 million of common equity totaling 3.9 million common shares. With more than $130 million of free cash flow generation to come over the balance of 2016, we remain on track to complete the remainder of the buyback program $94 million before the end of the fiscal year. You should expect us to be opportunistic in executing the remaining buybacks under this program, particularly in light of where current market prices are for our equity and equity-linked securities. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2016 outlook on slide 12. Based on the demand assumptions Jay highlighted earlier, we have lowered our fiscal year 2016 sales guidance to the bottom end of the range that we previously provided. We're now expecting approximately $3.4 billion of revenue. The driver of this downward revision is our expectation of lower production levels in the North America Class 8 market. Despite the decreased revenue outlook, we remain on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA margin target of 10%. We will continue to drive margin performance in the face of challenging end markets, just like we've consistently done over the last three years. And we'll do this through continued strong execution of our M2016 initiatives, particularly material, labor and burden performance. That said, 10% margin on $50 million of lower revenue relative to the midpoint of our prior guidance suggests that earnings will be lower by about $5 million. That's why we are reducing our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a new range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share for fiscal 2016, down $0.05 from our previous guidance. Similarly, we expect free cash flow to be down slightly as well, but still at a strong level of $110 million for the full fiscal year. Through M2016, we fundamentally changed our earnings profile and cash-generating ability such that, even in this revenue environment, we are still on pace to achieve more than $150 million in adjusted net income from continuing operations and more than $100 million in free cash flow. We successfully managed the North American truck upturn profitably and with strong cash flow generation, and we are doing the same as our largest market returns to more normalized levels. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide some closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 13. First and foremost, I'll reiterate that we are on track to meet all three financial targets we established for M2016. As we've continued to demonstrate strong results driven by the improvements we've made across the company, we've remained confident in our ability to achieve our margin, net debt, and new business win metrics this year, and to successfully launch our M2019 growth focus plan. With the capabilities we have demonstrated since launching M2016, we have strong momentum in the commercial vehicle marketplace. We've executed on a clear set of strategic priorities that were designed and developed to increase shareholder value. We've proven our ability to execute despite the unfavorable market dynamics that have been ongoing since we launched the M2016 program. Instead of using the markets as an excuse for not achieving our objectives, we use them as a challenge to demonstrate our operating excellence, and we will continue to do so. We have growing customer relationships and a strong brand, both of which are helping us win meaningful business within important global manufacturers. We continue to add to our robust product line that is further strengthening our global market leadership positions, and we have the leadership talent to take us where we want to go. Now, let's take your questions.
Operator: And your first question on the line comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital. Please proceed, sir.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Just want to kind of drill in on a couple of items. You've been assuming $175 million of new business wins in fiscal 2016 coming out of the Analyst Day. Is that still intact? Does the incremental weakness in Class 8 affect that? What could move this number up or down? And I guess – I don't know if you count as new business or just ongoing business – where did market share in Class 8 kind of shake out in the quarter, and what do you expect for the rest of the year?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Brian. This is Jay. Thanks for the question. Yes, in (22:25) comments I made today about the $435 million of being on track new businesses, our confidence in achieving that $175 million, we do market-adjust that number for all the wins globally. So, in North America, as I mentioned, we are seeing the aggressive ramp-up of PACCAR. But please remember, we also had a pretty significant win with Scania in Europe on the braking side. We've had a good hub reduction win with Daimler in India and several other wins throughout the world, in addition to seeing our emerging market axle in China starting to get a great reception with the bus and coach manufacturers. So, there's gives and takes on the market's impact on that, but overall, we remain very confident in the number.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Second question is just around share repurchase. I mean, you must have thought the stock was cheap at $11 when you bought it back. It's now lower. But just given concerns over the cycle, how are you thinking about your kind of balance sheet downside liquidity versus share repurchases in light of – and just all how that whole – remind us how that whole European customer receivables factoring kind of fits in your thinking on that.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hi, Brian. This is Kevin. I'll take that. Yeah, I mean, from a downside liquidity planning, we update that model pretty regularly, as we talked about at Analyst Day, in terms of how we establish how much liquidity we need to manage through the cycles, especially a down cycle that could last upward of three years. And we normally think we drive toward having liquidity in the zip code of about 20% of annualized revenue. As we look at where we sit today, and with our expectation that we are on pace to generate $130 million of free cash flow over the last nine months of the year, we feel confident about our ability to execute the balance of the program which is $94 million between now and the end of the fiscal year. We will look at the market, we'll look at the opportunities that are out there across both equity and equity-linked securities and – but we are confident we can – we have the liquidity to manage to be able to support that program.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And in terms of factoring, any change there?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, no change in factoring. We will continue to utilize those programs as operating – as part of our operating cash flow in that business.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And is that due – at least historically, I remember, is due to some – one very large customer being a rather late-by-world-standards payer?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, I think this is traditionally part of our working capital arrangement with our European customer base and so...
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: ... it's just part of the agreements that we have in place with those customers.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And final question, did you contemplate the insurance recovery when you did your free cash flow guide?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The original free cash flow guide?
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes....
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: There were elements of certain things we were assuming in recoveries in terms of insurance, but I won't get into the specifics how much it was in terms of our expectations. But in terms of the first quarter, I don't think we were anticipating that we were going to see that flow through our results this quarter.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: So just a quick follow-up on the share repo. Kevin, I think in prior quarters, you provided what you guys have repurchased since quarter end. Did you guys repurchase anything since quarter end?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Since quarter end, we have been in blackout. So we haven't been in the market in terms of open market repurchases.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. And then just a question on the revenue guidance. So, in order to achieve the revenue guidance of $3.4 billion for the full year certainly implies a meaningful step-up in revenue from first quarter levels. Clearly, there is less working days or there were less working days and some OEM production shutdowns during the December quarter. We understand Aftermarket & Trailer, it's typically the low watermark for the year in Q1. But just in light of North American production coming down, I mean, is there anything else that we should be thinking of to boost revenue such as revenue from new business wins materializing more throughout the remainder of the year to get us comfortable with the $3.4 billion in revenue?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Neil. This is Jay. I think you've listed off a few of them, actually. Our business, if you recall, at normalized stable market levels is highly seasonal with the first quarter and fourth quarter being our lowest revenue quarters, and the second quarter and third quarter being the strongest. There are several reasons for that. As you mentioned, the holiday shutdowns in North America and Europe in the first quarter and fourth quarter around production, and also the aftermarket business and brake replacement season is highly seasonal. And as you mentioned, we are seeing the ramp-up of our new business wins, as I mentioned on the call. My comments were above 50% penetration with PACCAR. We expect that to continue to increase throughout the year. And if you look at our estimate of the North American Class 8 market, you certainly can see we're not counting on that to be stronger in the back half of the year, certainly, than what we saw in Q1. So, I think those are the main reasons. And we do feel confident in that guidance.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks, Jay. And then, just one final one. Kevin, you alluded to the fact that you expect Aftermarket & Trailer segment margins to pick up for the remainder of the year. I mean, I think last quarter, you talked to 14% to 15% for the full year. Just to clarify, is that outlook still intact?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, I think it's fair to say. As we look at the last nine months of the year, we would expect to see the margins in that segment return to more normalized levels, or what we've been experiencing in the back half of last year. And it's really driven by a couple things. One is revenue picking up, because Q1 is always the low watermark for that business; and second, it's the continued execution of material labor and burden performance initiatives as those continue to come on over the course of the year.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Great. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the aftermarket margin question. In the commentary, it notes that there is a new warehouse cost. The decrementals seem extremely high on the sales decline. Can you maybe quantify the warehouse costs, so we can kind of get a better sense of the underlying decremental ones?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, I mean – and I'd say a couple things. I mean, the headwinds we saw in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, obviously, we had a little bit of a revenue impact, but there's overall FX impacts that we saw, translation and transaction related. As it relates to the warehouse issue, if you look at our North American aftermarket business, the labor and burden year-over-year was about $2 million worth, primarily driven by the discrete issue in the quarter related to the implementation of the new warehouse system. We had an old legacy system, no longer supported, and the new system that we put in place helps us improve throughput and fill rate. So, we're happy with the new system. We had some inefficiencies as we went through the execution of launching that back in November, but that was discrete to the first quarter. So, we should be back on track as we go into the back half of the year.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: How should we think about the sales trajectory for aftermarket with some of the weakness in the new vehicle market? I mean, does that actually help the demand in that business as we go through the year?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, traditionally, aftermarket has been somewhat countercyclical. And so, again, as I stated earlier, it is also highly seasonal with a fairly dependable brake replacement season here in Q2, Q3. So, I think we should expect to see some pretty healthy revenue growth sequentially from Q1 to Q2.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: And in terms of the insurance recovery within the quarter, you said you recognized $5 million of the $12 million, I believe or $17 million, sorry.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That's right.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: How do we think about it? Are you going to recognize more of it in this year? Or is that just a one quarter benefit?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It depends. I mean, as we receive the $17 million of proceeds, we determine how much is earned and it's linked to our estimate of what the probable liability is on our asbestos exposures in the Maremont entity going forward. So, if our outlook for those liabilities were to increase over time, the potential exists that we would recognize more of that – the remaining $12 million into income. If those liabilities decreased over time from our current expectations, the potential exists that we would return some of those monies back to the insurance company, which is why it's sitting on the balance sheet at the moment as opposed to being booked as income.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Why the logic of keeping it as a – not treating it as a special item?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, I mean, because it's really offsetting our ongoing asbestos costs each quarter. I mean, every quarter we have millions of dollars' worth of costs that are embedded within our cost structure, and this is simply a recovery related to those costs that we have.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I have a question for you on the revenue revisions. There is – on slide 4, there is a sensitivity that you provided for us to understand how the changes in the North American Class 8 production outlook would impact your revenue and your EBITDA margin. Looking at that at midpoint, provisions from prior outlook appear to be somewhere around a $70 million impact to the prior midpoint of revenue assumptions, but your revisions were about $50 million from prior midpoint. So, wondering what's driving the offset to that North American production decline outlook? And then your EBITDA margin was maintained at 10%. Are you finding incremental opportunities to – for cost savings, or is that something else?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hi, Irina, It's Kevin. I'll take that. You have to keep in mind, when we're talking about the guidance that we provided before, we're talking in ranges and approximations. And our prior revenue guidance was a $100 million range between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion. So, we were operating somewhere along that range. And as we looked at the changes that we expected to occur based on the North American truck market coming down, we felt that with that, plus any other of the small puts and takes we see, the appropriate guidance would be around $3.4 billion; again, an approximation. We could be a little bit above that level. We could be a little bit below that level. But we think the balanced look at this at this point is $3.4 billion. As you think about the margin, keep in mind this is at the bottom end of the prior guidance. In the prior guidance, we thought we would still be on track to achieve 10% with some of the programs we had out there, even if we trended down to $3.4 billion. And we continue to believe that's the case based on what we're looking at.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. And just as a follow-up to that, what are – what FX assumptions is your guidance currently reflecting?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It's pretty much comparable to what we provided last time. I mean, it's about $1.10 to the euro, and I think about BRL3.90 or so to U.S. dollar.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: And the final question comes from the line of Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Yeah. Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Yeah, just a couple. I wanted to follow up – I think it was Colin Langan that was asking about the $5 million. So it is included in the EBITDA – adjusted EBITDA that you report, but it's fairly substantial, right? It feels like it would be like worth kind of 50 basis points, 60 basis points. So, is that – I mean, in that quarter, was there a kind of big disbursement that sort of offset it and the net was a wash, or is there some lumpiness to this thing?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, I mean, you're right. The $5 million was discrete to the quarter, a one-time item. But we have lots of pluses and minuses that hit our results, just like we had the Aftermarket & Trailer discrete item in the quarter going a little bit the other way. I think, as you've seen over time, we've been trying not to adjust out any items plus or minus as a company, and really manage through those and drive to bottom-line performance in terms of margin and bottom-line earnings. And that's what we're doing right now. So we manage all those puts and takes, and we drove to this level of margin.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And I'm sorry to get into this, I know you said it, but the warehouse piece was just how much on a net basis?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, again, we had negative year-over-year labor and burden in that – in the aftermarket North American business of $2 million, and it was primarily related to this particular issue.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, okay. And just – I mean, look, you've gone over a number of these factors but – right, if I think of the net of those two things, I mean, you were up 40 basis points – including them, excluding them, you were probably up a little bit less to get to up 50 basis points, which is implied in your guidance. It would require a back-half step-up in performance. If I just kind of try and summarize the things you've talked about, I mean you did talk about a seasonality issue, although, that year-on-year shouldn't matter too much. But you have – I guess the aftermarket growth that you referred to, you have the net new business launches. Is there any sort of other items that I'm not including here as we think of the drivers of that improvement?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It's continued in performance and executing on continued performance initiatives throughout the year. I mean, remember, our Q1 is normally our softest quarter and look back to last year even, we were 9.0% Q1, but we ended the full year at 9.5%. That's a type of performance we're expecting this year. Again, coming out of the gate, with a weaker first quarter, because it's our low revenue watermark, 9.4%, but expecting the same type of performance in the back half to drive the same type of improvement year in the full year that we saw relative to Q1 last year.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. No, I get that. I was just trying to keep it in terms of basis points of margin improvement, right, which seems to be back-end loaded as well?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That's correct. And a big piece driven by revenue and continued execution of the performance initiatives. That's really the story of what drives the back half for the last nine months.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, okay. The other question I had just is on the – and thank you for the detail on the production assumptions for Class 8. I mean, I just – this is more just an industry question. It feels like – I think that's down 15% your calendar year, let's call it, calendar year Q1. You know that is less than – done less than orders and so I just wanted to see – I mean that, to us, would be kind of a positive number, just better than what we had modeled, quite frankly. So, is – how much of that is based on kind of a real tangible order book that's flowing through right now? And how much of that could be variable, if you will?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Patrick, I think, obviously, we've completed one fiscal quarter. So, we have three to go, and we're sitting almost the full month into the second quarter and our production outlook is pretty accurate for the remainder of this quarter. So you can think for six months of the year we have a pretty high degree of certainty and then we are continuing to evaluate the orders, but the backlog to build ratio remains fairly strong. We just had our Fleet Advisory Council and national meeting at most of major fleets. A week or so ago, those fleets are continuing to say business is strong and so the fundamentals still look very stable. So, although it is a pretty big step-down from last year, we think it's a fairly reasonable assumption based on what we're seeing.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Appreciate the color, guys. Thanks a lot.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thank you.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for everyone joining the call today. And if you have any further questions, just give Carl a call.

Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Let's turn to slide three. With the second full year of M2016 now complete, we are on track to achieve the financial targets for our three-year plan. When we launched M2016, we were a different company than we are today. Margin is up, debt is down, and we have established important new relationships with customers around the world like PACCAR in North America, Scania in Europe, Daimler in India, and DAF in South America, among others. We've also dramatically improved our execution. We've converted on up-cycles in Europe and North America through excellent management of our operating and product costs. In fact, several times during the month of September, we've produced the most axles per day in the history of the company with no degradation to safety, quality, delivery or cost. These changes in our business are enabling us to significantly offset the unfavorable effects of market challenges, particularly in Brazil and China, and in our Defense business, which historically have been strong earnings contributors to our bottom line. Looking at the 2015 financial highlights, we had a strong close. We beat our EBITDA margin guidance by 20 basis points and exceeded the top end of our EPS range. Year-over-year adjusted diluted EPS was up 52%, demonstrating a solid bottom line return to Meritor's shareholders. Also during the year, we earned new business that puts us on track to meet our revenue target for our M2016 program. And we've already exceeded our net debt reduction goal. Keep in mind, this was accomplished even after the repurchase of $55 million of common equity, representing a buyback of 4% percent of our total outstanding shares. In addition, we've refinanced more than $100 million of convertible debt that will also mitigate share dilution going forward. As you can see from the walk on slide four, our margin has increased 230 basis points since fiscal year 2013, putting us only 50 basis points away from achieving our M2016 EBITDA margin goal. This reflects our dedicated focus on material cost reductions and labor and burden performance combined with pricing, which more appropriately reflects our value proposition. I want to give credit to our global workforce for this result. They remain keenly focused on our objectives and day-to-day execution despite the volatile market factors that were in play and has paid off. Let me also take a moment to recognize more than 300 Meritor employees who have served or are currently serving in the United States Military. With today being Veterans Day, we want to tell them how much we appreciate their service. Now, as we look at fiscal 2016, we're confident we'll achieve a 10% EBITDA margin target. We believe our new business wins and ongoing management of operating costs will offset the full-year effect of unfavorable foreign exchange and the softening in the North American Class 8 truck market. Looking at slide five, we've taken steps to reduce net debt by approximately $500 million over the last several years. This was accomplished through proceeds from the Eaton settlement, the sale of our Brazilian joint venture, and free cash flow generation. As we look ahead, we expect to continue driving improvement in our credit profile as we strive toward our target of having BB credit metrics. This is part of our strategy to deliver long-term value to our shareholders that represents a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. On slide six, we highlight new business awarded in fiscal 2015. With PACCAR, we are now supplying rear axles in North America, Australia, and Brazil. We've achieved close to a 50% share of rears in North America, almost a full year before our initial expectations that we communicated to you back in January. You'll remember, we also have standard positioning for front steer axles. At full run rate, we expect revenue from fronts and rears to be approximately $190 million. New this quarter we have four additional wins to add to our revenue stream. In Defense, as announced in August, we'll supply wheel ends for approximately 17,000 JLTVs to be managed by Oshkosh over an eight-year timeframe. We're also supplying Navistar with all-wheel drive components including T-cases for approximately 2,300 medium tactical vehicles for the Afghanistan National Security Force. Deliveries begin in January of 2016 and conclude in 2019. Beginning in 2016, we'll supply rear drive tag and front steer axles and brakes to MCI in connection with the purchase of almost 8,800 commuter coaches by New Jersey's public transportation corporation. This is a six-year delivery schedule. And in Asia Pacific, we have a new axle and brake program with a major OE. While we don't plan to announce more details at this time, this customer award supports our new broad range of fully-dressed axle products in the region that offer customers greater efficiency, localization, and cost savings. This award is a good example of how technology developed in our engineering centers of excellence in North America, Europe, and India is being applied to meet the needs of other regions. Our well-developed infrastructure will be a key enabler of future business growth. We expect that the total value of these newly announced wins from the fourth quarter are going to approximate $45 million at a full annual run rate. Let's look at slide seven. The last time we updated our progress against our revenue target was this past February. At that time, we were $300 million towards our $500 million goal. Today, we are at $385 million towards that goal, taking into account the new business wins we've been awarded since that time. On the right side of the chart, you'll see that we expect $275 million to be in our P&L in 2016, exceeding the target we set for ourselves. And remember, these numbers are market-adjusted. This puts us close to 80% of the way towards achieving our $500 million revenue target. We are committed to engineering and manufacturing products that are the first choice of drivers, fleets, and vocational equipment operators, and troops around the world. Now, let's take a look at our market outlook on slide eight. We knew the peak volumes in North America would eventually decline, and we're now starting to see some signs of softening for 2016. Coming off a 328,000 unit market in 2015, we're projecting Class 8 production of 275,000 to 290,000 units in our fiscal year, which equates to approximately 265,000 to 270,000 units for the calendar year. Still a solid market, but down year-over-year. We believe medium-duty volumes will be slightly down, while trailers will remain flat. Economic indicators are showing positive signs in Western Europe for slight growth in 2016. We're continuing to see registrations increasing and freight fundamentals improve. We believe our markets in China will continue to be challenged in 2016. The off-highway sector is still weak, while bus and coach appears to be stable. India looks to be improving and we're increasing our outlook in that region by just over 9%. We're confident India offers growth opportunities for us as conditions there continue to improve. As for Brazil, we're not yet seeing signs of recovery from the current recession. We're expecting another 16% step-down year-over-year to approximately 75,000 units, driven by a variety of economic factors and ongoing low consumer confidence. In a minute, Kevin will talk about our guidance for 2016. The most important point is that even though we expect revenue to be slightly down this fiscal year, continued performance and increasing market share gains are offsetting the instability in the markets. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I'll review our fourth quarter and full-year financial results, and then I'll take you through our 2016 guidance. Overall, as Jay said, the key take-away from our results is that we continue to generate improved margins and increasing bottom line EPS and we expect that trend to continue as we march toward achievement of our M2016 objectives. Let's turn to slide 9, where you'll see our fourth quarter income statement from continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $853 million in the quarter, down nearly 9% from last year. The lower revenue was primarily driven by weaker currencies in Europe and Brazil relative to the U.S. dollar. Weaker end markets in Brazil and China also contributed to the revenue decline, although that weakness was largely offset by the strong Class 8 truck market in North America. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 12.7% in the current quarter, compared to 15% a year ago. You may recall that last year we had a $15 million one-time benefit related to changes we made to our retiree medical plans and an $8 million benefit relating to a favorable resolution of a warranty contingency. If we exclude the impact of these benefits on last year's margin, our current year gross margin actually expanded by 20 basis points. This improvement was driven by material, labor and burden performance, and pricing actions. SG&A was approximately 6.6% of sales in the most recent quarter, an improvement of $24 million from a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a $20 million charge associated with the year-end valuation of asbestos liabilities. Also, we had lower incentive compensation accruals in the current quarter. Next, you'll see charges we took for pension settlement losses and asset impairments. Consistent with our strategy to derisk the balance sheet, we executed agreements with insurance companies to purchase annuities that completely settled $107 million in book value of pension plan obligations. As a result of these transactions, we recognized a $59 million pre-tax loss in the quarter. The loss was substantially non-cash and relates primarily to the acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses already reflected in book equity. Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the U.S. Army awarded a new contract to Oshkosh Corporation for the production of the JLTV. While we are pleased to supply wheel-ends to Oshkosh for this program, our revenue will be significantly less than if they had been awarded to another OE that was going to utilize our ProTec independent suspension. Based on sales expectations for this and other currently awarded programs, we believe the fair value of our defense business is less than its carrying value. Therefore, we've recorded $17 million of asset impairments, of which $15 million related to goodwill. Moving down the income statement, you'll see that we booked a tax benefit in the quarter of $18 million. This includes $16 million of valuation allowance reversals relating to our deferred tax assets. As we have been indicating for several quarters, we are generating profits in various jurisdictions across the globe, where we have booked valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. We now have enough positive evidence, including sustained earnings in Germany, Italy, Mexico and Sweden, that enabled us to reverse valuation allowances in these countries. When you adjust for the large non-recurring items that I noted, you'll see that our adjusted income from continuing operations was $37 million, up $2 million from last year. That translates to $0.39 per diluted share, up $0.04 from 2014. Overall, this was another strong quarter for us. As we've demonstrated during this and every other quarter in fiscal year 2015, we are successfully executing M2016 initiatives, which is allowing us to drive consistently improving results over time. Slide 10 details fourth quarter sales and EBITDA for each of our segments. In our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, sales were $650 million, down 11% from the same period last year. Weaker currencies relative to the U.S. dollar drove most of this decline. Production in our North America truck business was stronger year-over-year. However, this was more than offset by lower production levels in Brazil and China. Segment EBITDA was $45 million, a decrease of $8 million compared to the prior year. Segment EBITDA margin was 6.9% in the quarter, down slightly from last year. These decreases were primarily driven by lower revenue. In our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, sales were $231 million, down 4% from last year. This decline was caused entirely by currency headwinds in our European aftermarket business. Segment EBITDA was $37 million, up 9% over last year and segment EBITDA margin was 16%, an increase of 180 basis points over fiscal year 2014. This improvement was driven by strong performance of our M2016 initiative. Let's move to slide 11, which compares our actual results for the full year 2015 to 2014. As you can see, we expanded EBITDA margins by 120 basis points even as revenue declined by 7%. Again, our focus on M2016 initiative is the driving force behind our improved financial performance. This was achieved on revenue levels that were down more than $250 million due almost entirely to weaker foreign currencies. Despite this, we increased our adjusted EBITDA by $20 million over last year. As you can see, our diligence around managing cost resulted in SG&A expense decreasing $35 million this year, excluding last year's one-time legal fee recovery from Eaton. Specifically, this is the combination of lower legacy cost, lower incentive compensation accruals, and overall discipline around cost management. You can also see the performance we're generating above and beyond SG&A. While volume was down modestly year-over-year, our efforts directed at pricing, material cost reductions and labor and burden performance contributed more than $26 million to our margin improvement in 2015. We expect these self-help initiative, which represent the foundation of M2016, to continue in the upcoming year. It's also worth noting that the improvement in EBITDA is falling straight to our bottom line as you can see in our reported EPS. While we expanded our EBITDA margin by 14% over last year, diluted adjusted earnings per share expanded by 52% year-over-year to $1.55 in 2015. This was driven by improvement in margins, as well as lower interest expense and lower tax expense. And finally, we had another strong year in free cash flow. The earnings improvement we're generating is comprised of real cash earnings. In 2015, we generated $18 million of free cash flow. This includes $94 million in voluntary contributions we made to fund annuity purchases that fully settled our German and Canadian pension obligations. Excluding this, we generated $112 million in free cash flow. Now let's move to slide 12, which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchase program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $25 million of common equity, totaling 1.9 million shares. Although not shown on the slide, after the quarter ended, we repurchased an additional 1.8 million common shares in October, pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan. That means, to-date, we've repurchased 6 million common shares under the program. In total, including the common equity repurchases in October, we've now executed nearly $94 million of equity and equity-linked buybacks under our $210 million program, of which approximately 80% has been in the form of common equity. We remain on track to complete the entire program by September 2016. Next, I'll review our fiscal year 2016 outlook on slide 13. Based on the demand assumptions Jay highlighted on slide 8, we expect sales to be approximately $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, down slightly compared to 2015. As shown in our sales walk, we expect our new business wins to just about offset revenue declines from the full-year effect of a stronger U.S. dollar and the softening of the Class 8 truck market. With that revenue outlook, we are confident we'll achieve our margin target of 10%. The 50-basis-point margin improvement will be driven by the continued consistency and execution that we've demonstrated throughout fiscal 2015. We also expect to improve adjusted earnings per share to a range of $1.60 to $1.70 in 2016, driven by higher earnings and lower shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. With regard to our reported adjusted diluted earnings per share, we currently are not reflecting the real cash impact from all of our net operating loss carryforwards. Due to the valuation allowance reversals in various European jurisdictions and Mexico, we expect to generate a $0.10 to $0.15 per share benefit in 2016 not reflected in our reported adjusted EPS. And with the potential for valuation allowance reversals in other countries in the future, the amount of the benefit not reflected in our EPS could increase quite significantly over time. We want to ensure that you have visibility into the real cash impact of these tax attributes. We'll provide more clarity into how we intend to do this at our Analyst Day in December. Finally, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $115 million. The takeaway here again is that our earnings generation is translating to real cash flow. Based on this outlook for FY 2016, we believe we are positioned to achieve all three of the M2016 financial targets that we introduced in 2013. And as we deliver on our financial commitments this year, it means that from an income statement, balance sheet and cash flow perspective, we'll have positioned this company to really capitalize on meaningful growth opportunities as we look beyond 2016. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 14. The main takeaways from today's call are that we delivered another year of improved financial performance. And as a result, we are confident we will achieve our transformational M2016 financial objectives. In doing so, we believe the company will be better positioned for revenue and earnings growth in the future. We remain committed to our current three-year plan even as we look forward to introducing you to the details of our next one. We now have momentum going into the last year of our M2016 plan, and everyone is excited for the next step in our future. As we look ahead, that plan will shift our emphasis to growth as we continue to focus on business strategies that deliver value to our shareholders. We look forward to taking you through this plan at our Analyst Day in New York on December 10. Now let's take your questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Two questions. We were surprised pleasantly by the strong margin in Aftermarket. It looks like your highest quarterly margin ever and close to 200 basis points above last year, which is also a strong close for you. Can you help us understand the drivers of that, the seasonality around that, if any? Were there any sort of one-time cost saves in it? And maybe just kind of, is Aftermarket – or on the other hand, is Aftermarket seeing some of the fruits of M2016 perhaps later than CB, where your margins have held up despite the volume headwinds?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hey, Brian. This is Kevin Nowlan. I'll take that question. But you're right, we had a really strong quarter for the Aftermarket & Trailer segment at 16%, and a portion of it was driven by some things that are unique to the fourth quarter. We normally have some year-end accrual adjustments and that might have contributed a couple million dollars for things like ICP. But the bulk of the performance or the results were driven by performance. Material, labor and burden performance and pricing actions is really what drove the 16%. And so, as I think about margins for that segment going forward, as we look ahead to 2016, I think you should expect it to be more in the 14% to 15% range as we look forward at these types of revenue levels. Now, having said that, you had asked a question about seasonality. Keep in mind, Q1 is typically the low point for the business given fewer selling days in the quarter. So we would expect it to be a little lower in the first quarter. But for a full year 2016 basis, we're expecting 14% to 15% margin, which is a little higher than what we've guided to in the past.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a follow up to that. Material, is that supply reengineering or is it just these are made of steel and steel prices have fallen? You don't necessarily have to pass that through like you do with OEMs and fleet customers.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It's less to do with the first piece that you mentioned, reengineering, and more to do with material performance initiative, which is improving our cost structure overall, as well as there is a little bit of a tailwind we get from steel index improvement on a year-over-year basis. But I'd say it's a healthy mix of both, as well as labor and burden performance initiatives and pricing actions. It's a combination of all those things.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Second question, back in commercial vehicle, two maybe kind of offsetting issues or kind of questions just around market position within North America and Class 8. On the one hand, one of your – so first subquestion is, one of your competitors ran into supplier issues with Class 8 and blamed that for their loss of market share. Did you benefit from that competitor's loss of market share in North America? And then, second question, one of your major customers, Daimler, is producing more axles in-house. How should we think about them using that capacity in light of the Class 8 build decline that you're forecasting? And are they going to try to keep that full perhaps by incenting some of their fleet customers to choose the in-house axle and how would that affect Meritor? So two issues, kind of gain of share on the competitive supplier issue and then kind of in-house competitor at Daimler.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Hey, Brian. This is Jay. Good morning. Yeah. On your first question, certainly, as I mentioned in my comments, we had an excellent year of execution. I think, most importantly, our customers would say we executed virtually flawlessly. So, we did see some opportunities to fill in some gaps in the market from various suppliers, but I think it still is a longer-term trend of us winning business. And so, I guess, to answer an unasked question, do we see a step back, because certain suppliers will be coming back online, not of any meaningful amount. We think these revenue gains have been – market share gains have been of a more permanent nature. And I really give credit to our team, especially from the supply chain and manufacturing side, for just doing an excellent job. On the second question on Daimler, this resurrection issue that was earlier in the year, we've seen our penetration stabilize, as we spoken to earlier, and we expect that environment to continue with stable penetrations going forward and have that understanding with our customer. We are still the majority supplier of Class 8 drive axles to Freightliner and other Daimler products, and we expect to continue that position for the long term.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the good results. A couple from me. I guess, maybe just more detail on the self-help. I think one of the things that pleasantly surprised us is how you've been able to maintain the margin guidance for M2016 of 10% under significantly more difficult volume scenarios than you had initially envisioned. And so, just as we think about bridging the final piece to that 10%, where is the lowest hanging fruit? I think you had outlined the plan which had some restructuring, labor and burden benefits as well as I think redesign and maybe even price downs for some of your own suppliers. How should we think about the stuff that's – the biggest levers that are left to pull?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. Good morning, Patrick, this is Jay. Good question. As we look at it, I would say it's just more the same. I mean, as we look at the pillars of the margin improvement, you can look at purchasing cost reductions, labor and burden cost performance improvements, pricing improvements. As we look at this last year at the M2016 program, I would say, those are the three main pillars again. And as you would expect, we have 12 to 24-month pipelines on the cost reduction efforts and the pricing initiatives that we review and make certain we have all the steps to ensure that we have execution on those. And that's why you're hearing us going out with confidence today. We'll achieve those targets even in what most people would call a very challenging market environment globally for our industry. We feel we're doing an excellent job of controlling the initiatives that we can.
Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. So, okay, that's important. So, it does seem like there's quite a bit of visibility on some of these factors.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Internally, a lot of visibility. Again, I think, as you would expect, given the past performance we've shown over the last few years, we have very detailed pipeline reviews and reports and make sure the teams are aligned to achieve the objectives. And the other item I should mention is, I think we're starting to get the favorable benefit of the new wins in the market that are attributable to the significant new product launches we're bringing to the market, our excellent delivery, and quality performance. We're starting to see meaningful share gains that you see in our guidance are offsetting a fair bit, if not almost all of the headwinds year-over-year.
Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then, are those accretive from a margin perspective relative to old programs at a variable cost level? Or is that just kind of operating leverage?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I think – Patrick, it's Kevin. The way to think about it is we expect to contribute at our normal type of 15% to 20% contribution on any typical new dollar of revenue and those new business wins, I think on average, are no different.
Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And one last one for me. Forgive me if you guys have gone over this, but your planned measurement data is still in September, is that correct? And if so, can you just give us a visibility on pension expense since you guys are usually ahead of the curve on that?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: In terms of – you're right, where at September year-end, and that's when we do our valuation adjustments. I don't think we're prepared to give new pension income guidance for next year at this point. But I think from our funded status, you should expect that our pension under-funded position is going to be just over $100 million as opposed to what has been in prior years, it's been upwards of $0.5 billion, just given some of our de-risking strategy that we've executed. And then, we'll provide you a little bit more color on your specific question in December at the Analyst Day.
Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Can I just ask that you guys take down your discount rate?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I cannot comment on that at the moment, but you should expect that we follow the same methodology we always do, which is looking at AA corporates and what they did on a year-over-year basis. It's not a significant move, I would tell you, on a year-over-year basis in our discount rates.
Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Well, I'll let you guys give us the specifics a little later. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please go ahead.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give any color on the Commercial Truck margins? They're down a bit, looked like almost like a 24% decremental in the quarter. And your comments about Aftermarket, does that – any color on how we should think about the Commercial margins into next year?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I mean, the real driver of the Commercial Truck margins has been revenue. And so, if you think about that on a decremental basis, I think on a year-over-year basis, it's actually more like 10%. And again, our typical contribution is more in the 15% to 20% range. And so, as we've seen revenue come down for the reasons we talked about, FX being the primary driver, we've been able to mitigate some of that impact through our performance initiatives. So, it's just been a bigger revenue decline in the Truck segment, which has had a bigger impact on the margin, but performance is still mitigating that.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: And I mean, in terms of, you've indicated Aftermarket will be up – I got them and I have a hard time to do the math. Does that imply that there should – do we still need to see Commercial Truck margins to be up or can it be flat next year and you can hit your overall 10% target?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think I would just say that, overall, we're driving toward 10% from a full company basis and I know there's a lot of focus on the Aftermarket & Trailer in the performance that it delivered. And I would tell you that if you look at the full year performance of that business at 14%, we're expecting to see even a little bit of improvement into 2016 on that. But you should expect for the whole company to be up 50 basis points, we need some contribution coming from really both segments.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: And can you give color on the tax guidance? It's holding at 15%, but you did have some reversals of the valuation allowance, thus, you expect more to come? Wouldn't that imply that your effective GAAP tax rate would start going up?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It would and that effective tax rate actually already contemplates the fact that there are some non-cash tax expenses in that number. So, if I look ahead to 2016, and we expect those jurisdictions where we just reversed the valuation allowances to generate income tax expense in the upcoming year north of $10 million, that's part of our effective tax rate guidance of 15%. If you were to strip out the fact that that $10 million or so is actually non-cash, an equivalent tax rate on more of that cash basis would be more like 10%. So, we are seeing that headwind in the 15% guidance number that we're providing you. And the cash basis is actually something lower.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. But I mean, if you have further allowances next year which are – could that – there's risk to the rate going up next year if you have further ones again. Is that right?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Absolutely. So, if that happens, we would have a – let's say, for instance, we had a jurisdiction like the U.S. where we have a lot of deferred tax assets and large valuation allowances. If we reverse those valuation allowances, we would generate a substantial one-time book income tax benefit. And then we would start booking tax expense through the EPS line on a going-forward basis on future earnings. But we would continue to recognize the cash benefit associated with monetizing those deferred tax assets, we think into the early part of next decade. So, we think there's a real substantial benefit for us to continue to realize whether those valuation allowances are reversed or not.
Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you very much for taking my question.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. Thanks, Colin.
Operator: Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. This is Irina on for Brett Hoselton. I had a couple of questions. Today's 2016 EBITDA margin guidance, 10%, how does that relate to your longer-term anticipated margin targets which you were going to introduce in December? Should we view this kind of as a directional sign of what we can expect going forward, or is this just 2016 guidance, the same as before, 10%, and you are not ready to provide longer-term targets yet?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Irina. This is Jay. Good question. Again, we're extremely proud and confident that we will achieve that 10% margin guidance. As I've said earlier, we feel confident we have the programs in place to achieve that. As far as for the outlook beyond that, that's what we'll be addressing in a month from now in December, so about four weeks from now, and be talking through that in some detail. I think, as we've said earlier, we think there's still opportunities but we're not ready to, specifically, to mention how much those are, but we think there's still opportunities to increase margin in the years to come.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. That's helpful. And then your North American Class 8 outlook appears a little conservative relative to the latest update from the industry. How do you view your initial guidance? Would you say you're on the conservative side, right in line with what you're seeing or hard to imagine, but perhaps maybe you've been optimistic?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: I think we feel we're shooting it pretty straight at some broader range than we typically give just because of the recent volatility in the market. So we've given a little broader range. Obviously, the most important thing is it supports our revenue guidance. So we feel that range is appropriate for what we've guided for the total revenue for 2016. As we look at that and look at the market factors, there are obviously, a lot of positive market factors. The fleets are still extremely profitable. The utilization rates are very high. Some of the negatives are the fleet age is coming down to more historic norms, and the used truck prices have also declined. I think the main thing we look at, like everybody is, the order data. And if we continue, if there's a trend that continues that occurred in October, where the orders for October were below the five-year average, it would put us towards the lower end of that range or put pressure on that. And if the orders over the next few months come in at or above that five-year average, it would put us towards the upper end of the range or above it. So that's what we're watching closely over the next few months. But I think we feel we're shooting it pretty straight, as we said today.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much for that detail. Very helpful. One last follow-on question on that. In terms of your capacity utilization, I know prior to the restructuring efforts a few years back, we discussed that at 275,000 units for the industry, 270,000 units, you would still be able to utilize your capacity quite effectively. Now that you are looking for a calendar year outlook that is a little bit below that 260,000 units, 270,000 units, how do you feel, with, of course, the latest actions taken internally, how do you feel in terms of your capacity utilization at these lower production rates?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: I think we feel good about it. I think if you look at one of the charts Kevin covered on slide 13, you can see we have new business wins of almost $175 million coming in that we feel go a long way towards offsetting the expected market decline here in North America. So we think that utilization could still run quite high through 2016 as we bring on that new business.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Congratulations on an excellent quarter. Very well-executed year, guys. Congratulations.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Irina.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. And congrats on a great quarter.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Just to clarify, the EPS guidance does not include any equity repurchases, correct?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It includes those that we've executed today. So it includes the $20 million that we executed in the month of October, but nothing looking forward beyond that.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. So that would be all upside of the current $1.60 to $1.70 guidance?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That's correct.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then the medium-duty outlook for North America of a 6% to 10% decline seems to be a little bit more bearish than other component suppliers or industry forecasters are projecting for next year. Are you guys seeing weakness currently, or are you just taking a more conservative view just based on what's transpiring in the cost market?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: I think we're maybe more at the conservative side of the spectrum, but remember also that has a much smaller impact on us. Our exposure to the medium-duty is primarily through Navistar where freight – because freightliner tends to be virtually 100% insourced on that product. So we tend to be less sensitive to that market movement, far less sensitive than Class 8.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: Thank you very much, indeed. Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli. Please go ahead.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just a few questions. Maybe to follow-up to Pat's question on margins for 2016; slide 13, the sales walk is helpful for fiscal 2016. Could we maybe run through an EBITDA walk as well in terms of the margin impact from some of the revenue drivers for 2016?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I mean, clearly you can see what our expectations are as it relates to revenue with revenue slightly down and you would expect that and we would expect that, overall, revenue is not going to be a positive contributor for EBITDA performance in the year, which just tells you that where we're expecting to see the EBITDA improve on a year-over-year basis and where margins improve is really coming from our performance initiatives: material performance, labor and burden performance, continued discipline around cost management including our legacy costs, all of those things are the types of things that we expect to continue to drive. And remember, the last two years, we've driven 230 basis points of improvement with revenue down. And so what we're suggesting this year is, hey, we are expecting to see another challenging market just like we've seen in the last couple of years. But once again, we're expecting to drive the same types of performance to improve our margins 50 basis points in the year.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. That's helpful. And then as we think about the new business that you've been winning – and maybe it's a little bit early to talk about fiscal 2017. But any way of how to think about the incremental new business contribution from what you've won to-date, roughly speaking, for 2017? Trying to think about your kind of growth profile outside of the markets.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: What I would say is, I mean, where we stand right now, obviously, we've indicated that we're going to have achieved $275 million of the $385 million of new business wins in the 2016 P&L, which just tells you that the other $110 million or so is coming after 2016. Not prepared to provide any more specific detail than that as we look to what years those hit, 2017, 2018, et cetera. But we would expect to provide more color on that at Analyst Day in December in terms of what our revenue outlook is as we look beyond 2016.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. That's helpful. And then just a quick last point of clarification. I think earlier on the pension, you mentioned about $100 million in liability. Is that global and do you maybe have the rough split between the U.S. pension and the global pension plans?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That's global. That's global. And it's predominantly – the underfunded position is predominantly in the U.S. We're actually overfunded a little bit in the United Kingdom on a U.S. GAAP basis. But on a blended basis, we're a little bit over $100 million underfunded globally. And you'll see those specific numbers when we file our 10-K which is slated to go out I think about a week from today.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. That's all I have.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much for your questions, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes your Q&A time for now. I'd now like to turn the call to Mr. Jay Craig for the closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for joining the call today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact Carl. We look forward to seeing you in December and especially looking forward to rolling out our next strategic plan. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for joining in today's conference, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2015 Meritor Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tia and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction]. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host for today Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed.
Carl Anderson: Thank you, Tia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's third quarter 2015 earnings call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we are recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our Web site. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks Carl, and good morning everyone. I told you in April that I was confident in our ability to beat our commitments and drive enhanced value for our shareholders. Our results this quarter demonstrate the progress we are making toward our M2016 objective and provide us with increased confidence for the future. Our financial performance also demonstrates the efforts we have put in to managing labor, burden and material performance to drive expanded margins. At the same time we are growing through new contracts with important customers like PACCAR that we will talk about today. Looking at Slide 3, you will see that the quarter reflects continued strong execution, while revenues were down $70 million year-over-year primarily due to unfavorable currency headwinds. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up 120 basis points year-over-year at 9.6% for the quarter which puts our year-to-date margin at 9.5%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter also improved $0.12 from fiscal 2014 which demonstrates that our improved to margins are translating to bottom line earnings for our shareholders. In July of last year we announced $210 million share repurchase program, which was the first time we have returned value directly to the shareholders since 2000 and date. In the second quarter of the fiscal year we repurchased $31 million of securities and this quarter we repurchased another $18 million. We remained on track to complete the entire repurchase program by the end of fiscal 2016. We also refinanced and repurchased a portion of convertible notes which will help reduced the dilution impact to the number of shares outstanding going forward. Although volume headwinds outside of North America have continued to present challenges our performance throughout the year has exceeded our expectations and were attend raising our outlook for earnings and cash flow. Let's turn to Slide 4, in January of this year we announced a long-term agreement with PACCAR for rear axles in North America and in Australia. At full run rate we told you we expected revenues to be approximately $150 million as we ramp up to more than 50% penetration for rare drive axles on PACCAR brands. Today we're pleased to tell you that we've added standard positioning for front steer axles to that agreement reflecting execution on another opportunity for growth in our core business. This change formally took place in data books on July 1st, for Kenworth and Peterbuilt trucks, although we started to see the penetration ramp up earlier in the year. We expect revenue from this piece of the business to be approximately $40 million at full run rate. Wins like this are an important part of our M2016 plan to organically grow the business by expanding product plans with our global customers. Now let's turn to Slide 5, in terms of volumes in North America we're slightly increasing our outlook for Class 8 volumes to approximately 325,000 units. Class 8 net orders have resulted in a strong backlog-to-build ratio of just over five months which we believe will carry current production levels into fiscal 2016. Related to the trailer business our forecast remains unchanged for the year. This month we purchased the majority of the assets of the Cyprus facility in North Carolina that produces us trailer axle beams and machines carriers and differentials for us. The work done at this facility is important to our trailer operation. This transaction allows us to further stabilize our supply chain and become more vertically integrated as we explore our opportunities to grow this business. Europe remains flat from our previous forecast at a midpoint of 390,000 units but is continuing to show signs of a potential economic recovery where reflected in slightly higher order intake at our major customers. In China we're reducing our volume outlook to reflect a 35% volume to increase year-over-year. This market continues to be volatile as the mining and construction markets remain extremely weak. South America continues to face a number of challenges as well; we produce our production outlook in this region to a range of 85,000 to 90,000 units for the fiscal year. India on the other hand is showing signs of recovery, growth prospects in the region are improving as the government drives structural, fiscal and bureaucratic reforms. While the Light Commercial segment remains weak there is an increased demand for a higher tonnage vehicles. We've therefore raised our forecast for this region by 10,000 units. And finally in our defense business you know we are partnered with Lockheed Martin of the JLTV program. We expect to file award announcement later this quarter. At this point I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Nowlan: Thank you and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 6. On today's call, I'll review our third quarter financial results and then I'll take you through our revised 2015 guidance. Overall, the key takeaway you'll see from our results is that we continued to drive financial performance. Our M2016 strategies are generating improved with margins and bottom-line EPS. As a result, in the third quarter we generated adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.6% and $41 million of adjusted income from continuing operations. So, let's walk through the details on slide, where you'll see our third quarter income statement compared to the prior year. Sales were $909 million in the quarter, down $70 million or 7% year-over-year. The lower revenue was driven entirely by currency headwinds in Europe and Brazil. Without the stronger U.S dollar revenue would have been higher this year versus last year. As robust production in North America truck and other revenue increases more than offset lower production in South America and China. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 13.6%, reflecting a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. This improvement was driven by continued material labor and burden performance and pricing actions consistent with our M2016 strategy. SG&A was $12 million higher in the third quarter compared to the prior year. The increase was due to a $20 million recovery of legal fees associated with Eaton antitrust settlement in prior-year, which did not repeat this year. Excluding this SG&A costs were actually lower by $8 million, mostly due to lower spending and variable in front of competition accruals. Restructuring costs were $9 million this quarter and were related to severance costs associated with previously announced restructuring actions taken in our South America truck business. As well as cost associated with the closure of our Newark Ohio facility. Interest expense was $38 million in the third quarter compared to $22 million a year ago. The increase is due to $19 million loss on debt extinguishment that was recognize this quarter as a result of the repurchase of 85 million of our 7-7/8% convertible notes. I’ll provide more detail on the balance sheet actions we executed this quarter later in the presentation. Excluding this loss interest expense decreased by $3 million year-over-year due to the benefits we're now experiencing from the capital markets transactions we executed last year. Income tax expense was $6 million in the third quarter representing an effective tax rate of 27%. The rate was higher than what we had experienced the last couple quarters, primarily due to the impact of the $19 million loss on debt extinguishment for which no tax benefit was recognized. Excluding this loss our effective tax rate would be in approximately 15%. Reflecting the fact that we are generating positive operating earnings in jurisdictions like the U.S. and parts of Western Europe where we have valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. All of that totals to adjusted income from continuing operations of $41 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Slide 7 shows third quarter sales and segment EBITDA for commercial truck industrial. Sales were $705 million down $56 million or 7% from the same period last year. FX headwinds were more than $70 million year-over-year which means that stronger sales primarily in our North America truck business more than offset the lower production we experienced in South America and China. Segment EBITDA was $58 million an increase of $3 million compared to the prior year. Segment EBITDA margin was 8.2% in the quarter representing 100 basis point improvements. The combination of continued cost performance and pricing actions more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower revenue. Next on Slide 8, we summarize the aftermarket and trailer segment financial results. Sales were $233 million down $20 million from last year mostly due to currency headwinds in our European aftermarket business. Segment EBITDA was $31 million up $3 million over last year. Similar to our commercial truck and industrial segment the increase was driven by continued cost performance and pricing actions. The segment EBITDA margin of 13.3% is in line with what we told you the last couple quarters to expect from this business at these levels of revenue. Now let's move to Slide 9, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q2 to Q3. Walking from the $87 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in our second quarter the net impact of volume mix and pricing was $10 million for the quarter. Higher sales in North America and European truck more than offset the impact of lower sales in South America. We continue to execute on our M2016 objective of achieving material labor and burdens savings. The incremental $7 million benefit sequentially from the second quarter includes both $3 million for performance and $4 million benefit associated with lower cost due to steel index movements. The benefit from the index movements is partially offset in the pricing line of above as we passed through the impact of prior period changes to our customers this quarter. Next foreign exchange movements negatively affected EBITDA by $3 million in the third quarter. Moving down the schedule you recall that we generated a one-time $6 million benefit last quarter related to mark-to-market gains associated with several foreign exchange hedges. This benefit was discreet to the second quarter and is a margin headwind to us on a sequential basis. We also experienced an incremental $6 million headwind associated with variable incentive compensation accruals. The sequential change includes the impact of a booth some favorable accrual adjustments last quarter combine with an increase in accrual this quarter. The portion booked in the current quarter reflects the increased accrual related our updated earnings and cash flow outlook for 2015 which I’ll discuss in a few slides. Overall this was a strong margin quarter for us. We generated $87 million of adjusted EBITDA which resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.6%. We continue to execute on our M2016 cost reduction initiatives to drag margin performance while at the same time managing through the dynamics of our global end markets. Now let's turn to Slide 10, for the third quarter total free cash flow was $71 million which was flat compared to the prior year. Our year-to-date free cash flow is 77 million is slightly better than where we were in this time last year. This performance puts us on track to achieve our updated free cash flow guidance which I’ll discuss in a few slides. Let's turn to Slide 11, as I mentioned earlier we executed several capital markets transactions this quarter and among other things were reduced to dilution impact associated with our 7-7/8% percent convertible notes. First we issued $225 million of 6.25% notes that’s mature in 2024. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repurchase 85 million aggregate principle amounts of our 7-7/8% convertible notes. Since the end of the quarter we repurchased an additional $25 million of the notes pursuant to a rule 10B51 plan. To date then we've repurchased $110 million of the notes at an average price of 162% of par. The premium paid over par reflects the market price of these notes which include the embedded auction values of security. Since the convertible has the strike price of $12 per share it's in the money which drives the significant premium. By issuing a new debt to execute these repurchases, we lowered the interest rates while simultaneously reducing the ongoing dilution impact of these notes by 44%. We plan to use the remaining net proceeds in the fourth quarter to purchase annuity to settle our German pension plan obligations. The recent foreign currency and discount rate decreases making annuity purchase in Germany more attractive from a U.S. dollar perspective that would allow us to permanently de-risk this portion of our pension liability. We do expect to recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $40 million to $50 million in the fourth quarter associated with the settlement of these pension obligations. Now let's move to Slide 12 which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchased program. As of the end of the quarter, we had repurchased $49 million of equity and equity-linked securities reflecting 2.3 million common shares and $19 million of 4% convertible notes. Although not shown on the slide since the end of the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million additional common shares under a 10b5-1 plan. So today we've actually now purchased 3.8 million common shares under the program. In total including all activity to-date in July, we've now repurchased nearly $70 million of equity and equity linked securities under the program of which almost three quarters is in the form of common equity, and we remain on track to complete the program by September 2016. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2015 outlook Slide 13. Based on the demand assumptions, Jay highlighted on Slide 5, our fiscal year 2015 sales guidance remained unchanged at a range of $3.5 billion to $3.55 billion. We now expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 9.3% for 2015 compared to our previous range of 9.0% to 9.2%. We expect to drive this margin result largely through continued strong execution of M2016 initiatives. Implicit in this full year margin guidance is that we expect lower margins in Q4 than in the first nine months of the year. There are two drivers of this. First, we expect overall revenue to decline sequentially from Q3 due to the normal European summer holiday which always drives a revenue headwind in the fourth quarter. In addition, we received updated yearend liability valuations in September any adjustment required as a result of these valuations would be recorded in the fourth quarter and could impact margin performance. Nonetheless, we still believe the results point to an improved outlook for the year with our margin guidance now at approximately 9.3%. Driven by the improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance as well as from the impact of our equity and equity linked repurchase activity, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.40 to $1.50 for fiscal year 2015 which is an increase of $0.10 compared to our prior guidance. Our effective income tax guidance remains unchanged at approximately 15% for fiscal year 2015. As I have mentioned in prior quarters, we are generating positive earnings in the U.S. and certain European jurisdictions where we previously established valuations allowances against our deferred tax assets. We will continue to evaluate the positive and negative factors to determine whether there is a sufficient evidence to reverse these valuation allowances in future quarters. Finally as Jay mentioned earlier, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to approximately $110 million for 2015 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $100 million which means we're expecting back to back years of cash flow above the $100 million level. This guidance excludes the expected cash payment of approximately $90 million related to the German pension plan settlement. In the end, we're pleased that our continued strong performance is allowing us to again raise earnings and cash flow guidance. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide some closing remarks.
Jay Craig: Thanks Kevin. Let's turn to Slide 14. In developing M2016, we identified key issues established and communicated measurable objective aligned the organization and are successfully executing against our plan. As you know our performance metrics include margin improvement, net debt reduction and revenue growth. We are on track to achieve all three and are committed to bring in home the plan next year, but for also hard to work on our strategy for beyond 2016. Our next three year plan will put more emphasis on executing opportunities for growth in our core and adjacent markets while remaining focused on expanding our margins and driving a balanced approach to capital allocation. We look forward to providing you a detailed review of that plan in our December Analyst Day Meeting. And now, we'll open it up to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital.
Brian Johnson: Can you just give us a broad sense of your China exposure? I think it's mostly off-highway, but just want to understand and also what you're seeing in that market vis-à-vis order rates, backlog et cetera.
Jay Craig: Brian this is Jay. That's good question. Our business today is primarily of highway construction mining with some premium bus and coach axles. I think what we're seeing as stability in the bus and coach axle business with extreme weakness in the other segments of the markets implied in our Q4 guidance is than expected further step down in Q4 compared to Q3 in that of highway and construction business and something we typically see this time of the year seasonally but we don’t expect that will see any recoveries soon in those end markets.
Brian Johnson: So that's not -- but would you say it's bouncing along the bottom or further downside?
Jay Craig: I would say it continues to step down bit-by-bit but quite frankly it's getting to be at such low volume levels, the impact to our guidance and the overall financial impact to Meritor it's becoming relatively insignificant.
Brian Johnson: Second question, on the military side. While we wait for hopefully new awards, can you give us an update on FMTV and your expectations in the fiscal 2016?
Jay Craig: Right now we are working with the prime contractor ash Oshkosh on this program trying to determine what production levels to expect in 2016. I think at this point we would say we don’t see values changing too much in that period compared to 2015.
Brian Johnson: And final question, how do you think about consolidation in the drive line industry? I guess a couple questions. One, do you see opportunities within the commercial and off-highway world? Do you see any potential tuck-ins? And three, what about the idea of kind of combining light vehicle axles and commercial vehicle axles in the same entity?
Jay Craig: I can address the second question first obviously we've worked hard for a long time to become a commercial vehicle focused business and I would tell you a big part of the PACCAR wins we've had PACCAR has complemented to us, in fact I think you saw the comment about Christianson made in our Analyst Day, I'm being focused on commercial vehicles. So we're very pleased with that focus or at more importantly our customers are pleased that all of our capital and research and development goes to that area and we don’t see a lot of synergies and overlap between the two as we've evaluated that over time. But as far as expansion within the commercial vehicle business as we had look to our next three year planning cycle that is something we're considering, we are looking at growth opportunities so I mentioned in my comments in the core which would be new geographies or new customers along with newer adjacencies for we think we can provide additional value to our customers and as we look at that growth we will consider certain what I would call bolt-on acquisitions that may help us expedite that growth.
Brian Johnson: And just final question, quickly, I know I ask it every time. Any update on Meritor WABCO's participation in truck active safety, and ADAS, and can we look forward to any given that's increasing, given their braking requirements coming in, whether it's through the resale of active safety equipment or just higher spec brakes, is there any contribution we can expect over the next three years from that and, if so, how to dimension it?
Jay Craig: We've seen very solid performance in Meritor WABCO participating obviously on the increasing value of the North America along with some increasing penetrations particularly collision avoidance systems and we're very pleased with the performance of that entity. I think it's a fairer expectation of ours it should be of our investors as we could see further penetration of those safety systems in the vehicles.
Brian Johnson: But any way the dimension the impact on your equity income or your financials?
Jay Craig: We're not forecasting that at this point. But certainly I think you can see some of the impact through our financial segments of the impact of non-consolidated joint ventures and the increasing income we're seeing from that.
Kevin Nowlan: And Brain it's Kevin if you look we have filed Meritor WABCO's financial statements for last year because they were a material sub here over the last couple of years so you can actually see what our earnings are coming from that entity.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Neil Frohnapple: Wanted to ask a little more on the front axle business win at PACCAR. Our channel actually picked up that your front axles were already installed on a meaningful percentage of PACCAR's production in the second quarter. So would you expect the ramp-up to greater than 50% share to be even faster than the rear axles, now that you have a standard positioning? Just really trying to get at when you would expect to hit the $40 million revenue run rate?
Kevin Nowlan: Neil this is Kevin. Yes you are exactly right. We did start to see the ramp up of this happen early on the year as PACCAR assets to ramp up and advance of the LTA being executed. So as we look ahead to the $40 million of revenue that we’re expecting at run rate, I would tell you we're expecting that already two-thirds of that is hitting in year 2015 and it really started already in our second fiscal quarter.
Neil Frohnapple: And then, Kevin, revenue from the front axle business win generate incremental EBITDA margins within your stated 15% to 20% conversion rate range you had previously provided?
Kevin Nowlan: We don’t give specific margin guidance on any particular program, but I think it's a fair assumption on any of our new business wins to think about it being in that general zip code. I think that's the fair way to think about it.
Neil Frohnapple: And then just one final one. Aftermarket and trailer segment EBITDA margins, very impressive in the quarter and up year-over-year again. That sounds like it was primarily driven due to continued execution of the M2016 initiatives. But you do have a tough comp in the fourth quarter versus last year. Do you guys think you can exceed last year's margin, given the momentum you built for the segment?
Kevin Nowlan: I don't think we're prepared to give specific margin guidance on each segment in the quarter, but I think if you look the last four quarters in a row now we've generated 12% to 14% EBITDA margins in that segment and that's not an accident. I think the 14% numbers that you saw on a couple of quarters had someone timers in there and as you think about the 13% or 13.3% we generated in the quarter which really didn't have any real type of one timers that's probably more of which you should expect of the run rate of this business at the current revenue level.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Patrick Archambault: Just following up on that last question firstly, what was -- sorry, you said there was some one-off items that impacted the fourth quarter last year in trailer. Can you just remind us of what those were?
Kevin Nowlan: Well I guess I was speaking to like the 14% we generated a quarter ago where we had some of those FX tailwinds the one-time foreign exchange hedges that generated some gains, so I think we've had a couple of guidance drove us with 14% numbers, but I think you should expect something in that 13% zip code is about the right margin for the business right now.
Patrick Archambault: And the liability true-up, I guess in September, can you tell us a little bit more about that? Is that something that you've kind of factored in a base amount, and you're being a little cautious because you don't know what the variance is, or how specifically are you -- because I'm not familiar with that particular issue?
Kevin Nowlan: I mean if you look at the last couple of quarters, we have seen some liability true-up happen to us at yearend particularly around some of our legacy liabilities. And unfortunately last year we saw a pretty meaningful step up in our legacy liability although we saw some big upsets to that as well. So as we think about our forecast for Q4, we are assuming a few million dollars of potential liability adjustments as part of our planning process, but it remains to be seeing what the actual valuations are going to come in at.
Patrick Archambault: And what are -- is that like interest rate or discount rate-driven, or what kind of factors affect that?
Kevin Nowlan: I mean for example last year when we had some of our asbestos exposure, it really related to the forecast of our tenured liability based on actual experience that we were incurring in the current year. So as we just looked ahead we're being cautious I think and assuming that there is some risk that we could have a few million dollar of true-up probably nothing material like we saw last year given where we sit today. But the potential exit that there could be a few million dollars and that's what we planned for thus for in our guidance.
Patrick Archambault: And last one from me, I guess all my questions are on accounting liability things, but just the German annuity that you are pouring some funding into, can you just remind us what are the tax implications and the earnings implications of funding that plan with that annuity?
Kevin Nowlan: So obviously we've issued that and we're using some cash on the balance sheet to basically fund that transaction. I think as you look at the impact of this on a going forward basis beside from the fact that we'll have bit of interest expense for the portion of that it uses debt we'll see an EBITDA improvement heading into next year probably in the $2.5 million to $3 million range. So that would be a partial offset to the interest expense that we're seeing. And then I think as we -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll have a non-cash charge that will take associated with some of the actuarial true-up that we have to flush through the P&L that will be a one-time non-cash charge that we will take. And then finally one thing that we'll be cognizant enough and we're not sure the impact yet as we take away that headwind of the German liability and the cost of that liability going forward, it has the potential to impact the way we look at our valuation allowances in Germany in terms of assessing the positive and negative evidence of whether or not we need to reverse the valuation allowances there and can start using those tax attributes that remains to be seen.
Patrick Archambault : But if there's not really a cash tax shield from funding that thing like there would be in the U.S., right?
Kevin Nowlan: Correct.
Patrick Archambault: And then so -- and then you have said, and you said it again today, well, multiple times, I think, that you're going to likely write up your deferred tax assets. So we should think of modeling something closer to the statutory rate next year onwards, is that kind of a safe modeling assumption, in the absence of more detail?
Kevin Nowlan: I don’t think we said that anything is likely. We're still assessing the positive and negative evidence. We've had obviously here a couple of quarters of positive earnings in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions in Western Europe, if those trends continue, if the potential exist that we could some of those assets being reversed or those valuation allowances being reversed, later this year or into some time in 2016 and I think we'll be prepared to give you that guidance at the end of the quarter when we get into the November earnings call.
Operator: The next question comes from line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed.
Colin Langan: Can you just remind us the percent of sales that you have today in China and how they're structured? I believe they're through joint ventures, just so I understand the earnings?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, in China I mean you look a year ago our China earnings were-- our revenue was about 150 million of revenues to down 35% this year was same. We're going to be in $100 million zip code. That’s predominantly conducted through a 60-40 joint venture where we own 60% and our JV partner own 40%. There's two JVs there, but the bigger of the two is with XCMG.
Colin Langan: And then regarding the PACCAR win, can you give a sense of how your capacity is today to handle that, because market's pretty strong in North America. What kind of capacity are you running at and are there going to be any challenges with all the new wins coming on line?
Jay Craig: I think, we feel confident meeting what we estimate as the demand currently in North America with current penetration we see including the incremental business with PACCAR. I would say we wouldn't commit to that type of business without having some surety that we could deliver on that without incurring additional expediting costs or other costs and just as importantly that we should expect PACCAR wanted to do some due diligence on that before committing to us. So I think all of us feel very comfortable where we are at and I think it's displayed in the actual quarter performance you are not seeing premium costs impact our ability for match the ramp up in volumes in North America.
Colin Langan: Can you remind us on the pensions, the impact, the mortality when we measure at yearend?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, this is Kevin when we first started looking at this a year ago and look at the Society of Actuaries tables, as they were published in the exposure draft. We model that through our liabilities and thought the impact would be about $124 million on our liability however as we-- as the final rules about how to apply the tables were published we realized we are able to apply some of our actual experience to modify the base line tables that were provided by the Society Actuaries. So in the end our experience defers from that, that was published by the Society of Actuaries. The end result for U.S., we think is going to be less than a $25 million impact on our liability at the end of the year versus the 124, so we thought about a year ago in this time. So less than 25 million we think at this point.
Colin Langan: And lastly, any update on your M2016, $500 million sales target? Where do you stand now with the recent win? 
Kevin Nowlan: We will update that in November but this win the $40 million PACCAR business win is incremental to what you have seeing before.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Kristine Kubacki with Avondale Partners. Please proceed.
Kristine Kubacki: I know you guys look at fiscal year a little bit different, but want to talk a little about the North American market, and obviously we're at very high levels. Where do you see that going, in terms of are we at peak? There's a lot of debate in the market. And would it be a bad thing to kind of come down from these really, really high levels? It sounds like you're not incurring any premium cost, kudos to you, but would it be a little bit more comfortable for you if the market cooled off just a little bit in North America next year? 
Jay Craig: Well, as I mentioned in my comments is a typically foresee this high volume level continuing through the calendar year, that we have discuss previously through this calendar year. Certainly we have to start to see orders pick up a bit for to continued this, these very strong levels through next fiscal year but will be providing our details outlook next quarter in conjunction with our guidance for fiscal '16. As far as whether it's a good thing, it cools off to that as you commented and I did-- we are able to perform very, very well at these volumes. I think we have because of the make-up of our hourly work force with a meaningful percentage being contract labors. We are able to flex sound quiet effectively, so I think this is pretty broad range where this market can be very profitable for us. So if it comes down a bit certainly we will miss those volumes. I wouldn't mislead you but I think we'd still have very profitable business in North America.
Kristine Kubacki: And then kind of the same question in Europe, but kind of the reverse of, as it -- it seems like it's a little bit more slower ramping there, but are there any things as we watch out in that market, as it seems like things continue to get better over there, are you anywhere near how you think about operationally ramping up there? Are there any challenges as that market continues to accelerate?
Jay Craig: I think we feel good about Brazil we did have a pre-buyer little of year ago now that we actually hit it very well on it and we lost it about one quarter but again its very few if any premium cost can be had its deal with that our response of that spike volumes. Right now I think what you are saying in that market is just for slowly building confidence and increased orders, so it looks like it could be a slow ramp up which obviously we could respond to very effectively. And also we're just very pleased with the profitability as far as European business overall.
Operator: That concludes today's Q&A session I'd now like to turn the call back over to Carl for any closing remarks.
Jay Craig: This is Jay Craig. I just want to thank everyone for joining the call and for your continued interest in Meritor and more importantly I want to thank to Meritor employees just for their efforts this quarter and delivering outstanding results for our investors. Our results in the third quarter are really testimony but our focus on execution and revenue growth is working, we're committed to delivering increased shareholder value by driving margin improvement and reducing debt and positioning our core businesses for profitable growth. I look forward to either seeing you before the next quarter or speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2015 Meritor, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alison and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, sir.
Carl D. Anderson - Treasurer, VP & Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Alison. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's second quarter 2015 earnings call. On the call today, we have Ike Evans, Jay Craig and Kevin Nowlan. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we are recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc. It's protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the expressed written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to slide two for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we'll refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Ike.
Ike J. Evans - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Carl, and good morning. I assume most of you have seen our two press releases this morning, so you know that we've continued to expand EBITDA margin in the quarter and we've also made an important management change that we'll talk about today as well. This is an exciting time for Meritor. We're meeting our commitments we made under the umbrella of M2016. We're executing our management succession plan and we're taking steps to strengthen and grow our core business with robust product development and launch cycle. Let's turn to slide three for a look at the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 10.1% on revenue; that's down $90 million year-over-year. This represents a 170 basis point improvement from the same quarter in fiscal 2014. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter also improved $0.17 year-over-year. The decrease in revenue that we saw this quarter was driven primarily by continued weak commercial truck production in Brazil, actually the lowest volumes we've seen there in a decade, and in China, as well as the depreciation of currency primarily in South America and Europe. In July of last year, we announced that we'd repurchase up to $210 million of our equity or equity-linked securities. During the second quarter, we began that program by repurchasing $31 million of securities. We've also said this is the first time since 2008 that we've been in a position to return value directly to Meritor shareholders. We're on track to complete the entire repurchase program by the end of fiscal year 2016. As you look at our full year guidance, we're raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin and earnings per share. The margin improvement we're anticipating for the year is performance driven. This along with our expectation of a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 is driving the expected improvement in earnings per share, of which Kevin will provide more detail. Let's turn to slide four. As I said, I'm very pleased to tell you that we've taken an important step in our management succession plan. Effective immediately, I will be transitioning to a new role as Executive Chairman and Jay Craig, currently President and Chief Operating Officer will become Meritor's next CEO and President. When I was appointed CEO, the board and I made succession planning a top priority. We wanted to ensure that we identified the right leader for Meritor's next phase of growth and development. I have worked with Jay since 2006 as a board member and we've worked closely together in a partnership relationship the last two years in implementing our M2016 strategy. This is the natural evolution of that partnership. Together with an outstanding management team, we've turned challenges into opportunities and today Meritor is stronger than it's ever been. In my new role, I'll work closely with Jay and the rest of the management team to achieve our M2016 goals and set the future direction of the company beyond 2016. And I'll remain actively engaged as we establish our path to drive continued increases in shareholder value. Jay is a talented executive and an excellent leader. As you recall, he has served in a number of key financial and operational roles at the company and was named President and Chief Operating Officer in 2014. Over the past couple of years, Jay has strengthened our customer relationships, driven a more robust product development cycle and focused on improving operational performance of our company. The board and I are confident that his unique combination of commercial and financial expertise makes him ideally suited to lead Meritor at this important time in our history. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Ike. First, let me say that I'm honored to be Meritor's next CEO. We've made significant progress toward achieving our three year plan during Ike's tenure. I am looking forward to continuing that collaboration with him in his new role as Executive Chairman. I appreciate the board's and Ike's vote of confidence and I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity to work closely with him as we take Meritor to the next level. This is a unique company because of the passion and commitment of our 9,000 employees. The depth of that commitment has become even clearer to me as I've led the operations over the past few years. I joined Meritor in 2006 and although it was a company in transition, I knew I had joined an organization with a solid foundation and the potential to drive value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. I was energized to be part of a team with more than a 100-year legacy of innovation and expertise in commercial drivetrain solutions. I'm even more energized today as we successfully execute our M2016 plan and enter a new chapter in our history. Let's now look at slide five. As we continue to deliver strong results, I'm confident that we will achieve the three overriding objectives of M2016. Our execution continues to be solid in a very strong North American truck cycle that has obviously tested the entire supply chain. The team has driven significant improvements in material, labor and burden performance, which are favorably impacting our bottom line financial results. As orders continue to be strong in North America with a backlog-to-build ratio of approximately six months, we continue to successfully convert on incremental sales through excellent management of our operating and product costs. We previously said we would achieve a 10% EBITDA margin, but only at certain levels of revenue. Given our strong execution to-date and robust pipeline of performance and revenue initiatives heading into next year, we now believe we will achieve that margin without any significant change in our end markets. During the last two years, we've also generated significant cash flows from operations, the settlement of the Eaton litigation and the sale of a non-core business that has allowed us to reduce our net debt by nearly $500 million. Overall, this performance has provided us with the balance sheet improvement necessary to grow with our customers, and we are. We're winning new business with global manufacturers like PACCAR that we just announced last quarter, among many others. As a result, we're more than 60% of the way toward achieving our $500 million target in new business wins and we remain confident that we'll achieve our full run rate. Each award solidifies our position as a leading supplier to every major truck OE in the world. Our mission is to provide these manufacturers with products that their customers need in each local market. Meritor products are designed and manufactured for maximum efficiency with the highest standards in durability and reliability. To complement our growing product portfolio, we also offer outstanding support in the field. Our team helps customers optimize their businesses from product specification to aftermarket service and support. It's all part of the Meritor value proposition that I believe in very strongly. After spending years with the company in finance followed by several more on the commercial side, I have a tremendous appreciation for our people and their talent, the incredible value of our products, our customers and the importance of the trucking industry overall. Before we move on, let me say that I'm confident we will continue to meet our commitments and by doing so drive enhanced value for our shareholders. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to lead such a great company that has so much potential. Now, let's move to slide six. As we said, we're driving higher levels of excellence throughout our operations and improving new net material performance. With an aligned focus on these activities around the globe, we are seeing outstanding results, some of which are highlighted here. In February, we told you that we've put some of our best executives and resources on labor, burden, and material performance, because these are areas we can control and we are leveraging them to drive expanded EBITDA margins. But, it doesn't end there. We're continuing to identify areas for improvement, not only in labor, burden, and material, but also in delivery, quality and safety. Collectively, the improvements we're making in these areas are enabling us to meet the challenges of higher production levels, first in Europe last year and now in North America, with near perfection. Let's go to slide seven. Looking into the future, we believe that there is significant revenue potential with an expanded product portfolio. This is a critical element of our plan as it relates to future growth. We have prioritized the 20 most important product launches for the company and are driving them to flawless execution. The result of this focus is that our current launch cycle is the most aggressive in our company's history, and most important, each of these products has a home. We've worked with our customers to design axles, brakes, drivelines and suspensions that will enhance the value of their vehicles in alignment with their forward product programs. Launching next month in India is our hub reduction axle targeted at severe service and off-highway applications for emerging markets. This axle is based on Meritor's current hub reduction design that's provided outstanding performance in harsh applications for more than a decade. This product will launch in India with our customers Daimler and Ashok Leyland. In August of this year, we'll offer the super-fast 2.28 ratio on the 14X platform that can be integrated with Meritor's RPL 35 driveline, which was successfully launched this year. This product combination will effectively handle higher torques from downspeeding, allowing the driver to maintain vehicle speed at lower engine RPMs and enhancing vehicle efficiency. And next year, we'll launch the 14X high efficiency tandem axle that will offer more than a 1% efficiency improvement over our current class leading 14X, which translates to roughly a 1% fuel savings for our customers. In our Defense business, Meritor has been a strategic partner in Lockheed Martin's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program since 2007. We've completed more than 400,000 miles of testing to-date on our ProTec suspension that increases vehicle speed and improves handling and ride control. As you know, the JLTV program is planned to be awarded by the government in the summer of this year. However, full run rate production would not be achieved until 2018. We highlight it here because of its significant long-term revenue potential. These are just a few examples of the innovative products we're launching that create the pipeline which will support our growth beyond 2016. Now let's turn to slide eight for our current fiscal year 2015 market outlook. In North America, we continue to believe, as we told you last quarter, that the strong backlogs and low cancellation rates will carry current production levels through the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We're holding our current outlook for Class 8 volumes in this region to a range of 305,000 units to 315,000 units. Our forecast for medium duty production is unchanged as well. Europe remains flat from our previous forecast at a midpoint of 390,000 units. In South America, we've lowered our production outlook to a midpoint of 95,000 units for the fiscal year. Consumer and business confidence continue to fall, driven in part by the political situation in Brazil. Long-term forecasts indicate a slow economic recovery, with GDP decreasing and interest rates increasing in the near-term. Specific to the commercial truck market, revisions to the FINAME program, used to finance more than 70% of truck and bus purchases in the country, has made it significantly more expensive to purchase a commercial vehicle. Even without the negative impact of currency that we're seeing, the Brazilian production headwinds alone are driving our 2015 revenue expectations lower by nearly $100 million from our prior guidance. Finally, we expect China to be down an additional 20% from our prior outlook due to continued economic headwinds. The deterioration in these international markets combined with the unfavorable currency impact from the depreciating real and the euro are driving our revenue expectations lower for the year. Kevin will provide the full update on our 2015 guidance later. As I said earlier in the call, however, we're confident in our ability to achieve our margin target of 10% in fiscal 2016. We are anticipating significantly less help from the global markets than originally planned when we launched M2016, but we have outperformed expectations in the areas we've highlighted. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you and good morning. Let's turn to slide nine. On today's call, I'll review our second quarter financial results and then I'll take you through our revised 2015 guidance. Overall, the key takeaway you'll see from our results is that we continued to improve our financial performance while facing challenging global markets including currency headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our M2016 strategies are continuing to generate margin performance and bottom-line EPS that is overcoming all of these headwinds. As a result, in the second quarter we generated adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.1% and $42 million of adjusted income from continuing operations. So, let's walk through the details on slide nine, where you'll see our second quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $864 million in the quarter, down $90 million or 9% year-over-year. Sales were negatively impacted by $55 million, largely because of the weaker Brazilian real and euro. Lower production in South America and China, as well as lower revenue from our Defense business, also contributed to the decrease. This was partially offset by the continued strength of the Class 8 truck market in North America. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 13.3%, reflecting a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. This improvement was driven by continued material labor and burden performance and pricing actions consistent with our M2016 strategy, as well as some non-recurring gains on foreign exchange hedges. I'll provide more detail on this later. SG&A was $9 million lower in the second quarter. The decrease was due to lower variable incentive compensation accruals and lower pension expense. Restructuring costs were $3 million this quarter and were primarily related to severance costs associated with restructuring actions taken in our European truck business. Interest expense was $21 million in the second quarter, compared to $48 million a year ago. The decrease was mostly due to the loss on debt extinguishment that was recognized in the prior year relating to the repurchase of our 10-5/8% notes due in 2018. Interest expense was also lower year-over-year due to the benefits we're now experiencing from the capital market transactions we executed last year. Income tax expense was $6 million in the second quarter, representing a decrease of $2 million compared to the prior year, despite the fact that pre-tax income was higher this year. Our effective tax rate was only 13% this quarter. We're beginning to generate earnings in jurisdictions such as the U.S. and parts of Western Europe where we previously established reserves against our deferred tax assets. All of that totals up to adjusted income from continuing operations of $42 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Slide 10 shows second quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck & Industrial. Sales were $681 million, down $82 million or 11% from the same period last year. We saw lower production in South America, China, and Defense, and experienced approximately $53 million of FX headwinds in this segment. These revenue headwinds were partially offset by higher sales in North America due to the strong Class 8 truck market. Segment EBITDA was $57 million, which was flat compared to the prior year. However, segment EBITDA margin was 8.4% in the quarter, representing a 90 basis point improvement. A combination of continued strong material and operational performance, pricing actions, and gains from foreign exchange hedges, more than offset the unfavorable revenue and mix impacts associated with lower commercial vehicle demand in South America and lower Defense revenue. Next on slide 11, we summarized the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. Sales were $212 million, down $13 million from last year, due to currency headwinds in our European aftermarket business. Segment EBITDA was $30 million, up $6 million over last year. Similar to our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, the increase was driven by continued strong execution of material and operational performance and pricing. Now let's move to slide 12, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q1 to Q2. Walking from the $79 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in our first quarter, the net impact of volume, mix and pricing was roughly flat for the quarter. The impact of higher sales in North America Truck in India was offset by lower sales in South America. We continued to execute on our M2016 objectives of achieving material, labor and burden savings. These initiatives along with slightly lower steel prices provided an incremental $5 million benefit sequentially from the first quarter. Next, we experienced a $28 million foreign exchange translation impact on sales. The translation and transaction impacts of foreign currencies negatively affected EBITDA by $4 million. However, as I previously mentioned, during the quarter, we recognized mark-to-market gains associated with several foreign exchange hedges that were put on to protect against certain transaction and translation risks. First, in April 2014, we bought option contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure on expected Indian rupee purchasing activity through the end of 2016. In the quarter, we've monetized these contracts and simultaneously entered into a new series of contracts that now extend through the end of fiscal year 2017. We also generated mark-to-market earnings on option contracts that we purchased last quarter to mitigate volatility in the translation of Brazilian earnings into U.S. dollars during 2015. Although these FX contracts are hedging actual exposures of the company, they do not receive hedge accounting treatment for U.S. GAAP purposes. As a result, the gains we've recognized this quarter represent the mark-to-market benefit associated with underlying economic exposure for both this quarter, some of which you see noted as a negative in the line item above, and future quarters. In the second quarter, these hedges generated a $6 million one-time benefit to our results. So, as you think about our go-forward earnings profile, you should assume that this benefit will not repeat in future quarters. Finally, we had an other net increase in EBITDA of $1 million. This includes a couple million dollars of additional one-time gains that we do not expect to repeat. Overall, this was a strong quarter for us, even considering the revenue headwinds. We generated $87 million of adjusted EBITDA, which resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.1%. And even if you exclude the favorable one-time items in the quarter, we still would have generated adjusted EBITDA margin north of 9%. Now, let's turn to slide 13. For the second quarter, total free cash flow was $27 million, representing an $18 million improvement over the same period last year. The increase was due to higher earnings and lower outflows associated with our off-balance-sheet factoring programs. Our year-to-date free cash flow was slightly positive, which is a little better than where we were this time last year. This performance puts us on track to achieve our $100 million free cash flow guidance for 2015. Now, let's move to slide 14, which provides an update on our equity and equity-linked repurchase program. During the second quarter, we commenced our $210 million buyback program. We repurchased 1.2 million of common shares during the course of the quarter, utilizing $16 million of cash. We also repurchased $15 million of our 4% convertible notes due 2027. In total, we essentially utilized the free cash flow we generated in the quarter to repurchase $31 million of equity and equity-linked securities, which puts us right on track to complete the program by September 2016. From an EPS perspective, we received only half a quarter's worth of benefit associated with the share repurchases. In future quarters, we will get the full benefit of the 1.2 million in common equity repurchases executed during Q2. This will help to offset any dilution impact associated with our 7-7/8% convertible notes due 2026, which were dilutive by about 3 million shares in the quarter. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2015 outlook on slide 15. Based on the demand assumptions Jay highlighted on slide eight and the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we have lowered our fiscal year 2015 sales guidance to a range of $3.5 billion to $3.55 billion. Lower production expectations in Brazil and China are negatively impacting revenue by $120 million. You can see our new currency assumptions reflected on the slide for the second half of 2015. The continued depreciation of foreign currencies is creating $40 million of additional revenue headwinds since we provided guidance in Q1. Despite the decreased revenue outlook, we're slightly increasing our margin outlook. We now expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 9.0% to 9.2% compared to our previous guidance of approximately 9%. We expect to drive this margin result largely through continued strong execution of our M2016 initiatives. Our effective income tax rate is now expected to be approximately 15% for 2015 compared to our previous guidance of approximately 20%. Lower earnings in tax-paying jurisdictions like Brazil and China are being offset by continued improvement in earnings in non-taxpaying jurisdictions like the U.S. and much of Western Europe. Driven primarily by this improvement in the effective income tax rate, we are also raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a range of $1.30 to $1.40 for fiscal year 2015, which is an increase of $0.10 compared to our prior guidance. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $100 million for 2015, which means we're expecting back-to-back years of cash flow at or above the $100 million level. The bottom line is that we're expecting production in South America and overall currency impacts to be worse than we previously thought, but despite that we're expecting bottom-line earnings to improve and cash flow to remain right on track. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay to provide some closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to slide 16. As Ike said in the beginning of the call, this is an exciting time for us. We are taking a disciplined approach to improving the performance of the company. M2016 is really about securing our base business by taking actions that drive excellence throughout our global operations, enhancing customer relationships and executing a robust product development cycle and improving material performance in a sustainable way. M2016, we sharpened our focus under the program and we defined the nine initiatives that we believed would create the transformation we needed at Meritor to improve our financial performance, and we made sure that every resource in the company was dedicated to it. It's now been approximately two years since we launched this program; our focus has not changed. With just over a year-and-a-half left, we are determined to deliver on our commitments. The actions we've taken since launching M2016 continue to drive solid bottom-line performance in spite of currency depreciation and volume declines. These are among the best EBITDA margin, net income and free cash flow results we have ever had. Ike and I, together with the entire management team, are fully committed to achieving the objectives of this plan. So, what does Meritor look like for shareholders in 2016 upon completion of the plan? We will have reduced the volatility associated with our industry through improved cash flow and lower debt levels. We will have a leaner fixed cost structure, improved operating footprint and a differentiated product base. We'll have built a culture of innovative thinking in all areas of the business and ultimately we will have provided a strong return on investment for our shareholders. With that, we'll take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi. Please go ahead.
Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Thank you so much. This is actually Justin Barell on behalf of Itay. Ike, Jay, congrats. The first question that I have I guess really is for Jay. With regards to the first 100 days for your plan, is there anything that we should expect any changes on or can you give us maybe a walkthrough of what you guys are expecting for the first 100-day plan for you?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thanks a lot for the question, Justin. The short answer is no. I mean, I think the execution and performance of the company has been nothing short of outstanding and we want to continue to execute the M2016 plan. As you can see from our revised guidance today that execution has been very strong, but we still have roughly 100 basis points of margin improvement that we expect to execute before the end of the plan. And it's certainly my job and with Ike's assistance to make sure that we just continue to stay focused on that.
Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Perfect. Thanks so much. And then, can you give us a sense of maybe an update on Defense quoting that you guys are involved with, just to kind of gauge the vertical and see how everything's progressing?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Well, like I mentioned in my comments, the primary program we're focused on is JLTV. We expect that award towards the latter part of the summer, and so we are waiting for that award. But in the comments I mentioned in the Analyst Day, the one thing I'd like to make clear is our belief in hitting our objectives of M2016 is not dependent upon the award to us of that program or any other single program.
Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Perfect. And then, I believe on the call, it was mentioned that the slightly lower steel commodity prices, you guys are having a modest tailwind. Can you give us a sense of how to think about that for the – through the end of fiscal 2015?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. This is Kevin Nowlan. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, the steel tailwind in the quarter for us sequentially was about $2 million. So, when you look at that $5 million sequential improvement in material, labor and burden, $2 million of it came from steel. With where indices are in steel right now, we'd expect a little bit of additional tailwind into Q3, but then we would expect to start giving that back through our passthrough mechanisms to customers in Q4 and into the beginning of 2016. So, it becomes a headwind at the back half of the year and into 2016, but it's a little bit of a tailwind this quarter.
Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Perfect. And then, so in terms of the normalized cadence throughout the year, should we expect something similar to what 2014 was for the back two quarters?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Cadence in what regard? I'm sorry, Justin.
Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just overall financial cadence. Essentially, the quarter-over- quarter improvements and everything like that.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I think it's right. I mean, I think if you cut through what our guidance is suggesting, you would expect that the back half of the year is going to be much closer to 9% and in part because generating 10.1% is based on a lot of proactive actions we took to hedge some of the exposures we have and to execute on our operating performance. But those hedges aren't going to repeat in the back half. So, when you eliminate those non-recurring items or those one-timers for the quarter, our run rate's probably right now closer to 9% than it is to 10%.
Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Right, okay. And then, just one final question that I want to ask on the South American outlook. Just trying to figure out exactly how much of the delta between your prior outlook versus the current outlook is driven by pessimism versus the financing terms? Is there a right way to think about that, like what's driving what and just exactly -- if you were to bucket the majority of the delta, would that fall more under just the general pessimism of the market or is that really just predicated on the financing programs?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: All right. I think the two are very interlinked. I mean, obviously, Brazil's economic reforms they're executing are pretty far-reaching. As I mentioned in my comments on the call, the impact to us directly through the commercial vehicle program is the FINAME program, but I think our revised outlook is really driven by just the overall macroeconomic conditions.
Justin Barell - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Perfect. Thank you, guys, so much and again, congrats, guys. Thank you.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning and congratulations, Jay, and hope, Ivor, you'll – Ike, you'll stay around for a while. Just a technical question, then a broader question. My technical question is the FX hedge impact, and this goes to your background, Jay, under I guess, what is it, FAS 133 that you have hedge gains realized before the offsetting underlying transactions. Can you give us a sense of just how that affected that? Are these covering up for – or not covering up -- are these sort of transactional exposures that are going to be either a headwind in later quarters or were actually in the quarter but you're calling those out separately?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: I appreciate your confidence in my memory skills, but obviously my CPA days are many years behind. But I think the company has done an excellent job of both hedging transaction risk, but on a limited basis, hedging some translation risk as well. But I'm going to turn your specific question over to Kevin.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hey, Brian, it's a fair question. I mean as you look at the $6 million of gains that we booked about $4 million of that $6 million relates to 2015 activity, the bulk of that being in the current quarter, and then some of that extending beyond the quarter, which means there is a couple million dollars of the hedge gains that we generated in the quarter that relate to future periods, which is really some of the rupee, euro purchasing activity that we've been hedging. So as we've been executing on our best-cost country sourcing initiative, we've been hedging out the curve two years and three years of purchasing activity to make sure that we can reap the benefits for the longer term on those programs. And so we continue to have hedges on the books to hedge against that activity going forward. So while we're not going to get that $2 million benefit anymore, we're going to continue to have a hedge position that protects against some of those currency moves.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I guess the broader question is you kept your Class 8 outlook unchanged. If you look at ACT, it's up to 335,000 now. Are you being – two questions, kind of are you being conservative, or do you see weakness in the back half of the year? I guess, two, if there is a run rate of 330,000, maybe it continues into next year, it goes up. Where are you vis-à-vis capacity? In particular, are you talking about a customer a couple quarters ago who was apparently building some in-house capacity to handle peaky kind of demand, kind of where does that stand if we have a market running in the 330,000s versus the 310,000s?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Well, I think just to answer the question in sections, we feel very good about our capacity, I mean we've run quarters of production roughly at 80,000 units for a quarter. And if you look at our forecast, it's really stating that the production levels will remain roughly at where they are today. I mean this last quarter was close to 80,000 units and we're seeing that the – our forecast for the Q3 and Q4 is that they stay within 75,000 units to 80,000 units. So I think we're confident in where our forecast is. And so far we have not had any capacity issues in meeting our customers' demand, and in fact, have been able to fill some shortfalls elsewhere in the supply chain.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And similarly in Europe, you remain conservative there, some of the customers, again, Daimler, are seeing some upside there. Is this kind of, more kind of you think it's more your fiscal 2016 or you just want to be conservative for now?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: That's exactly it, Brian, is it's really, I think our outlook is very similar to what you've heard recently from some of the European OEs. There is really two impacts of fiscal year to calendar year comparison. We have obviously the negative impact of the pre-buy that occurred late in 2012 – 2013, and then missing the fourth quarter here of 2015. So if you neutralize for those two impacts, we have a very similar outlook to what you've heard from the European OEs recently.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And back to North America, if North America fiscal 2016 runs sort of 335,000 or higher, are you comfortable a) with the capacity and b) that the customers aren't going to be taking stuff you'd like in-house?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Well, we are not really talking about any outlook yet for 2016, as you know, because of our – where our fiscal year falls, we end up being one of the first people to talk about that. But we're not ready yet at this point. In terms of our capacity, I think we feel very comfortable and very closely aligned with all our customers, including our growing relationship with PACCAR, that we can meet their needs based on what they're forecasting for production for the foreseeable future.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Good morning and congrats, Ike and Jay, on today's announcement as well. The 10% EBITDA margin in FY2016, you believe you can now achieve without any significant change in end markets. So just to clarify, would that be essentially based on FY2015 sales guidance range and then layering in incremental PACCAR business, or do you still need modest end market growth? I think before you kind of had called out like a $4.2 billion type number. Could you just provide some more granularity on that?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Well, I think the way we look at it is if the global mix remains roughly the same and if we include the wins that we have achieved and reported out previously, we believe we can hit the guidance. So, yes, it includes the PACCAR win. And so, that gives us the confidence that we can achieve that margin target.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: All right. Great. And then, regarding the expected market share recapture at DT&A for axles next year, have you seen any order activity yet for next year that would support that or is it still too early to tell at this point?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Actually, we feel confident in the statement that we made at the Analyst Day back in February that this was temporary, it's been rectified, and we're comfortable that it's meeting both ours and Daimler's expectations of where our penetrations would be. And more importantly, Daimler has been extremely pleased with our deliveries and that we've been part of their, helping them drive their sales success.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: All right. And then, maybe one last one for Kevin. The $6 million in hedge gains, do you have the breakdown by segment?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The bulk of it is Commercial Truck & Industrial, but there is a little bit more than $1 million in the Aftermarket & Trailer segment as well.
Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kristine Kubacki of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.
Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC: Good morning. I was just – we've been watching -- most of the global OEMs, they've kind of reversed their outlook and upgraded their outlook on India. I was just curious on why you didn't increase your forecast there.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We're certainly seeing growth in India as well. I think you're seeing people talk about a 10% market increase, and we're roughly seeing that as well, but the impact on our overall forecast is not significant. So, and a lot of that increase will start to come towards the end of the calendar year, given our fiscal year-end of September 30. But definitely the Indian market is strengthening. I think people can clearly say it's found bottom and it's recovering. And it's recovering well for our customer Ashok Leyland as well.
Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC: That's helpful. And then I guess, you talked a little bit about the restructuring activities have been kind of centered around Europe. I was wondering – I hope there is going to be an eventual upturn in markets of China and Brazil. I guess, how are you prepared for, have you taken any restructuring activities in those markets and then how are you prepared if the market moves quickly on you to the upside? How do you respond to that?
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: This is Kevin, I'll take that. I mean with Brazil, I think we got out ahead of it, to be honest. We took some restructuring actions, you'll recall, back in August 2014, so at the tail end of last fiscal year, when we saw this, the headwinds really starting to mount in Brazil. And you can imagine as we look forward, we'll continue to monitor that market and see if there are additional actions that we need to take in light of where the market currently is. So, we'll keep an eye on that and keep looking at that as we go forward. And then, as you can imagine, as we did in Europe, we look at other markets as well just to see if there are other areas where we should be focused to improve our cost structure. So, always something that we're looking at as we go through these difficult international markets.
Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC: But you could prepare for an upturn pretty quickly. There has no -- been major structural changes in those markets that you can prepare for a recovery that's -quickly?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: We feel confident we can respond to a recovery. We're in constant communication with our customers in all markets and informing them of our restructuring actions and what our ability is to provide them axles and brakes as the markets recover.
Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC: And then I just want to clarify one thing. You talk a lot about the Western European market. You don't have any exposure to Eastern Europe or Russia?
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Very limited other than through our primary customer, Volvo. They have some exposure in Eastern Europe.
Kevin Nowlan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, and on the Aftermarket side, I think we talked that in prior quarters. It's less than $20 million of revenue that goes into Russia, in the $10 million, $20 million range.
Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners LLC: That's helpful. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Hi, good morning. And yeah, congratulations, Jay, as well. Very much looking forward to working with you in your new role. And Ike, we've definitely appreciated the leadership and the transition that we've seen in this company under your direction as well. So, congratulations to you both. Just in terms of my questions, wanted to just follow up on the PACCAR item. I know that was something that was potentially impactful near-term. Have you been seeing the kind of take rate in PACCAR orders on the back of the change of standing in the quoting book? I guess that would be my first question. And then a second one would be just on Europe. I think there had been some discussion that within Europe, even though the outlook for the market is still relatively flat, some of the northern companies, kind of like Volvo and Scania have been doing a little bit better than some of the other guys, and just wanted to get your sense of if that's something you're seeing on the ground there as well.
Jeffrey A. Craig - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. Well starting with PACCAR, we're very pleased, I would say overall we're seeing our penetrations increase at the pace that both us and PACCAR expected them to, and we see our relationship broadening every day, particularly with their operating units of Kenworth and Peterbilt. So. just on track, is what I would say. And I believe that's a view held by both sides, that we are very much on track. In terms of Northern Europe, certainly has been the story since the economic downturn, is that has tended to be stronger. But again, our primary customers are Volvo/Renault, and they've had a bit of a mixed market experience because of their Renault exposure, and Iveco, which tends to be more Southern Europe exposed. But, I would say overall on our European business, we are very pleased with its performance. And back to an earlier question, we have taken the restructuring actions that, where we're very pleased with the profitability of that business and are prepared to operate it at these volume levels if necessary for longer and be pleased with the performance.
Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Terrific. That's all I had for you guys. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Carl Anderson for closing remarks.

Carl Anderson: Thank you, Tihisha. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor’s first quarter 2015 earnings call. On the call today, we have Ike Evans, Meritor’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today’s call are available at our website, meritor.com. We’ll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning.

If you have not received an invitation to that event and would like to participate, please contact me directly. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Ike.
Ike Evans: Thank you, Carl, and good morning, everyone. Let’s turn to Slide 3 for a look and highlights from the first quarter. We’re pleased to report continued earnings momentum as you can see in our first quarter results. Year-over-year, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 100 basis points to 9% despite lower revenue. Incremental pricing as well as continued benefits material, labor and burden performance favorably impacted earnings. As strong demand continues in the North American Class 8 truck market, our focus on converting the incremental sales at our targeted contribution rate to management of our operating and product cost is showing in our results. We are also very excited to announce a new long-term contract with PACCAR. I’ll give you more specifics about this new business win on the next slide. As we continue to deliver strong results, the confirms are confidence in achieving the three overriding objectives of our M2016 initiative. First, with the performance we are delivering in the first quarter of 2015, our margin is now within 100% basis points over 2016 objective of 10%. Second, we’ve generated significant cash flows over the last couple of years from operations, the litigation and the sale of the non-core business, that has allowed us to reduce our net debt by nearly $500 million in just two years. And finally, we continue to drive new business wins, including the execution of the PACCAR agreement that I just mentioned, but it goes far beyond the PACCAR win. Over the past several quarters, we’ve told you about several other new business wins and long-term contracts with major OEs, including Volvo, Daimler, MAN, Ashley Cleveland, [ph] Hino, and Scania and others. We are growing our relationships with major global truck manufacturers around the world. The book of business we are building is strong, and reinforces the competitive differentiators that make Meritor unique. Our Board of Directors continues to evolve and strengthen, most recently with the addition of Lloyd Trotter, who is elected to Meritor’s Board this month. Lloyd had a successful 36-year career at GE during which time he held roles as Vice Chairman, President and CEO of GE Industrial, and Vice President of GE Manufacturing Operations. He is also a Founding Member of GenNx360 Capital Partners, a private equity firm, based in New York, that focuses on improving business operations to drive shareholder value. Lloyd’s operational background and experience in private equity will be a tremendous asset to our Board, as we manage the company for greater shareholder return. Let’s go to Slide 4 for a more detail on our new seven-year agreement with PACCAR, a global market leader in design and manufacturer of premium trucks. If you remember that about a year ago, we announced new business with DAF in South America, at the time, we viewed this as an important step in broadening our relationship with PACCAR. And now we are announcing a new long-term agreement with PACCAR. Under this agreement, Meritor will now have preferred product positioning for rear axles in North America and Australia. And in those regions, we also have enhanced optional positioning for brakes, drivelines, and front axles. As we ramp up production with PACCAR over the next couple of years, we expect this to resolve an incremental revenue of more than $150 million for our company. The bulk of this income revenue will come after 2015, although we will see some step up this year. In anticipation of this significant opportunity, we’ve been executing a modest capacity strategy over the last couple of years. We’ve also worked to mitigate supply constraints and implemented various operational improvements that have increased throughput in our plans. As a result, we have capacity available to support this incremental PACCAR business while still meeting our contractual commitments with all of our other customers. We expect this additional capacity, which began to come online during 2014, will allow us to effectively service our customer base at around 300,000 Class 8 market, once you factor in anticipated share increases with PACCAR over the next couple of years. This agreement with PACCAR provides opportunities for us to grow with this global truck manufacturer as we expand future product plans. It’s an important new relationship for us with DAF and other premier truck manufacturers. We’ve worked hard to earn this business and look forward to growing it successfully. At Meritor, we are differentiating ourselves from our competitors and expanding our global customer relationships. We are doing this with a global engineering network with a tremendously talent team of commercial vehicle experts. Manufacturing capabilities around the world are efficient, advanced, and unique, a global footprint that allows us to serve our customers efficiently and timely and hands down the best customer service and support in the industry. But we can always be better, and despite the significant improvements that we made in execution, safety, quality, and delivery, we want to keep getting better. However, customers require excellence of us and we require excellence of ourselves. Please turn to Slide 5 for a wide fiscal year 2015 market outlook. Let’s take a look at North America. We believe the strength in order activity reflected most recently in December orders is a result of converging trends, including stronger economic activity, aging fleets, fuel economy, and solid fleet profitability. Indications are that the fleets have accelerated orders for 2015 requirements to reserve their places from future deliveries. Based on these factors and what we see in OE forecasted line rates, we expect the current backlog to drive strong levels of production throughout 2015 and into the beginning of 2016 as well. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for Class 8 volumes in this region by close to 5% to a range of 305,000 to 315,000. However, we are not anticipating to see a comparable pickup in our production. Daimler Truck North America has ramped up manufacturing of its Detroit axle to support its incremental demand in this peak market. While we currently are and expect to remain the majority supplier of Class 8 axles to DTNA, Detroit is producing more of its own axle to support the current cycle and heads up setting the upside opportunity arising from our increased Class 8 market outlook. As I mentioned, our new business with PACCAR in North America has begun. We will see a modest impact in this fiscal year with the bulk of the increase coming in 2016 and 2017. In other markets, Europe remains flat from our last forecast at a midpoint of 390,000 units. Economic indicators continue the fluctuating, making it difficult to forecast the timing of improvement in this region. However, we do expect currency headwinds to persist for the rest of the year, as the euro continues to depreciate versus the dollar. In South America, we have decreased our production outlook approximately 10% due to a difficult economic climate, driven by high inflation and climbing interest rates. That means that year-over-year we expect the market to be down 20%. The Brazilian currency has also weakened considerably, which is having a negative effect on revenue as well. Changes were also made for 2015 that affect the financing mechanism used for more than 70% of the truck and bus purchases in the region. Companies will now be required to make a down payment as much as 50% and the financing period is being shortened by several years. We anticipate that these changes in the financing structure of truck purchases will place further pressure on our business in Brazil. As a result, we continue to manage our cost structure appropriately. We believe that all of these incremental headwinds will drive slightly lower revenue this year.
from: Let’s turn to Slide 6, please. As I mentioned, our execution is showing in our results. Year-over-year, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin to 9% driven by pricing, labor and burden improvements, and material performance, all actions that identified a part of M2016 and we achieved this on slightly lower sales. We are confident in our ability to achieve our margin target of 10% for 2016, even though we are anticipating less help from the global market recovery than we did when we launched M2016. Our self-help strategy is working as you can see in year-over-year and sequential comparisons. With that, I’ll now turn it over to Kevin for financial details.
Kevin Nowlan:
you: As a result, we generated adjusted EBITDA margin of 9% and $35 million of adjusted income from continuing operations in the first quarter. Both of these are good results for us. So let’s walk through the detail by first turning to Slide 7, where you will see our first quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $879 million in the quarter, down $21 million, or 2% year-over-year. The decrease is primarily driven by lower commercial truck production in Europe and South America, as well as lower revenue from our defense business. Sales were also negatively impacted by $30 million in the quarter, due to the weaker euro and Brazilian real. The decrease in sales was partially offset by higher sales in North America, as the Class 8 tuck market continue to strengthen. Gross margin increased $10 million year-over-year due to pricing and material labor and burden performance. Keep in mind that this increase in gross margin was achieved despite the year-over-year step down in revenue. SG&A was $6 million higher in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year. The increase is primarily due to a $5 million long-term disability accrual reduction, which occurred last year and did not repeat. Interest expense was $19 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $27 million in the same period last year. The decrease was driven by the capital market transactions we executed that reduced our gross debt balances by $171 million and lowered our cost of debt. In addition, interest expense was favorably impacted by $2 million, due to interest earned on the refund of a judicial deposit in Brazil, which will not repeat going forward. Income tax expense was $7 million in the first quarter of 2015, representing a decrease of $4 million compared to the prior year, despite the fact that pre-tax income was higher this year. As I mentioned during the fourth quarter call, in many jurisdictions, including the U.S. and most of Western Europe, we previously established valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. As we generate positive earnings in these jurisdictions, we will recognize the minimal tax expense as long as these valuation allowances exist. Our effective tax rate of approximately 18% this quarter is a reflection of the fact that we are beginning to generate earnings in certain of these jurisdictions. All of that totals up to adjusted income from continuing operations of $35 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Slide 8 shows first quarter sales and segment EBITDA for commercial truck and industrial. Sales were $703 million, down $24 million, or 3% from the same period last year. In Europe, the Euro 6 pre-buy favorably impacted sales a year ago. In addition, we saw lower production in South America in defense and experienced approximately $30 million of FX headwinds in the segment, due to the weakening euro and Brazilian real. These revenue headwinds were partially offset by higher sales in North America, as the Class 8 truck market continue to strengthen. Segment EBITDA was $56 million, an increase of $3 million year-over-year. Continued execution of M2016 initiatives, including pricing and reduced product in operating costs, as well as the conversion on higher sales in North America more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower defense revenue, lower commercial vehicle demand in South America and FX. Next on Slide 9, we’ve summarized the Aftermarket and Trailer segment financial results. Sales were $208 million, up $6 million from last year, mostly coming from our aftermarket and trailer businesses in North America. Segment EBITDA was $25 million, up $4 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by conversion on the slightly higher sales and pricing actions executed last year. Now, let’s move to Slide 10, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk starting from the $80 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2014. First, you will recall that last quarter, we incurred both the $20 million charge associated with the remeasurement of our asbestos liabilities and the $15 million benefit related to the curtailment of our U.S. retiree medical plan at year end. Both of these items were discreet to the fourth quarter and did not repeat. The net impact of volume mix and pricing was flat for the quarter, even though volumes were down significantly on a sequential basis. Our first fiscal quarter has selling days, which affects our aftermarket business. In addition, production levels were down in South America as that market continues to show further signs of softening and the bid in North America as well as industry production was a little lower than in Q4. We were able to offset the lower volume through global pricing. Next, we experienced $23 million foreign currency headwind on sales, which negatively impacted EBITDA by $5 million, primarily associated with the continued appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the real. Finally, we had an all other net decrease in EBITDA of $1 million. This includes around $3 million of one-time favorable items that provided the benefit to our result this quarter. Overall, this was a very solid quarter for us. Despite declining revenue, our strong execution presented a corresponding decline in adjusted EBITDA. The result was adjusted EBITDA of $79 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 9%, which means, we were able to successfully manage downside conversion to only 2%. Now, let’s turn to Slide 11. For the first quarter, total free cash flow was negative $21 million, compared to negative $16 million in the prior year. In the first quarter, we typically make our variable incentive compensation payments related to prior year performance, and this year’s payments were higher than the prior year’s payments. These payments are included in the line item called other on the slide. Aside from incentive compensation payments, our first quarter is also typically affected by seasonal trends, including fewer selling days and calendar year-end cut off issues which often impact the timing of receivables collections. Despite this, we continue to be on track to generate $100 million in cash flow this year. Next, I’ll review our updated fiscal year 2015 outlook on Slide 12. Based on the demand assumptions I highlighted on Slide 5, we have lowered our fiscal year 2015 sales guidance to approximately $3.7 billion. As noted on that earlier slide, we are seeing FX headwinds in Brazil and Europe, which is impacting our revenue outlook. You can see our new currency assumptions reflected on the slide here. In addition, lower production expectations in South America and China are further reducing our revenue expectations. And while the North America Class 8 market is up a bit, as we mentioned, we don’t expect to see that translate to increased revenue for us, as the increased revenue opportunity is being offset by DTNA supporting that ramp-up with increased internal axle production. Despite the decreased revenue outlook, we expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 9% compared to our previous guidance of a range of 8.8% to 9%. We expect to drive this margin result primarily through our continued strong execution of our M2016 initiatives. We’re maintaining our adjusted earnings per share guidance from continuing operations in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 for fiscal year 2015. The impact of lower revenue, slightly higher margin guidance, and the mix of earnings between tax-paying and non-tax-paying jurisdictions is driving very little impact on our bottom line earnings outlook. Our effective income tax rate guidance also remains unchanged at approximately 20% for fiscal year 2015. Although cash taxes might drop a bit with the revised mix of earnings, that drop isn’t going to move the needle meaningfully on our effective tax rate. And finally, as I said earlier, we continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $100 million for 2015, which means, we’re expecting back to back years of cash flow at or above that level. Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Ike, to provide closing remarks.
Ike Evans: Thanks, Kevin. Let’s turn to Slide 13. Before we conclude our comments, I want to reiterate that we are on track to achieve all three of our M2016 metrics. By the end of fiscal 2014, we had already reduced net debt, including retirement benefit liabilities by close to $500 million, achieving our target two years early. Despite the revenue headwinds we referenced today, primarily in Europe and South America, we remain confident in achieving our 10% adjusted EBITDA margin target in 2016. And we remain on track to achieve incremental book revenue of $500 million per year at run rate. In fact, with the PACCAR win we announced today, we’re more than halfway to achieving our $500 million run rate revenue target. We’ll share more detail on our performance against these goals next week at Analyst Day. And with that, we’ll take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed.
Brian Johnson: Good morning, team.
Kevin Nowlan: Good morning.
Ike Evans: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Johnson: Look forward to seeing you next week. I want to just get a little bit more color on PACCAR. Could you maybe tell us if I or a fleet buyer is going to a PACCAR showroom earlier this calendar year, what would I be offered in terms of rear axles and other drivetrains? Where would Meritor have been in that option book, if at all, and then where are you going forward? And then kind of second, leading into that, is that $150 million in annual run rate, life of the contract measure and so forth?
Ike Evans: If you were to walk in and talk to a fleet, you would find that the Meritor axel would be listed as the preferred axel. And the 100 - to answer your other question on the revenue, that’s a $150 million annually.
Brian Johnson: Okay. But earlier in the year, if I went in last year to a fleet, would I even have the option…?
Ike Evans: You would have the - Brian you would have had the option, but our competitor would have been listed as standard.
Brian Johnson: Okay. So you are moving from standard from optional to preferred for rear axle…
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, let me - yes, Brian, at that point, I mean, there are specific axles that we’re talking about. And in particular as we talk about the preferred option, we’re really talking about a 46K axle, and there - there’s technically not a real standard position in the data book. The standard positions are around the 40K axles. And so, as you look at the 46K axle, which is a meaningful piece of the business, the rear axle business, we are the preferred option, which means, we are lower priced in the data book this year going forward.
Brian Johnson: And what do you think was going on - why do you think you won this business, how competitive was it? What was the feedback from the customer on why they made this change?
Ike Evans: The feedback from PACCAR and you need to ask them specifically, but they view us as a long-term partner, they can support them from a product, quality, and delivery standpoint. And matter of fact, at the Analyst Day, you will see Jay Craig is with Bob Christensen, and you will see a testimonial almost from Bob Christensen talking about why they picked us.
Brian Johnson: And in terms of capacity, is it - how are you freeing up capacity, is it adding extra shifts, is it improving flow rates through Six Sigma, any bump outs?
Ike Evans: It’s all of that. We have had some capital investment. It’s been modest and it’s been within the 2% that we’ve targeted. And there is still some, a little bit of modest, it’s not much to go that will finish this year. We’ve really as far as our operational excellence, we’ve been working on quality throughput and then had some real opportunities there. And we’ve also worked with our supply place to mitigate the constraints there. So if you look at it from a standpoint of our guidance this year of 305 to 315, we will - we’ve stated we were at 300, we probably can support, because we had two 80,000 quarters that we have successfully converted that would take us to 320, but when PACCAR was fully up to speed we would be back to a 300 Class 8 market.
Brian Johnson: Okay. And this trend with Detroit Diesel - last question, kind of, how much of an offset is insourcing to the market share gains you are making in PACCAR and is this more of a - is this permanent shift at that customer, or could it happen with other customers, or is it more a question of a customer, kind of, adding peak loading capacity?
Ike Evans: Right, we’ve seen Detroit ramp up to support this peak market, and it has had the effect that we’re talking about. But they are a valued and important customer. They are our largest customer in North America. I mean, we just signed a long-term agreement with DTNA last year that runs through 2017. And the bottom line is that, they and we expect to remain the majority supplier of their Class 8 axles going forward.
Brian Johnson: Okay, great. Thank you. Looking forward to seeing you next week.
Ike Evans: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed.
Colin Langan: Yes, just - thanks for taking my questions. Can you just clarify in terms of, I think you mentioned that you are preferred on certain axles, so any color in terms of the PACCAR business. Are you preferred in the majority of the trucks that they are selling, or is this just a subset and any color there on the relative size…?
Ike Evans: The preferred option is really focused on the 46K, which is, it’s not the majority of the business, but it’s a meaningful piece of the business.
Colin Langan: Okay. Thank you for the clarification. Any color on how we should think about the rest of the year? If we look at the annualized pace, you are at around $1.40, but you didn’t take your guidance up. What factors kind of mitigate the earnings growth through the rest of the year that we should be thinking about as we model things out?
Kevin Nowlan: I mean one of the things to keep in mind is that, as I mentioned in my remarks on the sequential walk, there was about $3 million of, I’ll call them one-time favorable items just a few $1 million items that we don’t expect to repeat. So if you flowed that through the EPS, if you backed that out effectively on a going forward basis, your annualized run rate wouldn’t be as high as what you’re suggesting there. So I think that’s something to keep in mind.
Colin Langan: Okay, that’s very helpful. And any color on - this is the first quarter with the new Volvo contract, any color now that has sort of passed on how much that maybe helped in the new contract or any framework there?
Ike Evans: We can’t really comment on that. We did get pricing with our OEs across all regions as well as our aftermarket business as well. But really not in a position disclosed specific details about that contract I would reiterate again that, we’re really pleased that we’re able to reach the agreement with Volvo that allows us to continue to provide them with their products for the foreseeable future.
Colin Langan: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Patrick Archambault: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I guess just - I dialed in a bit late and I might have missed the detail, but just the interplay between kind of the ramp-up for DTNA that you mentioned as well as PACCAR, and I guess the impact on margins that it’s having. Could you just get kind of get into a little bit more detail on that just because I felt we went through it fast, I wasn’t quite sure of what the impact was of all those pieces put together.
Kevin Nowlan: Okay, Patrick, I’ll - this is Kevin, I’ll take that. Very simply the way to think about it is that we’ve taken our full-year North American truck market up - guidance up about 5%. We think that 5% increase in market is effectively being offset from a revenue perspective by DTNA ramping up its internal production to support the peak market. So I think we are seeing effectively that upset opportunity being offset by some of the ramp up the DTNA has done. In terms of the PACCAR business, the bulk of the PACCAR ramp-up is going to happen after 2015, it will happen in 2016 and 2017. We are seeing some of that ramp-up this year, but it’s already factored into the guidance. We were on the verge of executing this contract back when we first gave guidance for the full-year, so we were already contemplating that in the guidance.
Patrick Archambault: And I’m sorry, like the DTNA ramping up internally that would be negative for you, why exactly?
Kevin Nowlan: Because effectively they are ramping up internal axle production, so they have a vertically integrated supplier. We provide the majority of the Class 8 axles and we continue to do so today, but they ramped up such that effectively our penetration on the rear axles with them has gone down as a result.
Patrick Archambault: And is that just kind of a timing item, or is that sort of a permanent shift that they’ve kind of resourced some of the stuff you have had?
Ike Evans: Patrick, we just signed just last year a four-year agreement and with Daimler that positions us as a majority of - supplier for the majority of their axles, and we expect that to be the case going forward as well.
Patrick Archambault: Okay. But - sorry, just a little bit on this more though, it sounds like in exchange for a price, they might have insourced some of it, right? Is that kind of a fair way to think about it?
Ike Evans: No.
Kevin Nowlan: I don’t know that I would go that far, Patrick, other than to say, we’ve seen them clearly ramp-up their internal axle production capability to support the peak market here. And beyond that that’s probably all I would say at the moment, but we expect to continue to provide the majority of axles as we’re doing today on the Class 8 business.
Patrick Archambault: Okay. That’s helpful, thanks. And just on Brazil, did you - did I hear you say that your - I don’t have the comps of the South American numbers you have on page 5 or Slide 5, but did I - I think you had said that was down 20%, so that’s fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014, is that correct? And then, I guess, maybe just a little bit more on that, I get it that you have the FINAME financing rates that have gone up in the down payment and all of that fun stuff. But I mean, on a calendar basis, production was down 50% in Brazil or the high 40s% at least last year. So one would have thought it was at least an easy comp. So I guess, maybe, just help me understand a little bit better what’s going on there, if you don’t mind.
Kevin Nowlan: Well, on a year-over-year basis, 2014 production was down only about 12% in 2014 versus 2013. As we look ahead to this year, we’re expecting it to be down another 20% on top of that. I mean, if you look at Q1 alone, sequentially going from Q4 to Q1 the market is down - production is down over 20%. You look on a year-over-year basis 2014 to 2015 is down little over 30%. The market we’re seeing right now in Brazil, where we are looking at about 130,000 market is approaching the levels that we saw back in 2009. The good news is, we’re still profitable in that market and we expect to play in that business longer-term. But we’re approaching levels that we haven’t seen since the recession five or six years ago.
Patrick Archambault: Interesting. I guess, maybe, some of that is the fiscal conversion, and I suppose you also potentially have a different market than what ANFAVEA reports, is that the difference? Because on a calendar basis, they have production down, kind of high 40s%, but so - maybe we can take that offline, but…
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, we can talk about that offline, but ANFAVEA we’re looking at from them that we’re seeing the exact same numbers that they are.
Patrick Archambault: Okay. All right. We will reconcile that offline. Thanks a lot, guys.
Kevin Nowlan: Okay.
Ike Evans: Thank you, Patrick.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Brett Hoselton: Good morning, gentlemen.
Kevin Nowlan: Good morning.
Ike Evans: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Hoselton: I guess first, just kind of a broad kind of overarching question here. Over the past 10 or 15 years that I have covered the company, you guys have gone through a number of cycles. As that cycle has ramped up and we’ve seen a fairly material ramp-up in Class 8 orders here recently and obviously you are raising your expectations here. In the past the leverage that a lot of us anticipated you might get or benefit from as a result of the higher sales has been offset by premium freight costs over time and that sort of thing, and therefore, you haven’t necessarily gotten to the 10% target that you had hoped to achieve and so forth. So my question is, how do you think about or how have things changed at Meritor this cycle versus prior cycles that that give you confidence that you will be able to achieve these higher margins as that cycle lifts?
Ike Evans: We’ll, I think, we’ve given guidance before that we thought we could convert incremental revenue in the 15% to 20% range. And I think the answer Brett, is we’ve been doing it. We have just come out two 80,000 quarters. And we did successfully convert at the 15% to 20%. Now, some of it has been better throughput as we talked about before and we’ve expanded our supply base. There has been - it’s not a single one action, it’s probably 10 or 15, if you were to sit and list them all. But I think the proof is proof is, is in the pudding of what we’ve been doing, that we’ve successfully been doing it for the last four, five quarters.
Brett Hoselton: And then as you think about the additional 100 basis points of margin expansion as you move into 2016, can you talk about or quantify or bucket the primary drivers of that and then just kind of give us a flavor of your confidence level in being able to achieve that?
Kevin Nowlan: And I think as we look ahead to 2016, we are emboldened by the fact that we are already jumping out of the gate here in the first quarter of 2015 at 9% on revenue that’s not even at $900 million. So we feel pretty good about the starting point as we look ahead toward 2016. So as we look towards 2016, we are expecting a mix of continued performance like we’ve been demonstrating the last couple of years combined with some revenue help. I mean, at the end of the day, we have a mix of things that we are looking for next year. And as we said publicly, we expect that we need to be at about $4.2 billion of revenue to be able to achieve 10% target. Now jumping off of $3.7 billion, how do you get from $3.7 billion to $4.2 billion? It’s too early to call what the markets are going to look like next year. But we know that with the new business wins that we generated, including the PACCAR win that we announced here today, that’s going to contribute a couple of $100 million incrementally between 2015 and 2016, which means then end market recovery we are still looking for $300 million or so of help. That said, this company is determined on executing toward hitting its 10% margin targets, but that’s kind of the flight path there.
Ike Evans: I think to add a little more to that, it’s basically our self-help. In 2016, the elegance of it is in its simplicity and the focus that we’ve done around the initiatives to support the overarching objectives.
Brett Hoselton: The 80,000 unit run rate that you experienced here, about 320,000 units, what happens in the event that the market moves up maybe another 10% or so to north of 350,000 units? How does that affect the business model, the margin profile, and so forth?
Ike Evans: Right now, we don’t think that is probably the case, Brett, and we’re in a position where we are supporting our contractual agreements with our customers. So I mean, I don’t see the market for the foreseeable future doing that. But right now, we are not going to chase capacity around the world above and beyond what we’ve committed to.
Kevin Nowlan: And I think when we look back to the last time we were approaching these types of levels in 2012, we saw or observed that there were constraints across the global supply base. And so seeing the market get to that type of level like you mentioned, 350,000, I don’t think we think it’s really achievable given the broader supply base in this industry. And so, as Ike mentioned, we are not going to chase that capacity by investing - installing new capacity to support that. But we don’t see the market going there. We think the order activity we are seeing, frankly, just strengthens our outlook for 2015 and probably carries us into 2016 as well a little bit.
Brett Hoselton: Excellent. Ike, Kevin, thank you very much, gentlemen.
Ike Evans: Thank you.
Kevin Nowlan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Robert Kosowsky from Sidoti. Please proceed.
Robert Kosowsky: Good morning, guys how are you doing?
Ike Evans: How are you, Robert.
Kevin Nowlan: Good morning, Robert.
Robert Kosowsky: Doing, right. Just going back to the Detroit axle, DTNA, I guess, shift in production, is this something that was contemplated when you came up with the most recent agreement? Meaning that if they are ramping up production right now, it might be tacking into some inefficiencies that you might have in your own production environment. So this is something that was contemplated going into that agreement a couple of years ago?
Ike Evans: I can’t necessarily answer what DTNA was thinking at the time. I just know what we’ve agreed to in the contract. And it was just signed last year, and the contract is that, we will be the majority supplier of DTNA’s axles going forward.
Kevin Nowlan: So, I mean, it’s is structured in a way that it gives DTNA the incentive to keep business with us. But DTNA has had that - had their vertical capability for an extended period of time that we continue to be the majority supplier of axles for an extended period of time. So the way the agreement is structured, our expectation of that relationship is that, it will continue to be operate the way it has, which is we will be the majority supplier. But, again, I think DTNA has used this as an opportunity to invest in some capacity from the axle side to support the peak market here.
Ike Evans: The way Kevin explained it, we are just missing a little bit of the upside here, that’s the bottom line.
Robert Kosowsky: Okay. And would this - if you had gotten this upside, would you have incurred, I guess, inefficiencies because it would have been - the market would have been going above what you were, I guess, capacitized for?
Kevin Nowlan: We don’t think so because, in fact, as we - as Ike talked about earlier, the capacity that we were installing over the last couple of years to support the PACCAR business that we were anticipating winning and ramping up. That capacity really started to come online last year. And so it happened to coincide with this type of the market, which is why we were able to actually support the 80,000 quarter that we saw back in Q4. And so, as the market hit that type of level with the types of penetrations we’ve experienced in the past with DTNA, we absolutely could have supported it. Now, once the PACCAR business comes fully up to speed over the next couple of years, our capacity will be constrained back to the levels that it was before. So I think the fact is, we could support an 80,000 market right now, because the capacity is there to support it until the PACCAR business completely ramps up.
Robert Kosowsky: Okay, I understand that. And then secondly, obviously there is weakness in Brazil and China on the construction side. I’m wondering do you see any signs of hope in those markets, and specifically there was some talk earlier this month about a Chinese infrastructure stimulus plan coming out. Do you give any credence to that?
Ike Evans: Well, the Brazilian market is - obviously has its own issues, and we don’t see much recovery this year. Hopefully we’ll start to see some recovery next year, and as Kevin implied, we like the Brazilian market. We have strong relationships with our customers. We are profitable at the levels that it is today, so I mean, we’re very much committed to the Brazilian market. The China market is anybody’s guess, and if - obviously if there is additional infrastructure spending, we’ll obviously have the opportunity to take advantage of that.
Robert Kosowsky: Okay. Do you think there is a good likelihood that a plan goes through, or do you have any kind of idea as to whether or not the reality of that happening?
Ike Evans: I just don’t know, to be honest.
Robert Kosowsky: All right. Thank you very much, and good luck.
Kevin Nowlan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Alex Potter: Hi, guys. One thing that you had mentioned pretty consistently both in the aftermarket and in the new equipment segment was this impact on pricing. Can you just, I guess, flush out a little bit more what specifically you are being able to increase pricing on and why?
Kevin Nowlan: This is Kevin, I’ll take that. From an aftermarket perspective over the last number of years, we’ve consistently launched or executed pricing actions generally in the second fiscal quarter of the year. And, in fact, we’ve executed pricing again in this current quarter in the aftermarket business. So that’s been a pretty consistent trend for, at least, five or six years. On the OE side, it’s been more opportunistic as opportunities arise with different markets or different OEs. And so, as we look at the commercial truck and industrial segment in the quarter, we saw a number of different geographies and a number of different customers in which we had some pricing actions that went into effect.
Alex Potter: Okay. And presumably that’s, I guess, related to the fact that right now, say, in North America, we are getting somewhere in the neighborhood of peakish order run rates. So the - I guess, the supply chain is somewhat constrained and you have more leverage to be able to request pricing increases?
Kevin Nowlan: No, not - I mean, the countries in which we are under an LTA, if that LTA is still in effect and continuing, the pricing is already contractually locked in. So there aren’t - there generally aren’t mechanisms when you are in the middle of an LTA to change the pricing, unless you are launching new products or providing new features. It’s really things that happen when either an LTA comes up for renewal or when you have, you are operating on a spot basis in certain markets, those are the types of opportunities.
Alex Potter: Okay. So it has nothing to do with supply constraints in the supply chain?
Ike Evans: No it does not, yes.
Kevin Nowlan: That’s correct.
Alex Potter: Okay. And then shifting over to margins, obviously nice margins in aftermarket, how sustainable do you think they are going forward?
Ike Evans: Very. I mean, we don’t see - as a matter of fact the pricing opportunities we’ve got are not this is necessarily just price per say. They are value-added services that we’ve been in - product availability, 24-hour service. We are doing things that our customers put a value on and they are willing to pay for it. So the margins that we see are very sustainable.
Kevin Nowlan: And I think we alluded to that last quarter as well. I think our Q4 margin was a little bit high. We were at a higher revenue level because we have seasonal - seasonality in the business that takes revenue down this quarter, but we also had some one-time favorability that was helping the results last quarter. And we indicated that we thought a normalized run rate at that type of revenue was a little bit north of this, and with revenue coming down a little bit in the quarter, this is right in line with our expectations. So I think, we do believe this to be sustainable as we go forward.
Alex Potter: Okay, very good. And then the last question also on aftermarket, but specifically on Europe. I was wondering if you could kind of dive in there, I don’t know if you have sort of visibility on what Europe’s aftermarket specifically is doing by maybe region or sub-region within Europe, but is there any way that you can draw some insights out of those aftermarket trends that help inform your view of the new truck market?
Ike Evans: Well, the aftermarket distribution channel in Europe is very much different than it is in this country. It’s basically through the OEMs as opposed to - in the North American market, it goes through OEMs and distribution. I guess, the biggest impact to us in Europe is Russia. We have considerable revenue in Russia, and Russia obviously is uncertain at this point in time.
Alex Potter: Okay. And no specific aftermarket trends up or down in Russia that would lead you to believe that things are getting better or worse there?
Kevin Nowlan: Well, I think just generally with the issues that we’ve seen in the Russian market it has impacted that piece of the business. It’s not a majority of our business by any means, but it’s still a meaningful piece of that business. So that has been impacted a little bit. And I think, the softness we’ve seen overall in the European market, it’s had a similar impact on the aftermarket business as well, even putting Russia side.
Alex Potter: Okay, very good. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on behalf of Ryan. Thanks for taking our questions. So the first question I have, I was just trying to get to what has really changed since you last issued guidance, and revenues looks softer on that front, but you are able to execute the stronger net higher margins. So wondering is this just a function of pulling in more cost sales in the business, or are you contemplating more pricing actions going forward in the future quarters, which is driving higher margins? What’s really helping you drive that higher margin and the slightly softer revenue outlook for this year?
Kevin Nowlan: I would say by and large, it’s the performance of the business. I don’t think, it’s necessarily anything incremental beyond our expectations from a pricing perspective. I think it’s just a lot of the cost initiatives are taking hold and sticking. We obviously, as I mentioned, had a few million dollars of one-time favorable items in the quarter about $3 million that we hadn’t necessarily planned for. So it’s a simple DOS around the top end of the guidance that we had previously given.
Unidentified Analyst: Just a follow-up there, is there an X number that you’ve quoted us to be cost save that you expect in this year incrementally over the last year?
Kevin Nowlan: We haven’t. I think the best way to dimension that, you can look at the sequential walks that we provide every quarter, and if you add up the components and think about what that means from a material labor and burden perspective, I think you can get in the ZIP code of what we expect to say. It’s part of our M2016 initiative. We are driving for generating reduced material costs of about 2.5% of controllable spend and about 2.6% on the labor and burden side. Those are our targets, and we achieved those last year. So the combination of those things might give you a little bit of color.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And just more on the housekeeping side, you mentioned some one-time items benefiting your margin this quarter. Were they primarily on the aftermarket and trailer segment? I mean, I’m just trying to get at whether the 12% margin there is sustainable, or was that benefiting from some one-off items this quarter, which don’t really carry forward?
Kevin Nowlan: No, it was - I would say, it’s wasn’t really related to aftermarket in particular. So there are no real discrete items. There were some accrual reversals that impacted both segments, and there were a couple discrete items more on the truck side, I would say.
Unidentified Analyst: So it’s fair to assume that the aftermarket and trailer segment margins are sustainable in the quarters going forward?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Good. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Kristine Kubacki from Avondale Partners. Please proceed.
Kristine Kubacki: Hey, good morning, guys.
Ike Evans: Good morning.
Kristine Kubacki: Not to beat a dead horse a little bit, but I’m a little confused, I guess, on the DTNA when you say a majority supplier. It was my understanding and I may have this completely wrong, but that as they spec out their most popular evolution package that you have to have their supplied axles. And I guess, and then I guess, when you say majority supplier to them, are you talking as a third-party supplier? And then, I guess, how do you monitor if, in fact, how you maintain a majority market share if, indeed to spec in the evolution package you have to have at Daimler axle?
Ike Evans: Well, I will let Kevin to take it in a little more detail, but keep in mind that the fleets spec the products that they want, now they - DTNA offers the Detroit package, but the fleets can request a Meritor axle on that drivetrain if they choose. So it’s just not that that - that’s one of the potential offerings, but it is just one of the potential offerings.
Kevin Nowlan: And don’t forget, I think Detroit axle is standard for Daimler. It has been for a long time, yet we command a majority of the Class 8 rear axle supply for Daimler and continue to do so today. So it’s exactly as I described, the fleets can specify, which axles they would like on their vehicles and more often than not they select a Meritor axle on the Class 8.
Kristine Kubacki: Okay. And then just - and that’s helpful and something we haven’t talked about in a little bit. But you are still the preferred supplier for Navistar as well, correct?
Kevin Nowlan: We are standard position, yes.
Ike Evans: Yes.
Kristine Kubacki: Okay. And that’s helpful. And then one last question, in terms of the PACCAR ramp up, how can we think about that? Is it going to take two years to ramp-up, and then I guess, how - with your traditional market share being a preferred supplier, where do you think you get to, is it 50%, is it 80% over time?
Kevin Nowlan: A couple of points there, I think we’ll see the majority of the income on this new contract in our income statement by the end of next year. So we would expect to see the bulk of the ramp-up happen by the end of 2016. In terms of where that puts us from a penetration perspective, we’ll talk a little bit more about that at Analyst Day next week.
Kristine Kubacki: Okay. That’s very helpful. I look forward to seeing you guys there. Thank you.
Kevin Nowlan: Right, thank you.
Ike Evans: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will be the last question of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks.
Carl Anderson: Thank you. We do appreciate your participation in today’s call. As a reminder, we are hosting our Analyst Day event next week on February 5, that we hope to see you there. This concludes our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Ivor J. Evans: Thank you, Carl and good morning everyone. Let’s turn to slide 3, our companywide alignment to achieve our M2016 objectives drove improved financial performance year-over-year. Our results reflect strong execution, driven by a focused effort to convert on the upturn in North America and to effectively manage our operating and product cost.  Although revenue was only slightly up over the prior year, EBITDA margin increased from 7.2% last year to 8.3% this year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $1.02 from $0.42 per share last year and free cash flow for the year was $138 million, our best cash flow result in several years. Efforts to improve our balance sheet this year also paid off.  Our eight year pursuit of the antitrust settlement with Eaton as well as treasury actions we executed throughout the year resulted in us achieving our M2016 net debt target two years early. We also extended important long-term supply agreements; one with Volvo our largest global customer and another with Daimler, our largest customer in North America. In June we announced a share repurchase plan of up to $200 million of our equity or equity linked securities that we intend to initiate this year and complete by the end of fiscal 2016.  Let’s turn to slide 4 for an update on our M2016 metrics. Our performance in fiscal 2014 puts us on track to achieve our EBITDA margin target of 10% in fiscal 2016. Despite headwinds, including the wind down of our defence business, a challenging South American environment, and a loss of earnings from the 2013 sale of our Suspensys joint venture, we improved our margin by 110 basis points.  This was largely due to a concentrated effort by our global team to reduce material costs, better manage labor and burden, and pricing actions. With our strong margin performance in 2014 that exceeded expectations and our outlook for fiscal 2015 we are even less dependent on end markets than our original M2016 planning. We now believe we can achieve a 10% EBITDA margin at revenue levels as low as $4.2 billion, clearly demonstrating our ability to successfully mitigate micro economic headwinds.  On slide 5 you’ll see that we’ve reduced net debt by close to $500 million since 2012 resulting in net debt of $1.439 billion. This settlement with Eaton, proceeds from the sale of our former joint venture, free cash flow generation, and pension de-risking strategies were important elements of strategy that drove this achievement. As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, this change in our debt structure allows us to begin executing our buyback program this year despite a likely increase in pension liabilities due to a new mortality table change. Slide 6 shows the progress we’ve made toward our revenue target of $500 million. We’ve added $60 million in new business relative to what we reported to you last year. With the $120 million we earned in fiscal 2013, we are now $180 million towards our target. However market deterioration primarily in South America has negatively impacted this figure by approximately $35 million. So while we won $180 million in new business, we are only score carding ourselves at $145 million to take in account the market softness that we expect to negatively impact revenue.  Despite the current volume weakness in global markets, we do have a robust pipeline and are confident in our ability to achieve the $500 million revenue target. On slide 7, we highlight two major contract renewals we announced this year. The contract with Daimler represents the continuation of an important partnership.  With this agreement we retained standard position for air drum brakes and drivelines, and hold optional position for front and rear axles. With the new Volvo agreement we’ll provide axles for 7 years in Europe and South America, axles and drivelines for 4 years in North America, and axles in Australia for 4 years. We also extended an agreement to supply Hino, our second largest medium duty truck customer with axles and brakes through March of 2017.  Please turn to slide 8. We are designing and manufacturing a broad portfolio of products that meet our customer needs for efficiency, flexibility, reliability, and high value. This is the Meritor value proposition that is allowing us to maintain and grow business with existing long-term customers and win new contracts with OEs around the world. In September we displayed our global capabilities at the IAA Commercial Vehicle Show in Hanover, Germany that includes the products you see on this slide. Our global engineering network is enabling us to design products for unique regional needs like the RPL 35 drivelines for North and South America that feature high torque capacity equipped to handle engine downspeeding and heavy service applications. As you know, downspeeding is a current trend in the industry that employs direct drive transmissions and fast axle gear ratios to maintain vehicle road speed at lower engine RPM which as you know supports the industry demand for fuel economy.  Beginning in early 2015, we will also launch a portfolio of products that offer a 228 ratio on our 14X Tandem for 6x4 long haul applications and 231 ratio on the new FUELite Plus Tandem for the 6x2 market. These fast axle ratios can be integrated with our RPL 35 drivelines.  In Europe we have launched the 17X EVO drive axle that was recently designed for 4x2 applications in that region. This axle is built with advanced technologies for greater durability and substantial reductions in fuel consumptions. It will also be offered in South and North America for the 6x2 segment. While this product is compact and light weight, it has expanded capacity for 50 ton payloads and superfast ratios to deliver additional fuel economy. Engineered initially for the light vehicle, commercial vehicle market and segment in India, our 10X axle is built for higher payload capacity, fuel efficiency, and strength to accommodate road conditions for challenging terrains. This fully addressed axle provides our customers with single drive solution for the light duty market. We plan to also launch this product in South America.  As I said, our long-term success is contingent on the products we bring to market. Efficiency gains, adaptive designs, extended life, and customer support are the characteristics that differentiate Meritor products in our global markets.  Please turn to slide 9 for a fiscal 2015 market outlook. As you know, North America is in a strong market upturn right now. Class orders, Class 8 orders for October came in at 46,200 the best month since March of 2006. ACT attributes to the demands in new truck fuel economy and proves that economics and freight sectors, rising freight rates and the fleet profitability. This recent order activity indicates that this cycle has a longer run giving us confidence in our outlook for fiscal 2015. We anticipate Class 8 buyings for the year to be in the range of 290,000 to 300,000 units and Class 7 volumes to be between 210,000 to 220,000 units for our fiscal year. We also expect trailer volumes to remain strong, up slightly from what we saw this past year. There are several factors we watch closely in North America like driver availability, the shift of production to Mexico, and hours of service rules that our line of site tells us that 2015 will be another strong year in this cycle.  Europe and South America are a different story. In Europe we are projecting our medium and heavy duty truck production to fall by approximately 3% year-over-year. The economic indicators in Europe are fluctuating making it difficult to closely gauge this next year. However, some indicators are trending negative and truck registrations had decreased in some countries.  South America is the big story right now in terms of economic outlook. Brazil is technically in the recession, GDP growth is negative, inflation continues to increase, unemployment is showing signs of deterioration, and the currency continues to weaken. Commercial vehicle markets reflect these worsening conditions which is why we expect fiscal 2015 volumes to be lower at 140,000 to 150,000 units. With the outcome of the election in October, we will be closely watching the region as the incumbent President begins her next term.  While bullish on South America, in the longer term we expect markets to remain under pressure for a period of time. With regard to China we expect China will be up slightly this year. And end of the year market segment is improving following the election earlier this year, driving higher medium and heavy truck volumes.  On slide 10, I want to spend a couple of minutes on our performance during the upcycle in North America. Last February at our Analyst Day event we told you we were prepared for the high volumes we were anticipating in fiscal 2014. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, our daily axle production is up 25%. Throughout this cycle, we will remain focused on achieving our targeted conversion rates while not allowing premium cost to meaningfully impact our bottom line.  We have done that through effective management of cost and close collaboration of demand requirements with our customers and suppliers. While at the same time our delivery performance was 90% on time and our customer PBM was 68. This is the new Meritor. Not only is our execution strong as demonstrated during this cycle of North America and earlier this year in Europe during the pre-buy but our overall financial performance is proving as well. Our results this year were positively impacted by our performance during this upturn.  Now I’ll turn the call over to Kevin for more financial detail. Kevin?
Kevin Nowlan: Thanks Ike, and good morning. On today’s call I’ll review our fourth quarter and full year financial results. And then I’ll take you through our 2015 guidance. We achieved solid financial results for the quarter generating $35 million of adjusted incomes from continuing operations and expanding our adjusted EBITDA margin by 50 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. As Ike said, our results reflect excellent execution driven by our commitment to achieve M2016 objectives. Our team successfully converted on the high volumes in North America and managed our operating and product cost well around the globe.  Before we get started in reviewing the financials let me point out that we’ve recast all current and historical results to reflect the Mascot remanufacturing business' discontinued operations. In August we announced that we would exit this business and in September we signed a definitive sale agreement.  On slide 11 you’ll see our fourth quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $933 million in the quarter up $31 million or 3% year-over-year. The increase is primarily driven by higher sales in North America as the Class 8 truck market continued to strengthen. This is partially offset by lower commercial truck production in South America and Europe as well as lower revenue from our defence business.  Gross margin was $31 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. The improvement includes a $15 million benefit related to the curtailment of our U.S. retiree medical plan. Excluding this benefit gross margin still increased $16 million, which reflects 130 basis points improvement. The expansion in gross margin was driven by higher revenue and the continued execution of our M2016 initiatives. We continue to have strong net material, labor and burden performance in the business which is a key component of our margin expansion objectives. Keep in mind that this increase in gross margin was achieved despite the significant year-over-year step down in revenue from defence and South America.  I should also note that the margin improvement includes an $8 million benefit relating to the favorable resolution of the warranty contingency that we originally booked in the third quarter of 2013. We’ve excluded the $8 million benefit from adjusted EBITDA consistent with the charge that we took in 2013. SG&A was $19 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. The increase is primarily due to higher as best as related expenses as well as higher variable incentive compensation cost.  Next, the other line item encompasses the remaining items that impact our operating income. The $7 million cost in 2014 relates to the restructuring actions we took in our South American business in response to the difficult market conditions there. This is consistent with what we announced in August. The prior year expense of $71 million is primarily related to a charge that we took associated with buyouts of term vested participants in our U.S. defined benefit pension plan.  Interest expense was $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $27 million in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the losses on debt extinguishment related to two initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter. First, we executed the repurchase of the remaining $84 million of our 8 and 1/8th notes due in 2015.  Second, we also opportunistically repurchased $38 million of our 4% convertible notes in the open market as we continue to delever the company and improve the balance sheet. You will note that we have included an add back of $10 million in adjusted income from continuing operations associated with the loss on these transactions. This loss was partially offset by lower cash interest expense we’re now experiencing due to the capital market transactions we executed in the second quarter of this year that reduced our gross debt balances.  Moving down the income statement, income tax expense decreased $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year. Remember, when we sold our stake in Suspensys last year we incurred a $33 million capital gains tax which is included in this line item. That explains the bulk of the year-over-year improvement but in addition to that during 2014 we experienced lower earnings in jurisdictions such as Brazil where we accrue income tax expense. All of that totals up to adjusted income from continuing operations of $35 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared to adjusted income of $13 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the same period last year. This represents 169% expansion of adjusted earnings per share on slightly higher revenue.  Slide 12 shows fourth quarter sales and segment EBITDA for commercial truck in industrial. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $729 million up $20 million or 3% from the same period last year. Segment EBITDA was $53 million, a decrease of $1 million year-over-year. Conversion of higher sales in North America and continued strong material and operational performance were more than offset by higher variable incentive compensation accruals and the unfavorable mix impact associated with lower commercial vehicle demand in South America and lower defence revenue.  Next, on slide 13 we summarized the aftermarket and trailer segment financial results. Sales were $240 million, up $13 million from last year. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue in North America. Segment EBITDA was $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, up $7 million compared to last year. This increase is due to a combination of improved pricing in our North America aftermarket business and a charge related to value added tax that we incurred last year which did not repeat.  Now let's move to slide 14 which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q3 to Q4. Walking from the $82 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in our third quarter, we had an $8 million unfavorable impact due to volume mix and pricing. The favorable impact of slightly higher revenue in our North America truck business was more than offset by lower defence sales and lower sales in Europe resulting from the summer holiday shut down.  Next, we continue to execute on our M2016 objectives of achieving net material, labor, and burden savings. These initiatives provided an incremental $4 million net benefit sequentially from the third quarter. Also as I mentioned earlier we recognized a $15 million onetime benefit associated with the curtailment of our U.S. retiring medical plan. At the same time we incurred a $20 million charge associated with the remeasurement of our asbestos liability at year end. I will cover both of these items in more detail on the next slide.  And finally we had $7 million of favorability due to other year end liability evaluations. This includes evaluations for such items as workers compensation, long-term disability, and product liability. When you think about the large pluses and minuses coming from the OPEB curtailment gains and the various year-end evaluation adjustments of our accruals they largely net out. As a result we chose not to adjust any of these items out of our reported adjusted EBITDA.  Overall then this was another solid quarter for us. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $80 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.6% which means we were able to successfully manage downside conversion to only 4% in the quarter. If you adjust for the large pluses and minuses that occurred at year-end, our downside conversion would still have been only 9% which is below the normal expected 15% to 20% we told you to expect with changes in revenue.  Now let's turn to slide 15. I want to spend a couple of minutes explaining the two large P&L items that impacted our Q4 results. First, during the fourth quarter we amended our U.S. retiree medical plan for non-union salaried workers by eliminating certain pre-65 medical coverage and life insurance related benefits. The decision to eliminate these benefits was based on a comparison of our benefit programs and coverage levels to those of other companies. We recognize that $15 million benefit associated with these changes which as I noted on the prior slide is included in our adjusted EBITDA results.  Also during the quarter we received our annual evaluations related to 10 year estimate of asbestos liabilities. As part of this evaluation we review each significant assumption impacting the projected liability including trends in claim filings and costs associated with defending claims. Each year end we also update our insurance receivables based on changes in the underlying liability forecast and our assessment of recoverability. These insurance receivables reduced the amount of the net liability that we reflect on the balance sheet and that can mitigate the size of the charge that we recognized when the growth liability increases.  This year's evaluation update resulted in a meaningful increase in our net liability stemming primarily from increasing claim filings, higher projected defence cost, and a write off of a disputed insurance receivable. As a result, we recorded a $20 million charge associated with the year end evaluation of these net asbestos liabilities. We have included this discharge in our reported adjusted EBITDA.  We currently have receivables on the books related to insurance covering 48% of asbestos liabilities. However, it’s important to note that we have insurance policies with other carriers including Zurich, OneBeacon, and Equita (ph) that we believe provide coverage of asbestos related cost. However, because these carriers are disputing whether or not these policies cover our asbestos cost, we are currently in litigation against them.  Although we don’t have any insurance receivables recorded for these policies that have the potential to provide substantial coverage for both our indemnity plans and defence cost. Of course there are no guarantees in litigation. We continue to aggressively pursue solutions to mitigate the company’s financial exposure in this area. Taken together the impact of both the curtailment benefit and the asbestos charge is $5 million unfavorable impact on EBITDA during the quarter.  Now let’s turn to slide 16. For the fourth quarter, total free cash flow was $74 million. This positive result was driven by the impact of receiving $209 million in after tax proceeds from the Eaton settlement. Partially offset by the $134 million prefunding of the next three years of mandatory pensions contributions for our U.S. and UK pension plans. Ignoring the impact of these items, free cash flow for the quarter was roughly breakeven. Slide 17 compares our actual results for fiscal year 2014, to 2013 and the full year guidance we provided during our third quarter earnings call. As you can see, we achieved solid financial performance in 2014. Sales were in line with our most recent guidance and slightly higher than last year. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.3% exceeded the top end of our guidance and was 110 basis points higher than in 2013. Continued execution on our M2016 initiative has allowed us to generate this strong performance and enabled us to overcome headwinds resulting from lower commercial truck production in South America, lower revenue from our defence business, and the loss of earnings from the Suspensys joint venture. Diluted adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 exceeded our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75. This full year result represents 143% increase over the prior year and is due to improvements in adjusted EBITDA as well as lower income tax and cash interest expense. Our full year cash flow of $138 million reflects strong conversion of earnings to cash flow and represents our best free cash flow performance since 2006. Overall we are pleased with our financial results this year. Our 8.3% adjusted EBITDA margin performance confirms our belief that we are solidly on track towards achieving our M2016 margin target of 10%.  Next I’ll review our fiscal year 2015 outlook on slide 18. Based on the demand assumptions Ike highlighted on slide 9, we expect sales in fiscal year 2015 to be approximately $3.8 billion up slightly from 2014. Although we are expecting the North American Class 8 truck market to strengthen by 5% and we see encouraging signs of recovery in India, most of our other key end markets are expected to see production declines next year.  Despite the relatively flat revenue outlook, we expect to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin by 50 to 70 basis points to a range of 8.8% to 9%. We are expecting this margin growth despite both a significant decline in South America productions as well as the $50 million decrease in defence revenue as the SMTD program winds down. We expect to drive this margin growth primarily through continued strong execution of our M2016 initiatives. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 for fiscal year 2015. We expect improvements in adjusted EBITDA, combined with lower interest expense and a relatively low effective tax rate to drive an increase year-over-year.  We are also providing our planning assumption for the effective tax rate for 2015 to help you walk from EBITDA down to after tax earnings. As you can see, we expect income tax expense to be approximately 20% of pre-tax income. Remember, in many jurisdictions including the U.S. and most of Western Europe, we previously established evaluation allowances against our net deferred tax assets. As we generate positive earnings in these jurisdictions we will recognize minimal to no tax expense as long as these evaluation allowances exist. The effective tax rate of 20% is indicative of the fact that we expect to start generating earnings in these jurisdictions.  And finally we expect free cash flow to be approximately $100 million for 2015. Due to combination of a stronger balance sheet and continued margin expansion, we expect the company to begin to generate meaningful cash flow. By achieving our M2016 net debt target two years early and by utilizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets we have reduced the amount of EBITDA required to support our fixed cost structure. This has positioned us to convert more of our earnings in to free cash flow this year and in future periods.  Now I will turn the call back over to Ike to provide closing remarks. 
Ivor J. Evans:  Thanks Kevin. Please turn to slide 19. This year we took actions to majorly improve our EBITDA margin and cash flow. The settlement of our antitrust lawsuit with Eaton and the treasury actions we took during the year enabled us to achieve our net debt target two years early. We have worked hard on customer relationships and demonstrated that with major contract extensions.  We told you we were going to improve our execution and we did. As I said we intend to return value to shareholders. In 2015 we will begin our share buyback, this will be the first time since 2008 that we return value directly to shareholders in the form of the dividend or share buyback.  Looking ahead our guidance for this fiscal year shows continued measurable improvement in EBITDA margin and our earnings per share. And we are on track to achieve our M2016 metrics. With that we will take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed. 
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital:  Yeah, good morning, just wanted a quick housekeeping and operational question and then sort of a balance sheet strategy question. On the quick housekeeping, can you maybe elaborate a bit further on the value added tax accrual. I think what a number of people are trying to get their heads around is was it a more or less a onetime headwind a year ago that showed up in the fourth quarter and what we have now is a cleaner run rate or conversely is this value added tax going to hit at some point in the year and it is just a question of what quarter it gets accrued at?
Kevin Nowlan: Hi Brian, it is Kevin. Yes, the value added tax accrual that we booked in the fourth quarter of last year was about $5 million and it was really a onetime item for catch up of some prior period issues that we discovered in our aftermarket business. So we don’t expect that to impact our run rate going forward.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital:  Okay, the second thing is if you look at the original M2016 plan, you had higher revenues than you are coming in at, they are into basis points margin performance. It just looks like as you have said, your margin performance is better than it would have been in the past given where the revenues are actually coming in due to macro. You know what are the two or three big drivers of that and lots of puts and takes around the world, some markets see a word about incremental margins on growth in North America, other managing the detrimental, how is that?
Ivor J. Evans: I mean, the first point as it relates to margins on the businesses that we are seeing incremental revenue, actually we are converting nicely on those. So, we are pretty confident as we see revenue upticks in certain markets that we are able to convert in line with our normal expectations.  In terms of our margin performance and where we are seeing improvements that is going above and beyond what even we were guiding to in the last couple of quarters, it really relates to the execution across the board of various M2016 initiatives. It is material performance outperforming our expectations. It is labor and burden performance which had a significant out performance this year relative to the expectations. It is pricing and then again it is converting on the incremental revenue we are seeing in markets that are seeing an uptick in revenue.  So, it is really across the board. And as we look into 2015 and our guidance which implies 50 to 70 basis point increase in margin on relatively flat revenue, it is more of the same. 
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital:  Okay and then two quick balance sheet questions. First, payment sort of strategy as well, Meritor WABCO JV, that JV seems to be well positioned in some interesting developments with automatic emergency braking, if you have shown up with tuning product where one truck can follow another truck. Is there any -- look at that business though kind of it is right around 38 million down 4 million year-over-year. Is that a business that could actually see some technology driven growth over the next several years or is it just going to continue be dominated by truck builds and the brakes needed on trucks?
Ivor J. Evans: No, I think technology is a major play Brian in that regard and so the answer to your question is yes. And I mean we are excited about what we are being able to accomplish with our customers with WABCO. So, no absolutely. 
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital:  Okay and then… 
Ivor J. Evans: It’s a technology play and we’ll see more .
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita: And is there backlog, when you talk about the new business, would that include new business that Meritor WABCO is getting because that’s not consolidated revenue and so how should we think about that?
Ivor J. Evans: When we look at our pipeline Brian, we look at our pipeline which by the way we feel really, really good about, that level of business with the joint venture as far as WABCO is not in that. 
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita: Okay so that’s over and above?
Kevin Nowlan: The revenues is not consolidated for Meritor or WABCO so it’s not in our revenue guidance. Obviously performance flows through our JV earnings line and I will say some of the Meritor WABCO sales do got through our aftermarket business so to the extent that we are seeing out performance from a top line perspective within that JV. It does have an impact on our aftermarket business as well but it’s not in a meaningful way from a growth perspective relative to the $500 million revenue growth target.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita: And then final balance sheet question. Now that you’ve delevered a whole bunch, you are ahead of your net debt targets. What are the plans vis-à-vis cash to repurchase shares, potential timing and magnitude and I guess a broader question kind of should we start looking at this business on EPS as opposed to EBITDA?
Kevin Nowlan: Brian as it relates to the plans to repurchase obviously we did come in below our net debt target two years early by about $60 million. Now we do have the mortality table adjustments which have gone into effect and we’ll go into effect for us in 2015. So we have to be cognizant of that. But as we look at that and we look at our expected cash flow generation, we are confident that we are going to start the execution of that buyback program this year in 2015 and complete the execution of that program by the end of fiscal 2016.  As it relates to thinking about us more on an EPS basis, I think we are thinking about that more internally as well and there is a couple of reasons for that. One of the important reasons is because as we buy back shares, you know, we are trying to deliver real value to shareholder that manifest itself in the EPS line item. Second, I think what you see is we are starting to generate a real benefit on these deferred tax balances that have valuation allowances against them, we’re going to see relatively low effective tax rates for the coming years as you see in our 20% effective tax rate guidance of planning assumption. And that’s not reflected in EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA margins but obviously that flows through the benefit -- the benefit of that flows through EPS. So as we think about our performance we are spending a lot more time thinking about EPS as well. 
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita: And does your EPS guidance for 2015 include buybacks?
Kevin Nowlan: It does not so that’s potential upside depending on the timing and the magnitude.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capita: Okay, thanks and great progress on -- and we should call it M2014 at this point?
Ivor J. Evans: Thank you Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky of Sidoti & Company. Please proceed.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Hi, good morning. How are you doing?
Ivor J. Evans: Good morning.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: I was wondering if you can give us maybe quantify what the revenue decline was from South America in defence or perhaps the EBITDA decline just to get a better sense of how much mix went against you in commercial?
Kevin Nowlan: On a year-over-year basis full year, I mean the full year basis its almost $140 million of decline between the two businesses. 
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: 40 million in full year, what was that in the fourth quarter?
Kevin Nowlan: $140 million for the full year both South America and defence combined.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay and as far as the quarter specifically can we just divide that by 4 for kind of a rough approximation maybe a little bit less than that because of the cadence of the draw down on defense? 
Kevin Nowlan: I would tell you it was in the zip code of $35 million to $40 million down sequentially. 
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay and then –
Kevin Nowlan: For the quarter year-over-year, the one quarter year-over-year.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Yes, in the fourth quarter versus last year? 
Kevin Nowlan: Fourth quarter versus last year ballpark is $35 million to $40 million.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay and then I know there’s a lot noise in SG&A so should we look at $75 million as a more realistic or reasonable number for what fourth quarter SG&A would have been?
Kevin Nowlan: I think the way what we have seen is pretty consistently the last few quarters running in around 6.5% to 7% more normalized, is what we are seeing.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay and then finally one other the question just on the deferred tax assets that you have, how much profitability are you going to be generating in I guess the jurisdictions that you haven’t been paying taxes in previously, is it going to be pretty meaningful and I am wondering how long those deferred tax assets will take to get exhausted over the next forecast that you see in your profitability standpoints? Just trying to get a better sense of what the value is of that asset from where you are right now given the improvement of operations in those jurisdictions?
Kevin Nowlan: You’ll be able to see when you look at our 10-K what those deferred tax assets balances are. In terms of generating real profit in those jurisdictions we expect to start generating profit in the bulk of U.S. and Western Europe in 2015, which is the reason you are seeing an effective rate that’s 20% as opposed to something that looks like a U.S. statutory rate of 35%. So, as you think about our earnings performance going forward that 20% effective rate is reflective of the fact that we are getting 0% tax rate on those earnings. As we look forward we have a substantial pipeline of these deferred tax assets, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. So it will take a long-long time to exhaust. Now what we do have is the potential that if we generate earnings in these jurisdictions for the next two to three years consistently and have a forecast that will continue to generate earnings in those jurisdictions, the potential exist that we would reverse the valuation allowance at some point in the future and put those assets back on the book.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Okay, that’s helpful. Then I guess is there any way you can guide us as to how much profitability you will be making in those regions or is that detail you don’t want to disclose?
Kevin Nowlan: At this point we are not disclosing that but I think you can get a sense based on the fact that it’s a 20% effective rate and that a normal tax rate probably looks like something closer to 30% or 35%
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company: Alright, thank you very much, good luck.
Ivor J. Evans: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnappple of Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research: Hi, good morning guys and congrats on a nice quarter. 
Ivor J. Evans: Well, thank you. 
Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research: Ike, I believe you mentioned last quarter that your capacity is around 300,000 unit North American market, but it looks now based on continued strength in orders that builds could certainly be higher than at level on 2015, I know your guidance I think suggest 290 to 300 so, how should we think about your ability and plans to meet demand if higher than previously expected gross scenario plays out next year?
Ivor J. Evans: You are right. We have stated that our capacity is at around that 300,000 unit level Neil. As discussed the production demand and the capacity levels of our customers, and we do this just on almost a daily basis, we really think the industry is at 290,000 to 300,000 market level. So the way we would view this is that the backlog which is by the way is increasing each month along with the strong Class 8 orders for October, we really think it bodes well for us in the second half of our fiscal year. 
Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research: Okay, so you are not worried about missing out on some upside in demand potentially if the market were to heat up a bit more than expected?
Ivor J. Evans: Not really, we really think the market really is around that 300,000 level.
Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research: Alright and then can you remind us of how lower steel prices will impact Meritor, I believe you guys have steel pricing adjustment programs in place of most of your major OEM manufacturers but you just remind us what the lag is and what percent of pass through you are allowed on average?
Kevin Nowlan: We do have pass through mechanisms with the bulk of our OE customers as it relates to steel prices, whether steel prices go up or down we tend to have movements that go along with movements in steel industries. Those tend to lag the actual movements and the changes in our cost by upwards is six to nine months. Now what I will tell you though is what we see in the last six months or so steel has been relatively flat across the globe particularly if you t North America and Europe. So we haven’t seen material movements in steel or something.
Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research: Alright and one last one, I think you mentioned earlier Ike that you guys are still confident you can achieve the 500 million of incremental booked revenue. Could you elaborate on any potential opportunities on the horizon if the target is predicated on you guys, getting a major military contract by JLTB? Thank you.
Ivor J. Evans: No, the pipeline is quite robust and we’re very confident that we think we can deliver that number. And as we have said before it’s really not dependent upon any single program to make that happen. So I mean at this point in time I mean we are still very, very bullish about what our abilities to make that 250 million hidden in 2016 and $500 million run rate. 
Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please proceed.
Colin Langan - UBS: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Any color on the aftermarket trailer margin in terms of how sustainable that is. It looks like a record margin. You kind of indicated that the tax issue is more of a onetime issue last year, how should we think about that going forward?
Kevin Nowlan: Hi Colin, this is Kevin. Keep in mind that the aftermarket in trailer is benefitting now from the fact that we have recast Mascot discontinued operations. So that did help as we recast the earnings for each of the quarters including the fourth quarter this year. As you look at that 14 plus percent margin in Q4 relative to what you might think of as a run rate, it is probably a little bit high because we have some of those yearend liability valuation adjustments I talked about, product liability workers comp. Those things had a little bit more of an impact on the aftermarket and trailer segment. So probably upwards of a point that, that 14% might be high relative to what you might think of as a run rate going forward, at the type of revenue level that they generated in the fourth quarter. But still a pretty high margin relative to historic standards as we jump off.
Colin Langan - UBS: And how much you mentioned Mascot, how much of a drag historically has that been in the business?
Kevin Nowlan: I can tell you in 2014 for instance there was about $29 million of revenue from the business and we generated a loss of about $5 million of operating losses in the business. So that gives you a sense as to what’s been recast out for the full year of the aftermarket in trailer segment.
Colin Langan - UBS: Okay and any thoughts on, you mentioned pension mortality assumptions, is that impacting you this year or is that an issue for next year?
Kevin Nowlan: It will be an issue this year in 2015. I think a couple of weeks ago or few weeks ago the final rules were handed down and so the expectation is that the actuaries for the plans across North America, the actuaries will be using those new mortality tables with some discretion as they have they update valuations for companies at year end.
Colin Langan - UBS: And any sense of how big of a factor that or measurements going to be?
Kevin Nowlan: Well we estimated it previously about six months ago as being about $124 million negative impact or increase in the liability for our pension and our OPEB liabilities.
Colin Langan - UBS: Okay and just one last one, on the buyback I mean what is the authorization, is it still 210 million and how should we think about that over the next two years, if you think about that going equally over that period or will it be lumping or how should we think?
Kevin Nowlan: At this point we are not giving specific guidance or timing on other than to say that we are going to commence the execution of that buyback plan this year, and we’ll complete it by the end of 2016. But we are not going to give any more details of that. You know, the things we are looking at is where we stand relative to our net debt target adjusted for the mortality tables, where free cash flow is coming in, what our liquidity requirements are of being compliant with compliance with our covenants. But at the end of the day we are going to execute the full 210 within the next two fiscal years. And that 210 has been approved by the board and we have the flexibility under our revolving credit agreement to be able to execute on that as well. 
Colin Langan - UBS: Okay, thank you very much and congrats on a good quarter. 
Ivor J. Evans: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Kanowski (ph) of JP Morgan. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. How are you doing, this is David Kanowski on for Ryan. 
Ivor J. Evans: Good morning David.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning guys. Just a question on your margin guidance, it seems to imply a little bit more of a step up in 2016 and in 2015, can you just talk about what may be drives some of that strength into the out year, is that just some of the headwinds from SMTD still showing up in 2015?
Kevin Nowlan: Well keep in mind as we look ahead to 2016 what we said as we expect to be able to achieve 10% EBITDA margin in 2016 as long as revenue is above $4.2 billion. And so part of our expectation is we are going to continue to see execution of material performance, labor and burden performance, pricing actions but we also expecting to still see some market improvement and revenue improvement, a piece of which is market and a piece of which is achieving the $250 million of new business wins that will materialize over the course of the next two years. So we are expecting revenue to be a piece of the equation in converting on that incremental revenue.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and can you just also maybe remind us what your revenue exposure is in China right now and maybe provide a little bit color on the environment and what’s driving some of that uncertainty you mentioned in the slide deck?
Ivor J. Evans: Our revenues in the $150 million range and right now we see the market up slightly which was good. But I mean there is a lot of uncertainty as you know around China but it’s not a large market for us in that sense. So the uncertainty still persists but it’s around $150 million David.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then just one last question, can you just remind us maybe what you expect to pay in pension contributions that is here for 2015 and 2016, I think this would be your pay as you go plans?
Kevin Nowlan: It will be roughly about $10 million. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, alright, thanks a lot guys.
Ivor J. Evans: Thank you. 
Operator: At this time there are no additional questions in the queue and I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Please proceed.

Analysts: Colin Langan - UBS Brian Johnson - Barclays Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Kirk Ludtke - CRT Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti Chris Reenock - Citigroup 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2014 Meritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ian, and I'll be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, the call is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, sir.
Carl Anderson:  Thank you, Ian. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Ike Evans, Meritor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc. It's protected by U.S. and International Copyright Law and may not be rebroadcast without the express written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to Slide two for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our Web site. Now I'll turn the call over to Ike.
Ike Evans:  Thank you, Carl, and good morning. Please turn to Slide three. We reported another strong quarter driven by our M2016 initiatives. Despite continuing softness in all of our markets outside North America, we delivered an 8.1% EBITDA margin largely due to our continuous focus on reducing net materials costs and improving labor and burden performance. On year-to-date basis, we're demonstrating real year-over-year improvement. Although not shown on the slide, sales for the first nine months increased 63 million or 2%, EBITDA increased 37 million or 19% for a conversion rate of 59%. And EBITDA margin year-to-date is 8%, up 120 basis points compared to the prior year. Cash flow has also been strong year-to-date, and we expect to end the year with the strongest cash flow performance since 2010. Other third quarter highlights include a signed MoU with Volvo, that covers our global axle business, the antitrust settlement with Eaton, the announcement of an equity repurchase program, and for the second consecutive quarter we have increased our full year earnings guidance. We're increasing our guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS from continuing operations and free cash flow for the year. Kevin will provide you with more details, but the increase in our full year expectations for earnings reflects the strength of our third quarter performance driven by our M2016 initiatives, some of which I'll highlight for you in a moment. Slide four shows the sequential comparison of our results. Revenue increased 24 million from the second fiscal quarter to 986 million. Higher revenues from our truck and aftermarket businesses in North America partially offset lower sales in South America and the defense business which had a negative mixed impact on our earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was 80 million, up 2 million from the prior quarter. Continued improvements in net material and labor and burden performance were offset by the unfavorable mix impact I just mentioned. Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat from the prior year at 8.1%. Adjusted income from continuing operations was 28 million, up from 21 million in the second quarter, due to the lower interest expense and higher adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.28, an increase of $0.06 quarter-over-quarter.
 : On Slide five, we provide you with more detail on the non-binding MoU with Volvo. As most of you know, our contracts for Europe and South America are scheduled to expire in October of this year. Based on the MoU executed in July, we expect to sign a new long-term agreement prior to the expiration of our current contract. With the new agreement, we'll provide axles to Volvo for seven years in Europe and South America, and axles and drivelines for four years in North America. Well, that's all the detail we can provide at this time. We're encouraged to have a solid path forward in our partnership with Volvo. This business will contribute to our M2016 revenue target that we'll update in November. Please turn to Slide six. An important part of our M2016 growth strategy is to win new customer business that drives profitable growth. We were recently awarded new axle business with Kamaz Motor in India. Kamaz builds vehicles for applications ranging from mining to construction and heavy duty infrastructure projects. Beginning December of this calendar year Meritor will supply this new customer with fully-dressed tandem axles. We're also pleased to finalize a long-term agreement with Hino. With this agreement, we'll supply our second largest medium-duty truck customer with axles and brakes through March of 2017. Let's now move to Slide seven. Largely driven by our intense focus on M2016 initiatives, we're getting healthier in every area addressed by our plan, and that is driving better financial performance. Operational excellence is an important piece. So, we'd like to give you a glimpse into how we're building our operational strength with engaged teams. Our safety, quality and delivery metrics are better than it had been in recent history. Last month, I made an impromptu trip to our largest axle plant in North America to congratulate them on achieving 500,000 hours, which is equal to about six months without a recordable injury. The plant also received awards in the state of North Carolina for being 50% below the state safety industry standard. We want our people to go home the same way they came to work. And through training, employee involvement, improved levels of machine guarding the communication we're achieving a high success rate. With regard to quality, seven of our plants are in PACCAR's 50 PPM quality awards for 2103, and we received the DTNA Masters of Quality award for the same timeframe. Our PPMs in North America truck are the lowest they had been in six months, but I can tell you we're still looking for ways to get better. As for delivery, we achieved a 98.9% on-time delivery in North America for the month of June. This is our best on-time delivery in six months, which also happens to be our highest production month for rear axles in that same timeframe. I also want to spend a minute on labor and burden, because it's a great example of how we're building on one of our inherent strengths. We have 6400 production employees and 300,000 part numbers delivery that require consistently perfect coordination. We're achieving this through a multidisciplinary cross-functional team effort. Engineers are working diligently to maximize uptime and throughput. One example, this is the work they've done to eliminate a heat treat process; by employing controlled cooling technology to manufacture drive pinions for gear sets, we're eliminating the need to heat treat without impacting quality or durability. This will shorten lead time, reduce inventory, and it's expected to save approximately 400,000 annually.
 : The opinions of every team member matter. We've had thousands of employee suggestions that have contributed to our labor and burden savings. With closely aligned and engaged cross-functional teams, our metrics in these areas are better than ever, and that translates to financial improvement. Slide eight is a recap of the facts related to the antitrust settlement with Eaton. We're reaching a settlement that we believe was in the best interest of the company and our shareholders. Another terms of the agreement, Eaton paid 500 million to ZF Meritor resulting a net after-tax proceeds to Meritor of 209 million. In the last decade, only five other defendants have actually paid private antitrust claims of more than 500 million. Proceeds will be used primarily to pre-fund the next three years of mandatory pension contributions in the United States and the United Kingdom.
 : Once we achieve our target, Meritor's Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase of up to 210 million of equity or equity-linked securities. We anticipate completing the entire 200 million repurchase program by the end of fiscal year 2016. Please turn to Slide nine for a slightly revised market outlook from last quarter. Our forecast for Class 8 trucks in North America has increased by 5000 units, for a new range of 270,000 to 280,000 units. A healthy backlog-to-build ratio and low cancellation rates are two of several positive indicators. While the summer months tend to be slow for orders, we're continuing to see a high level of interest in equipment purchase with June orders being up 41% from June of last year. We believe the North American truck production will remain strong into the beginning of fiscal year 2015. In South America, we're reducing our medium and heavy duty truck production forecast for the second consecutive quarter. We now anticipate production to be in the range of 145,000 to 155,000 units, down 10,000 from last quarter. While our inventory levels are beginning to decrease due to OEM shutdowns, the region continues to experience economic headwinds and restrictions related to FINAME financing. The consumer confidence index reached its lowest point in five years, this June. As a result, you should anticipate that we'll take the necessary actions to manage our cost structure appropriately. When we provide our fiscal year update in November, we'll share with you an overall look at the markets for fiscal 2015. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin for more detail on our financials.

Kevin Nowlan:  Thanks, Ike, and good morning everyone. On today's call, I'll review our third quarter financial results and take you through our updated 2014 guidance. On Slide 10, you'll see our third quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $986 million in the quarter, down slightly year-over-year by $7 million or 1%. This decrease is due to lower commercial truck production in South America and lower revenue from our defense business as FMTV's production volume continues to step down. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in North American commercial truck production and higher revenue from our aftermarket and trailer segment. Gross margin increased $14 million primarily due to $12 million warranty contingency that was booked in the third quarter of 2013. Excluding this, gross margin increased by $2 million despite the decrease in revenue, including the year-over-year step-down in FMTV production. This improvement was driven by continued execution of M2016 net material, labor and burden initiative. SG&A was $13 million lower in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. The decrease includes the $20 million recovery of current and prior year legal fees associated with the Eaton antitrust settlement. This is partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals and higher legal defense cost associated with asbestos-related claims. Next, earnings in our minority-owned affiliates were $201 million in the quarter compared to $15 million in the prior year. The increase was due to $190 million of affiliate income related to the gain recognized from Eaton antitrust settlement. Excluding this, earnings in our minority-owned affiliates decreased by $4 million year-over-year primarily due to the sale of our Suspensys joint venture, which was sold in July of last year and is no longer contributing to our earnings. Interest expense is $23 million lower in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year. The decrease is related to $19 million loss on debt extinguishment that was recognized in the third quarter of last year associated with a repurchase of debt securities due in 2015. The decrease is also due to lower cash interest resulting from the capital market transactions executed last quarter. Moving down the income statement, income tax expense increased $10 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a $9 million tax benefit that was recognized in the third quarter of 2013 associated with the settlement of certain Canadian pension plans. And finally, adjusted income from continuing operations was $28 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to adjusted income of $33 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the same period last year. The impacts of Meritor from the Eaton antitrust settlement is excluded from adjusted income. Slide 11 shows third quarter sales and segment EBITDA for commercial truck and industrial. Sales in the third quarter of 2014 were $761 million down $23 million or 3% from the same period last year. Segment EBITDA was $55 million, a decrease of $12 million year-over-year. The decrease in segment EBITDA was primarily due to lower revenue and the unfavorable mix impact associated with lower commercial vehicle demand in South America and the step down in our FMTV business. Next, on Slide 12, we summarize the aftermarket and trailer segment financial results. Sales were $259 million, up $21 million from last year. The increase is primarily due to higher revenue across all parts of the segment. Segment EBITDA was $26 million in the third quarter and was up $1 million compared to last year. The EBITDA benefit of higher revenue was partially offset by the loss of earnings from our previously divested Suspensys joint venture. Now, let's move to Slide 13, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q2 to Q3. Walking from the $78 million of EBITDA generated in our second quarter, we had $2 million of unfavorable impact on EBITDA due to volume, mix and pricing despite higher consolidated revenue. The favorable impact of higher revenue in North America and our aftermarket and trailer segment was not enough to offset the unfavorable mix impact of lower South America and defense sales. Next, we continue to execute on our M2016 objectives of achieving that material labor and burden savings. These initiatives provided an incremental $2 million net benefit this quarter even after giving consideration to modestly higher steel prices in North America. And finally, we have another net increase in EBITDA of $2 million. Overall, this is another solid quarter for us. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $80 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%. As Ike pointed out, we continue to execute on our M2016 cost reduction initiative to drive margin performance, while at the same time managing through the dynamics of our global end markets. Now, let's turn to Slide 14. For the third quarter total free cash was $71 million representing a $43 million improvement over the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by lower pension contribution and lower cash taxes. We are pleased with our free cash flow performance this quarter. This result reflects the best third quarter free cash flow performance in five years. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2014 outlook on slide 15. Our fiscal year 2014 sales guidance remains unchanged at a range of approximately $3.75 billion to $3.8 billion. Although the North American class 8 market is strengthening, we are seeing continued headwinds in Brazil. As a result we are keeping our revenue forecast flat compared to the guidance we issued in the prior quarter. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance from approximately 7.7% to a range of 7.7% to 7.9%. The increase in margin guidance reflects solid execution of our M2016 cost reduction initiatives during the first three quarters of the year as well as our conversion on additional sales in the North American and European commercial truck markets. Our year-to-date margin performance indicates that we are on track to achieve a solid full year adjusted EBITDA margin result, the keys is on the path to achieving our M2016 margin target of 10%. With this said, as you think about the fourth quarter from an earnings perspective, it's important to keep several things in mind. We expect overall revenue to decline sequentially from Q3 due to the European summer holidays. We also continue to expect headwinds in two of our higher margin businesses as the South American truck market remains soft and FMTV production continues to wine down. In addition, we receive updated yearend liability evaluations in September. Any adjustments required as a result of these evaluations would be recorded in the fourth quarter and could impact margin performance. We are also raising our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a range of $0.65 to $0.75 for fiscal year 2014, which is an increase of $0.15 compared to our prior guidance. This increase is primarily driven by the expected improvements in adjusted EBITDA and lower tax expense. We're also taking up our total free cash flow guidance from a range of $0 to $25 million to a range of $50 million to $75 million. The increase is a result of the strong free cash flow performance so far this year combined with our expectations for the fourth quarter. We are confident in our ability to deliver this free cash flow guidance which would represent our strongest full year free cash flow performance in four years. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Ike to provide closing remarks.
Ike Evans: Thank you, Kevin. Let's turn to Slide 16. I said at the beginning of the call, our financial performance this quarter was strong, and our year-to-date performance clearly demonstrates that we are focused in the right areas. Our alignment around M2016 targets includes all areas of our global organization. Today, we discuss just a few examples of the work we are doing to continually improve our operational performance. I am proud of our teams around the world who are working together closely with our customers to improve the company and to meet our requirement. We're winning new business and the Meritor brand in strong and growing. This quarter we signed an MoU with Volvo in anticipation of extending our actual supply agreements with our largest global customer. And in July, we entered into a new contract with Kamaz in India and extended our partnership with Hino for another three years. You'll remember last quarter we signed a new four-year agreement with Daimler Trucks, North America. Although certain international markets remain soft, we are executing and converting on the F-Cycle and Class 8 trucks in North America. We're confident and we have momentum. As Kevin told you, increasing our guidance reflects good execution and effective cost reduction initiatives combined with strong conversion on incremental sales. Our year-to-date performance demonstrates that we are getting real traction to achieve sustained improvement in our fashion or performance. We remain on track with our M2016 objectives. And with that, we'll take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And that question comes from Colin Langan. Please go ahead, Colin.
Colin Langan - UBS: Great, thanks for taking my question. Any color on how we should think about the profit impact from the change in the Volvo contract. I mean, is that something that we'll see rather immediately once the final contract is settled or is that something that may be a benefit over time because my understanding is that the European contracts have generally … 
Ike Evans: Colin, we spent over a year working with Volvo on this MoU. And we both expect to sign the long-term agreement prior to the expiration of this contract. However, due to the confidentiality provisions of the MoU, we can't provide you with any more detail. The bottom line though is we're confident, we have a solid path forward with this important global customer. And our focus is to continue to providing them with superior quality delivery and products that help [to freight] (ph) their trucks in a regional market. And that's as much as we can say at this point in time.
Colin Langan - UBS: Any color on prior contract, so the changes occur immediately or if they usually face them?
Ike Evans: I can't say any more than what I've already said, Colin.
Colin Langan - UBS: Okay.
Kevin Nowlan: Colin, this is Kevin. As you look historically, I mean we've had -- this has been a 10-year agreement with Volvo in Europe, so we haven't had a whole lot of history in terms of that. But I think the expectation is that we would execute the long-term binding agreement at the end of this -- at the maturity of this contract, which is the beginning of October of 2014. And the new contract would kick in after that. That's the expectation.
Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. That makes sense. Okay. Any color on the aftermarket, trailer business is up 9% year-over-year, what was driving that strong growth in that segment? Is that a market or is that market share?
Ike Evans: It's primary market, Colin. We had really strong markets.
Kevin Nowlan: And that's inclusive of trailer, which our trailer market has been up and even our European aftermarket business which is up as well. So it's really across the entire segment.
Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. And just one last one; and you talked about it a bit, why the expected slowdown into Q4, that's just the normal seasonal pattern or anything else going on in Q4?
Kevin Nowlan: Well, the first thing to keep in mind, yes, there is some seasonality there. Remember Europe right now is shutdown. And so we lose several weeks of production in the fourth quarter. So that has a big revenue impact on us as we go from Q3 to Q4 and obviously we lose conversion on that. Second, we do have a little bit more step down going into Q4 from the defense business and then of course South America remains soft. So I think those are the key drivers that we are focused on as we think about why our implied Q4 guidance would be softer than where we ended Q3.
Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. Thank you very much.
Kevin Nowlan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. We have another question for you. This one comes from the line of Brian Johnson. Please go ahead, Brian.
Brian Johnson - Barclays: Yes, good morning. A couple of questions about these results and where they get you towards M2016; the first is, you had very good incrementals overall in the commercial vehicle segment. And you flagged the two headwinds, defense and South America and then the tailwind in North America. If you look within North America, were you comfortable with the incrementals that you were getting on what I assume was a revenue increase there given the 8% increase? And are you comfortable that as North America continues to grow, you can continue to bring that to the bottom line versus the problem Meritor had in the last up cycle of having premium freight over time and others actually detract from profits.
Ike Evans: Brian, the answer is, yes, we're converting successfully. As we've committed before we said we will convert at least 15% rate on incremental revenue and we are executing on that. And we expect to continue to do so. Kevin, I don't know if you want to add any more to that.
Kevin Nowlan: I think that's right. And frankly that part of it as we think about. The reason I think Q3 came in a little bit stronger, we had really good material labor and burden performance in the quarter which overcame the steel. But we also had good conversion on the North American sales I think stronger than what we've historically seen when we were in the midst of an upturn. As we stay here today, we are not prepared to declare victory. We have a long way to go through this upturn, but I think we are pretty pleased with the incrementals that we've achieved today.
Ike Evans: And Brian, if you remember in my comments in the call, we are delivering basically world class quality and virtually 100% on time delivery.
Brian Johnson - Barclays: And we will probably hear more in the fall about this. But as you just look at the M2016 earnings kind of implied margin guide, do you need the North American Class 8 truck market to get back to 320 to 340 and further strengthening in Europe, Brazil, India and China, or is there enough momentum on the cost side of M2016 and perhaps that's what you are getting out of restructuring your European business and contracts that you don't need to get the revenue number there to get that kind of numbers you were talking about.
Kevin Nowlan: It's a good question, Brian. I think where we sit today -- we are not necessarily counting on North America to be sitting at a 300,000 Class 8 market. We generally use some of the services; LMC, FTR and others across the globe to assess what we think the markets look like. As you know, when we talked about our 10% margin guidance, we talked about it in the past as needing to hit 4.5 billion of revenue, which fundamentally, what's underlying that is recovery in markets like South America, India, China, Europe, more so the North America. In fact I think North America given where we sit today versus a couple of years from now could be a little bit lower at least on the truck side. I think as we sit here today, that 4.5 billion that we've laid out is probably -- it needs those markets to come back, and who knows where that's really going to be two years from now. But I'd tell you given where we sit today, we believe that we can achieve 10% margin even if we fall short of that 4.5 billion target, and I think will provide a little bit more clarity on that when we get into November timeframe on the earnings call.
Brian Johnson - Barclays: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, Brian. We have another question for you. This was from Patrick Archambault at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Patrick.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a good result. I am going to start by pushing my luck on the Volvo question. I guess is it at least safe to say certainly you would never have agreed to a contract which at least didn't keep the profitability similar or better. I think we can comfortably assume that just given how much of a priority this was?
Ike Evans: Well, Patrick, thank you for -- it was a good quarter for us. Really it's not a delivery to be able to say anymore than I've already with regard to Volvo. Other than that we are both our companies are excited about the prospects I moving forward. I mean this is seven years for Europe and South America and four years for North America for axles and drive lines as well. So this is exciting. This is our largest global customer. It's 27% of our sales. So I mean we are excited about this as overall Volvo.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: And I'm going to have to push my luck again. On the four years for North America is that I mean at least just structurally in terms of the way things are framed, is that kind of four years and then the contract is up for re-bid or renewal or is like is there an in-sourcing that happens after four years for the North America piece?
Ike Evans: At this point who knows four years from now, but at this point in time Volvo and we've sat down and we view ourselves as a long-term commitment on our part or their part to be their actual driveline supplier for North America.
Kevin Nowlan: I'd add to that, Patrick, keep in mind that the North American agreement actually wasn't scheduled to mature until 2015, the spring of 2015. And as the parties were moving forward in the discussions around Europe and South America and Australia, we decided it was in the best interest of both companies to address that contract now even though it could have ordinarily waited a little bit longer. So we are extending four years from next spring, which is basically 2019. And I think that's indicative of the strong relationship we have with Volvo right now.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Got you. Okay. Thanks for the color. On a couple of other ones from me, just in terms of FMTV, can you just remind us of the cadence? Now it does step-down sequentially in your fourth fiscal quarter, are we at kind of close to zero at that point or just can you remind us of sort of when that eventually peters out and then actually if you could also just refresh us on the timing of some of the other potential opportunities to replace it like the HMMWV Recap and such.
Kevin Nowlan: Let me start with FMTV and talk about that, and then I'll turn it over to Ike to talk about the future programs. With FMTV we're seeing another sequential step down here in Q4. If you look at Q3, been on a year-over-year basis were down almost 60% in that business. And for the full year we expect to be down about $100 million FMTV and revenue. As we go into next year we expect that we will have roughly level production release the first few quarters of 2015 roughly the same as what our Q4 production is. So I think you are going to see a step down in Q4 and then probably flat for several quarter before the program ends. Remember there is 949 more vehicle sets to be produced in '15. And again that's indicative of basically several quarters of flat and then probably falling off at the end of the year next year.
Ike Evans: Patrick, we continue to support both the marine's and the army's developmental programs as far as HMM-WV Recap or the HMMWV Recap program is concerned. On July 28th the government indicated that the Marine Corps is analyzing its acquisition strategies to enable mission achievement within budgetary constraints. We'll closely follow updates on this evaluation, but the bottom line for Meritor is as we've said in the past that our M2016 targets are not really dependent on any single program. We have a very robust pipeline. So if this doesn't materialize we will still be in good shape. But however we wanted to, but we can't give any further update because we don't know other than what I just told you. As far as the JLTV program, it's on track with final selection still expected, middle of next year. The government has issued a draft request for purchase as planned at the end of -- did it at the end of June. We provided our response to our partner, Lockheed Martin. And we've already indicated that the (indiscernible) is on schedule for down selecting the summer of 2015. So that's the status of both of those.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Terrific, and one last one if I may, just the reason for the decline in CapEx … 
Kevin Nowlan: Yes. I don't think there is any significant reason. I think as I talked about on prior quarters, we tend to have some lumpy CapEx projects from time-to-time. And some of those projects have either not happened this year or on the timing that we expected. I think the other thing to keep in mind if we manage the CapEx pretty closely. We are not looking to cut CapEx, it hasn't been our strategy. But we need to make sure that the CapEx projects that we have in the hopper meet the return that's required to deliver a good return to our shareholders. So I think you can expect some lumpiness, and I think as you think about us going forward, 2% of sales is a good way to model us as you think about going forward even though we're running a little late on that so far this year.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Okay, it makes sense. Thanks a lot guys for taking my questions, and congrats again on a very good result.
Ike Evans: Thank you.
Kevin Nowlan: Thank you, Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. Give me two seconds. And Kevin, we have another question for you. This is from Irina Hodakovsky from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc: Good morning everyone.
Kevin Nowlan: Good morning.
Ike Evans: Good morning.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc: I had a question for you on the SG&A line, and Kevin you mentioned a $23 million recovery in legal fees, and increase in incentives and legal fees for asbestos. Overall, it seems if I add that 20 million that came as a substantial step-up in SG&A as a percentage of sales, I'm wondering if you can give us any guidance on how we should view this going forward into 2015.
Kevin Nowlan: And I think -- you're absolutely right. So, of you strip out the $20 million from SG&A associated with Eaton, our SG&A was up about $7 million. And there is a couple of drivers of that, one is we did have some increased incentive compensation accruals as we look at how we're tracking relative to our plan, which is we're tracking fairly well. Second, we did have some incremental asbestos related to legal defense cost. That's both defending cases as well as we're going after a couple of insurance companies with trials upcoming in the fall to allow us to obtain insurance coverage for claims that are coming out in six, seven, eight, nine years from now. So that's a couple of the key movers in the SG&A line that were negative.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc: And so they found isolated to the 3Q and we really shouldn't expect them to go on into 2015?
Kevin Nowlan: I think those were both probably a little higher than what we'd have expected. In incentive compensation I think we're doing a little bit of a true-up given our performance coming in a little bit stronger. The defense cost, I think we have to monitor. It really depends on what cases are going to trial, what cases we need to defend in the near-term. So it's something we keep a close eye on.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc: Thank you guys very much, and congratulations on a great quarter.
Ike Evans: Thank you.
Kevin Nowlan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we have another question for you. This is from the line of Kirk Ludtke at CRT Capital Group. Please go ahead, Kirk.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT: Good morning everyone.
Ike Evans: Good morning.
Kevin Nowlan: Good morning.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT: I might have missed it, but could you quantify the new business that you've won in the quarter and where you stand with respect to the $500 million target in your M2016?
Ike Evans: We're going to dimension that on an annual basis, and we'll do that at the November earnings call. So, the Kamaz win is actually a contributor to the $120 million that we've earned today. It was actually a pretty good contract for us from a revenue perspective. The Hino contract is an extension. So that one, you won't us see counting towards the 500 million, but the Kamaz one does count, we're not going to dimension win-by-win, but we'll dimension it in aggregate when we get to the end of the year, November.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT: Okay, thank you. And with respect to Volvo, you have an MoU, and you haven't revised your 2016 target, so is it safe to say that the MoU is consistent with the targets?
Ike Evans: The answer there is due to the confidentiality provisions of the MoU we can't provide you any more details on that.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT: Okay, it's worth a try. And then, with respect to the industry, in North America, are you seeing any bottlenecks anywhere? It doesn't sound like you see any bottlenecks in your system, but do you see any bottlenecks away from you?
Ike Evans: We work hard on this. As we said, our capacity is around 300,000 North American markets. We work daily with our customers and our supply base to ensure that we were able to meet our customer's requirements. We're tracking all our commodities and we just stay on top of this. And the good news is we're converting, and we had 98.9% delivery rate in June. So I think we're delivering to our customers. I can't comment as to whether any other suppliers out there might be having pinch points.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT: Okay. I appreciate it, thank you.
Ike Evans: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Kirk. We have another question for you. This one is from Robert Kosowsky of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: Yes, just a quick question on the Kamaz business. Does this bring over some of the off-highway technology you have in China over into India, and do you see India being a bigger launch pad for off-highway, and where is that right now?
Ike Evans: Not really, Robert. It's off existing platforms and it's a neat opportunity for us.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Okay, thank you, Robert. And we have another question. This one is from Itay Michaeli from Citigroup.
Chris Reenock - Citigroup: Hi, thank you. This is Chris Reenock for Itay. I just had a question on margin. You talked about H2 in general should be a weak result, just based on South America and defense, but you still delivered in Q3 an 8.1 really strong margin. Just wondering besides the revenue's sequential step-down, what else are drivers of potential weakness in Q4?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, I'd say outside of revenue, which is a big one because we do lose a lot of significant amount of revenue when Europe shuts down and we lose the contribution on that, so that's a big piece. But the other pieces are South America continuing to remain soft. It's our military business taking another step-down going from Q3 to Q4 as we've talked about it in the past as the high margin business. And then, we do have some hedge for some potential if we have any year end accrual adjustments. As you know, every year we do liability assessments, actuarial evaluations on some of our longer data liabilities, and sometimes those result in adjustments that can impact margin. So I think those are the three things in addition to revenue that we think about as potential headwinds in the fourth quarter.
Chris Reenock - Citigroup: Okay, great. And so again, understandably South America was weak, just wondering if you -- if and when you anticipate a flattening there and how you're looking at the region going forward?
Ike Evans: We don't know. We don't have a crystal ball. All the economic indicators are not really good. So what we're going to do, we'll take the appropriate cost structure actions that we needed to do to manage effectively in this region, but no one has a crystal ball as to when this is going to return.
Kevin Nowlan: And so I think it will be -- have some uncertainty as we head into '15, and I think we'll give some more updated guidance in November as how we think about '15 is playing out. But I think we do -- it's important to keep in mind we do think longer term we're pretty bullish on the South American market even though we're going through some tough times right now. It's been a good market for us, if you look versus 10 years ago where this market was I mean it's more than doubled. So, it's a good market, lot of good opportunity up there and we make good money.
Ike Evans: If you think about just six months ago, our customers and our sales, we were bullish on this market. So the market can be volatile. It can go down and it can come back just as quickly.
Chris Reenock - Citigroup: Okay, great. Thank you, and congrats.
Ike Evans: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this stage. Therefore, I'll hand back to Carl Anderson for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
Carl Anderson: Thanks, Ian. We appreciate everybody's participation in today's call. If you do happen to have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact me directly. And this concludes Meritor's third quarter 2014 earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conversation, gentlemen. This concludes the presentation, and you may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 Meritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Glen, and I will be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, sir.
Carl D. Anderson: Thank you, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Ike Evans, Meritor's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides accompanying today's call are available at meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Ike.
Ivor J. Evans: Thank you, Carl, and good morning. Please turn to Slide 3. Our second fiscal quarter was characterized by solid execution as demonstrated by the financial results you see in our press release. Across the company, we're fully aligned to our M2016 and determined to achieve our targets. That determination is reflected in our performance again this quarter. I continue to be impressed with the commitment of our leadership team and all of our employees to make Meritor a premier company for our shareholders and customers. Higher revenues combined with continued cost performance improved our EBITDA margin by 170 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Total free cash flow was $9 million representing the best second quarter results since 2010. We also successfully executed several capital market transactions this quarter. At our analyst event in February, we told you that our priorities were to maintain strong liquidity, to assess our liability structure and prudently manage our debt maturity profile. The actions we completed in the quarter support each of these priorities and ultimately provide us with greater financial flexibilities. With regard to our outlook for the fiscal year, we're pleased to announce that we are increasing guidance for revenue and earnings. With our first half performance, combined with expected higher revenues in the second half, we've increased our guidance for both adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. As you know, a major element of M2016 is winning new business. On Slide 4, you'll see that we reinforced our partnership with Daimler Trucks North America this quarter by completing a new 4-year agreement. This contract represents an important partnership with a long-term customer, our largest in North America and second-largest globally. With the agreement, we retain standard position for air drum brakes and drivelines and hold our strong optional position for front and rear axles. In addition to the DTNA agreement, we also -- we won new business with Daimler India. For this award we will supply Daimler with our MS-145 axle for its BharatBenz rigid truck. The 145 is Meritor's highest volume axle for global applications. It was the primary axle used in North American linehaul for more than 20 years and is highly adaptable for a variety of applications. We look forward to continuing the relationship we've enjoyed for many years with Daimler and we are working together on future business opportunities. On Slide 5 is a comparison of our sequential performance. Revenue increased $55 million to 6% quarter-over-quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes across both segments in North and South America, partially offset by lower volumes in Europe as a result of the first quarter pre-buy. Adjusted EBITDA was $78 million, up $8 million from the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.1%, an increase of 40 basis points, mainly driven by higher revenue and our continued focus on reducing costs. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $21 million, up $9 million from the first quarter. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.22, an increase of $0.10. Free cash flow was $9 million compared to an outflow of $16 million in the prior quarter. Let's turn to Slide 6 for a revised market outlook for the fiscal year. Arrows on the chart indicate the segments where we revised our forecast. In North America, our forecast has increased 20,000 units for a new range of 65,000 to 75,000 (sic) [ 265,000 to 275,000 ] Class 8 trucks. As you know, orders over the past 4 months have shown considerable strength year-over-year. Despite March orders being down close to 6% sequentially, they were still up more than 24% from March of last year. The Class 8 order board is at a 22-month high at 4.9 months. As a result, OEMs are increasing production rates. Moving to China, you may remember that our revenue in the region was down approximately 40% last year. Coming off that low base, we now expect revenue to increase 10% over the prior year, as inventories that were consumed by OEs are being replenished. However, we do remain cautious on this market. In South America, we are anticipating a meaningful decline in demand expectations for the second half, resulting in a reduction to our forecast for the medium and heavy-duty truck market of 20,000 units. Our updated forecast is now for 155,000 to 165,000 medium and heavy-duty trucks. As we moved into the second quarter, OEs built up inventory in anticipation of higher demand, but with continued economic headwinds and uncertainty, that demand is not materializing, causing OEs to decrease production and take days out of their schedules. Inflation of approximately 6%, low GDP projections and increasing market interest rates are continuing to deteriorate consumer and business sentiment. The World Cup, which starts on June 12, is also expected across some level of production disruption, and the election in October is creating further uncertainty. In Defense, new prime contractors will be selected for the engineering, manufacturing and design phase of the Humvee program in August or September of this year. As a result, we expect the final contract award to be in September of 2015. The Marine Corps has established its acquisition quantity to be roughly 1,600 vehicles and has increased the acquisition price from $110,000 to $145,000 per vehicle. The JLTV program is on track with a final selection also expected in late 2015. Please turn to Slide 7. As we watched demand increase in North America over the past 4 months, we've initiated actions to ensure we're prepared to support our customers at higher volumes. We're taking a forward-looking approach that includes global coordination and detailed market reviews with our customers. We've improved our operating efficiency and capabilities to support our customers. We've invested in our precision forging presses and taken steps to upgrade machining and assembly operations in the United States and Mexico. We're working with suppliers to mitigate risk associated with key commodities, and we're strategically building inventory to avoid pinch points that we've dealt with in the past. With the detailed plan we have in place, we're confident in our ability to execute well. Our objectives are to maintain high customer satisfaction and delivery rates while converting on additional sales in line with normal levels. You will remember that in the first quarter of 2014, axle production in Western Europe was up 30% year-over-year. Using the approach I just outlined, we successfully avoided -- we successfully achieved excellent delivery performance and managed cost for strong conversion. We expect to have the same results in North America. Now I'll turn over the call to Kevin for a more detailed review of our second quarter results. Kevin?
Kevin Nowlan: Thanks, Ike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I'll review our second quarter financial results and take you through our updated 2014 guidance. On Slide 8, you'll see our second quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales were $962 million in the quarter, up year-over-year by $54 million or 6%. This increase was due to higher commercial truck production in all of our geographic regions, but most notably in North America and Europe. In addition, revenue was slightly higher in our Aftermarket & Trailer segment. Our only business that was lower on a year-over-year basis was Defense, as FMTV revenue stepped down by nearly 50%. Gross margin increased $21 million year-over-year due to the continued execution of our M2016 initiatives. This improvement was driven by conversion on higher revenues and continued net material, labor and burden performance, and keep in mind that this increase in gross margin was achieved despite the significant year-over-year step down in FMTV volumes. SG&A was $1 million higher in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. However, as we look at SG&A as a percentage of revenue, we actually experienced a slight decrease on a year-over-year basis. This is the result of our continued focus on managing the overall cost structure of the business. You should expect this disciplined approach to continue even as revenue increases. This quarter's restructuring costs were $9 million lower than the same period a year ago. As you may recall, in the second quarter of 2013, we recognized an $11 million expense primarily for employee severance costs associated with our segment reorganization and our Asia Pacific realignment. Earnings in our minority-owned affiliates were $9 million in the quarter, down slightly from the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to $4 million of lower earnings from our Suspensys joint venture, which was sold in July of last year and is no longer contributing to our earnings. Interest expense was $23 million higher in the second quarter of '14 driven by the loss on debt extinguishment relating to the repurchase of our 10 5/8% notes due in 2018. You'll note that we have included an add-back of $21 million in adjusted income from continuing operations associated with this loss. Later, I'll provide more detail on what these transactions mean for our debt maturity profile. Income tax expense increased $2 million in the second quarter of 2014. This increase was driven by higher earnings in jurisdictions where we recognized tax expense. In addition, no tax benefit was recognized on the loss on debt extinguishment incurred during the quarter since this loss was recorded in the U.S. where we currently have a valuation allowance. After adding back the debt extinguishment loss, adjusted income from continuing operations was $21 million or $0.22 per share compared to $6 million or $0.06 per share in the same period last year. Slide 9 shows second quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck & Industrial. Sales in the second quarter of 2014 were $763 million, up $51 million or 7% from the same period last year. Segment EBITDA was $57 million, an increase of $20 million year-over-year. This represents 39% upside EBITDA conversion due primarily to improved net material labor and burden performance and higher volumes across all of our commercial vehicle markets. These positives more than offset the negative mix headwind associated with the step down in our FMTV business. Next, on Slide 10, we've summarized the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. Sales were $232 million, up $8 million from last year. The increase was primarily due to higher European sales and North American pricing initiatives executed over the past year. Segment EBITDA was $22 million in the second quarter and was flat compared to last year. The EBITDA benefit of higher revenue was offset by the loss of earnings year-over-year from our previously divested Suspensys joint venture, as well as certain inventory reserves booked in our second quarter. Now let's move to Slide 11, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from Q1 to Q2. Walking from the $70 million of EBITDA generated in our first quarter, we had $17 million more of EBITDA due to volume, mix and pricing. This is primarily driven by higher revenue in both segments across North and South America. This increase was partially offset by lower revenue in Europe as production levels stepped down following the Euro 6 pre-buy that occurred during our first fiscal quarter. We also executed pricing actions in our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, which contributed sequentially to our results. Next, you recall that in the first quarter, we recorded a $5 million accrual reduction associated with a change we made to reduce benefits provided under our long-term disability plan. This did not repeat in the second quarter, so it is a headwind in our sequential walk. And finally, we have an all other net decrease in EBITDA of $4 million when compared to the prior quarter. This includes additional inventory accruals in our Aftermarket business, as well as the impact of the Brazilian real depreciation. Overall, this was another solid quarter for us. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $78 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%. We are continuing to build upon the performance we have delivered over the last several quarters and remain focused on achieving our financial objectives. Now let's turn to Slide 12. For the second quarter, total free cash flow was $9 million. This represents a $35 million improvement over the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher adjusted earnings, lower pension contributions, lower cash interest and a decrease in restructuring payments. Working capital, including the impact of our factoring programs, negatively impacted our cash flow by $37 million in the quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, our first quarter cash flow was positively impacted by higher sales in Europe where we factor most of our receivables. This had the effect of accelerating the cash cycle time in Q1. As production volumes in Europe took a step down in this quarter following the pre-buy, the first quarter cash flow benefit from factoring became a cash flow headwind for us in the second quarter. In addition, as Ike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to build strategic inventory buffers to support an upturn in the North American market, so this had a modest impact on working capital performance in the quarter and will continue to impact us in the second half of the year. Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a review of our liquidity and debt maturity profile. We completed several capital market transactions during the second quarter. First, we issued $225 million of 6 1/4% notes due in 2024. The proceeds from this issuance were used, along with balance sheet cash, to call $250 million of our 10 5/8% notes due in 2018 and to pay off the remaining $41 million term loan balance. These transactions resulted in gross debt reduction of $66 million and will generate annual cash interest savings of approximately $14 million going forward. During the second quarter, we also amended and extended our revolving credit facility. The maturity date for the revolver was extended to February 2019 and we improved the drawn pricing by 75 basis points. In addition, we increased the facility size to $499 million through April 2017. After which time, the facility will step back down to $410 million through maturity. From a liquidity perspective, we used cash to help fund the debt repurchases I just spoke about. However, as a result of the revolver amendment, we largely offset the liquidity impact of using that cash by upsizing the revolver more than $80 million. As a result, we ended the quarter with $795 million of liquidity, only slightly below last quarter's balance. Completing these actions has allowed us to achieve greater financial flexibility and has provided us a clear runway in which we have only $170 million of funded debt coming due over the next 5 years. In fact, 85% of our funded debt doesn't mature until 2019 and later. Next, I'll review our updated fiscal year 2014 outlook on Slide 14. We are raising our fiscal year 2014 sales guidance from approximately $3.7 billion to a range of approximately $3.75 billion to $3.8 billion. This increased sales guidance is due to a strengthening North American Class 8 truck market, and to a lesser extent, increased revenue expectations in China. This revised sales guidance also takes into account the effect of the weaker market in Brazil. We're also raising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance from approximately 7.5% to approximately 7.7%. We expect better second half performance than originally planned due primarily to the revenue upside we're seeing particularly in the North American Class 8 market. But second half performance is tempered somewhat as we manage headwinds in 2 of our higher-margin businesses, as well as modestly higher steel cost in North America. We are taking down our production forecast for South America due to the softness in the commercial vehicle demand in that region. And in the case of our Defense business, we expect revenue to be lower by more than 50% in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year, due to the continued step-down in FMTV production. It will be important to keep these headwinds in mind when thinking about our third and fourth quarters from an earnings perspective. We are also raising our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a range of $0.50 to $0.60 for fiscal year 2014, which is an increase of $0.20 compared to our prior guidance. This increase is driven by the expected improvements to adjusted EBITDA, as well as the benefit of lower interest cost resulting from the capital market transactions we executed. Total cash flow is still expected to be between breakeven and positive $25 million. As the North American market continues to strengthen, we are ensuring that we are prepared for increased demand by putting strategic inventory buffers in place where necessary. This investment in working capital will position us to convert on the North American market upturn. But even with these inventory buffers, with the first half performance, we're confident in our ability to deliver this free cash flow guidance, which would be our strongest full year free cash flow performance in 4 years. Now I'll turn the call back over to Ike to provide closing remarks on our continued forward momentum.
Ivor J. Evans: Thanks, Kevin. Let's turn to Slide 15. When we met with you in February, we highlighted several reasons that make Meritor a sound investment. This quarter, we made solid progress with accomplishments that further validate our investment thesis. First, we said we had a clear and simple plan to improve performance in 2016. That plan is working. As I said earlier, we're aligned and focused on 9 objectives, and we're on track to achieve the 3 financial metrics we have established for EBITDA margin, net debt and incremental revenue. Also in the second quarter, we launched our new air disc brake program with Scania in Europe. This business was part of the $120 million pipeline we captured last year. We have strong partnerships that we're focused on growing. We're proud of our new 4-year agreement with DTNA, which is a year longer than the last agreement, and we're ready to begin new axle business with Daimler India. We're also working hard to build and sustain relationships with other important global players like Volvo, Navistar, MAN, DAF and Mahindra to name just a few. Our margins are improving. In the first quarter, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin 250 basis points year-over-year. This quarter, margins grew by 170 basis points from the same period last year. We briefly told you our liquidity was strong and we were evaluating further action to improve the balance sheet. We did that this quarter with a series of transactions. Our cash flow is improving. In the first quarter this year, we had the strongest first quarter free cash flow since fiscal year 2010. This quarter, we had the best second quarter results since that same year. Defense programs, including the Humvee Recap and the JLTV, continue to show good potential for Meritor. Meritor's ProTec High Mobility Suspension successfully completed 100,000 miles of on- and off-road testing in Lockheed Martin's JLTV. This equates to about 62% of the required test miles. The transformational change in our approach to material cost management is working. As you saw, material performance this quarter helped contribute to our favorable results. And our global operations are getting more efficient. In Europe, we achieved a 98% delivery and strong conversion during the first quarter pre-buy. We now believe we are in an up-cycle for Class 8 trucks in North America with the best 4-month period of orders from December to March since 2006. We are ready and responding as demand increases. We're managing the process carefully to ensure we convert incremental sales at normal levels, which would reflect better performance than in previous production cycles. Overall, we're showing consistent improvements in financial performance, balance sheet management, cost structure and operational excellence. We're also winning important new business with large global players. Raising guidance for the full year is further indication that the actions we're taking are sustainable. We are building momentum and looking forward to the second half of the year. And with that, we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault, Goldman Sachs.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe a couple of questions here. Why don't we just start off with -- on the Commercial Truck side. You had very, very strong conversion on the revenue, and I think you highlighted some of these, I guess, burden and material benefits that you put in place that are sort of paying off. Can you speak to the sustainability of that kind of a conversion in subsequent periods kind of hitting what's implied by your guidance, and potentially if we can talk about sort of beyond 2014, that would be helpful as well. That's my first question.
Ivor J. Evans: Patrick, the answer is yes. But as far as specifics, Kevin, do you want to go ahead and...
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, sure. Patrick, it's Kevin. With respect to the sustainability, I mean, this is part of our M2016 initiative. As we look at material, labor and burden performance, we have specific objectives in that regard. In material, we're driving for 2.5% annual net material performance; in labor and burden, in the same zip code; and we're were achieving it. We achieved it last year in '13, we're on pace to achieve it in 2014. So it's 1 of those 9 key strategies we're focused on in terms of driving that type of performance as part of M2016, and we expect to sustain that and deliver that through M2016.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And so no kind of unusual commercial settlements or anything sort of helping the result this quarter?
Kevin Nowlan: No. And I think you can see that when you look at -- it wasn't just this quarter. It was last quarter and it's been prior quarters. I mean, we continue to see that improvement in our margin, so it's not a 1 quarter phenomenon, what you're seeing. You can see it quarter-over-quarter continuing.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And I guess, just looking kind of turning forward one page in your slide deck here, Aftermarket & Trailer, can you just give us a sense of what the kind of outlook is for that? I feel like there's sort of less of an understanding, less transparency in terms of the real revenue drivers there. So what should we be looking at to sort of gauge the opportunity there from a top line and maybe in terms of a conversion as well?
Ivor J. Evans: Patrick, I'll go ahead take a pass at it, and if Kevin can add a little more color, fine. But Aftermarket is tracking to forecast and the trailer market has picked up nicely. So we feel very encouraged about both our Aftermarket and our Trailer business as well. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything you want to further...
Kevin Nowlan: I mean, we're definitely seeing, on a year-over-year basis, the Aftermarket business is up from a revenue perspective with truck production, and that's why we provide the U.S. truck freight ton-mile as kind of an indicator, a directional indicator as to what we expect in the Aftermarket performance from a revenue perspective. And then from a margin perspective, Aftermarket has historically been one of our better contributing margin businesses. So we would expect to generate pretty healthy conversion as we see revenue growth there. Now this quarter, on a year-over-year basis, that was tempered by the fact that we no longer have Suspensys helping those earnings, so that's a year-over-year headwind, and we did have some modest inventory accruals that we booked in the quarter for E&O. So -- but overall you should expect that to be one of our better converting businesses.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then on that, like Suspensys, I should know this but this was something that wasn't consolidated and was there for helping EBITDA but not revenues, is that correct?
Kevin Nowlan: Exactly right. So on a year-over-year -- so second quarter of a year ago, we generated about $4 million, $2 million of which was in the Aftermarket & Trailer segment. The other $2 million was in the Truck segment. So Aftermarket's down $2 million year-over-year, but exactly like you said, it was EBITDA with no sales.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then just the reserves that you've taken, is that kind of a one-time thing, or are those kind of accruals that are ongoing as the revenue is picking up?
Kevin Nowlan: I wouldn't call it a one-time thing. I mean, every quarter, we're assessing our inventory for excess and obsolescence to see if there are any inventory adjustments we need to make. And from time to time, we make adjustments. So it was a small amount, couple of million dollars in the quarter. And it happens from time to time, particularly in businesses where you carry a lot of inventory to support that business like the Aftermarket business.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Last one for me. Can you just -- any update on discussions with Volvo?
Ivor J. Evans: Patrick, as you know, our contract expires this fall in October. We are encouraged with our discussions, but we don't have any announcements to make at this time. I think that if you step back, the good news from both Volvo and our perspective is that we both see long-term value in our relationship. And I think it's fair to say that we see a path forward, but I don't really have any more than that at this point in time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays Capital.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just want to start in the CB [ph] division by asking a little bit more color on the impact of Brazil, Venezuela or other countries in South America. What was the drag there, if any? What does it look like going forward? And then where -- if there was a drag, where were the key offsets and kind of -- and maybe just gives us some color on how you're managing that situation as it kind of went through the quarter?
Kevin Nowlan: Brian, it's Kevin. Are you referring to FX related or something broader?
Ivor J. Evans: Or are you talking the economy?
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: FX inflation, weak economies, government in Venezuela that's on the -- following the Fidel Castro model, just the whole collection of [indiscernible].
Ivor J. Evans: Okay. So before Kevin answers, the good news is we're not in Venezuela, so we don't have an issue with FX coming out of Venezuela. But Kevin?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes. I mean, that's exactly right. We don't have any Venezuelan exposure, so from a market perspective or an FX perspective, there is 0 exposure that we have to that market. From a Brazilian perspective, obviously, it's an important business for us. I think it was about $450 million in revenue last year and we have had some FX headwinds there. I mean, for the quarter, the Brazilian real was about 2.35. Keep in mind, a year ago it was about 2. So on a year-over-year basis, that's impacted us quarter-to-quarter, Q2 to Q2, about $22 million in revenue, the Brazil real, and about $5 million or so in EBITDA. But sequentially, it didn't have a big impact on us even though there was some depreciation, maybe about $4 million of revenue in the quarter. The good news is we're offsetting that with performance, so you're not seeing that pop as a real big bad news item that's not being offset by other things like volume, mix, pricing and performance.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, anything you can update us on the Eaton litigation and kind of timeline for that? We know there's a court date currently scheduled for June 23.
Ivor J. Evans: That date is still a good date, and we expect the trial to last 8 days as we've communicated before. But really don't have any more to update than that, Brian.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then final kind of question. As you kind of look at the margin progress here, as well as in your guide, and you're kind of thinking about M2016, to what extent would you ascribe the margin improvement to, a, revenue just showed up better than you expected due to cyclical factors? Or versus, b, we executed better and had revenue been, say, a bit lower or -- where would it have been [ph], I think Ike will kind of recognize this as a question has boss back at Emerson would've asked. That is, are you actually operating better or did you just get some -- something from tailwind?
Ivor J. Evans: Brian, we are operating more efficiently across the globe, our material and burden and labor cost reduction initiatives are bottom lining, and it was all part of M2016 that we would -- in difficult markets, that we would improve our EBITDA margins. But Kevin, you want to add a little more to that?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, I will. I mean, as you look at 2014, I mean, the primary reason why we're taking up our guidance is obviously driven by revenue but our ability to execute on converting on that revenue. And we're guiding to a range on revenue and we're guiding to approximately margin. But if you just kind of do the math on some of the midpoints, it would imply a high-teens conversion on that revenue, which is showing that the cost performance initiatives that we are executing are sticking and that we're able to convert successfully on the incremental revenue we're seeing. And we would expect that to continue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan, UBS.
Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: This is Rahul Chadha on behalf of Colin. I just want to understand, it seems like in the first half, the margins have been pretty strong, 7.7% in Q1, 8.1% in Q2. So why does your full year guidance only stop at 7.7%? Is there room to go above or is it just being conservative?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes. I mean, I think there's a couple of headwinds that we need to keep in mind as we look at the second half of the year. The first starting with kind of markets and the mix impact of that. We obviously have South America where we're taking down our guidance on the second half of the year with that market coming down quite a bit, so that's impacted the way we think about the second half versus what we were thinking before. Second is, our military business, which is another high-margin business for us, is down 50% in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Big mix impact for us there. And finally, in the North American market, with the upturn, we have seen steel indices increase on a year-over-year basis. As you look at bar and hot-rolled, I mean, you're seeing up about 7% or 8% on a year-over-year basis, we saw the indices peak in January. And so that's going to have an impact on us in the back half of the year. And even though we have recovery mechanisms, those recovery mechanisms, as you recall, are on a lag, and so we're not likely to get the recovery on those until early in '15. So those are the things, as you think about why second half is implicitly guided to something lower than first half. Those are the headwinds that we're seeing and to keep in mind.
Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then one question on the Military business. Any update on potential wins which were in the pipeline or in the near-term?
Ivor J. Evans: There's 2. Humvee timing, we expect 2 contractors to be selected for the EMD, or the Engineering Manufacturing Design phase. That should occur late August or September of this year, and we expect the final contract to be awarded a year from now -- a year from September 2015. And the JLTV is, we expect that selection to be late 2015. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're performing well on the test phase with Lockheed Martin.
Rahul Chadha - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And could you remind us, was any of this baked in the $0.5 billion incremental revenue target in M2016?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes. I mean, those initiatives, along with a number of other initiatives, are baked into the M2016 target. But keep in mind, we have a pipeline that far exceeds the $500 million target we're driving for. We embed all of the initiatives that we're working toward and then we put a discount factor on that, kind of a macro-level discount. And there's no single award that would -- that if we didn't win, would cause us to miss that target. So while those are important programs to hitting $500 million, we're not dependent on any one program to hit the $500 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky, Sidoti.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Just a quick question on China. Was this a -- I guess more clarification, was this a restocking that you saw there, or are we're just seeing demands at the point where it's mirroring end-user demand? And also any thoughts about growth in excess of the market, either on-highway or off-highway?
Ivor J. Evans: No, you got it right, Robert. It was restocking. It's a replenishment of inventories at this point in time. And obviously, as I mentioned, we're coming off a weak comparison. So we're not declaring victory as far as the Chinese market, but we are seeing some increase orders to replenish inventory.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And then secondly, SG&A has been under pressure for quite a few years now. You've done a really good job on just driving that lower. And if we do have some -- little bit better cyclical end markets over the next few years, would you expect to see an inflationary growth rate in SG&A, or is it still going to be a source of like an absolute dollar attrition?
Ivor J. Evans: No, we expect to be able to, as we increase revenues, to be able to leverage our functional spend. It's something that we pay attention to, we work hard on it. And obviously as we win new businesses we may have a few incremental increases. But overall, we expect to be able to leverage our functional spend going forward.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. Would you expect growth in absolute dollars?
Ivor J. Evans: There could be some incremental dollar growth. But as far as rate, we should expect to be able to see that being leveraged. And you saw that, by the way, in the sequential walk from last quarter to this quarter as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Irina Hodakovsky - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Brett had to sign off, I'm representing Brett Hoselton. A quick question for you. As we move into the third quarter, your comparisons become much more difficult. I'm trying to understand how you can -- I know you don't provide guidance on a quarterly basis, but if you can maybe directionally guide us into what we can expect from your end markets?
Kevin Nowlan: We're not giving specific guidance, obviously, on each of the last 2 quarters. You can do some of the math, though, and look at what our guidance is implying about the second half of the year, and obviously, it's implying that our margins are going to be down. So you're absolutely right when you look at Q3. Q3 is a difficult comp for us given that we generated 8.8% EBITDA margin in that quarter. But again, keep in mind we do have some headwinds heading into the second half of the year that I spoke of earlier that'll hit us over the course of the next 2 quarters. I talked about how we took down our guidance in South America, FMTV stepping down and the modest increase in steel economics that we're seeing in North America.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, we have no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks.
Carl D. Anderson: Thank you, Glen. Thank you for your participation on today's call. For any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. And with that, this concludes Meritor's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Thank you.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter 1 2014 Meritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Juliann, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson, Vice President and Treasurer. Please proceed, sir.
Carl D. Anderson: Thank you, Juliann. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's first quarter 2014 earnings call. On the call today, we have Ike Evans, Meritor's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Today's presentation will be abbreviated due to our scheduled analyst event in New York on Thursday, February 6. We're looking forward to providing you with more detail at that time. Now I'll turn the call over to Ike.
Ivor J. Evans: Thank you, Carl, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 3 for some highlights from our first fiscal quarter of this year. As you can see, performance improvement initiatives are continuing to drive financial results. We generated $12 million of adjusted net income, or $0.12 per share, in the quarter from continuing operations. Year-over-year, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 250 basis points and had the best first quarter free cash flow performance in 4 years. We believe these results are particularly meaningful concerning the significant step down in our defense business from the same quarter last year. We told you during our fourth quarter call that we expected the action taken in the past year to drive continued margin expansion this year even though we did not anticipate revenue growth. Our performance this quarter demonstrates that these actions are having the intended results. We continue to execute our M2016 strategy, and I tell you I am really pleased with the progress we're making. We certainly have more work ahead of us, but first quarter results are consistent with our plan, and we're really off to a good start this year. We're also reaffirming our fiscal year guidance. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a look at our sequential performance. Typically, we see our revenue decline in the first quarter due to seasonality from less selling days and production impacts from the holiday season. This year, however, revenue in the first quarter decreased only $2 million from the fourth quarter of last year to $907 million. Prebuy activity in Europe and slightly stronger production in China mitigated the anticipated impact of less aftermarket sales in North America and lower truck production in South America. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million in the first quarter, flat to the prior year, while adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.7% for the quarter. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $12 million, up $1 million from the prior quarter. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.12, up $0.01 from the fourth quarter of last year. Total free cash flow was negative $16 million, an improvement of $30 million from the prior quarter. Keep in mind, we prefunded $54 million of required 2014 pension contributions in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding this prefunding, free cash flow decreased in our fiscal first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Cash flow performance in our first fiscal quarter is typically weaker due to the normal seasonality in our business. Please turn to Slide 5. We're encouraged with the recent developments in our defense business. With respect to our HMMWV Recap opportunity, the Marine Corps recently selected a vehicle configuration for this program. This important decision followed a competitive evaluation process of 4 different configurations. It was determined during this process that Meritor's content meets or exceeds the Marine's performance specifications. Specifically, our content includes ProTec suspension, differentials, brakes, wheel end equipment, frame rails, drivelines, drivetrain control and central tire inflation systems. To give you an idea of the total Marine Corps program value, the selling price of each vehicle is expected to be $110,000. At more than 6,800 units, the program value is in excess of $750 million over the course of 5 years. With significant content on each vehicle, this would be an important win for us with a meaningful portion of the $750 million. 2 prime contractors will be selected for the engineering, manufacturing and design phase of this project by June of this year. This phase is a new development and will ultimately lead to a final contract award in May of next year, which is a modest delay from our prior expectation. We're working with a number of prime contractors to provide our content on their respective vehicles. We're also monitoring an additional opportunity with this program. The Army has indicated it is considering to retrofit 30% of its current HMMWV fleet. That means approximately 50,000 to 60,000 vehicles could be added to this upgrade. This would most likely be a 20-year program with the Army. Also, this quarter, we received good news that more than 900 units have been added to the FMTV program. This additional build will now extend the program into next year. On Slide 6 is our volume outlook for the fiscal year. Overall, we're currently holding our global market forecast unchanged. In North America, our forecast is steady at 245,000 to 255,000 Class 8 trucks. The market is solid with December being an exceptionally strong month for orders. January orders will be very important in shaping the year. For defense, I've given you an update on HMMWV Recap and FMTV. As you know, JLTV is another defense program we're closely following. JLTV remains on schedule, with the engineering, manufacturing and development phase scheduled from August of 2012 to November of this year, with a final selection expected in late 2015. China's outlook continues to be consistent with volumes last year. However, we experienced a stronger-than-expected first quarter, primarily in the grader and loader segments. While this is encouraging, recent economic data suggest further weakening in the region. We'll need to see another fourth -- quarter before we consider changing our forecast. India continues to be under pressure. As we've told you, the elections in the spring will be an important event for the region. Currently, we see continued deterioration with little upside. Western Europe had a strong first quarter due to the prebuy I mentioned earlier. Our team performed well in quality and delivery with a solid contribution on incremental sales. While economic indicators continue to point toward a modest recovery, the first quarter prebuy presents an uncertain picture for the next several quarters. In South America, we're maintaining our forecast for medium and heavy-duty truck market at 175,000 to 185,000 units. The economy in Brazil continues to be challenging to forecast due to slower GDP growth, high inflation and a volatile currency. However, the agricultural sector has experienced record harvest, which has had a positive impact on the trucking business. Infrastructure demands also continue to be high due to the upcoming World Cup and 2016 Olympics. Now I'll turn it over to Kevin for a more detailed review of our first quarter results.
Kevin Nowlan: Thanks, Ike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I'll review our first quarter financial results and reaffirm our 2014 guidance. On Slide 7, you'll see our first quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales of $907 million in the quarter were up year-over-year by $16 million. The increase was due primarily to higher commercial truck production in Europe, driven by the prebuy associated with the Euro 6 regulation impact. In addition, South America revenue was higher on a year-over-year basis, as production volumes 1 year ago were still challenged following the Euro 5 emissions standards change. These increases were partially offset by lower military revenue and continued weakness in China. Gross margin was $20 million higher year-over-year due to the continued execution of our M2016 initiative. The gross margin improvement was primarily driven by conversion on higher revenues, execution of global pricing initiatives throughout calendar year 2013, continued net material labor and burden performance and lower structural cost resulting from actions executed largely in the second quarter of last year. All of this was achieved in a market environment where our FMTV volumes stepped down more than 30% year-over-year. So overall, it was a solid first fiscal quarter. SG&A was $3 million lower in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, as we continue to manage the fixed cost structure of the business. This quarter's restructuring costs were $5 million lower than the first quarter of 2013, which had included costs associated with the actions taken 1 year ago. Earnings in our minority-owned affiliates were $8 million in the quarter, down slightly from the prior year. This decrease was driven by the loss of earnings from the Suspensys joint venture, which was sold in July 2013. Interest expense was $2 million lower in the first quarter of 2014, driven by debt extinguishment costs of $5 million experienced in the first quarter of 2013 that did not repeat. Income tax expense was in line with last year, despite the fact that pretax earnings improved. As we continue to expand margins and improve the financial performance of the company, we expect to drive toward a more normalized effective tax rate. In total, adjusted income from continuing operations was $12 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $11 million, or negative $0.11 per share, in the same period last year. Slide 8 shows first quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck & Industrial. Sales in the first quarter of 2014 were $727 million, up $12 million from the same period last year. Segment EBITDA was $53 million, an increase of $19 million year-over-year. This represents a 158% upside conversion, due primarily to lower net material labor and burden costs as well as pricing actions in South America to recoup part of the FX depreciation experienced in the latter part of 2013. These positives, along with higher revenues in Europe and South America, more than offset the negative mix headwind associated with the step down in our FMTV business. Next, on Slide 9, we summarized the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. Sales were $208 million, up $5 million from last year. The increase was primarily due to a modest uptick in European aftermarket sales. Segment EBITDA was $19 million, an increase of $6 million year-over-year. The upside conversion was driven by pricing actions we executed throughout calendar year 2013. We also had lower net material, labor and burden costs. This EBITDA performance was achieved despite the headwind of not having earnings from the Suspensys joint venture. Now let's move to Slide 10, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from our fourth quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014. Walking from the $70 million of EBITDA generated in our fourth quarter, we had $5 million less EBITDA due to mix. Our first fiscal quarter has less selling days than our fourth quarter, which affects our aftermarket business. In addition, production levels were down in South America and our FMTV volumes took another step down sequentially. So while we experienced a significant revenue increase in Europe driven by the Euro 6 prebuy, the benefit of that increased volume was not enough to offset lower sales from these other businesses, which typically have higher margins. The net result of this was an unfavorable net volume and mix of $5 million. The other notable item in the quarter relates to $5 million long-term disability liability reduction. We executed a change in our long-term disability benefit plan to reduce the duration of medical benefits provided to individuals in order to be more consistent with market practices. This cost reduction will result in real cash flow savings to the company in the coming years. Overall, this was a solid quarter for us. We believe this represents the highest reported first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in at least 8 years. While we have more work to do, we're off to a good start for 2014. Now let's turn to Slide 11. For the first quarter, total free cash flow was negative $16 million. This was a $90 million improvement over the same period last year, driven by higher net income and lower cash outflows for working capital. We also benefited this quarter from an increase in factored receivables, driven by higher sales in Europe, where we factor most of these receivables, and a new short-term factoring program in Brazil. These factoring programs have the effect of accelerating the cash cycle time. As production volumes in Europe are expected to take a step down following the prebuy, this first quarter cash flow benefit will become a cash flow headwind for us in the second quarter. Overall, while still a negative cash flow quarter, it's important to reiterate that our first fiscal quarter traditionally is challenging due to fewer selling days and calendar year-end cutoff issues. With that in mind, this free cash flow performance represents the best first quarter results since 2010. Next, I'd like to review and reaffirm our fiscal year 2014 outlook on Slide 12. As Ike discussed earlier, the demand assumptions are unchanged for our end markets. And as a result, we are maintaining our sales guidance of approximately $3.7 billion. While we see the potential for upside in markets such as North America, there is still significant uncertainty in Europe relating to the full year impact of the Euro 6 prebuy, and in South America and India. As a result, we'll have a better sense as to whether we need to make adjustments following another quarter of data. We are also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of approximately 7.5%, as well as our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance at $0.30 to $0.40 for 2014. Our first quarter has put us on track toward achieving these results. However, we must keep in mind that we continue to face the sequential wind down in our high-margin FMTV business, which will continue to be a margin headwind throughout the year. Total free cash flow is still expected to be between breakeven and positive $25 million. With the solid Q1 cash flow performance, we feel confident about our ability to deliver such a result, which would be our strongest full year free cash flow since 2010. Now I'll turn the call back over to Ike to wrap up and discuss our continued focus on M2016.
Ivor J. Evans: Thank you, Kevin. If you'll please turn to Slide 13. In our fourth quarter call in November, we provided you with detail on each element of our M2016 plan. Let me briefly summarize the highlights for you again because this plan is the roadmap to the financial results we have committed to achieving in 2016. The 3 financial targets we've established for M2016 address margin performance, net debt reduction and revenue. We intend to achieve a 10% margin for the full fiscal year 2016 through performance initiatives, incremental business wins and some market recovery. As we said previously, our cash flow breakeven is around 7% to 7.5%. We intend to drive performance that far exceeds this breakeven point so that we can consistently generate strong free cash flow. Last fiscal year, we reduced net debt by $216 million, which puts us more than halfway to our goal of $400 million. We're off to a good start but have more to do. We also reported $120 million of new business last year. We'll continue to scorecard ourselves annually against our target of a $500 million per year run rate, and we'll continue to tell you about new business we're winning around the world. M2016 has 9 specific initiatives that we believe will improve the performance of our business, resulting in achieving the financial targets that I just mentioned. In the first quarter of this year, we exceeded our operational targets in safety, quality, delivery and cost. Through continued execution of Lean concepts in our plants, we're taking the Meritor production system to a higher level in an effort to further improve our operational performance. We're making solid progress toward completing contracts with major customers. As we discuss our partnerships with these customers and others around the world, we're working closely with each one to ensure our product strategy is closely aligned with theirs. We're designing new features and enhancement to help our customers achieve their goals in safety, efficiency, performance and application coverage. We're confident in our ability to organically grow this business as we continue to engineer commercial drivetrain products that enhance mobility and maximize vehicle uptimes through superior engineering. Our products offer better performance at lighter weights for increased payloads and higher operating efficiencies. We're also actively pursuing various strategic approaches to reduce material cost, and we're seeing the results. Working capital is another area that we've targeted for improvement. We believe there's an opportunity to increase our inventory turns over the next few years. Overall, we're on track to meet our M2016 objectives. We've focused our resources onto the fine set of initiatives that we believe will lead to the achievement of the financial targets that we've detailed for you. We have momentum. We're celebrating our wins. We're challenging ourselves to do even more. We look forward to seeing you at Analyst Day in New York on February 6 for a more detailed discussion. Now we'll take your questions, and thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I was hoping we could talk a little bit about, just if you could help us out on the cadence of margins throughout the rest of the year. I know -- because typically Q1 is, as you mentioned, fewer production days. Your margin did come in above your full year range. You did mention some of the sequential FMTV headwinds. Hoping you can maybe quantify those, maybe just walk us through a little how we should think about the margin cadence in the next couple of quarters roughly.
Kevin Nowlan: We're not going to give specific guidance on a quarterly basis, but I can tell you the way to think about it. Obviously, we had a good quarter here at 7.7% margin. A couple of the headwinds that you should keep in mind as we think about sequentially going into Q2 and beyond. One is we obviously had this one-time benefit from long-term disability, which was an execution item to reduce our cost structure. But that's not going to be an item that recurs in the next couple of quarters. Second is we do have continued step down in the FMTV business sequentially over the next few quarters. So you should expect that to be a headwind. And third, there is some risk related to the Brazil FX. I mean, even if you look at where that was yesterday, trading at $2.44, that's even a depreciation versus where we were at the end of the year. So while we won't give sequential guidance, you can expect that some of those things are impacting us as we think about hitting our full year 7.5% guidance.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Sure, that's helpful. Then on the fiscal '16 targets on revenue, I know you didn't provide a new revenue scorecard like last quarter. Maybe you could talk about the overall quoting booking environment that's out there, just your overall level of confidence today to achieve the $500 million target.
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, we're not going to scorecard ourselves quarter-to-quarter on that. Obviously, we provided in our year-end call our scorecard in terms of having already generated bookings of $120 million on a run rate basis, and $110 million of which is going to hit in 2016. I think we are going to provide you a little bit more color at Analyst Day next week on some of the things that we think drive or help us achieve the targets as it relates to that $500 million run rate revenue target.
Ivor J. Evans: I might add to Kevin's point, we have a very robust pipeline that we think is very viable and we continue to work that aggressively.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's great to hear. And just lastly, on the FMTV, the incremental vehicles into fiscal '15. Any way to help us quantify the impact to you from that extension?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, I think the way to think about it is next year, we were thinking that we would have no FMTV revenue. I think you should think about those 900-plus vehicles, I think it's 949 vehicles or so, as being about 30% of the volume that we would experience in FMTV in '14. So '15 volume in that regard would be about 30% of '14.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a follow-up on the earlier question on the FMTV. What kind of sequential headwinds are we facing? I mean, is it -- any color on the percent down over the next few quarters?
Ivor J. Evans: Well, I think, as you know, we were about to -- we were going to lose all of our volume this year. So this is potential upside.
Kevin Nowlan: And you should think about it as you go through the course of the year, we're down about 30% year-over-year Q1. But on a full year basis, we're going to be down about 55%. So I think that should just help you see that there are more step downs coming sequentially as we head into Q2 and Q3.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. And any color on how Brazil is trending? Are orders there still stable? I mean -- because I think there has been some...
Ivor J. Evans: It's very difficult to forecast what's going on in Brazil. It's just been, for the reasons we outlined, it's been difficult. I mean, we -- GDP and inflation remain a concern. But the inventory levels are -- the good news, inventory levels are stabilizing. The FINAME program has been extended to this calendar year. So those are positives. But consumer confidence is weak. And so it's just very uncertain. But we're pretty confident that the 175,000 to 185,000 medium and heavy-duty trucks is probably a fairly realistic outlook.
Kevin Nowlan: And then keep in mind, from a Meritor-specific perspective, we did have that new business win with DAF, which should help our revenue as we go throughout the year relative to -- in increasing share, you can think about it relative to the overall market there.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, that makes sense. And any update on the Eaton litigation? I mean, is the last date it's set to go to trial on June 23, or are there any additional updates?
Ivor J. Evans: Well, the District Court ruled in favor of Meritor and against Eaton on a set of pretrial motions. And we had a pretrial scheduling conference, and the judge tentatively set a date for June 23. Eaton has asked for additional time for more discovery. And she has said that she will consider that and get back to us and determine whether she is going to hold the June 23 date, which would probably be an 8-day trial. But either way, we expect a trial date this year, whether it be June 23 or a little later in the year. But there should be a trial this year.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just one last question on -- any color on the size of the factoring benefit in the quarter to your cash flow?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, I mean, you could see the factoring was -- the good news coming through the factoring line was about $81 million. Now as you think about that -- and that's driven by Europe, where we had a big uptick in volume sequentially, driven by the prebuy activity. And we also had a new factoring program in Brazil, it's a short-term program that we had put in place. As you think about that from a headwind perspective going forward, I would think about it as being roughly half of that balance, maybe a little bit more of half of that balance being a sequential headwind as we go into Q2.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A couple of questions. First, on the litigation. Your General Counsel just retired or left the company. Does that -- is that -- could you just kind of comment on that and how that kind of fits into the broader litigation picture?
Ivor J. Evans: Sure, Brian. Vernon had shared with us his plans to retire in the next several years. And was expected to leave. Vernon has been a valued member of our team. But we were opportunistic and found a great replacement. And as you probably know, finding good outside -- excellent [ph] counsel and corporate secretary can be difficult. So we decided to go ahead and proceed with that. We will be making an announcement shortly in that regard. And Vernon has also continued to -- continue in a consulting role with us for this next year. We do not see any impact at all to the Eaton suit. Kevin and I and Vernon have actually teamed this with outside counsel. We've had the same outside counsel for 7.5 years. So we don't -- there's no impact here at all, Brian.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And in terms of M2016, I guess, a couple of questions. How much of the low-hanging fruit has been harvested and kind of where does it go going forward? And kind of second, probably more for Kevin, is kind of on a sequential basis, it sort of looked like a wash, you had a little volume pricing. How do we kind of judge sequentially the impact of M2016? It looked good year-over-year, but sequentially, and it gets to that low-hanging fruit question, harder to see.
Ivor J. Evans: Well, regarding to the low-hanging fruit, as far as margin performance, we feel very comfortable in our abilities to deliver our material net cost reductions. In fact, if you look at what we've identified and what we have to go get this year, it's very, very small. We're very confident we've demonstrated it in last year, as well as far as labor and burden improvement, and we're well on track through the first quarter this year in both labor and burden and material performance. So we're very confident, at this point in time, that we can continue with the Meritor Lean production system and continuous improvement, that the opportunity still exists. We have a -- and we also have not only, on our revenue side, a very aggressive pipeline, we have also identified a very solid pipeline of opportunities on the material and labor and burden front as well.
Kevin Nowlan: And I think another thing to keep in mind, Brian, is that as you look at this year, we obviously ended last year with a full year EBITDA margin of 7.1%. We're guiding to flat revenue this year and margin uptick to 7.5%. And that's despite 2 pretty significant headwinds, 1 being the FMTV stepping down 55%. And I think we've given different data points over time which can help you kind of dimension the potential impact of that. And second, keep in mind, we don't have Suspensys anymore. So we've lost those JV earnings. And the combination of those 2 things are being overcome or overwhelmed by the performance that we're generating right now to allow us to generate improved margins. So as you think sequentially as we go forward toward M2016, those headwinds start to go away. Suspensys won't be a headwind again in '15. And FMTV, while it's got another step down coming, it's not going to be the same magnitude of headwind for the next 2 years. So as long as we continue to execute on the performance we have, we're going to start to see that performance flow to the bottom line without those same types of offsets we have here in '14.
Ivor J. Evans: I was just going to say, if you'll recall, when I first came, I made an assessment regarding M2016 that this plan was doable and that we have the right management team to execute it, and nothing has changed in that regard. And you can see by the results that it's working.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, a couple of questions from me. First is, I know you have upcoming contract negotiations with Daimler and Volvo. Can you kind of give us a sense on the timing of that, and it's probably still early, but should we be viewing those as opportunities, or how easy is it to dimension the importance of those things to your profit outlook that you've outlined in 2016?
Ivor J. Evans: Speaking specifically about Daimler, we're in a process of finalizing our contract renewal with them. We view them, clearly, as a strategic customer. And when we're in a position to make an announcement, we will do so. But we're very encouraged about our progress. Similarly, we're very encouraged about the discussions that we've had with Volvo. And we're not in a position to make any announcement in that regard. But we're encouraged with the discussions that we've had to date.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just on the -- some of the volume outlook. I mean, could I get just a general idea of, like, based on what you've seen with one additional quarter since you outlined your plan and your guidance for this year, what has come in, like what regions do you have more confidence in, what regions do you have less? I mean, I guess, within that, I'd be specifically interested in Europe, which you haven't really had a question on yet. With the prebuy, how much of what you've seen is really just pure prebuy? How much of what you've seen is actual activity picking up, and in first quarter, based on the kind of visibility of the order book, how difficult do you think that could be? So maybe just a couple of questions surrounding the volume outlook as it stands now.
Ivor J. Evans: I would say the greatest uncertainty at this point in time is in North America. The December, Class 8 orders were very strong at 31,000 plus. So January will be -- we're really looking at this month orders critically. So, hopefully, there could be some upside there, we're not sure, but we'll have to watch that closely. The prebuy in Europe clearly helped the first quarter, and it kind of clouds the remaining 3 quarters. But maybe, Kevin, do you want to...
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, I mean, I think you characterized it right. If you think about -- if your question's really where the risks and opportunities relative to the guidance that we're giving right now, I think North America is the one where there is the potential for upside, but we're not prepared to call that yet because it's just based on a month of orders. I think there are other regions, though, Europe, as Ike alluded to, South America and India, where I think there's continued risk in those relative to our guidance. I think still too early to tell at this point. And I think once we get one more quarter of data, we'll have a pretty good idea of where those markets are more likely to shake out. But at this point, that where the real risk and opportunity is.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just one clarification. The 10% EBITDA margin and the revenue target for 2016, you were able to -- do you still feel that you'd be able to achieve those things even in the absence of some major wins to replace FMTV? And I guess, on the back of that question, it seems like there are a lot of irons in the fire, so to speak, on military. And should those be considered maybe upside opportunities to that target?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes it's -- I mean, the way we think about it is we feel really good about our ability to deliver 1.5 to 2 points of margin expansion, absent any volume changes from where we are today. And then the volume, which is a combination of new business wins that -- some of which we've already executed on, as well as the market recovery, those are the things that would get us the rest of the way to 10%. So right now, as we think about it, there is a little bit of dependence that we have on the markets and the new business wins, but the bulk of the margin expansion that we're driving toward right now is based on underlying execution and performance. So we expect we'd get to 8.5% or 9% without any volume help.
Ivor J. Evans: But Patrick, as you look at our pipeline, we are not dependent upon any single program. We had -- the pipeline is very robust. And I would view -- I would look at the defense as some of the newest opportunity that presented themselves as just opportunity.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley.
Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A quick question on Latin America, long term. We've heard from -- on the light vehicle side, from a lot of the OEM suppliers, obviously, addressing the volatility and the lack of visibility in the region, and some of them even maybe downgrading their priorities in that region. Just want to get a sense of how you guys think of the Latin American market long term? And do you feel like your business is rightsized and nimble enough to deal with the volatility there?
Ivor J. Evans: Well, to answer your question, we remain very bullish in South America on the long term. And yes, we think we have the cost structure to weather where we are today. But we're winning new business as we speak, and we've announced that with MAN and Phevos. So we are very bullish on particularly Brazil and Latin America.
Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. And just one housekeeping question. You commented earlier on the potential cadence of earnings through the year. What about cash flow? Do you expect that to be fairly back-end loaded in getting up to that 0 to $25 million? Or do you think it's going to be fairly stable through many quarters?
Kevin Nowlan: It's -- normally, our stronger cash flow quarters tend to be the third and the fourth fiscal quarter. And I think you should think of that being no different this year. Because we do, as we come into Q2 here, we do have that factoring headwind I mentioned in Europe as those volumes come down following the prebuy and that factoring benefit unwinds. So I think you should expect that Q3 and Q4 will be the stronger quarters of the year from a cash flow perspective, but still in line with putting us on full year targets for 0 to $25 million of positive total free cash flow.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky from Sidoti.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Just looking at the balance sheet. It looks like the inventory turns have been turning down over the past 6 months -- 6 quarters or so, and your operations are supposedly getting better. And a, do I have my math right on inventory turns coming in? And why is that decelerating when the operations are getting better, material side especially? And what should we look for as -- when is the turn going to happen in inventory turns, and when are you going to get some of this shining through?
Ivor J. Evans: You're correct that the quarter was not as strong on inventory turns as we'd like. We've identified what we need to do. We have not changed on where we think we can go long term -- longer term, which we think we can get to 10 turns. But Kevin, I don't know whether you want to add a little more color.
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, I'll give a little color, because that's right. I mean, Q1 is down from where we were in Q4. If you look year-over-year, just looking where we ended '13 versus where we ended '12, actually, our inventory turns are flat. Now we would have liked to have seen some improvement, but we didn't. Now as you look at a year-over-year basis, Q1 to Q1, actually, our inventory turns improved. And the reason they are down, though, on a sequential basis, is we tend to have some inventory build that we have in the first quarter as we prepare for aftermarket spring selling season coming up and some of the other volume preparation we do, as we have production shutdown in December, we need to be ready for the early part of the second fiscal quarter. So overall, I think we'd like to see our performance improving. But as you look at the year-over-year metrics, we have seen some improvements. So I'm not sure I would agree that sequentially, we're seeing it get worse and worse. I think it's been stable, really, as I look Q4 to Q4 of last year and then Q1 to Q1 as well, it's a little bit up.
Ivor J. Evans: But having said that, it is one of our initiatives, and we're committed to improving our inventory turns. So...
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: And is the 10x turn goal concurrent with M2016, is that end of the year then?
Ivor J. Evans: Yes.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. Then otherwise, the -- I guess, in Brazil, are the DAF business and the new exposure you have to MAN, are those at full run rates right now or do those step up over the course of the year?
Ivor J. Evans: They step up over time.
Kevin Nowlan: The DAF one is happening right now, and the MAN-Phevos program starts several years out. It's not one that's in production right now.
Ivor J. Evans: It's a modest revenue in '16.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. Then finally, how are you thinking about China. Because you seem kind of cautiously encouraged, I guess, by what you're seeing in some product lines. CAT seemed like they're a little bit constructive as well, but obviously, there's a lot of negative headlines in the newspaper, so I'm wondering what you think about the China big June quarter season.
Ivor J. Evans: Well, we successfully completed the consolidation of our operations, and we saw really nice margin improvement. We've got the right cost structure. Grader and loader segments did show some signs of improvement. But overall, look at the mining segment, it's at depressed levels. And there's still some inventory out there for cranes. So we are, as we said in the call earlier, let's wait another quarter, and we'll come back to you on that one. Right now, we're kind of seeing it as flat.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Kind of following on with some of the questions that Patrick asked. This is just clarification on my part. My understanding is that roughly, I think, 150 to 200 basis points of the M2016 margin expansion is due to a combination of some execution on your part but also some pricing, which I think feeds into the idea that you're negotiating with Daimler and Volvo, and so on and so forth. Can you do 2 things here? One, can you just give us the timing as to the contracts, Daimler and Volvo, when is the expiration? Just remind us there. And then, secondly, am I correct in my impression that you seem to feel pretty good about how those contract negotiations are going with respect to your M2016 targets?
Ivor J. Evans: First of all, one of the pricing actions, Brett, is with our aftermarket. And we are achieving that. As far as Daimler is concerned, we're really excited about the discussions that we're having with them. And we'll -- to be announced at a later date. We are actively engaged in productive discussions with Volvo. The Volvo contract expires in Europe at the end of this year. So -- but in all cases, these are strategic customers for us. And we are engaged and involved and the discussions, at this point in time, are all positive.
Kevin Nowlan: And keep in mind, I think one of the things we've said is as you think about this OE contract renewals, it doesn't mean there are meaningful price movements in all of those contracts. I think we're focused on a couple in particular that we feel like are maybe underpriced. And so I don't think you should have an expectation necessarily that every OE contract necessarily translates to some sort of significant step up in price. The other question you asked there about Daimler. The contract actually expired December 31. But as you can imagine, with the strategic relationship that we have with Daimler, we continue to supply Daimler, and we continue to have a constructive relationship and hope to have something to talk about in the near future.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, secondly, and again, Patrick asked this question, but I just didn't quite understand the answer. You outlined a number of military opportunities here on Page #5. And as we think about the $500 million target, how much is baked into that?
Ivor J. Evans: The -- there's -- the HMMWV is in our pipeline. And as I said, we didn't discount any of the programs in that pipeline, but we've discounted the total. So we're not dependent on any particular program. I mean, we could not get HMMWV and still be okay with the incremental revenue growth that we're talking about. We're just encouraged about where we are with HMMWV right now because of -- with the selection of the -- where the Marine Corps is in their process.
Kevin Nowlan: And then as it relates to the FMTV, I mean, it's -- the extension of the program into '15 is nice, but that doesn't help us on a run rate basis. So that volume, you're not going to see us count that towards the $500 million of revenue. But the HMMWV is one of those programs that we're focused on among a lot of others as we drive toward the $500 million.
Operator: You have no questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks.
Carl D. Anderson: Thank you for your participation in today's call, and this concludes our first quarter earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Ivor J. Evans: Thank you, Carl, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 3. On the left side of the chart are highlights from our fourth quarter. As you know, Meritor's Board of Directors appointed me Chairman, CEO and President in August, after serving as the Executive Chairman, Interim Chief Executive Officer and President since May. In addition, 2 new board members were elected in fiscal 2013. Tom Pajonas is Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Flowserve. He has extensive operational experience, as well as a strong manufacturing and engineering background. Bill Lyons, former Chief Financial Officer at CONSOL Energy, has also joined Meritor's board. Bill not only has considerable financial experience, but also serves as a trustee of a major trust fund, which contributes to the board's insights from an investor perspective. Our margin performance this quarter was 7.7% on $909 million in revenue. Despite revenue headwinds in the period, we delivered strong operational performance. The actions we're taking to expand our margins are starting to take hold. We also took steps to improve our balance sheet by deploying $100 million of cash to retire debt and debt-like obligations. If we look back at the past year, you can see we've taken significant steps to better position the company for growth and improve financial performance. In May, we launched M2016, which represents our commitment to achieve a 10% EBITDA margin, $400 million in debt reduction and an incremental $500 million of new business awards in fiscal year 2016. Our EBITDA margin for the year was 7.1% on $3.7 billion of revenue, down due to lower volumes in all markets. Despite the fact the revenue for the year was down more than $700 million, we were able to limit downside conversion to approximately 12%. We were able to do this through solid operating and material performance, combined with restructuring actions announced earlier in the year that reduced SG&A and other fixed costs. Overall, we are pleased with our margin performance for fiscal 2013 in spite of lower revenue levels. We expect the actions taken in 2013 will drive continued margin expansion in fiscal year 2014, even though we do not anticipate revenue growth. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a look at our performance quarter-over-quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 was $909 million, a decrease of $84 million from the third quarter, driven primarily by North American truck, typical seasonality in Europe, softening in India and the next production step-down in defense. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million in the fourth quarter, down $17 million from the prior period, driven primarily by lower sales. Adjusted EBITDA was 7.7% for the quarter, as I mentioned earlier. In the fourth quarter, we made a $54 million voluntary pension contribution, as well as a $33 million income tax payment associated with the gain on the sale of our ownership interest in Suspensys. As a result, free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was negative $36 million for the quarter. Please turn to Slide 5. As we've told you, M2016 has specific targets in 4 key areas that we believe will drive achievement in our 3 metrics for EBITDA margin, net debt and revenue. I'll share a few highlights with you today, but we'll provide you with more detail about the plan at our Analyst Day in February. Starting from the left, operational excellence represents the need to integrate lean concepts throughout our global manufacturing operation, with an emphasis on safety, quality, delivery and cost. We have defined targets for each of these performance indicators that we intend to achieve through continued diligence and execution of the Meritor production system. Not only are each of these measures important in terms of the well-being of our employees and the satisfactions of our customers, but they also impact our bottom line. In fiscal year 2013, we're proud to have had the best safety and quality performance in the past 6 years and the highest OE delivery performance in 3 years, with a 98% on-time delivery rate. We're also taking steps to improve labor and burden year-over-year. In fiscal 2013, we were able to partially offset the $700 million market decline through restructuring actions, and we further reduced costs with a series of burden optimization actions. The next pillar represents our clear priority on customer value. We plan to continue strengthening our relationships with our current customers, developing our relationships with new ones and substantially enhancing our product portfolio as we maximize Meritor value proposition in the market. We're confident in our ability to grow the company organically, and we'll highlight for you our wins last fiscal year with OEs in the 4 major regions of the world. Related to product costs, we intend to drive reductions in net material performance using 3 different approaches. While commercial negotiations will always play a part in managing product costs, we're also actively engage in a best-country sourcing and technical innovation that we believe are more permanent cost-reduction strategies. We're devoting more resources to these strategic process that we anticipate will account for 2/3 of our material performance as we reach 2016. Another key element is to increase inventory turns as the means to improve our working capital performance. Due to the inventory-intensive nature of our business, we typically run 7 to 8 turns a year. We believe we can improve that number. Finally, we recognize that M2016 is only achievable if our team is engaged. I believe we have the right leadership team and required degree of commitment from our employees to create the level of sustainable performance improvement we want. If you turn to Slide 6, we'll provide additional context around each of the 3 key metrics we've established. Our first financial metric is to achieve a 10% adjusted EBITDA margin. Historically, our cash flow breakeven level has been 7% to 7.5%. At 10%, we would generate meaningful cash flow, and that's our target for 2016. Specifically, we expect to generate 1.5 to 2 points of margin in the next 3 years through successful execution of non-volume-related actions. Even if volumes were to stay essentially flat, we are driving margin expansion and expected to be in an 8.5% to 9% margin in 3 years. With some level of market recovery and new business wins, we expect to gain an additional 1 to 1.5 points of margin. Relative to prior years, sales were down in all regions this past year. As Kevin will discuss, we expect most of these markets to remain challenged in 2014. And while we remain bullish that global markets will strengthen during this 3-year time frame, our plan is not overly dependent on this recovery. We are also developing a strong pipeline of new products that will drive increased sales during this period. We anticipate that regional market improvement combined with new business wins will increase our revenue to around $4.5 billion by 2016. Let's turn to Slide 7. Our target is to reduce net debt, including retirement benefits, by $400 million by the end of fiscal year 2016. This 20% reduction on our debt levels, combined with a 10% margin target and revenue of $4.5 billion, would give us metrics on par with a BB credit rating. At this rating, we believe we'll optimize our cost of capital. This past year, we achieved $217 million of net debt reduction through the sale of our 50% ownership in a Brazilian joint venture and steps we took to improve the funded status of our pension plans. We are halfway there, but we have more work to do. On Slide 8, we're providing more color on our target of $500 million per year of incremental booked revenue at run rate. While we'll continue to manage the short-term cycles typical in this industry, we have the ability to grow beyond the peak cycles. We believe our strength in engineering and manufacturing combined with growing customer relationships and leading market positions will lead to organic growth independent of market recovery. By the end of fiscal year 2016, we expect to secure new business wins, resulting in $500 million of revenue at run rate, of which $250 million we expect to be on our P&L. We're tracking ourselves against the $500 million and are proud to announce that in fiscal year 2013, we secured $120 million in new business wins. Of that, we expect to realize $110 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2016. The wins we're highlighting today move us about 40% of the way to achieving the $250 million we expect in 2016. As you can see in the chart, the vast majority of this revenue will come from new business in South America, India and Europe. The wins we highlight in the next few slides represent the diversity of our growth opportunities. On Slide 9, we highlight several axle wins with important customers in South America, including MAN, DAF, Ford and Mercedes. Today, we're pleased to announce a new contract with MAN for Phevos program. The majority of this business is a conquest win for Meritor to supply front and rear axles for this customer's 8 and 10-truck platforms. Our local footprint in Brazil combined with extensive design and manufacturing expertise will enable us to supply axles for this contract that meet or exceed our customer's requirement of power density, efficiency, durability and reliability. As we told you last quarter, we'll also supply axles for DAF's new extra heavy-duty trucks to be built at its new plant in Brazil. This award further expands our relationship with Paccar globally. If you turn to Slide 10, we're expanding our business in India with major customers in that region as well. Another new contract we're announcing today is with Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery, a joint venture between Tata Motors and Hitachi Construction. Meritor will supply axles for this customer's deep mining dump trucks. Earlier this year, we told you about new business to supply axles for Ashok Leyland and Mahindra in the light commercial vehicle segment. To support these heavy-truck customers, on the lighter end of the range, we'll manufacture our 10X axle with cold-formed housing. This is the lightest-weight axle in our portfolio. We also announced earlier this year our contract with Daimler India for Meritor's hub reduction axles. As global experts in hub reduction, we've localized this complex axle for India from our existing platform in Europe. We've said previously that we're excited about the long-term growth and potential. Although sales declined close to 40% year-over-year, we remain optimistic about the opportunities in this market. Please turn to Slide 11. We announced earlier in fiscal year 2013 that we had secured new business with Volvo in North America for our EX+ air disc brakes. We also told you about a new disc brake program in Europe with a major OE. This contract also represents a conquest win for us. We have significantly invested in our brake technical center and manufacturing operation in the United Kingdom, and we look forward to increasing our share of the air disc brakes in Europe over the next several years. As I said earlier, growing our top line with new customers and products is a primary focus for us. Our ability to meet our M2016 margin target requires organic growth. As you can see, we are winning in the marketplace. We're getting conquest business, but we're not sitting still. We have a lot of work to do to achieve our objectives, but the important thing is we know what we need to do and have the plans to get there. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.
Kevin Nowlan: Thanks, Ike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our guidance for 2014. Slide 12 compares our actual results for fiscal year 2013 to the outlook we provided on July 31. Sales for the year were just over $3.7 billion, which was slightly below the bottom end of our outlook. We had lower-than-anticipated sales in our India, South America and China markets, as these economies were slightly weaker-than-expected. We delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.1%, or $261 million. Despite the revenue headwinds, we were able to deliver our margin guidance of approximately 7% through solid operational execution, continued net material performance, fixed cost reductions and aftermarket pricing actions. We earned $0.40 in adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2013, which exceeded the upper end of our outlook. This was primarily due to the better mix of earnings from a tax perspective that resulted in a lower effective tax rate. As Ike mentioned, we made a $54 million voluntary pension contribution in the last week of our fiscal year to prefund our 2014 requirements in the U.S. and U.K. Including this contribution, our reported free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was negative $109 million. However, our free cash flow guidance did not contemplate this opportunistic pension contribution, nor did it include the $33 million of withholding tax payments associated with the gain on sale of our ownership in Suspensys. Excluding these 2 items, free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was negative $22 million, which was in line with our expectations. Although we experienced revenue headwinds in nearly every market we serve, we were able to deliver on our earnings guidance in 2013 through solid execution. This execution has created momentum in the organization to continue to drive margin performance in the face of near-term revenue headwinds. It has also improved our operating leverage, which gives us confidence in our ability to improve margins as the global markets recover. On Slide 13, you will see our fourth quarter income statement from continuing operations compared to the prior year. We have also included a similar slide for the full year 2013 in the appendix for your convenience. Sales of $909 million in the fourth quarter were down $77 million year-over-year, or 7.8%. The decrease in sales is primarily in the commercial truck and industrial segment and was driven by lower military sales, as the FMTV production continued its planned wind down. In addition, our production levels were lower in North America, China and India. These declines were partially offset by year-over-year increases in South America and Europe. In recent months, European production has been positively impacted by prebuy activity in advance of the Euro 6 emissions changeover scheduled for January 2014. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 11.7% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. This improvement includes a $5 million supplier recovery relating to the warranty contingency that we booked in the third quarter of 2013. We have excluded this recovery from adjusted EBITDA, consistent with the charge we took on this matter in the third fiscal quarter. SG&A of $60 million was $20 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2013 versus the same period in 2012. As you'll recall, we executed a series of cost reduction actions earlier in the year, which favorably impacted both gross margin and SG&A on a year-over-year basis. In addition, last year, we had higher year-end asbestos valuation adjustments, as we changed our actuarial assumptions related to our Rockwell liability to include a 10-year estimate of the liability versus the 4-year estimate we had been previously using. Next, you'll see a line item related to pretax pension settlement loss of $73 million that we incurred in this past quarter. This noncash charge relates to pension buyouts of term-vested participants in our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Consistent with our strategy to derisk our pension plans, the execution of these buyouts released the company of approximately $197 million of gross U.S. pension liabilities based on the 2012 pension valuation. Pension plan assets of $157 million were used to settle these liabilities, which resulted in a year-over-year improvement to the funded status of the U.S. Pension Plan of $40 million. The corresponding loss associated with the settlement of the plan was noncash and relates primarily to the acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses already reflected in book equity. Restructuring costs were $3 million favorable in the fourth quarter of 2013, which was primarily driven by the settlement of a lease obligation in China for less than the accrued liability, so we reversed the remaining reserve associated with the obligation. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of our minority interest ownership in Suspensys. Gross proceeds for this transaction totaled $195 million, which resulted at net proceeds of $160 million after taxes and fees. This resulted in a pretax book gain of $125 million. Earnings in our minority-owned affiliates were down $3 million year-over-year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower earnings from our joint venture in Mexico and by the loss of earnings from the sale of our investment in Brazil. Interest expense was $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, which is $4 million higher than the same period last year. This increase was caused by higher fixed-rate debt balances, primarily driven by the capital markets transactions executed in fiscal year 2013 to refinance and extend our debt maturities. Income tax expense was up $38 million from the fourth quarter of 2012, due in large part to the $33 million of withholding taxes related to the Suspensys sale. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $11 million. Due to the unique and material items affecting our results in the quarter, adjusted income excludes the pension settlement loss, restructuring charges, the specific warranty recovery and the gain on sale. All of this resulted in $0.11 per share of adjusted income from continuing operations, compared to $0.32 in the same period last year. On the next 2 slides, I will discuss the quarterly results for our 2 business segments. Slide 14 shows fourth quarter sales and segment EBITDA for commercial truck and industrial. Sales were $709 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, down 10% relative to the same quarter in 2012. This sales decrease reflects lower military sales and OE production volumes in North America, China and India. We did experience higher sales in Brazil year-over-year, as the fourth quarter 2012 production levels were still somewhat depressed due to the impact of the Euro 5 emissions standards. Europe was also up for us, which is due to increased order activity relating to the Euro 6 emissions change going into effect in January 2014. Segment EBITDA decreased $9 million, driven by -- primarily by the lower sales. And segment EBITDA margin decreased to 7.6% compared to 8% in the prior year. Overall, we delivered a 12% downside conversion for this segment, which is better than the 15% to 20% range we typically generate. The lower downside conversion was primarily driven by meaningful net material performance and cost improvement actions. Next, on Slide 15, we've summarized the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. This segment demonstrated considerable year-over-year margin improvement. Fourth quarter sales were $233 million, $2 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. Despite the small increase in sales, segment EBITDA increased by $6 million and EBITDA margin increased 250 basis points year-over-year to 10.3%. This improved performance reflects the benefits associated with the pricing actions executed earlier this year and lower material and structural costs. Overall, this performance reflects the efforts by the -- our aftermarket team to achieve the Meritor value proposition by ensuring we are properly compensated for the value we bring to the market. Moving to Slide 16, I'll take you through our sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from our third fiscal quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter. We generated $87 million of EBITDA in our third quarter. Relative to the third quarter, our EBITDA was lower by $12 million, due to volume, mix and pricing. The decline in volume drove this number with normal downside conversion. However, the impact of the sequential volume decline was partially offset by positive pricing in our aftermarket business. The Brazilian currency was a significant headwind in the fourth quarter, as the currency depreciated 10% from the third fiscal quarter to the fourth. That was the primary driver of the $6 million decrease quarter-over-quarter due to foreign exchange. The next item on the walk summarizes the impact associated with the reduction in earnings of our unconsolidated joint ventures. About half of this relates to lower earnings due to the sale of Suspensys. Moving to the next line item, we experienced another quarter of sequential improvement in net material, labor and burden costs. This drove $6 million of higher EBITDA in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Driving reductions in material cost and delivering operational excellence are key priorities underlying the M2016 plan. So we're pleased with our team's ability to continue to demonstrate strong performance here. Next, you recall that in the third quarter we incurred $4 million of executive severance costs, which did not repeat in the fourth quarter. And finally, we had several year-end valuation and other adjustments resulting in a net EBITDA reduction of $3 million. Overall, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $70 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.7%. Our downside conversion was approximately 20%, in line with the typical 15% to 20% we've told you to expect with changes in revenue. Now let's turn to Slide 17. For the fourth quarter, free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was negative $36 million, $73 million less than the same period last year. This lower year-over-year result is primarily due to the voluntary pension contribution and the income tax associated with the Suspensys sale that I previously discussed. Excluding these 2 items, we generated strong positive cash flow in the quarter, driven primarily by positive earnings and good working capital performance. Total free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2013 was negative $46 million, $77 million below last year, mainly due to the items I just mentioned. Now let's turn to Slide 18 for a review of our liquidity and debt maturity profile. We ended the fourth quarter with $817 million of liquidity, including $318 million of cash on hand. These are the year-end balances even after the impact of repaying $45 million of term loan debt and opportunistically prefunding our required 2014 pension contributions. Our liquidity position in relation to revenue is 22%, which is higher than our targeted range of 15% to 18%. You should expect that we will continue to use any excess liquidity to pay down debt and debt-like liabilities, consistent with our M2016 strategy. Throughout the year, we've been proactive and opportunistic in managing our debt maturity profile. We executed several capital markets transactions that now provide us with a relatively clear runway before any significant funded debt matures. Over the next 3 years, we only have $154 million of debt maturing, which we believe is very manageable, particularly given our strong liquidity profile. Next, I'd like to review our global market outlook for fiscal year 2014 on Slide 19. In the upper left, we've provided our fiscal year 2014 North America industry forecast for medium- and heavy-duty truck volumes. As you can see, we expect a stable and solid truck market in fiscal 2014. The backlog-to-build ratio for Class 8 trucks remains fairly consistent at 3.7 months and cancellation rates have continued to decline. The North America truck freight tonnage metrics are stable and are trending slightly upward, with an estimated increase in GDP of 2%. As a result of this market backdrop, we are forecasting a heavy-duty truck market of 245,000 to 255,000 units, which is up slightly from 2013 levels. Our forecast for the medium-duty and U.S. trailer market is also up slightly year-over-year. In South America, we are forecasting the medium- and heavy-duty truck market to be down slightly from 2013. Given the economic uncertainty over the last 2 quarters, the economy in Brazil has not recovered to levels we expect over the longer term. On a positive note, the Finance Ministry announced in early October that it will extend the financing incentives designed to stimulate truck and bus sales through 2014. With that backdrop, our fiscal year 2014 forecast for medium- and heavy-duty truck production is at 175,000 to 185,000 units, which at the midpoint is down 3% year-over-year. That said, some of the new business wins that I spoke about in Brazil will have an impact on 2014. So while industry production may be down, we expect our revenue to increase. In Western Europe, we are forecasting the medium- and heavy-duty truck industry volumes to increase modestly in 2014. We do expect prebuy activities to continue through our first fiscal quarter. While this prebuy is likely to be a headwind in our second and possibly third fiscal quarters, keep in mind that we are jumping off relatively weak 2013 production levels. In addition, the OEs are expressing some optimism as we move through the back half of the year, and we do see certain economic indicators in Europe improving. There is a risk to this forecast, however, particularly given the uncertainty related to the effects of the prebuy. But at this point, we do expect a modest uptick in production in 2014, resulting in a forecast for medium- and heavy-duty truck production of 365,000 to 375,000 units, which is a 4% increase year-over-year. Turning to China, the mining segment is expected to remain at depressed levels in 2014. As we provide a lot of axle content for manufacturers of cranes and mining equipment, we are not planning for any meaningful recovery in China next year. We do believe, however, that we have reached bottom and our forecasted revenue will be flat year-over-year. We continue to follow recent news reports that China may increase its future investment in infrastructure projects. If this develops, it could favorably impact the region's business in coming years, and it could have a direct impact on the segments in which we compete. The Indian market continues to be depressed, and we really do not see any tailwinds on the horizon. While the elections in the spring of 2014 will hopefully create some catalyst, we are not planning on any improvements in the Indian market next year. We expect the market to be down another 8% in 2014, given the current economic climate. As I previously said, we remain bullish on India longer term. We see this as an area for growth, which is why we continue to invest in our product portfolio to support our customer base in the region. Finally, I want to spend a few minutes talking about our defense business. As we have discussed extensively, a big component of our defense business has been the FMTV, which is now winding down over the course of the next 12 months. Our revenue from the FMTV business will be down approximately 55%, or nearly $100 million, in 2014. With that said, we are focused on winning 2 significant military programs: The HMMWV Recap and JLTV. If we were to win both, they have the potential to generate combined revenues that would be higher than our peak FMTV revenue, albeit several years out. From a timing perspective, the HMMWV Recap production award is expected to be announced in about 12 months. The JLTV program is currently in the engineering, manufacturing and development phase, which is expected to run through late 2014. The final selection for this program is targeted to be announced in late 2015. Turning to Slide 20. Based on the demand assumptions we outlined on the preceding chart, we expect sales in fiscal year 2014 to be approximately $3.7 billion. On an aggregated basis, our OE and market assumptions would suggest a modest increase in revenue. However, that increase is expected to be more than offset by the decline in the FMTV business. The new business wins that I spoke about, particularly in Brazil and our EU brake business, will also provide a little bit of good news to offset the loss of FMTV sales. Taken all together, we think the result is relatively flat year-over-year revenue. Despite the relatively flat revenue outlook, we expect to expand our EBITDA margin by approximately 40 basis points, to 7.5%. Keep in mind, this improvement would be accomplished in the year that our high-margin military business steps down 55%. We expect to drive this improved margin primarily through continued material labor and performance actions, combined with select pricing actions. This is consistent with the strategies underlying our M2016 initiative. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be $0.30 to $0.40, reflecting higher EBITDA margin and higher pretax earnings being more than offset by higher adjusted tax expense. The driver of higher tax expense is related to the mix of earnings, as we expect more relative improvement in taxpaying jurisdictions, such as China and Brazil. In 2014, we are changing our approach to guidance for free cash flow. Consistent with our M2016 strategy of reducing net debt by $400 million, we will be measuring our cash flow performance on a total free cash flow basis. For 2014, we expect total free cash flow to be breakeven to $25 million positive. We have also included our key planning assumptions for 2014 in the appendix for your convenience. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ike to provide some closing remarks around how the efforts underlying our fourth quarter performance reflect the demonstrated commitment to driving toward our key financial objectives for fiscal year 2016.
Ivor J. Evans: Thank you, Kevin. Let's turn to Slide 21. You're now familiar with the 3 financial measures we've established for 2016. We're confident we will achieve these targets because we believe the fundamentals of this company are strong. We've recognized globally -- we're recognized globally for our capabilities in designing, testing and manufacturing the best drivetrain products available anywhere. With efficiency and safety in mind, our global engineering team works with the supply chain and manufacturing to offer a technology-rich portfolio of drivetrain solutions, localized by region when needed. We effectively manage complexity for small volumes and aim to support our customer needs during periods of high volumes. The quality, durability and on-time delivery of our products has earned us the #1 market position in most of the markets we supply. We're growing organically, as demonstrated by the contracts we told you about today with large and growing global customers. Today, we had a recognized brand requested by the largest OEs and commercial truck fleets in the world, a global distribution network for aftermarket products and unmatched support and service from DriveForce to Drivetrain Express. M2016 represents the next step for us and provides the road map that will take us there. Our attention is focused on customers, products and process improvement. We're confident that if we remain committed to maximizing our performance in these areas, we'll be able to minimize the volatility inherent in this industry and achieve the targets we established to create greater value for our shareholders. Thank you. And now we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And please standby for your first question, which is from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So just wanted to -- maybe we could start with a broad revenue walk between the $3.7 billion you've guided for, for fiscal '14 and your 2016 target. Maybe a little bit more detail around the cadence of the $110 million of revenue from the new book business, the visibility for the remainder of the total $250 million that you expect and then just maybe your overall global market assumptions to underpin that $4.5 billion target.
Ivor J. Evans: Of the $110 million, we'll see some of that start in our 2014 numbers. It's obviously more hockey stick towards '16, but it will gradually increase in '15 with the full $110 million in 2016. As far as the global markets, obviously, we were concerned. They are -- our end markets are our concern. We'd like to see them stronger. But again, we've put a plan together that is not overly dependent upon end market recovery. And that's the good thing about M2016, is that we think we can do -- we can really improve our bottom line with what we're doing internally and organically without end market help.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then maybe a couple of free cash flow questions. One, what's embedded in the fiscal '14 outlook for pension contributions and cash restructuring? And then do you also have maybe, Kevin, the breakout between the pension and OPEB? I think you have it kind of both combined on Slide 17. If you have a breakout between the pension and OPEB that will be very helpful, too.
Kevin Nowlan: In terms of pension contributions in '14, it's about $11 million remaining. And we didn't prefund those because those tend to be pay-as-you-go plans. In terms of the pension and OPEB breakout, I'm going to have to get that for you out of the 10-K, I think, in terms of the breakdown. I think the pension -- I'm going to have to get that detail for you.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Firstly, any color on the Eaton trial? Any court date set at this point? And in terms of timing, I think you had previously mentioned the fall or kind of there. So is that going on now?
Ivor J. Evans: The 3 motions are still before the court. Unfortunately, a trial date has not been set. And other than that, I really can't provide any further updates, but that's the status. I mean, we're waiting for the judge to set a trial date, and that hasn't happened yet.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And can you give any color on your exposure to South America? I mean, I think some outlooks out there for Brazil are a bit more bearish. Just trying to get a gauge of, in your commercial segment, how big of an exposure there is there.
Ivor J. Evans: Jay, do you want to answer that question?
Jeffrey A. Craig: Sure. Yes. This is Jay Craig. Yes, I've just come back from Brazil in the last couple of weeks. And certainly, the market isn't recovering entirely to the levels we would have expected in the short term. As Kevin mentioned in his comments, we're still bullish on the long term. There are some segments of the market that are quite strong, due to the strong agriculture performance out of Brazil. And that tends to favor the very-heavy-truck segment because those are the vehicles required to move those goods. So you're seeing the heavy truck segment perform quite well there. And for the customers that we're aligned with, we're performing well there. But it's really the lighter heavies that has still experienced weakness since the emissions change, which caused a large price increase, which is still being digested by the market.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And any color on the percent of sales that are in your commercial segment from South America?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I'd leave that also to Kevin, but I don't think we disclose specifically what our...
Kevin Nowlan: We disclose it normally in the 10-K. I mean, I think if you look at our fiscal year '12, South America represented between 10% and 15% of revenue. And I think when you look at it again this year, you'll see it's probably in that same ZIP code.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And any color -- your tax rate seemed -- I mean, obviously, you have a lot jurisdictional issues. But, I mean, it seems like your guidance is implying almost an over 50% tax rate. Is that correct? And how do you think you can maybe get the tax rate back to a normal level over time?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes. I mean, the key for us to getting the tax rate to more normalized levels over time is to generate better earnings out of our jurisdictions in which we're not a taxpayer. Because, as you'll recall, we have valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, like in the U.S. and through our Western Europe. Which means if we generate any losses in those jurisdictions, we're not able to recognize a tax benefit. So as the earnings profiles of those geographies improve, it improves our overall effective tax rate.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And my assumption that your tax guidance, the implied rate is over 50%, or am I...
Jeffrey A. Craig: We're not giving a specific guidance on the effective tax rate. But I think you can do some math that would suggest the effective tax rate is not going to be down to the normal levels we would hope to achieve over time.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Robert Kosowsky from Sidoti & Company.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I'm just wondering on this M2016 plan you've had in place for a little bit of time now. We saw some nice margin expansion in the aftermarket side. And I'm wondering, if you can tell us like what stage of the game we're in as far as the margin expansion on aftermarket versus commercial truck?
Ivor J. Evans: We've done well with margin improvement around value-added offerings. But Pedro, do you want to add a little more color?
Pedro N. Ferro: Yes. As far as the aftermarket is concerned -- this is Pedro Ferro. We have done a strategic price. We have a large portfolio and we have internal goal now in parallel with the markets, as far as the total increase. But we have managed to change the pricing amongst the various items. And also the lower material cost, we have done a lot of work in optimizing material costs and best cost-country sourcing, as we said, and then the benefit of structural costing reductions in the beginning of the year as well. So...
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: So does that mean is there still a lot more margin expansion opportunity on the aftermarket side? Or is the bulk of the 200 basis points is going to be coming on the commercial truck side?
Kevin Nowlan: Robert, it's Kevin. It's both. I mean, if we think about the key objectives that are really driving margin expansion in M2016, I mean, you have material -- or Meritor value proposition, which is really on both commercial truck in industrial, as well as aftermarket. I think aftermarket experienced some of the successes of that in '13, but there is more to come there. As you look at reduced material costs and better labor and burden performance, that crosses both segments as well. So I don't think you should assume that we're done in one segment or the other. There's more to come in both segments.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then otherwise, for some of the new business that you're picking up, do we assume that it's margin accretive relative to your legacy business? And I understand regional kind of margin profiles differ, but is it generally -- a general rule that as you book a new business, it is margin accretive?
Ivor J. Evans: Well, without giving specific -- answering that specifically, the -- we -- the customers are -- our customers are recognizing the value of our product offerings. And I tried to outline that a little bit in my comments. These are good business wins.
Kevin Nowlan: And to that point, Robert, and you'll see it on the slide where we talk about our revenue outlook and our margin expansion over the next few years, I think it's fair to assume -- I think you'd be in the right ZIP code if you assume 15% to 20% incremental conversion on new business. Some are going to be higher, some are going to be in that range, at the lower end of that range. I think, overall, when we'd look at revenue increases up towards our 2016 targets, you should expect the incremental conversion to be in that range.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And then 2 last questions. Do you have any update on the freight liner and Volvo contract negotiations?
Jeffrey A. Craig: This is Jay, Robert. I think we're making good progress with both customers right now. I would say the relationships we have with those customers are strong. And we're having good discussions about how we both optimize the value that we provide to those customers. And I think all of us are very pleased on both sides, both the Volvo side and Daimler North America side and our side, on the progress we're making there.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, good. And then, finally, I just noticed CapEx looks like it's going to be up next year. And I was wondering what some of the things you're investing in are kind of accelerating some investments.
Ivor J. Evans: Well, it's basically, we didn't spend as much in '13. It's really at normalized level. So it's really not up versus where we've traditional been. But from a modeling standpoint, you can be in that $70 million, $80 million range.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.
Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Given that you're forecasting free cash flow of only roughly breakeven plus $25 million in FY '14 and yet you have spoken repeatedly of the need to delever the business, are there any other actions that you're maybe contemplating taking in FY '14 to help to delever the business?
Kevin Nowlan: I mean, I think our guidance really contemplates what the planning is for fiscal year '14. Keep in mind, as we talked about and Ike mentioned, we've historically had a breakeven of around 7% to 7.5%. So as we're migrating toward our 10% objective over the next couple of years, which will allow it to generate meaningful cash flow, we're still at a stage -- we're at 7.5% --- we are not throwing off a lot of cash flow. But as we see the margin expansion and the recovery of the end markets, we would expect to see that free cash flow improve even more.
Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. I was just thinking if there were any sort of other things you had in your back pocket, like the sale of Suspensys, for example, if there's anything else that you could sort of strategically -- levers you could pull strategically to help delever the business, apart from like any settlement or anything along those lines or just kind of the free cash flow?
Kevin Nowlan: I think right now, we're really focused on those M2016 strategies that Ike talked about earlier. That's really where the focus is as we head into '14.
Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then can you share what your mandatory or maybe any sort of planned discretionary contributions are in FY '14 and to the pension plan? And are those embedded in the free cash flow outlook?
Kevin Nowlan: Yes. The plan contribution, we had -- we expect another $11 million of pension contributions that we'll be making over the course of the year. The $54 million was -- that we funded at the end of last year was really what was mandatory to be contributed this year. The $11 million really represents primarily pay-as-you-go plans in some of our international jurisdictions. So the assumption embedded in our free cash flow is another $11 million of pension contributions.
Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, that's really helpful. And then just on some of the end markets, China flat versus down 40. What are you seeing there in terms of stabilization to maybe get you a little encouraged? And then on your outlook for 5 through 8 in trailers for North America, obviously, you're looking for a little bit of improvement there. But do you still believe in the idea of large pent-up demand, meaning that volumes could be significantly higher, for example, say, in FY '15, if not in FY '14?
Ivor J. Evans: We've given you our best estimate of what we think these markets will be. We've tried to be conservative. But your thoughts as to where these end markets are is as good as ours in that sense. We're at lower levels. I mean -- and the good news is that we are executing really, really well in markets that are depressed and at the lower end. So any kind of upswings that we see in any of these markets is a positive.
Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Then just last question. Your guidance seems to imply roughly $17 million higher EBITDA year-over-year, some margin expansion on flat sales, and I'm sure you can do that, given your stronger execution in the face of the revenue declines just last year. But can you just kind of help us on where that improvement comes from next year? Is it pricing? Is it cost saves? Is it mix? Is it a combination of these factors? What are the rough buckets?
Ivor J. Evans: Yes, it's a combination of. We are seeing some pricing, particularly with our aftermarket. But we've also continued to perform on our net material and labor and burden areas as well. So it's a combination of all those things.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Doug Karson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas Karson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: As I look out to 2016, the strategy to achieve 10% adjusted EBITDA margins, can you maybe give us a flavor of like the cadence? Is that going to be like back-end loaded or could we see maybe material improvement in 2015?
Kevin Nowlan: It's really a mix. I mean, as you think about some of the different elements. As you look at material, labor and burden performance, for instance, we expect to see steady progression on those each year as we move forward. As we look at some of the other things on pricing actions or even on some of the new business wins, they tend to be more back-end loaded. So I think you should expect to see sequential improvement as we head into '14, '15 and '16, but it's not going to be a straight line.
Ivor J. Evans: But the good news is we've got $110 million towards the $250 million goal, the $250 million we expect to hit in 2016. So we're 40% of the way there on that. And just to reiterate what Kevin says, we are seeing steady performance on the labor, burden and material area. Some of the pricing from aftermarket probably is a little more in '14, '15 as opposed to '16.
Douglas Karson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Right. I guess, my question here would be on capacity utilization. I've been following the sector for quite some time. And getting the capacity utilization right, it seems to be difficult for much in the an industry. How is your capacity utilization right now kind of heading into 2014? Is it where you need to be, given the outlook on what you could think 2015 could hold?
Ivor J. Evans: Well, the answer -- the quick answer is yes. But, Jay, do you want to add a little more color?
Jeffrey A. Craig: Sure. I mean, it's really consistent with what we see in the outlook for the region. So if you look at North America, it's relatively normalized replacement demands. So we are comfortable with the capacity utilization at that level. We certainly are comfortable that we could flex to higher levels there, if required. I think in Europe, there's a pretty strong prebuy going on right now. So the capacity is not, although 100% utilized, being utilized at a fairly high level. And then as we look at South America, we are probably operating at slightly lower levels than we would expect to. And certainly in China and India, it's probably far below what our capacity is right now. And we've taken actions there to align our variable and fixed costs in line with what we're seeing right now.
Douglas Karson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then -- and finally, on the free cash flow side, it looks like we're going to be either reasonably close to breakeven in the coming year. But as we head out to 2016, I'm assuming we'll be cash flow positive. Do you have any ideas of how you'd deploy that cash flow? Would it be acquisitions, CapEx, trying to delever? Or am I getting too ahead of the plan here?
Kevin Nowlan: No, you're not getting ahead. I mean, that's -- you're right on point. I mean, we are expecting to generate positive cash flow as we get through the fiscal '16, M2016 plan. And we expect to deploy that cash flow, primarily to reduce our debt and debt-like liabilities so that we can target achieving BB credit metrics.
Operator: The next question is from Kirk Ludtke from CRT Capital Group.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: With respect to the Eaton litigation. You mentioned that there's really no trial date set. And I'm just curious, is there a -- can you help us with the time line for the litigation potentially? Or are you kind of getting out of the -- trying to predict what this judge is going to do?
Ivor J. Evans: We -- you said it well. I would love for this to have moved at a faster pace. But we're dependent upon the trial judge to set a trial date, and she hasn't done it yet.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Is there -- when you think about what would be a reasonable time line for -- when does -- is there any kind of way to gauge what the particular time line...
Ivor J. Evans: Well, we've been wrong at every pass so far. Initially, we thought at early fall, and then we would say maybe late fall. It hasn't happened yet. So your guess on this one is as good as ours and as good as our outside counsel who is helping with this. So we're just dependent upon Judge Robinson to set a date.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. With respect to the HMMWV upgrade, you said something was going to happen in the next 12 months, and I missed it.
Ivor J. Evans: Jay, do you want to talk...
Jeffrey A. Craig: Yes, we're expecting a decision out of the Marines, so sometime in the next 12 months on that product. And so we're still -- I think we are very well positioned on 2 of the 4 down-selected programs. And so I think we're very pleased with our positioning there and our -- the vehicles we're aligned with are performing very, very well.
Ivor J. Evans: I might add a little bit to Jay's comment. Even though that this one does not require congressional approval, there is always an element of risk with the political process, so just as that as a caveat.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Right, I appreciate that. And when -- what would be the earliest this program would go into production, do you think?
Kevin Nowlan: 2015. I think it'd be probably a slow ramp-up in the early part of 2015, but then we -- but we would start to see production potentially in '15.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And back to the 2014 guidance for a second. You highlighted that the prebuy in Europe a couple of times. And is -- can you give us a sense for how much of the total annual production will be in the December quarter of the 3 60 for...
Kevin Nowlan: We're not really providing any guidance by quarter at this point. But you can imagine, the prebuy does have a benefit on the year overall as we think of the first quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Ivor J. Evans: Well, the good news in Europe, we've seen a prebuy and we are seeing some strengthening in the European markets, particularly the Northern Europe. So -- but we can't provide specific guidance for the quarter.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just a couple follow-ups on the other cash flow items. Did you mention pension expense in 2014? I know that funding is 11, but...
Kevin Nowlan: I didn't mention pension expense. It will be de minimis in the year. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but it's virtually nothing.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. And restructuring and working capital? I think you mentioned working capital would be a source, but I'm sure if...
Kevin Nowlan: We didn't comment one way or the other. I think it's all contemplated in the 0 to $25 million. And the same with restructuring. Historically, we've given some estimate of the restructuring bucket because it's been outside of our free cash guidance. But this year, we are giving free cash guidance in totality, inclusive of restructuring or anything else. So I think you should just assume those are all pieces or potential elements of the 0 to $25 million of guidance.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Carl Anderson for closing remarks.
Carl Anderson: Thank you for your participation in today's call. If you do have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. And with that, we will conclude our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a very good day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Quarter Three 2013 Cummins Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sheena, I’ll be your operator today. (Operator Instructions) At this time all participants in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I’d now like to turn the call over to Mark Smith, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.
Mark A. Smith: Thank you, Sheena. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2013. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and President of our Engine business, Rich Freeland. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the prepared remarks. Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website presentation for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. Now I’ll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. I will start with a summary of our third quarter, including some brief comments on each of our business segment. And then I’ll talk about our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of our second quarter financial performance and our full year forecast. Revenues for the third quarter were $4.3 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year. EBIT for the quarter was 12.6% of sales compared to 12% a year-ago. The improvement in EBIT percent this quarter was a result of gross margin expansion with material cost savings, productivity improvements and lower warrantee expenses, all contributing to stronger performance year-over-year. Revenues for the engine business declined by 1% compared to the third quarter a year-ago, with weakness in global mining and power generation demand offsetting higher revenues in truck markets in North America and Brazil. EBIT for this segment was 10.9% compared to 9.5% last year. With higher parts sales, lower material costs, improvements in warrantee expenses and stronger joint venture earnings in China, offsetting the impact of a 24% decline in high horse power unit shipments. Revenues in our Components business increased 14% due to higher demand in on-highway markets in the U.S, China and Europe. EBIT of 12.3% improved 280 basis points year-over-year due to the benefits of higher volumes and good cost control. Distribution revenues increased by 18% year-over-year, with acquisitions accounting for 16% of the improvement and organic growth adding 6%, while currency negatively impacted revenues by 4%. EBIT in the distribution business for the third quarter was 9.1% compared to 12.4% a year-ago. The decline in EBIT percent was due to the dilutive effect of acquisitions and the negative impact of currency which offset improvements in underlying operations. Power Generation revenues declined 13% year-over-year, as continued weakness in most international markets offset higher demand in North America. Third quarter revenues and new order intake were well below our expectations as demand fell sharply in India due to declining business confidence. Weaker manufacturing activity and easing the power deficits as economic activity has slowed there. Orders have also been weak for large gensets in Australia, Indonesia and other parts of Asia as a result of the cut backs in resource industries. Demand in the Middle East has also been below our expectations. Power Generation EBIT of 6.3% was down from 9% a year-ago. The benefits of higher pricing and lower engineering costs were more than offset by lower volumes and adverse mix, exacerbated by one-time costs for product coverage and legal settlements this quarter. We continue to execute our restructuring actions in Europe and reduce costs throughout the business to combat the lower levels of demand. Pat will take you through the details of our guidance for the rest of 2013. But in summary, we now expect full year revenues for the Company to be down by 4% from 2012. This is a reduction from our previous forecast that revenues would be in line with 2012. Power Generation revenues are now expected to decline 10% compared to our previous expectation of a 3% decrease. Engine business revenues are projected to be 8% lower than last year. This is lower than our previous expectation, a reduction of 5% due to lower demand from Power Generation and a lower outlook for the heavy duty truck market in North America. We now expect to deliver EBIT in the range of 12.5% to 13% of sales for the year, with the biggest change in our EBIT guidance coming from Power Generation. I want to add more details about our sales in key markets around the world. As I said, Company revenues increased 4% in the third quarter with revenues in North America up 11% and international revenues down 4%. Our shipments of engines for North American heavy duty trucks were 20,000 in the third quarter, slightly above last year, but a decrease of 6% from the second quarter and below our forecast three months ago. For the full year we are adjusting our forecast for the market size to 223,000 units, down from our previous forecast of 229,000 units. Demand for the new trucks -- demand for new trucks has not grown as much in the second half as we expected. Our market share though, was 40% year-to-date consistent with our plan and our full year guidance. We shipped 16,000 units to the North American medium duty truck market this quarter, an increase of 38% year-over-year. We expect the full year market size of approximately 110,000 units in 2013, up 3% from 2012. Our market share increased again in the third quarter and currently stands at 62% year-to-date, ahead of our previous guidance of 60%. As Navistar starts to ship trucks powered by ISB engine, we should see further market share gains going in to 2014. Demand from Chrysler decreased by 23%. Shipments in the third quarter of 2012 were very strong as dealers orders increased ahead of the 2013 model year change. Full year volumes are expected to decline 10% consistent with our prior guidance. Power Generation revenues increased by 17% in North America, boosted by sales to the U.S military. Excluding the military business, sales to our traditional markets increased 3%, reflecting the general trend of moderate growth in a number of our end markets in North America. Our international revenues decreased by 4% in the third quarter, with declines in India Australia and Europe offsetting growth in China and Brazil. Our revenues in Brazil increased 14%, with improvements in engines and components driven by stronger on-highway demand as the truck market recovers after a challenging year in 2012. Our Power Generation and Construction business also grew in the third quarter. For the full year truck production for the industry is expected to grow by 38%. However, production for the fourth quarter will be lower than the third as some OEMs take shutdown days to lower inventory. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, increased 23% year-over-year due mainly to higher demand in on-highway markets. Demand in our power generation and construction markets remains relatively weak consistent with a slower pace of infrastructure investment and weak manufacturing activity. In the medium and heavy duty truck market industry demand increased by 26% in the third quarter driven largely by pre-buy ahead of the anticipated implementation of NS4 emission regulations. Year-to-date industry sales are up 14% and we now expect full year demand to increase by 15% over 2012 compared to our previous forecast that the market will increase 5% year-over-year. The truck industry is still awaiting communication from the Chinese government regarding a specific transition plan and timetable for the new emission regulations. Although a number of cities and regions that have announced the implementation of the new regulations as growing, very few NS4 compliant products are currently being produced. We have received some orders for aftertreatment systems to be delivered in the fourth quarter which is encouraging but we continue to believe that the transition to NS4 compliant technology will be gradual. Volumes and revenues at our light-duty joint venture with Foton grew in the third quarter with revenues for the domestic market up 36%. For the full year we expect revenue growth of 66% as Foton continues to produce more vehicles equipped with our joint venture engines. Demand for excavators in the third quarter increased slightly with industry sales up 10% against extremely weak comparisons. Year-to-date industry sales are down 7% and we expect the full year to be down 4% consistent with our expectation that 2013 would be a year characterized by weak end user demand and destocking. Cummins third quarter revenues in construction increased 10% year-over-year but still remain at very depressed levels. Power generation revenues for the third quarter in China, including joint ventures, increased 21% compared to a year ago when orders were quite weak and dealers were reducing inventory. Revenues for the year are expected to be flat consistent with our prior forecast. For the full year we now expect our total revenues in China, including joint ventures, to be up 10% compared to our previous forecast of an increase of 5% with growth in on-highway markets more than offsetting weakness in off-highway markets. Of all of our markets, India is currently the most challenging. Revenues, including joint ventures, declined by 25% in the third quarter as demand dropped sharply in most end markets. Customers cut orders to lower working capital and preserve cash as business confidence declined in the face of weak industrial activity and rising inflation. Truck production for the medium and heavy commercial vehicle market declined 33% in the third quarter and we now expect a full year decline of 25%, down from our previous projection of a decline of 12%. Industry truck sales in September represent the lowest monthly total since 2003. Power generation revenues declined by 34% in India excluding the impact of currency movements as demand for power weakened with the slowing economy and an easing of the power crisis in the south of the country. We now expect full year revenues to decline by 12% compared to our prior expectations that revenues would grow 8%. We now expect full year company revenues in India, including joint ventures, to decline by 19% compared to our previous forecast of a decline of 11%. In Europe we experienced a 3% decline in revenues year-over-year. Revenues in the U.K. declined by 37% caused by weak demand for power generation equipment for rental and power projects. Weak sales to U.K. based customers were partially offset by increased sales to Russia. Sales in other European countries increased modestly. Revenues in Australia declined by 24% with the depreciation of the Australian dollar causing 10% of the reduction. Weaker demand for mining companies have affected our engine, power generation and distribution businesses there. Although demand remains weak in a number of our major markets we are encouraged by the strong interest from OEMs to partner with Cummins as they execute their global product plans. In the third quarter a number of OEMs announced plans to increase use of Cummins engines including Nissan and Navistar and this month there have been further announcements. Scania announced the ISB engine in bus applications in Europe for Euro 6, the first time a Scania vehicle has been powered by an externally sourced engine. Just this week at Fenatran, the Brazilian truck show, MAN exhibited a constellation truck powered for the first time by the Cummins ISL engine. At the same show, Ford exhibited a new vehicle that will also be Cummins powered. Our leadership is focused on driving strong financial results, despite the weak global markets, all while continuing to invest in our key programs that position us for profitable growth in the future. We continue to launch leading new products in the major markets around the world and help our customers and partners achieve competitive advantage. At the same time we improve gross margins year-over-year and our operating cash flow has increased 69% through September. There is a no question that it's a challenging period but we will continue to perform well and built for long term. Thank you for your interest today and now I'll turn it over to Pat.
Patrick J. Ward: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $4.3 billion, an increase of 4% from the third quarter of last year. North America sales which represents 54% of our third quarter revenues were up 11% from a year ago with increases in each of our four operating segments. The increase in revenue is driven by stronger demand and market share gains in the North American truck markets along with the impact of acquisitions in our distribution segment and increased military sales in our power generation business. Growth in our North American oh-highway business is partially offset by continued weakness in industrial markets, in particular mining. International sales decreased by 4% as a result of continued weakness in global industrial and power generation markets, particularly in India where we experienced a 28% decline in revenue compared to the previous year due to the slowdown in the economy and the devaluation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar. In total the stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted international sales by $65 million mainly in India, Brazil and as planned in Australia. On a more positive note, China sales improved by 20% from the third quarter of last year. Despite a 28% drop in high horsepower engine sales, gross margins improved to 26% of sales in the quarter up from 25.3% last year. This increase was the result of improved pricing, more material costs and productivity improvements, partially offset by the unfavorable product mix. Selling, admin and research and development costs increased by $23 million compared to last year but remained unchanged as a percent of sales. The acquisitions in our distribution segment accounted for $50 million of this increase. Joint venture income of $91 million was down 3% compared to year ago and negatively impacted our EBIT margin by 20 basis points. Compared to last year, lower earnings with North American distributors as a result of the acquisitions was partially offset by increased earnings in China. Earnings before interest and tax improved to $536 million or 12.6% of sales for the quarter compared to 12% of sales last year which represents a 27% incremental EBIT margin. Earnings per share were $1.90 compared to $1.86 a year ago and the tax rate was 29.2% in the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, sales were down by 6%. The engine and components segments were impacted by decreased demand in North American truck markets and we experienced reduced demand in international power generation markets. Despite the lower revenues, gross margins increased by 50 basis points when compared to last quarter. Selling, admin and research and development costs were essentially flat with the second quarter but increased as a percent of sales as a result of lower revenues in the third quarter. Joint venture income of $91 million was down $17 million compared to the prior quarter as a result of lower earnings from joint ventures in both China and in India. Other income was $20 million lower as one-time favorable items in the second quarter did not repeat in the third quarter. As a result of the lower sales and joint venture income and one-time benefits and other income recognized last quarter, earnings before interest and tax declined from $621 million or 13.7% of sales to $536 million or 12.6% of sales in the third quarter. Let's now move on to the operating segments and discuss third quarter performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year. In the engine segment, revenues were $2.5 billion a decrease of 1% from last year. Increases in North American, Brazilian and European truck markets were more than offset by a 30% reduction in sales for our power generation segment and a 33% reduction in sales to global mining markets. Compared to the prior quarter, sales were driven by 6%. Sequentially, we experienced weaker demand across most end markets and for the North American truck markets and global industrial markets. Segment EBIT was $272 million or 10.9% of sales, up from 9.5% last year with the improvement all coming in gross margins with lower material and warranty cost and improved pricing more than offsetting the headwinds from lower high horsepower engine demand in mining, oil and gas and to power generation. Sequentially, the decrease in volume and lower joint venture income resulted in EBIT margins decreasing by 190 basis points. For the full-year, we’re adjusting our forecast and now project that revenue for the Engine segment will be down 8% compared to previous guidance of down 5%. The reduced guidance results from lower demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market and international power generation markets coupled with general weakness in India. Compared to 2012 revenue decreases are driven by weakness in industrial markets in particular mining and lower demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market. This is partially offset by improved demand in the Brazilian truck market and market share gains in the North American and medium-duty truck market. We now project EBIT for the full-year to be between 10.5% and 11% of sales. In the Component segment, third quarter revenue was $1.1 billion up 14% from last year and down 4% from the prior quarter. Compared to last year, higher revenues were driven by stronger demand in global truck markets excluding India combined with market share gains and now the emission solutions business. Compared to last quarter, reduced demand in the North American heavy-duty market was partially offset by increased demand for aftertreatment systems in international markets. Segment EBIT was $132 million or 12.3% of sales up from 9.5% last year. Higher volumes along with lower material costs resulted in improved margins compared to year ago. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins improved by 10 basis points with lower warranty cost partially offset by the lower volumes. We continue to expect full-year revenue growth of 7% for the segment and compared to our previous guidance we now expect slightly weaker demand in North America to be offset by stronger demand in the China truck market. Compared to 2012, revenue increases are primarily due to increased aftertreatment market share in the North American truck markets. We now project EBIT for the full-year to be between 12% and 12.5% of sales. In the Power Generation segment third quarter sales were $712 million down 13% from both the prior-year and the prior quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2012 weakness in international markets especially India was partially offset by higher sales in our North American business. Sequentially we saw weakness in both North American and international markets including India we saw sales decline by 30%. EBIT margins were 6.3% in the quarter down from 9% last year and 9.3% last quarter. The lower EBIT margins were the result of the sharp decline in volume and from a legal settlement. For 2013, we now expect sales to decline 10% compared to last year primarily due to the weakness in international markets. The reduction in revenue guidance is primarily driven by deteriorating conditions in India and China along with weaker demand across most international markets. As a result of the weaker demand we are lowering EBIT projections for the full-year to between 7.25% and 7.75% of sales. For the Distribution segment, third quarter revenues were $944 million an increase of 18% compared to last year and a reduction of 1% compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, third quarter revenue increased 2% compared to last year and decreased 5% sequentially. Compared to the prior-year growth in parts and service revenue in North America was partially offset by weakness in North American oil and gas markets, global mining markets and international power generation markets. Currency negatively impacted revenues for the segment by 4% compared to last year. EBIT margins as a percent of sales were down 3.3% from a year ago, from a down 1.4% from last quarter. While the acquisitions completed during this time were accretive in EBIT dollar terms that were dilutive as a percent of sales and we have previously explained. Currency movements negatively impacted both EBIT dollars and the EBIT percent compared to last year and also last quarter. For 2013, we continue to forecast 10% revenue growth. However we are reducing EBIT projections for the full-year to between 10.25% and 10.75% of sales due to the expected impact of the unfavorable currency movements. Overall our third quarter results represent an improvement over the previous year, and incremental EBIT margins for the Company was slightly better than a long-term target that we communicated in our Investor Day last month. However, well we expect the third quarter revenue to be lower than the second quarter; the decline was more than we anticipated due to weakness in international power generation markets along with a significant deterioration in Indian markets and the reduction in the North American heavy-duty truck market size. As a result of this we have adjusted revenue guidance to deflect these conditions and we now project total Company revenues to be down 3% in 2013 and the forecasting EBIT margins for the Company will be in the range of 12.5% to 13% of sales down from our previous guidance of 13% to 14%. The change in EBIT guidance is driven by the lower volumes in Engine and Power Generation segments along with the negative impacts of currency which primarily impacts the Distribution segment. We are now projecting a tax rate to be 28.5% in 2013 excluding any dispute items. During the quarter we completed $1 billion debt offering, which we’ll primarily utilize to fund that acquisition of the North American distribution channel. Our debt to capital ratio has now increased to 19% and all rating agencies reiterated single A and A3 credit ratings for the Company. You should expect interest expense for the Company to rise from the current run rate of approximately $8 million a quarter to $20 million beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. We produced $1.3 billion of cash from operations year-to-date which equates to just over 10% of sales. Year-to-date we have reinvested almost $600 million back into the business and returned $600 million to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. During the third quarter we did increase our dividends to shareholders by 25% marking a 257% increase over the last four years. We will invest approximately $700 million in capital expenditure for the full-year which is below our previous projection. Inventory levels of $2.5 billion are down $60 million from this time last year. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions inventory is down $178 million from a year ago. We do expect to lower inventory levels further in the fourth quarter. And as is our practice, we will provide guidance for 2014 during our fourth quarter earnings release. Now, let me turn it back over to, Mark.
Mark A. Smith: Thank you, Pat. We are now ready for questions. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays. Please proceed. Hello, Andrew? The next question comes from Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Good morning.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Tom, can you talk about how we should think about the margin structure in Power Gen with your highest margin business obviously declining from here; can you keep that at a 20 or so percent margin business in India, and can you get the segment back to double digit margins and within that what was the exact legal settlement cost in the quarter?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Well, let me just talk first of all about what's happening in Power Gen and how I think that’s affecting margins and I’ll hopefully get to your question about, so what do I think the opportunity is. I mean, clearly we’re operating now at significantly below capacity. So we are especially in our high horsepower side which isn’t impacting mix. So we are seeing worst gross margins for the mix, and we’re also well below capacity, so we're having absorption challenges in our plants. Having said that we put in place a number of cost reduction efforts, I've mentioned those last time. We've been doing a lot of work in Europe where we've had very, very low demand for our large alternators. We've also done work across the whole business in terms of reducing costs, improving supply chain costs and as you heard from Mark [ph] pricing has been net positive despite the challenging environment. So I think we've been managing in a tough environment to try to hold our margins best we can but there's no question that we are disappointed with where we are. The biggest negative impact in this quarter was India where it was not doing well up until now, but it really fell off a lot in Q3 much more than we expected as it seemed like the economy just kind of hit a tipping point. All of a sudden people started to say we have to reduce orders and we have to preserve cash now and that was frankly a surprise to us how quickly that happened and so a whole bunch of orders were cut or pushed out towards the second half of the quarter and it looks like we'll extent into Q4, so that also impacted us. I do feel – I still believe, Jerry, that our opportunity in power gen to get back to double-digit margins is clear, our path is clear. Tony laid it out in our Analyst Day and we still see it as more than doable. Basically we've got to get our volumes and growth up, that's clear, so we can utilize some of our capacity. We've got to get our high horsepower business up which will definitely happen as markets return. And then we'll benefit from the cost reduction actions we're taking now and that will drive us up to double-digit margins. So I have complete confidence that that's going to occur. We do need the markets to turn back for it to happen.
Patrick J. Ward: Jerry, on the legal settlement, not related to a case in Brazil, it goes back to 2002, 2003 that we settled this quarter and that was for about $8 million.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays. Please proceed.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital: Hi, guys. Can you hear me now?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. Welcome back, Andy.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital: Thank you. Tom, maybe – I know you don't want to give 2014 guidance now but can you frame some of the puts and takes as we go into '14, what could be better in '14? We know about Navistar. We know about you're buying out your distribution businesses, but to bridge the gap to '15 we need a pretty strong growth here off of these levels in the second half of the year. So where do you think that comes from, what's the visibility you have today on the '14 growth?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Great question, Andy, and again without providing guidance let me just talk to you about some of the big things that are happening. Obviously economic conditions are uncertain, so I won't be able to give you much view about that because we just don't have a good view of it. That would be something that hopefully as we get closer to the time we give guidance, we'll be able to give you a better view of it. But right now we don't see a big win behind us on economic conditions. There's a few places getting a little bit better like the U.S. In most places it's not clear. But there's a whole bunch of stuff going on for Cummins which is not related to the economy that we think drives some level of growth next year. For example Euro 6 and Tier 4 Final both emissions regulations hit next year. That will have a positive impact on our components business significantly positive. You talked about distribution acquisitions, we'll start to see more and more of those come in which drive earnings dollar growth throughout the year. Where we launched a whole new range of low horsepower gen sets and those will be in the U.S. which is again one of the markets is doing a little bit better, it's a market where our share is not very large today and we have an opportunity to grow and it also helps our distribution business. We've got the ISF business which has been growing but pretty slowly. It's now starting to see some critical mass. Foton is now taking more engine, it's putting it in their vehicles, they are a very large vehicle supplier in China but also we have our highway applications now coming for the ISF. So that business is likely to improve and that's again new market share that we're not in today. The 10 and 12-liter we talked about the ISG before, it will be a slow start because it's a new launch. So our sales will grow, our profitability will be below – will achieve that maturity but it will grow through the year and improve through the year and that will be a nice add. And then of course we've been doing cost improvements all year. When we stay flat and we have cost improvements, we begin to absorb those. We see better margins at the same sales but also we'll be continuing of course to do more next year. But I think the effect of the cost reductions we have taken this year also helps us next year. So those are just wins that are coming our way I think separate from what happens in the economy.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital: Okay. That's helpful, Tom. If we look at 3Q over the last several years it's been kind of weak versus 4Q and your implied guidance talks – it seems like it talks more about flat in EPS and down actually in sales. So was this just India being extremely weak at the end of the quarter that makes you guide like this? And is it also as you mentioned – I think you mentioned Brazil is down sequentially also?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, Andy. Hi, this is Pat. Yes, I think India is a big factor in us taking a more prudent position in the fourth quarter than what we may have done in the past. The drop off really in the last couple of months in the third quarter did catch us by surprise and there's no signs that those markets are going to recover anytime soon. The other area I would throw into the mix here would be the North American truck market, the heavy duty truck market which we're seeing weaker demand than what we envisaged three months ago.
N. Thomas Linebarger: You may remember we cannot envision the truck market kind of getting better each quarter. I mean there's a pretty big improvement from Q1 to Q2 and then steady improvement and in fact that started out that way and then started to level out and head down again, so that's just worst across our components and engine business for North American heavy duty truck.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital: Okay, guys. I appreciate it.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Thanks again.
Operator: Steve Volkmann with Jefferies, please proceed.
Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Morning.
Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC: I'm wondering if I can just expand this maybe a little bit further. It sounds like things sort of – obviously you gave the preliminary view that things were a little bit weaker than you expected when you were at the Analyst Day and it sounds like maybe I don't want to put words in your mouth, but they actually sort of deteriorated further from that point. And I guess I'm just trying to put this in the big picture. Do you still believe that the 2015 targets you put out there are achievable given what you're seeing now especially with the India weakness or should we be reevaluating that a little bit?
N. Thomas Linebarger: You may remember, Steve, that as we set targets we're always looking at trying to understand targets in the face of market conditions we're in and they vary by market conditions. But as we stand now we still believe we can hit our 2015 targets. And when we don't think so we'll tell you that. Right now it's too early to tell what economic conditions we're going to have for 2014 and 2015 and as we understand it, we'll definitely share with you. But right now we're still headed for those targets. There's no question as you said that Q3 which is one quarter was weaker than we expected and as Pat highlighted, the parts that were weaker were India which really – I mean it was already that, so we already had a weak forecast in but it was a lot weaker than we thought. And then as we said the North American kind of crept down some. On the high horsepower side the reason we saw things weaker when we talked before is that the high horsepower markets have been to the bottom end of our ranges in nearly every market. So mining hit the bottom end of the range, high horsepower power gen is now below the bottom end of the range, so a whole bunch of those there's not really way out but everything is bad as it could be. And then you added these other two things in and we just had no room in Q3 really to make it up. So that's what happened in Q3, but we still got a lot of favorable things happened in 2014 despite the markets so we're still shooting for our 2015 targets.
Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC: Okay, great. That's helpful. Then I guess I know we ask you think every quarter so I'll try again and see what happens, but obviously it seems like Navistar is the biggest swing factor ex-market growth next year and is it going to be a big deal I guess as to where these numbers settle out for 2014? Can you give us any help yet in sort of putting parameters around what you think that opportunity is specifically?
N. Thomas Linebarger: No. I appreciate you asking again. No, thanks. But you probably understand the sensitivity of that in terms of market planning for them and for us and all that kind of thing but it is a good opportunity but again, it's one of many. I talked about them before but the Euro 6 and Tier 4 Final will be significant opportunities for our components business and those will be big ones and the distributor acquisitions will continue to contribute. So there's a number of good new product launches. I mean one of the things you can say about us is that over last two years or year and a half while growth has been relatively modest given the markets, we've continued to invest to make sure we've got new products available. Those will help us in 2014 and as markets return, they'll help us even more which is why I remain confident about our 2015 target. So I think those give us some tailwind even in flat markets.
Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC: Again I appreciate it.
Patrick J. Ward: I’ll just add one more comment on Navistar. We’re on track if you look at the heavy duty for what our share would be at Navistar. So, we’re approaching 60% which is actually higher than we’ve simulated and our medium duty share with the beginnings in Navistar were now up to 62%. So if you recall we talked -- as recent as five years ago we’re at 38%. So we see more upside to grow in the medium duty share as we move forward in 2014.
Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC: Okay. I appreciate it.
Operator: Next our question is from Jamie Cook, Crédit Suisse. Please proceed.
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Hi. Good morning.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Good morning, Jamie.
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess a couple of questions. One thing you had pretty good margin performance on the gross margin line which was impressive, but I guess as I look at your SG&A levels as a percent of sales or on a dollar basis, just given where revenues are going. I am just wondering if there’s more opportunity there versus what we’re seeing today. If you could talk about some of the actions that you’re taking there and then I guess my next question on the Engine side, you cited material cost and warranty cost I think helps you. How much was that versus mix which was a headwind? And then just my last question on Power Gen, in some of the other industrial companies I cover we’re starting to hear about pricing deterioration, in Ag, and construction equipment, I am wondering on Power Gen is pricing taking a turn for the worst? Thanks.
N. Thomas Linebarger: So, Jamie why don’t I address SAR and Power Gen. Pat, maybe you can talk a little bit about the mix of numbers or Mark can.
Patrick J. Ward: Sure, yes.
N. Thomas Linebarger: On the SAR side, that’s something we – as you’d guess we take a pretty good look at and that the balance that we’re striking on the SAR side is we definitely see relatively weak economic condition today, so we need to keep our cost down, we need to keep finding ways to reduce cost. On the other hand we need to invest to make sure that we’ve got future growth. So we’re balancing those two and we have talked about that before, but my leadership team spends a lot of time, going through project by project to figure where can we reduce, where we can delay, where do we want to carry on and we’re doing that even more and it’s just getting with growth again not really coming in the last few quarters, it's getting tougher and tougher. So we’re having some pretty tough conversations about that. I think you’ll continue to see us keep a very tight squeeze on SAR. One thing I just want to highlight to you is versus a year-ago, acquisitions was half of the increase in SAR. So if you just look at SAR year-over-year were about the same in dollar terms. And so we’re not really growing very much and sales aren’t growing very much so that’s about what we can afford to do. So I think we’re keeping a tight lid on it that we’re definitely looking for opportunities to reduce everywhere. In Power Gen, remind me our question on Power Gen?
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Well my question was on Power Gen just are you seeing -- you talked about maybe you talked about India and I am just wondering if pricing is becoming a factor or discount.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yeah, and so far Jamie we have not seen deterioration in pricing. Obviously it’s something we take a good look at and if not that we don’t see competition here and there where something gets more aggressive, it does happen, but generally speaking I’d say pricing is held up pretty well in fact we’ll – we’ve put in a pricing initiative to improve pricing this year and we’ll get some pricing benefit year-over-year in Power Gen. So we’ll see how it goes, but so far that’s not been a major impact again other than individual deals we obviously see competition now. But our expectation is that it will be up a percent or something in pricing.
Patrick J. Ward: And Jamie the question on …
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Pat, yes – sorry go ahead.
Patrick J. Ward: Okay, the question on the …?
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Engine.
Patrick J. Ward: The Engine…
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: What was the material cost warranty versus mix?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. So if you look year-over-year for the Engine segment, despite sales being down, (indiscernible) business actually improved the gross margins from 20.5% to 22%. So that was terrific. Pricing was about 1.5, 2 percentage points of that. Material cost was about 1% of that and then the volume mix that went the other way was about 1.5 percentage points. Warranty was a little bit better but we’re talking 10s of a point now.
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. I’ll get back in queue. Thanks.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Thanks, Jamie.
Operator: Ann Duignan, JP Morgan. Please proceed.
Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Hi. Good morning, guys. How are you?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Hi, Ann.
Patrick J. Ward: Good.
Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Good, can you talk a little bit just philosophically I guess, what do you think is going on in the North America heavy-duty truck market, I mean we hear a lot anecdotally by the hours of service we’re about GPS, lack of drivers. I mean what’s your sense of what’s going on there and to that question, why do you think there’s such a big disparity between what we’re seeing in heavy-duty versus medium-duty; just be interested in getting your color.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Okay. Let me take a first short at this. I haven't said that we’ve been wrong most of the last few times we talked about heavy-duty truck. But right now it appears and we talked to the same people you do to the fleets, I mean the bigger fleets are kind of in a replacement mode and generally folks are not expanding fleets despite some pretty positive things if you look macro at the market, used truck prices look good, the ages of fleets, freights up. But we kind of -- we see going sideways right now quite frankly with despite it appears to be some positive things that we would expect. On the medium-duty side I think it's – we’ve gotten some help from the housing market is a piece that’s helped us there in North America and so that’s the market that’s up some, and then plus we’ve gained share through the years on that. So, again it's – we have seen the impact of the natural gas has s come in too, it has filled in some of that gap as we’ve introduced ISX12. So -- and the only thing I would add, broadly speaking in the truck market I think we’re seeing the same thing we’re seeing in most business-to-business environments in the U.S. If conditions are okay and they’re growing slowly, but business confidence is not very high for major investments. Basically people are making small investments and conservative investments, they’re not hiring that much. So it's not that they’re not doing anything, but it's pretty conservative and pretty slow versus as you know we see in the consumer economy is a little bit more robust. But business-to-business is not – we just add ATA a lot of our folks were interacting with a lot of fleets and nobody thought it was a disaster but nobody was getting ahead of themselves, they’re all kind of just staying within their – within the fairway here about what they think they can afford, they’ll buy trucks when they have a new route, they’ll replace trucks that look like their past and that’s what they’re going to do.
Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. That’s helpful. And just to touch on the 12-liter natural gas, can you give us an update there. There was a lot of excitement earlier in the year from the OEMs. How is the launch of that engine going? Is it in line with your expectations better or just slower ramping up given the macro, just an update there please? Thank you.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Sure. So we rolled out the full line in August with the higher ratings and in fact the acceptance has been good where again we’re now engineered in with all the OEs in North America, in fact our sales are running a bit higher than our internal projections.
Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, I’ll leave it there and I’ll get back in line. Thanks guys.
Operator: Andrew Casey, Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thanks. Well, good morning everyone.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Good morning, Andy.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Just a little bit back to Ann’s question on the NAFTA truck market, the end-use customers have obviously seen some challenges. I’m wondering if you’ve seen any industry order activity acceleration during October.
N. Thomas Linebarger: No, we haven't Andy. We’ll be delayed from the truck guys obviously, Andy so you’ll -- obviously you’ll talk to them I assume and see, but right now if you look at build rates or whatever we’re not seeing anything accelerating in build rates.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And then the same sort of question on the oil and gas markets, but are you seeing any movement in drawdown on the excess inventory that you talked about over the last couple of calls?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yeah, it appears that we’re seeing the bottom of that, and in fact they’re from very low comparables. But we’re seeing a bit of an uptick in the order rate oil and gas, and we talk to folks that if much of the equipment is been moved from the shale gas into the oil side and so equipment appears to be utilization rates are pretty good right now. And so that’s when we see the -- we have shaken out most inventory, and I’ve seen at least real short signs of some improvement there in order rates to us.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: That’s good. And then one last one; we’ve heard some kind of mix commentary about a Brazilian truck market. Are you guys seeing any change in trajectory down there or is it still pretty positive?
Patrick J. Ward: Well, as I mentioned in my remarks Andy, the only thing I’d say is that the Q4 looks like build rates will drop a little bit because people will take some shutdowns which – again they're saying they manage the inventory and things that gives you some cause for concern. The other thing I hear about is that FINAME [ph] rates might increase, so there's a lot of discussion about how the government's trying to manage costs and they've got their own budget challenges and things like that, so they're talking about pushing FINAME rates up which again could drive down volumes. So there's a couple of headwinds I'd say in the market but as I mentioned, things have significantly improved from last year. Truck markets' generally pretty good especially at the heavy end, the part that help support in the ag markets which are pretty robust, that part of the truck market looks quite good. The rest of the truck market looks like the rest of the economy which is some level of growth but not awesome.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: David Leiker from Bob, please proceed.
David Leiker - Robert W Baird & Co. Inc.: Hi. Just two things I want to talk about and I know we talked about pricing a little bit earlier, but in your mining end markets and your power gen end markets look pretty weak and in those types of environments usually you see discounting or incentives or things like that. You don't seem to indicate that any of that's happening.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. I mean again as I mentioned, it doesn't mean an individual deal or an individual market. There's isn't some work on that. But generally speaking I would say in those markets because there's relatively few players, all those players are in for a long run; the products are pretty highly engineered. The customers are generally not looking for a 3% off. They either have the money to do the project or they don't, right, or they want to get the mine running or they don't. So there's a little bit less of this mentality. Well, I do it for 5% less but I wouldn't do it for that price. A little bit less in those segments of the market. Again, it's not that that doesn't happen but has not been an overwhelming trend. We did see it a decade or so ago when there was a lot of overhand in the rental business. And one of the things I mentioned in my remarks and several comments were rental demand is down a lot. And rental demand tends to be one that sort of swings more to adjust the capacity when they start to see downturn, they got to bring down capital purchases a lot to make sure they don't get too much equipment. That has happened. So some of our big customers like Aggreko have cut orders dramatically, a bunch of Middle East rental players also cut dramatically and what that will do is help prices. I mean it's really bad for demand but it helps prices because the rental inventory overhand doesn't drive down prices.
David Leiker - Robert W Baird & Co. Inc.: All right. Okay, great. Thanks. Then one additional item. Nice wins at Scania and MAN, can you talk a little bit and provide some color, are those new engines in terms of replacements, are those replacing internal engines, are they a new range of engines within those OEMs, just a little color please?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, great. Those are both new ranges for those guides. So think in the Constellation truck example that's MAN and they're basically the power requirements of customers in those mid range or small heavy trucks is going up. So people are asking for more power to do more things. It's just the typical evolution of the truck market and the Constellation which is an incredibly popular truck has been for years is just pushing up the power and we've been working on that with them for years and it's a terrific launch, it's a great vehicle. We'll be really well accepted given the demand, so that's that one. On the Scania side, they don't offer much in this lower range of products. So they've had generally heavy trucks and heavy buses. This mid range engine that we're providing for them just gives them a little bit smaller, shorter bus to compete in more markets. So for them it's an opportunity to expand their product range.
David Leiker - Robert W Baird & Co. Inc.: If you look across the market in your customers, how many more opportunities are there for share gains of product extensions at your customers?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, I appreciate the question. I mean this is the bright spot I was trying to cover. I mean it's a tough economy and you got to figure out where you think the opportunities are. But we are getting more positions at more OEMs than ever. Why is that? Because we've got global scale especially in our mid range business. We make more mid range engines than anybody by 10 times. I mean we are so much larger and we're in every market with every technology. Plus because we're launching all these new emission products that means when you buy one of our engines at any size range, you can launch it in Brazil, you can launch an earlier version in China, you can launch an even earlier version in Africa and you can even eventually take it to the U.S. if you want to. So you partner with us, you get a lot of choices in terms of international expansion. So every OEM – OEMs who have never talked to us before – Scania has never had an outside engine, said, okay we'll try it. It's the only way they can compete in that size engine. So I see us getting win after win in off-highway, I mean that's even more. I mean the volume numbers are lower in off-highway applications but it's even more wins. So I see us having lots of opportunities there and if we see an economic upturn and we actually see markets grow, all this stuff will turn into significant revenue and profit opportunity for Cummins.
David Leiker - Robert W Baird & Co. Inc.: That sounds very helpful [ph]. Thank you for the time.
Operator: The next question is from Alex Potter, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Alexander Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies: Hi, guys. First, when you were kind of running through the list of incremental opportunities that you have in 2014, I noticed that you left NS4 in China out. Is that just because it's tough to predict or appreciate I guess a little color there?
N. Thomas Linebarger: No, it's a great question. I know you pay pretty close attention to this. Our view is it's gradually – the transition's going to gradual and because you're launching new products, we'll see gradual increase in volume and relatively modest margins to start with that would get better over time. So I was just looking at the opportunity and say, yes, it's there but there's not a bunch of dollars to counter the bottom line unless the transition goes faster than we anticipate. So it's a great opportunity for Cummins. I didn't mean to say that, just to say like if I think through how much is that going to contribute to growth and profit and based on our assumptions how gradual it's going to be, it doesn't look terrific until at least towards the end of the year. But as you said there's a lot of uncertainly about that. I mean the fact the government hasn't given guidance is remarkable. Companies are acting like they have guidance because they have no choice. There are definitely buying some few vehicles and a few engines and aftertreatment systems and figuring how they can set them up and be ready. But there's just very little volume today and very little clarity about when there will be volume.
Alexander Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies: Okay, fair enough. Was wondering then also I guess on – again on power gen this time in Europe, how much longer do you think it will take before restructuring is complete there?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. We'll be done with it for sure by the end of the year and that assumes again that we've kind of reached the bottom of our volume curve. We of course always relook. If things got worse, we'd have to take more action. That's kind of where we are. We're quite a bit below full capacity in our power gen business especially in our European plant, so we take another look. But for the program we're running now, we'll be done at the end of the year.
Alexander Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Kauffman, Buckingham Research. Please proceed.
Jeffrey Kauffman - Buckingham Research: Thank you very much. You clarified the currency impact on the revenue line, mostly distribution. Could you clarify the currency impact on an operating profit line?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. For the company, Jeff, if I compare Q3 to Q3s, the currency impact on sales was $65 million, the currency impact on the EBIT line was $6 million. So for the company overall, it wasn't such a big deal for the distribution segment. They're always more exposed given their profile to currency movements in any of the other three segments.
Jeffrey Kauffman - Buckingham Research: Okay. And if I just kind of hear all the commentary talking about the end markets and at the end of the day, is this more a function and let's take India and put that in some special bucket. Is this more a function of weak markets just not improving as much as we thought in terms of the disappointing guidance or is this a function of your view on global growth changing?
N. Thomas Linebarger: I think it's really three things, Jeff, to summarize. Again, there is a lot of changes but just get through each three big ones. Number one is that the high horsepower market trends, so the mining, power generation, the big project kind of work, all that stuff is at the bottom of its range. So it's not really a different thing, it's just worse.
Jeffrey Kauffman - Buckingham Research: Right, so that's bucket one where it was weak and we didn't see it get better?
N. Thomas Linebarger: We didn't think it would get better but it just got worse; exactly.
Jeffrey Kauffman - Buckingham Research: Okay, all right.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Second one was – I would put in the second bucket which is we thought North American truck will get steadily better through the year and it actually turn back and started to get flat or worse.
Jeffrey Kauffman - Buckingham Research: And do you view that more as a shorter term concern, given where the market is and maybe some weaker profits of the truckers, because we do have a lot of new product coming in the market next year or do you read that as a change in the market?
N. Thomas Linebarger: I think it’s just a weaker situation. I think basically we are in the same condition in North American truck, we’ve been for a long time, which is that as Rich was saying there people are replacing trucks that’s fine, but they’re not really growing any fleet. And if you look at so when the truck companies kind of build their stock and anticipate what people -- they overcall by a little bit and then now they had the cut build rates and so -- and order rates are not really growing, so we ended up a little weaker Q3 and Q4 than we thought. It’s not a big change, right. But it’s bringing up in this low market to pinch us, but it’s not a gigantic change in market -- shift in market, right. What we really need is we need confidence in the U.S economy to grow, so business-to-business investment goes up and then we will see a real bounce back. And the third -- the third bucket really is India. In India I would just say to you that I think we should have seen it better than we did. The market was already bad and it just turned a lot worse in Q3 than we anticipated. I’m disappointed that we didn’t see that earlier on, one thing you step back from these kind of things and say wow, how come we didn’t know it’s going to fall so much, but it really took a turn for the worse in Q3 and we just didn’t see it. I mean we know it was bad, but it got a lot worse.
Jeffrey Kauffman - Buckingham Research: And if I -- I’m understanding your commentary properly in your view yes it got worse, but it’s really been exacerbated by an inventory draw down?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes.
Jeffrey Kauffman - Buckingham Research: Okay. All right.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes and that’s people kind of preserve cash because they’ve lost confidence.
Jeffrey Kauffman - Buckingham Research: All right. Thank you.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Wertheimer of Vertical Research. Please proceed.
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Hey, good morning.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Hi Rob.
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Actually just to follow-up on that inventory drawdown -- Komatsu kind of cut their numbers both on mining, OEM and aftermarket during the quarter. Is there an abnormally bad swing this quarter just as they call up the market, maybe you’re already there, can you just talk about whether that was an incremental negative.
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. It wasn’t -- the inventory drawdown was really in Power Gen in India. Mining is kind of tracking exactly where we’ve said pretty much all year Rob. So year-to-date we’re down 42% in mining, engine revenues and for the full year we will may be towards the upper end of the down 40% to 45%.
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay.
Patrick J. Ward: So nothing -- related to mining in this quarter, it’s Power Gen in India.
N. Thomas Linebarger: I think the comments you’re hearing from Komatsu and other people are them catching up. Each mining company had a slightly more positive, slightly less positive outlook and they’re all just trying to get back to where the outlook is really going to come out, which is its -- and it’s going to be -- we gave a pretty lousy forecast for the year and it’s going to be at the bottom end of our lousy forecast. So it’s bad. I mean there is no question that mining is bad, but different companies are just getting catching up to where the market is versus what their -- how optimistic or pessimistic their market outlook was.
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Perfect. Can you update the mining aftermarket for the quarter and the year? And then is there anything to say on Power Gen in the Middle East, which I think you said was soft and I didn’t expect that Thanks.
N. Thomas Linebarger: I will do the Middle East first and then I will let Mark talk a little bit aftermarket. The Middle East -- the things are improving in the Middle East. I was just there, I just spent a week there, and definitely like in Dubai and Saudi, you see projects starting to ramp up, buildings going again in Dubai and again Saudi, the oil price is high enough that they are definitely building. So projects are going versus the last -- over the 12 months projects were basically on stop. They are going again. But the rental business, which is the guys who go out and do projects around the region, they have sort of cut orders in order to make sure they don’t end up with too much equipment since projects have been so weak for the last 12 months or so. So my own view is that Middle East will eventually come back up and start going again, but right now it’s just a question of settling -- letting some of the inventory drawdown as orders improve, which they are. Q3 -- even Q3, orders improved and Q4, orders will improve again, I expect. But they will drawdown inventory and then we will start to see equipment shipments into the Middle East.
Mark A. Smith: And then on the mining -- last comment, Rob, on the mining aftermarket, we said the full year we expected to be flat. We have picked it from that weak point Q4 last few years were down about 1%. So maybe just touch below our forecast. The comps get easier on aftermarket in Q4 because we saw a pretty big drawdown, so not a lot of variation.
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Perfect. Thank you.
Mark A. Smith: Thanks.
Patrick J. Ward: All right. Thank you very much everybody.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mark Smith for closing remarks. Thank you, Mark. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Meritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Catena, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Christy Daehnert, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Christy Daehnert: Thank you, Catena. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Chip McClure, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Kevin Nowlan, Senior Vice President and CFO. The slides accompanying today's call are available at www.meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc.

To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Chip.
Charles G. McClure: Thank you, Christy, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 3. I'm proud of our team's performance this quarter. On a sequential basis, we delivered improved financial performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Quarter-over-quarter, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 120 basis points. We delivered $12 million in incremental EBITDA in the second quarter, an increased revenue of $17 million, a 71% conversion as compared to our more normal conversion of 15% to 20%. This result was primarily due to higher volumes in South America resulting in a positive margin mix, net material performance improvements, seasonal aftermarket pricing actions, benefits of structural cost reductions and improving some labor and burden. This quarter, we have new business wins to tell you about in North and South America, Europe and India. Each of these are significant for us as we grow relationships with existing customers and develop relationships with new ones. Also this quarter, we completed the consolidation of our North American remanufacturing business announced in November 2012. This consolidation involved transferring operations from a facility in Canada that remanufactured commercial component to our North American center of excellence in Plainfield, Indiana. And in China, we initiated actions this quarter to move our on-highway business from its current location in Wuxi, China to our off-highway joint venture facility in Xuzhou. By consolidating these 2 operations in the same location, we're confident we can improve efficiency, preserve revenue growth potential and reduce overhead costs by leveraging existing footprint and overhead structure in Xuzhou. Additional actions in China include plans to streamline our corporate office in Shanghai and sublease the facility in Nanjing, previously intended to be used for our on-highway business. We realize the impact these decisions have on our employees and in each situation take appropriate actions to offer support throughout the process. Transitioning to market activity this quarter, we're pleased to see momentum in Brazil as well as higher order intake in North America and Europe, which is supporting a step-up in production for commercial trucks. Off-highway production in China and on-highway in India continue to be weak. We expect this trend to continue in the second half of fiscal year 2013. Moving to the balance sheet. Yesterday, we executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell our ownership interest in the Suspensys joint venture to our joint venture partner, the Randon group in South America. The purchase price for Meritor's 50% ownership interest was $195 million in cash and other consideration, subject to regulatory approvals. We expect to complete this sale in the fourth fiscal quarter. Meritor remains committed to its trailer business in North America and expects to continue supplying its customers in the region with a series of high-quality trailer products. Kevin will give you more detail later in the presentation on the Suspensys transaction. If I draw your attention to the lower-right quadrant on this slide, I'd like to introduce you to M2016. M2016 is a detailed 3-year plan that includes our commitment to achieve a 10% EBITDA margin for fiscal year 2016, which we told you about in February, in addition to a debt reduction objective and an incremental revenue target driven by organic growth. M2016 clearly defines our path to achieve these objectives. The plan is prioritized in 4 main areas: operational excellence, customer value, product costs and high-performing team. With the strong team we have in place around the world and the product, customer and cost initiatives underway, we are confident in the success of M2016. We'll provide more detail later. Let's look at Slide 4. In South America, I'm pleased to announce that we've secured an agreement with a new customer for Meritor's air disc brake systems and rear axles. Start-up production is planned for May 2014. In Europe, we launched our 17X Quiet Ride axle with a cast housing for Irisbus coach applications. Production is scheduled to begin this month. Meritor's ELSA 225H brake will also be introduced as part of the Euro 6 transition. In India, we entered into a strategic agreement with Mahindra. With this agreement, Meritor's share of single axles with this important customer significantly increases. In addition, we were awarded light commercial vehicle business and maintained 100% share of Mahindra's tandem axles. You'll remember at our analyst event in February, we told you we were excited about the growth potential in this region. We've made significant investment in new product offerings in India, including the light commercial vehicle axle. With the 4-ton axle launched this year and subsequent plans for the 6-, 8- and 10-ton axles, we're proud of the work our team is doing to bring this high-quality product to market for Daimler India, Ashok Leyland and now Mahindra. In North America, Meritor air disc brakes will be installed in close to 700 Peterbilt and AutoCar trucks for Waste Management this calendar year. The EX225 disc brake will also be installed on Volvo tractors in May for testing, in anticipation of a production release in July on steer axles and early next calendar year on drive axles. We believe as more owner-operators and fleets experience Meritor's advanced disc brake technology that comes with unrivaled support from our drive force field sales and service organization, on-track customer support and Meritor's extensive aftermarket network, demand will continue to increase. Now let's turn to Slide 5 as we look at a sequential comparison of our financial performance quarter-over-quarter. Revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 was $908 million, an increase of $17 million from the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations for this time frame. Adjusted EBITDA was $58 million in the second quarter, up from $46 million in the first quarter driven by the reasons I cited earlier. EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points as previously noted. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $6 million, an improvement of $17 million from the first quarter. And adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.06, up $0.17 from the prior quarter. Free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was negative $16 million, up from negative $91 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. This improvement in cash flow is primarily due to performance working capital improvements as noted on this slide. Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update of our forecasted commercial truck production volumes for fiscal year 2013. In North America, Class 8 orders are in line with our expectations for fiscal year production of 230,000 Class 8 units and 190,000 units for Class 5 through 7. With the backlog-to-build ratio continuing to trend up, now to over 4 months from 3.2 months last quarter and cancellations falling to their lowest level since 2010, we remain confident in this forecast, which is down approximately 22% year-over-year for Class 8. We've revised our forecast for fiscal year 2013 in South America to increase 10% year-over-year to 181,000 medium and heavy units. Last quarter, we forecast this market to be relatively flat from fiscal year 2012. The economy in South America appears to be improving supported by a slightly better GDP, stable unemployment levels and low interest rates. While order boards are showing good activity for the third quarter and inventories continue to fall to more normalized levels of about a 3-month supply, the rate of growth, while positive, remains uncertain. Last quarter, we told you we expected production in Western Europe to be down roughly 5% to 10% year-over-year. We are still forecasting medium and heavy-duty truck volumes to decrease in fiscal year 2013 to 346,000 units, closer to a 10% decline year-over-year. At that level, we would see the third lowest annual production level in Western Europe since 2000. However, while Europe remains sluggish, we are seeing activity in the order boards that indicates upside in the second half of the year, partially resulting from an anticipated Euro 6 pre-buy, as well as higher intercompany sales driven by market recovery in Brazil. Now let's turn to Slide 7. We told you last quarter we did not believe any recovery in China during fiscal year 2013 would be meaningful. We still believe that to be true. Finished vehicle inventory remains high, therefore, any impact on current axle production is not expected to be significant. We still expect China off-highway production to be down 10% to 15% this fiscal year, with some recovery toward the end of the calendar year primarily due to approved infrastructure projects. Again this quarter, India is showing the most meaningful decline in market volumes. We don't expect to see significant levels of economic reform until after the 2014 elections. The current parliament will complete its term on May 31, 2014. We are now forecasting a year-over-year decline in this region of 25% to 30% resulting in approximately 227,000 units, down from the 258,000 units we projected in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. We don't have any changes to share relative to our defense business this quarter. FMTV production is winding down and will decline approximately 30% year-over-year. As noted previously, we've been taking actions to eliminate approximately 200 salaried and 50 hourly positions worldwide, most of which are complete, to substantially mitigate the mix effects of the ramp down in this important military program. Looking at Slide 8, we continue to believe revenue from aftermarket in North America and Europe will be roughly flat to down slightly year-over-year, basically in line with our forecast last quarter. Indicators are that products at lower price points are becoming higher in demand. And overall, products are lasting longer than in the past. We believe this may lead to an increasing adoption of remanufacturing products, which we of course will support through our global remanufacturing operations. Orders in the second half of the year are still expected improve due to typical seasonality and additional selling days. We are forecasting the trailer business to be flat to slightly up year-over-year, and still anticipate 245,000 units in fiscal year 2013 as we stated last quarter. This is roughly a 3% increase from fiscal year 2012. Order activity in trailers continues to support these assumptions. We expect the market to remain steady through the remainder of the fiscal year 2013. We continue to monitor all of our end markets regularly. As you've seen, we're taking actions as necessary to mitigate the effects of the decline in defense volumes and ongoing weakness in certain markets. The second half of the fiscal year, however, is expected to show improvement in North America, Europe and Brazil. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Nowlan: Thanks, Chip, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I'll review our second quarter financial results, provide more detail around the recent announcement of our sale of Suspensys, and then close with a summary of our 2013 guidance. On Slide 9, you will see our second quarter income statement for continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales of $908 million in the quarter were down significantly year-over-year by $252 million or 22%. The decrease was largely driven by lower production volumes in all geographies except South America. Gross margin decreased $39 million due to the steep decline in sales. And gross margin as a percent of sales came in over 10%, worst than last year but solid considering the revenue headwinds. SG&A was $65 million in our second quarter of 2013, $7 million lower than the prior year. The decrease is mostly due to a $5 million charge for a legal contingency we incurred last year that did not repeat. Restructuring was $11 million this quarter. We recognized $7 million in our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, primarily related to employee severance costs resulting from our segment reorganization and Asia Pacific realignment. We recorded $1 million in our Aftermarket & Trailer segment, primarily related to employee severance costs. And finally, we recognized $3 million at our corporate locations associated with our segment reorganization. This quarter's restructuring expense was $8 million higher than the second quarter of 2012. As you'll recall, last year, we incurred costs associated with selling our French assembly operation back to Renault and the European headcount reduction plan. Restructuring charges are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Earnings in our minority-owned affiliates were $10 million in the second quarter of 2013, about 30% below prior year. The decrease is mainly due to lower earnings from our affiliates in North America and India, reflecting weaker truck markets in those regions, partially offset by higher earnings from our joint ventures in Brazil. Interest expense was $25 million in the second quarter of 2013, $2 million higher than the same period last year. And income tax expense was down $10 million from the second quarter of 2012, due primarily to lower net earnings and jurisdictions in which we recognize tax expense, such as China, Canada and India. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $6 million or $0.06 per share, compared to adjusted income of $32 million or $0.33 per share in the same period last year. The decrease in 2013 was mainly associated with the impact of substantially lower revenue and the related reduction in affiliate earnings. On the next 2 slides, I will discuss the quarterly results for our 2 business segments. Slide 10 shows second quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck & Industrial. Sales were $712 million in the second quarter of fiscal '13, down 25% compared to the second quarter of 2012, reflecting lower OE production volumes in most geographies. North American production for heavy-duty trucks decreased 28% in the second quarter of 2013, as compared to the same period a year ago. In addition, we experienced lower sales in Europe as truck production was down 14%; continued weakness in our off-highway business in China, which unfavorably impacted year-over-year sales; and the continued wind-down of our FMTV business, which was down more than 20% year-over-year. The decreases I just mentioned were slightly offset by higher sales in South America as truck production was 19% higher than last year. Segment EBITDA was $37 million, a decrease of $38 million year-over-year. The decreases in EBITDA and EBITDA margin were primarily due to significantly lower sales this quarter, with downside conversion at about 16%. In addition to the volume headwinds, we recognized increases to some of our inventory reserves, along with some other non-recurring charges this quarter. We've mentioned several times that we consider our normal conversion to be 15% to 20%, so we were able to limit that to the low end. We are pleased with this performance, particularly in light of the more than 20% year-over-year decline in our high-margin FMTV business. Thanks to the hard work of our teams, we were able to partially offset these headwinds with favorable net material, labor and burden performance, along with the structural cost reductions materializing in this segment. Next on Slide 11, we summarize the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. Sales in the second quarter of 2013 were $224 million, $19 million lower year-over-year. The decrease is largely due to lower aftermarket sales in North America. The decline in sales led to slightly lower segment EBITDA of $22 million, a decrease of $2 million. EBITDA margin of 9.8% was roughly flat to what we achieved last year as the pricing actions implemented at the beginning of the second quarter of 2013, along with net material performance and structural cost reductions, helped to offset the EBITDA impact of lower sales. Moving to Slide 12. I'll take you through our sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from the first fiscal quarter of 2013 to the second. Starting with the $46 million of EBITDA in our first quarter, we generated $8 million of additional EBITDA due to volume mix and pricing. We had higher volumes in our South America truck, aftermarket and trailer businesses quarter-to-quarter, which more than offset declines in some of our other regions. Pricing was a component of this $8 million increase, as the aftermarket pricing actions we talked about at Analyst Day started to take effect in January. Next, we increased EBITDA $4 million from the prior quarter due to the execution of the structural cost reduction actions, which consisted mostly of headcount reductions. These actions were detailed on our last call and at our Analyst Day presentation in February. Our expected savings from these actions in fiscal 2013 are $18 million and $37 million on a run-rate basis starting next year. We remain on track to achieve these levels. Moving down the slide. We then have $4 million higher EBITDA this quarter due to a reduction in net material costs. The majority of the savings relates to the performance of the purchasing team to secure more favorable contracts for purchased components. And finally, we have an all-other net decrease in EBITDA when comparing to the prior quarter of $4 million related mostly to an increase in some of our inventory reserves during the second quarter, which we view as non-recurring. Overall, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $58 million and EBITDA margin of 6.4% in our second quarter. Our conversion was over 70%, again, much higher than the typical 15% to 20% we've told you to expect with changes in revenue. We're very pleased with the performance of our teams. Last quarter, we committed to expanding EBITDA margin from first quarter on a similar revenue base, and we achieved that goal. Now let's turn to Slide 13 to briefly review our income tax expense for the second quarter of 2013. Our effective tax rate on income not subject to valuation allowances was 28%, the same rate as last quarter. Our total effective tax rate though was 233% as the loss in jurisdictions with valuation allowances resulted in additional increases to the valuation allowance rather than reducing income tax expense. Now let's turn to Slide 14. For the second quarter, free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was negative $16 million, an improvement of $45 million from the same period last year. During the quarter, we saw improved net working capital, including lower inventory levels. Last quarter, we mentioned that with volumes declining in our fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013, we had been unable to drive inventory down fast enough, but we expected that to unwind as we move through our fiscal year. We saw a part of that decrease in inventory occur in the second quarter. We also made $25 million in pension contributions this quarter, which is included in the negative $21 million you see on the related pension and retiree medical line in the cash flow statement. As I mentioned before, with no pension expense for the year, we expect these pension contributions to ultimately drive lower retirement liabilities, which is why we view this as a form of deleveraging even though these contributions are embedded in our reported free cash flow. Total free cash flow for the second quarter of 2013 was negative $26 million, an improvement of $43 million from last year, mainly due to the working capital improvements I just mentioned. On Slide 15, I'd like to expand a little more on yesterday's announcement that we are selling our 50% interest in Suspensys, which is the truck and trailer suspension joint venture we have with Randon group in Brazil. The purchase price is $195 million in cash and other considerations, of which all but $5 million will be received on or before the closing date. The closing date is currently expected to occur during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, following approval from the Brazilian antitrust authorities. Suspensys has been a strong investment for the 2 joint venture partners, and we expect the prospects for the business to remain strong going forward. However, we felt that our minority investment was not a strategic asset in our portfolio. And given that the $195 million in total pretax consideration represents a multiple of 14x fiscal year 2012 affiliate earnings, we felt we were receiving good value for the investment. We plan to use the cash proceeds primarily to delever the balance sheet. We expect to remain partnered with the Randon group in our Brazilian brake joint venture, which has strategic value given our global ambitions and our significant investment in the brake business over the last few years. As a result of the Suspensys transaction, our affiliate earnings going forward will be lower starting in our fourth quarter of 2013. Given that there will be only a 1-quarter impact on 2013 of the loss in affiliate earnings, we estimate the negative impact to our full-year adjusted EBITDA margin in 2013 to be only 10 basis points, relatively small. Consequently, we are able to reaffirm our margin guidance of approximately 7% in 2013. The impact of this transaction to our future margins will be more significant, as the Brazil market is expected to grow over the next few years and the growth in Suspensys-related affiliate earnings would likely be correlated for the Brazil market changes. But when we established fiscal year 2016 guidance of 10% EBITDA margin, we had anticipated the distinct possibility that we would execute this transaction. Therefore, we are reaffirming our 10% adjusted EBITDA margin target for fiscal year 2016. Next, I'd like review our fiscal year 2013 outlook on Slide 16. As Chip discussed earlier, the demand assumptions for some of our addressable markets continue to fluctuate. But currently, the net movements largely offset one another. As a result, we continue to forecast sales in fiscal year 2013 to be approximately $3.8 billion. Our revenue outlook is based on our market assumptions, which Chip outlined on Slide 6 through 8. As I just mentioned on the previous slide, even with our revised affiliate income assumption for 2013, given the sale of our interest in Suspensys, we maintain our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of approximately 7%. We are also reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations at $0.25 to $0.35 for 2013. And we continue to expect free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring to be slightly negative. Keep in mind this assumption includes approximately $73 million of pension contributions in 2013. Consistent with the M2016 financial goals associated with our 3-year plan, which Chip will review in a couple minutes these contributions are expected to directly reduce our pension liabilities, which we view as a form of deleveraging. Now let's turn to Slide 17 for a wrap-up with some of our key planning assumptions for 2013. Capital expenditures remained in the range of $65 million to $75 million. We feel it is critical to invest in improvements that drive operational efficiency and productivity, but still be sensitive to changes in the individual markets and adjust our spending where appropriate. Interest expense is still expected to range from $95 million to $105 million, while cash interest payments are also unchanged at $75 million to $85 million. And cash income taxes are still expected to range from $45 million to $55 million for 2013, driven primarily by payments related to earnings in taxpaying jurisdictions such as Brazil, China and India. This range does not include the onetime impact of the Suspensys transaction. Our guidance for restructuring cash is approximately $40 million and supports the following actions that we've previously announced: the global variable labor headcount reduction plan; the consolidation of our North American remanufacturing operations resulting in 1 plant closure; the revised management reporting structure where we went from 3 business segments down to 2 to drive efficiencies; and the Asia Pacific realignment that Chip talked about earlier in the presentation. Overall, I'd like to reiterate that we're very pleased with the financial performance of the company in the second quarter. We continue to face economic weakness in many of the end markets we serve, but despite that have still been able to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin, setting us up for continued margin expansion as the global markets and truck cycles return to more normalized levels. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chip, where he will go into more detail on our M2016 strategy.
Charles G. McClure: Thank you, Kevin. Let's now turn to Slide 18. As I referenced earlier on the call, today, we want to give you some insight into M2016, a detailed 3-year strategy that we believe will take Meritor to the next step in terms of the value it will provide for our shareholders, customers and employees. M2016 represents the next step of the journey for Meritor, moving us further down the path of achieving our vision to be the recognized leader in providing advanced drivetrain, mobility, braking and aftermarket solutions for the global commercial vehicle and industrial markets. Over the past several years, we've made significant progress to establish the foundation for greater financial performance. We divested our former light vehicle businesses so that we could focus in the areas of our expertise. We modified pricing for the value of our products and services, improved our global footprint, reduced our fixed cost structure and strengthened our execution. The hard work we've done over the past several years has put us in a position to deliver the level of performance our constituents expect from us, and quite frankly, we expect from ourselves. For shareholders, we believe this strategy will improve our profitability and cash flow, reduce debt and increase revenue. For customers, we'll design, develop and offer a broader, more advanced portfolio of innovative products and solutions with a focus on fuel efficiency, weight, performance and durability. Products like the 14X, 17X and 18X axles, the light commercial vehicle axle we've released in India, ELSA brakes, ProTec suspension for military vehicles and MTA trailer suspensions, are examples of the work we're doing in product development. We'll be even more alive in terms of quality and delivery and we'll provide the best cost for the value, while becoming even closer strategic partners with our customers around the world. This strategy also focuses on our employees. We recognize that a high-performing team is critical to the level of performance we want to achieve. M2016 emphasizes our intent to continue building a diverse workplace fueled by engaged and empowered people. M2016 has defined goals and objectives in the 4 key areas I noted in the beginning of the call. Specific goals related to executing the Meritor production system; optimizing our global footprint; advancing the Meritor value proposition; meeting and/or exceeding customers' expectations in terms of quality, delivery, innovation and customer service; driving net material performance and further improving inventory turns. Ultimately, we believe that focusing on these defined goals will position Meritor for 3 financial measures of success in the stated time frame. The first is achieving a 10% adjusted EBITDA margin. Execution of these goals, combined with the anticipated revenue of $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2016, should enable us to achieve this margin objective for the full fiscal year of 2016. The second measure of success is a reduction to net debt, including retirement benefit liabilities by $400 million to less than $1.5 billion. Since the end of fiscal year 2009, we've reduced this debt metric by approximately $200 million, and we intend to continue that trend. And the third is incremental booked revenue of $500 million per year at run rate, which represents significant organic growth. We expect about half of this to occur by the end of fiscal year 2016. We'll accomplish this through new defense programs, introduction of new axles, continued investment in air disc brakes, aftermarket growth, expansion of emerging markets and growing our customer base. We'll also grow by commercializing technology projects that bolster our market-leading position in axles, brakes and related drivetrain products. We'll leverage focused R&D, strong customer relationships, leading market positions and strong brand recognition with new products and new customers to grow organically. The foundation exists to unleash the value of Meritor, and that is where M2016 comes in. We'll update you on our progress toward each of these 3 financial measures of success on a regular basis. Now we'll take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson representing Barclays.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just 2 questions, one legal and the other strategic. On the legal side, I don't know if your counsel is on the phone. But could you maybe give us an update of the path forward from here, now that the Supreme Court has denied the defendant's appeal of the third circuit and lower court findings in favor of ZF Meritor?
Charles G. McClure: Sure. Brian, this is Chip, and first of all, good morning. And yes, we're certainly pleased with yesterday's announcement. And at this point, it's been remanded back to the courts for a damages trial. A damages trial has been scheduled for the September time period, so we do expect it will be sent back there for that review in that time period. So that's really kind of the time frame that we see for it going forward.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And on the -- just quick housekeeping. When you talk about the impact of the JV being taken out, are you putting it into the discontinued ops next quarter or is it just really that 0.1% in 4Q?
Kevin Nowlan: Brian, it's Kevin Nowlan. Because it's an investment, it's actually not a business, it doesn't get put into discontinued operations. So it's simply once we no longer own the business, we'll stop recording the income through EBITDA.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And more on the strategic side. Upfront you talked a lot about the brakes, a couple of questions on that. Could you maybe remind us what part of your commercial vehicle business brakes are? Is that something you're seeking to grow? Are the margins higher there than in other parts of driveline? And then finally, does the euro requirement for autonomous emergency brakes, automatic emergency brakes in commercial vehicle help that business at all?
Charles G. McClure: Brian, this is Chip to start. And obviously, we had announced a couple of years ago the breakthrough strategy. We've made significant investment and continue to grow our brakes. So let me start by saying, clearly, when you look at it, brakes is an important part of our business going forward. So strategically, we want to continue to invest in that, whether it's disc brakes or drum brakes. And as you know, we have that kind of coverage in a number of different markets around the world, where some require disc and some do require drum. So that is strategic, and we'll continue to look to grow that in the future and we'll continue to invest in it.
Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And did you get a boost from the emergency braking requirements coming in?
Charles G. McClure: Yes. There's no question when you look at it, whether it's there in Europe or in other parts of the world, as you look at these braking requirements, there's no question we've got to continue to invest in that and innovation. So if I -- the answer to your question is yes. And if I look at the ones with the reduced stopping distance here in the U.S. last year, we were able to demonstrate the ability to be able to do that with our brake configuration. So yes, I do see that as an opportunity in the future as we continue to invest in, in brakes and as there continue to be the stricter and stricter requirements. Not just in the markets here in North America and Europe, but really around world, I think, positions us well for that in the future. And that's why we'll continue to invest in it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton representing KeyBanc.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: If I recall your comments at the Analyst Day correctly, it's -- you had anticipated your second quarter margins may be a little better than your first quarter margins. And clearly -- well, they appear to be much better. And so my question is simply -- and maybe I just misunderstood, so correct me if I did, but if that is in fact the case, then my question is why not necessarily adjust your full year expectation at this point in time?
Kevin Nowlan: Brett, it's Kevin Nowlan. At Analyst Day, what we were signaling is that in the second quarter, we expected to see margin expansion over -- relative to the first quarter despite having flat revenue. And we thought it was going to be driven by the structural cost reductions and the aftermarket pricing actions, among other things, and that's effectively what happened. So as we thought about what we expected for Q2 and how that relates to the full year guidance, we think it's right in line with what we were expecting.
Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then as we think about the M2016, Chip, the $400 million reduction in net debt and so forth, does that $400 million include the $195 million that I think you expect from the South American divestiture?
Kevin Nowlan: It does. And keep in mind on an after-tax basis and after fees, we expect to ultimately generate about $160 million dollars in proceeds. But yes, the $400 million reduction would include the benefit of those proceeds coming in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli representing Citigroup.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just wanted to follow-up on the $400 million debt reduction target. So it looks like with the proceeds and maybe a modest cash burn, you maybe will get $100 million of that done this year. How should we think about the next couple of years and how does the pension play into there? Are you counting sort of pension contributions as part of the $400 million and assuming all else equal, or just help us out in terms of how you get the remainder of the next couple of years?
Kevin Nowlan: Itay, it's Kevin Nowlan. The pension contributions are absolutely an important part of the debt reduction strategy. As we look at it, right now, the way our contributions and our P&L is working, we have virtually no pension expense, but we're making pension contributions north of $70 million a year. Last year it was $100 million. So as we go forward and we have expectations of pension contributions to be in that $70 million to $75 million range, without an expectation of pension expense going forward, we would expect to see that simply be a reduction to our liabilities. Now of course, that's -- discount rates can come into play, asset returns can ultimately come in play. Our expectation is that we're not going to get help or get hurt by those movements in those rates, but those could have an impact one way or the other. Related to that, I would mention on OPEB, OPEB has a little bit of a similar phenomenon where we make cash payments of about $40 million to $45 million per year. But the OPEB expense that actually flows through the liability is maybe only a much smaller amount. So we're getting some deleveraging effect from our OPEB payments as well. So the combination of pension and OPEB, we expect to be a significant contributor to the $400 million debt reduction.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's very helpful, Kevin. And then where there any restructuring savings in the quarter? And if you can remind us what the thinking for restructuring savings is now for the second half of the year?
Kevin Nowlan: You could see the structural cost reductions, that the impact going from Q1 to Q2 was about $4 million of help. And for the rest of the year or for the full year, we're expecting that to benefit us to the tune of about $18 million. And then next year when we're at full run rate on those restructuring actions related to the structural cost reductions, we expect that to contribute about $37 million on a full run-rate basis starting next year.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And just lastly on the booked business that the $250-or-so million you expect to do in fiscal '16, do you have any guidance in terms of how we should think about the cadence of that over the next 3 years? Is it more back-end loaded or kind of split pretty evenly for modeling purposes?
Kevin Nowlan: I don't think at the moment we're giving any guidance towards that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault representing Goldman Sachs.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of items. Yes, I guess just on Slide 12, a couple quick ones on the walk. Sequentially, is there anything that's kind of one-off in these items here like pricing that would not necessarily be ongoing pricing but like onetime recoveries? Or are most of the tailwinds here things that will carry into subsequent quarters, would be my first question.
Kevin Nowlan: Okay. This is Kevin again. The -- as you look at Slide 12, we believe the only one-timers, really, on the page are in that other net line, which is the negative $4 million. We booked some additional inventory reserves in the quarter that we don't expect to recur as we go forward. But the other items we all view as recurring and part of the baseline as we go forward.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: All right. And then just kind of keying off of that, as we sort of walk to your 7% target, sequentially, I mean you've outlined volume, you've outlined ramping up to that $18 million in restructuring savings. Is there anything else that we should think about that sort of gets better as we go into the second half or are those the main items? And I've got one other follow-up.
Kevin Nowlan: Okay. I mean, I think, as you think about the 7% that we're guiding to for the full year, I think you can see the flight path coming off of this second quarter. Where if you adjust for that, the non-recurring inventory reserve that we just mentioned, and then you look at the expectation of revenue growth in the back half of the year, which based on our $3.8 billion of guidance would suggest, on average, a $100 million increase a quarter for the next 2 quarters, you just do normal contribution margin on that combined with the adjustment for the one-timer here. I think you can see the flight path as to how we get to the 7% margin.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Great. Yes, that's helpful. And then just finally, on the Suspensys transaction, forgive me if you said it before. But was this mostly just a balance sheet-driven sale? Was that the primary motivation? It's just that, clearly, this region has been such a focus for you guys and the outlook is good and the business seems to be performing. So was there another strategic rationale to sell it or was it mostly really just to sort of help you guys shore up some of your balance sheet targets?
Charles G. McClure: Patrick, this is Chip. There's no question that was part of it. If you look at it -- and first of all, Brazil is an important market for us in the future. I'll also tell you that Randon is an important partner. We still have a very strong joint venture with them and Masters on the brake side. But as we looked at this, yes, some of it was driven by the ability to generate some cash to deleverage the balance sheet. But in the other case, really, when you look at this business, it was a lot of different suspension components and was not as strategic for us. And obviously, in our case, is a minority joint venture, we kind of looked at it that way. So I would say it was driven partially by the ability to deleverage the balance sheet but secondly, also as we just looked at it, it was not as strategic as either our other joint venture there in Brazil with the Randons or just our commitment to that market in general.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky representing Sidoti & Company.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Yes. Just a question on the China restructuring. The consolidation, is this a commentary on the construction market not getting back to the strength that you might have seen a few years ago when you were building the plants?
Charles G. McClure: Well, there's no question. As you look at that, first of all, part of consolidation was on the on-highway side. But also to address your question, the off-highway side, which is a construction side, there is a couple of dynamics going on, both on the plus side and the negative side. There's new leadership in place right now, and there are some infrastructure programs being put in place as they continue to expand further westward in China. So as you look at it long term, you still look at that as good potential that way. But as we kind of look at China for ourselves, it really is a 2014 and beyond story because the other side of it, on the off-highway side -- and then I'll get back to the consolidation in a moment, is the fact that there's a great deal of finished goods inventory in the pipeline. So as we kind of indicated at the last call and are reindicating today, as we look at our fiscal 2013, although we do expect that there will be some uptick with the market there in China, I don't believe it's robust as it was a couple years ago, to your point, Robert, but still picking up. As we look at the dynamics for us for the next 6 to 9 months just because of the finished goods inventory, our customers' finished goods inventory in the pipeline, I think you've got to kind of bleed that down before you see a material impact that way. On the on-highway side, really, what we're looking to do is to kind of take that opportunity to kind of better rationalize our manufacturing footprint. We've had a very strong joint venture with XCMG for the better part of 20 years in China. So it allows us to further strengthen that joint venture partnership and our footprint there, which is really what was driving kind of the move from Wuxi to Xuzhou.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then can you talk about the cadence of your sales within the quarter and kind of how you're seeing build rates go throughout April, regionally?
Charles G. McClure: Yes. This is Chip again. If you look at it -- if I start here in North America, we are starting to see, obviously, some continued pickup into kind of what I'll call this quarter and into next quarter. I think a number of the OEMs have kind of indicated that and we are starting to see that starting to move up and we're obviously preparing accordingly. When you look in Europe, as we've kind of indicated, it kind of bottomed out, but we are seeing some pickup there. And now that one may be tied a bit to the pre-buy for the Euro 6 emissions, which is taking place, what we kind of see the second half of this year. When I go to South America, very strong production numbers there. And we've kind of indicated that for the last quarter or 2. And again, they had a very strong harvest there. I think the FINAME activities the government is doing is working. So those are kind of a couple of the short-term catalysts. Longer term, there is a growing middle-class in South America and obviously, discovery of oil and natural gas, I think, helps that. So of all the markets, clearly, we're seeing the strongest rebound there in South America. On the flip side, India as we kind of indicated, until the new parliament's in place, I think there's a real concern about how that's going to go. And we've seen a significant down step there. And in addition, in India, the mining industry is essentially flat. So that's kind of it, plus what I've said on China before.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. So should we assume that maybe fourth quarter won't be as seasonally weak as it usually is, meaning, you'll have sequential growth in third and then the fourth quarter as these build rates get more fully implemented?
Charles G. McClure: Well, if you look at some of that, you've got -- you still have the shutdowns in the fourth -- our fourth fiscal quarter, which is the third calendar quarter in Europe. So we're still expecting that. So I think you'll still see some seasonality there. So it's kind of bridging from the third, fourth and into the first quarter of next year, you'll see that. But I think it's still safe to say that we'll still be -- some of that seasonality is represented by -- probably the best example is summer shutdowns in Europe.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And just one other question on the Suspensys deal. Was there any thought to waiting to do this transaction until after you saw what the settlement was going to be from Eaton?
Charles G. McClure: Well, as I look at it, the Eaton settlement is truly separate. And that's still -- as I said, we're pleased with the progress that has been made, but that's got to go through the courts on damages. So I view those as kind of 2 independent actions or transactions or items at this point. So no, we did not tie the 2 together and just felt this was the time to do this with Suspensys, so it's very much independent of anything on Eaton.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan representing UBS.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can you provide color, you said the equity income coming out of Suspensys is $14 million. But when I look at the 10-K, I think last year it was $7 million in Aftermarket, and that was main joint venture. So is some of it in another -- in the commercial segment and is that the discrepancy between those numbers? And any color on what your guidance this year is kind of baking in, in terms of what you thought it would contribute for '13?
Kevin Nowlan: Okay. This is Kevin Nowlan. The $7 million you referred to from last year was what showed up in our Aftermarket & Trailer business. There's also a piece of our ownership stake. The other half of our ownership stake was through our Master joint venture, which actually flows up through our Commercial Truck & Industrial segment. So you should think about that Aftermarket figure of $7 million representing about half of the affiliate income from Suspensys. And there's another half embedded within the Commercial Truck & Industrial business through the Master's affiliate income.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And any color on what your guidance is implying for this year because that market has been fairly strong, so I think it would be up year-over-year.
Kevin Nowlan: I think you can get a sense on Slide 15 when we talk about the impact in Q4. We said it's going to have about a 10 basis point impact on full year '13. So if you think 1 quarter worth of income or thereabout, or affiliate income is being lost on a denominator of $3.8 billion, it would point you into the zip code of about $4 million of affiliate income in the fourth quarter. So I think that gives you the dimensions, kind of the size of what we are thinking for this year, at least for the fourth quarter.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Now that's very helpful. And any thoughts on additional divestitures? Would you ever consider divesting other JVs, like in particular the WABCO JV, which is -- it's potentially larger?
Charles G. McClure: Well, Colin, this is Chip. And my comment on those things is never say never. But at this point, we don't have any of this, but we continue to evaluate all of the business kind of on a regular basis, which is just kind of our normal process at this -- as we look at that. So at this point, no. But I -- hopefully, we've demonstrated over the last few years that if it does make best sense for our shareholders, we're certainly willing to do that. And we continue to evaluate all our businesses throughout the process.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just one last question. I just want to understand the M2016 incremental sales target of $500 million. Now is that accumulative through '16 or is that the annual run rate? I'm just trying to reconcile that headline versus some of the footnote on it.
Kevin Nowlan: Yes, so the $500 million represents the incremental business that we expect to secure to win between now and the end of 2016. That won't all flow through our income statement by 2016, so some of the run rate occurs after 2016. Our expectation is that about half of that $0.5 billion of new business wins will occur within the 2016 time frame, and the other half will occur afterwards. And then as you think about the guidance that we gave at Analyst Day, the $4.5 billion in revenue, that contemplates that business is being an offset to some of the military business losses that we were expecting over the same time frame.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker representing Robert W. Baird.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I just want to follow-up on that last comment, because I'm not sure I heard that correctly. The $500 million is an annual revenue contribution?
Kevin Nowlan: That's an annual run rate of incremental revenue, correct. Some of which -- that we will secure between now and the end of '16 but that will hit our P&L, some of it about half of it before '16 is out, and some of it after '16.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. So if you split it over 3 years or something, each of that would hit each of 3 years or some -- 4 years or whatever number like that?
Kevin Nowlan: We're not giving any guidance as to how that -- the cadence of that $0.5 billion or the half of that amount over the next few years. But you should expect to see us talk about the wins as they occur, and then on an annual basis scorecard ourselves against that objective.
Charles G. McClure: David, this is Chip. One of the things I'd kind of characterize it, it probably will be lumpy based on when the businesses are awarded. So as we kind of look at that, we'll clearly kind of, as they become known, we'll let you know. But I would characterize them as being lumpy.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then different people use different definitions of incremental revenue. Is that excluding business that runs off or renewal of existing business? Just definitionally, what flows in there?
Kevin Nowlan: It's effectively gross. Think about it as gross. So if we did have business running off, we're not taking that as a deduct. That said, we're not expecting any meaningful losses as we look out over our guidance period.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: But if you've got a renewal contract first, then existing piece of business, that's not in there?
Kevin Nowlan: Correct. We're not counting the renewal business. We are counting true new product or new customer wins or significant market share expansion via new established relationships with a customer. But not simply replacement business because the contract expired and we rolled it over. We wouldn't be including that.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then if we look at $500 million -- $400 million to $1.5 billion debt reduction, net debt reduction, I mean, it looks between -- that the proceeds and the sale, the pension contribution, the difference in the OPEB, that you're probably right around $500 million with just those 3 resources themselves. So is the balance of that expected to come from fee cash flow or is there some asset sales that are in there or any other source of funds?
Kevin Nowlan: The target that we're establishing is that we'll achieve at least $400 million in debt reduction. So I think -- what I think I heard you just suggest was that maybe there's -- the math you're doing suggests something more than that. I didn't follow your question maybe.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes. Well, between the $160 million in proceeds, $75 million a year for pension, whether it's 2 or 3 years, and then the OPEB, I mean, your above that $400 million, I guess, is what I'm saying from just those 3 items.
Kevin Nowlan: If you add just those 3 items, I think that's right. And so that's why we are driving toward that and making sure that we achieve that target. That's our objective.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then that next swing of getting up between that and getting to $1.5 billion, is that expected to all come from fee cash flow or are you assuming in there that there might be additional asset sales or equity offerings or other access to other sources of funds?
Kevin Nowlan: I'd say the $1.5 billion represents what we expect the net debt balance including the retirement liabilities to be, after the $400 million reduction. So if you look at where we were at the end of 2012, we were at about $1.9 billion if you add our debt, our pension liabilities and OPEB liabilities and subtract cash, it's $1.9 billion. So the $400 million takes us to below $1.5 billion.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Understandable. So then, what's the anticipation that you -- given that you have, essentially, between those 3 items reach that number, what's the expectations for the use of free cash flow between now and then?
Kevin Nowlan: I don't think we're giving any additional guidance on that, beyond what we've said on the chart. But I think those are some of the key elements of the debt reduction that we're talking about, are some of the things that you've highlighted.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman representing JPMorgan.
Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It seems your EBITDA decremental margins have been very well contained, 15% this quarter, 12% last quarter. What can you tell us though in terms of what kind of incremental margins you think you can earn when we do start to see higher year-over-year revenue? For example, as we move into fiscal 2014, the quarter-over-quarter result was, obviously, extremely strong in 2Q, but so strong that it seemingly is not very useful as a contribution margin modeling point going forward.
Kevin Nowlan: I would agree with that, Ryan. This is Kevin. I think, we continue to expect as we generate new business that you can assume we would generate incremental contribution on those sales of about 15% to 20%.
Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then on Slide 12, you mentioned that volume mix and pricing, I think, you bucket them together as an $8 million help quarter-over-quarter. Are you able to tease out the impact of any mix or lumpier pricing actions in the quarter? What I'm really trying to do was just determine if you did experience a normalized underlying conversion rate on the stronger sequential revenue related to volume during the quarter.
Kevin Nowlan: Yes. I mean, I think, as you think about that $8 million number, revenue was up $17 million in the quarter. So you can think that our typical contribution being 15% to 20% is probably a good gauge as to what the volume impact was in the quarter and mix and pricing making up the rest of it.
Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then it seems your capital expenditures were sharply lower year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but -- obviously, the annualized that you're not going to get to $65 million to $70 million. Can you just help us understand the cadence a little bit better there and if there is indeed some sort of potential to track maybe a little bit lower than that guidance?
Kevin Nowlan: I think we're still expecting to be in $65 million to $75 million. I think sometimes CapEx, some of the projects tend to be lumpier and sometimes that CapEx doesn't hit in a particular quarter or materializes all in one quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into that versus our guidance, or are we pulling back from the guidance or constraining capital. We continue to expect that we're going to invest at those levels for the full fiscal year.
Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just very last question. I know that you've always shied away from sort of -- and any kind of sizing of potential magnitude of proceeds from an Eaton settlement or lawsuit or whatnot. But even if you don't want to address that head on, at least could you talk about your priorities in relation to the proceeds, the use of such proceeds, and how that could potentially change at various different levels of proceeds? Is there any sort of possibility that proceeds, once you reach a certain threshold, could it be used for something other than shoring up the balance sheet?
Charles G. McClure: Ryan, this is Chip. And first of all, I think it's far too premature for us to even kind of speculate on that. I think it needs to go back to the courts for the damages trial before we have any kind of discussion on that. I think the important message though, as we've kind of looked out on all of this, including the M2016 program, we're not counting on that as part of our commitment going forward. So that, as I said before, is independent of anything else that we're doing. But for me to really comment on it, I think, it really is too premature and probably can't do that at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Ludtke representing CRT Capital Group.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of follow-ups. With respect to the FMTV, it looks like the year-over-year decrease is unchanged for 2013. I'm just curious has the cadence changed within this fiscal year and when do you -- what's your expectation for an access to when it winds up?
Charles G. McClure: Kirk, this is Chip. And actually it has not. In kind of, I think, one the charts we had in there, we do still expect a 30% reduction year-over-year from '12 to '13, and do expect it to wind down in 2014. I think the only thing that's changed in the cadence is I think -- and again, our customer, this is Oshkosh, has kind of indicated that they spread it out throughout 2014. So it'll probably go longer during -- throughout our fiscal year 2014. But our expectation is at the end of fiscal 2014, the program ends. So no real change in what we've projected for cadence in 2013, but 2013 does reflect a 30% step down. And in 2014, the only difference is the fact that it has been spread out over more months and throughout our fiscal year 2014.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And you mentioned an aftermarket price increase. Can you maybe quantify that and talk a little bit about how it was accepted?
Kevin Nowlan: This is Kevin. I can speak to that. It's embedded within our volume mix and pricing. Again, we're not breaking that out in terms of how much was pricing versus mix. You can get a sense by looking at our normal contribution and estimate how much of that $8 million was volume. So you can just assume pricing was an element of that, but we're not disclosing any more detail. In terms of how it was received, I think the market has been conditioned to accept these price increases on an annual basis in the aftermarket business, and we expect that to continue to be receptive to those increases going forward.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Fantastic. On the Eaton litigation, is there a range of as to when the legal process will be exhausted, time-wise?
Charles G. McClure: Kirk, this is Chip again. And the answer is no. And obviously, we're pleased with yesterday's announcement that the Supreme Court denied Eaton's appeal and it has now been remanded back to the lower court for damages. So the liability side has been completed. And really, it's just the damages side and as I say, it has been remanded back to Delaware district court for this September. Now beyond that, I really can't put a time frame on that because, obviously, it's been going on for several years. But at this point, I think the important thing is it has been targeted to go back for district court in September. But beyond that, really can't comment on any kind of time line beyond that.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. Still up to the judge?
Charles G. McClure: It absolutely is, yes.
Kirk Ludtke - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: And then lastly, my impression is that you're not contemplating a prefunding of the pension plans. Is that correct?
Kevin Nowlan: I think we'll -- I mean, we're funding the contributions currently as we're required to. But as we think about deleveraging over the next few years consistent with the goal that we've established to reduce our liabilities by $400 million, we'll assess where the best use of the cash would be, whether that's paying down debt or funding our pension plans. We'll assess those things as we come into the cash.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Christy Daehnert for closing remarks.
Christy Daehnert: Thank you for participating in our earnings call today. For those of you who do have additional questions, please feel free to contact me directly. And that concludes our second quarter call.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-01-30 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Chip McClure - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President Jay Craig - Chief Financial Officer Christy Daehnert - Director of Investor Relations
Analysts: Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the first quarter 2013 Meritor earnings conference call. My name is Taheisha and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Christy Daehnert, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Christy Daehnert: Thank you Taheisha. Good morning everyone and welcome to Meritor’s first quarter of fiscal year 2013 earnings call. On the call today we have Chip McClure, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jay Craig, our CFO. The slides accompanying today’s call are available at www.meritor.com. We’ll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call which we’re recording is the property of Meritor Inc. It’s protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the expressed written consent of Meritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me now refer you to slide two for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you will find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Before we begin, I’ll point out that today’s presentation will be slightly abbreviated due to our scheduled analyst event in New York on Tuesday, February 5. We are looking forward to providing you with more detail at that time. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Chip.
Chip McClure: Thank you Christy and good morning everyone. Let’s turn to slide three. I’ll start our call today by announcing three key executive appointments. I’m pleased to tell you that Jay Craig has been appointed Senior Vice President and President of Meritor’s Commercial Truck & Industrial segment. Most recently Jay was our Chief Financial Officer with additional responsibility for Treasury, Tax, Purchasing, Information Systems, Investor Relations and Communications. Jay’s experience and success in leading each of these disciplines, as well as his operations background at GMAC and at Meritor will play an instrumental role in the turnaround of the Body Systems business prior to its sale, makes him the perfect candidate for this position. Tim Bowes, who formerly held this position has accepted a CEO position with Transtar Industries. We wish Tim all the best in his new opportunity. Replacing Jay in his role of Chief Financial Officer is Kevin Nowlan, Meritor’s current Vice President and Controller, and he has been in that position since 2010. Prior to that Kevin also held the positions of Treasurer and Vice President of Shared Services. Prior to joining Meritor he was the Director of Capital Planning at GMAC. I’m also pleased to tell you that Brett Penzkofer, who many of you know, will become our new Controller. Brett has held a number of financial roles since joining us in 2006. Before that he served in various finance positions at DaimlerChrysler. We have been diligent in building the bench strength of our management team and are confident these moves will continue to enhance the company’s performance. Turning to slide flour, our financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 was slightly below our expectations, due primarily to greater than expected weakness in our major global markets. As we told you last quarter, the general market weaknesses we’re seeking is being driven by continued recessionary forces in Western Europe, slowing truck production volumes in North America and reduced infrastructure investment in China and India. As we review the global market outlook, you will note that Meritor’s forecasts are more conservative than others. While the markets are challenging to predict, we use all available data to forecast production in these markets as closely as possible. Over the past several quarters we have been correct unfortunately in identifying these downward trends. To offset the volume declines we are experiencing globally and the anticipated margin impact of the FMTV program winding down in late fiscal year 2014, we have taken several aggressive steps to manage costs during the past three months. In November, we initiated variable labor reductions. Overall we adjusted our global headcount by approximately 800 people. As we noted in our fourth quarter call, this included 50 salaried and 750 hourly workers, Commercial Truck, Aftermarket and defense facilities were affected. Also in November we announced plans to consolidate the production operations from our remanufacturing plant in Mississauga, Ontario into our remanufacturing facility in Plainfield, Indiana by March of this year. This action resulted in the elimination of an additional 85 positions in our Canadian manufacturing facility; 65 of those positions were transferred to our Indiana facility, resulting in a significant efficiency improvement. In January we initiated an action to reduce our fixed cost structure by eliminating approximately 200 salaried positions that included full time employees and contract workers. This restructuring action followed our November announcement indicating we revised our structure to report the future results under two segments; Commercial Truck & Industrial and Aftermarket & Trailer. Beginning today with the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, we are reporting our financial results under this new structure. As I said, we are taking aggressive actions to align the business with the demand we are forecasting in our global markets through fiscal year 2013. While we understand the impact of these actions on our workforce, we are committed to taking the necessary steps to drive greater levels of efficiency across the company. We will provide you with more details on the charges, benefits and timing associated with these restructuring actions at our analyst event on February 5. Now, let’s turn to slide five for a year-over-year comparison of our first quarter financial performance. Revenue was $891 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $268 million or 23% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. This decrease was primarily driven by lower commercial truck production globally. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $33 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 to $46 million, compared to $79 million a year ago due to the significant decline in sales we experienced this quarter. However, the downside conversion on this revenue decline was limited to 12%, due in large part to the benefits associated with lower material costs and the actions we have executed during the past 12 months. Adjusted income from continuing operations was negative $11 million, a decrease of $22 million, which also reflects the impact of lower sales and EBITDA. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was negative $0.11 down from positive $0.12 in the prior year. Free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was negative $91 million, down from negative $10 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2012. This decrease in free cash flow was primarily due to higher working capital this quarter. Let’s now turn to slide six to review our forecasted commercial truck production volumes for fiscal year 2013. In North America, Class 8 orders in the first quarter were in line with internal expectations. The backlog to build ratio, which measures how long it would take truck makers to assemble all trucks ordered but not yet built is currently 3.2 months according to the ACT. This ratio appears to be trending upward, but remains weak. At this time market indicators are in line with our forecast of approximately 230,000 Class 8 units in fiscal year 2013, down approximately 22% year-over-year. Our forecast for fiscal year 2013 in South America has improved with production projected to be relatively flat to prior year at 166,000 medium and heavy units. As you’ll remember from our last earnings call, we were previously expecting the medium and heavy-duty commercial truck market in South America to be down approximately 5% year-over-year. We believe government incentives in the region are beginning to have a positive impact. It was announced in December that the FINAME financing program was extended through the end of 2013. Reductions in truck and bus inventories are promoting more optimistic order boards and truck inventory is back to a normal range of approximately a three-month supply. In Western Europe we are forecasting medium and heavy-duty truck volumes to decrease in fiscal year 2013 to 368,000 units, roughly a 5% to 10% decrease year-over-year. OEMs have significantly reduced the production in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2013, but we expect that to stabilize in the second half. Due to government incentives, a pre-buy effect is not expected in fiscal year 2013 from the Euro 6 emission change effective January 2014, as we referenced in our call last quarter. Now let’s turn to our industrial markets update on slide seven. In China we believe the decline of the construction volumes year-over-year may be more significant than anticipated last quarter. Our opinion at this time is that any recovery in this region during fiscal year 2013 will not be meaningful. A high level of inventory at the OEMs is impacting demand for off-highway vehicles, including cranes, loaders and other excavating equipment. Mining growth also continues to weaken due to lower levels of energy consumption and low commodity costs. While we believe the market may begin to recover late in the year, it will take a period of time for an up-tick to materialize into production for Meritor, due to the current level of vehicle inventory in the channel. Based on this data we have reduced our forecast to 190,000 units for the 2013 fiscal year, down from 200,000 units we forecasted last quarter. This represents a 10% to 15% decline year-over-year. Since our discussion last quarter, India is showing the most significant change in market dynamics. Actions by the government to stimulate the industry are not expected to create the level of improvement we previously thought. You will remember that we forecasted the medium and heavy-duty truck market in the region to be up approximately 4% year-over-year at 348,000 units. We are now forecasting a year-over-year decline of 15% to 20%, resulting in approximately 258,000 units in fiscal year 2013. It’s worth noting that India is currently a volatile market that is difficult to accurately forecast. LMC, formerly J.D. Power also substantially decreased their expected industry production by approximately 20% compared to the prior forecast. There is no change to our defense business since our discussion in November. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we’ve initiated restructuring actions to help mitigate the margin impact of this decline. Looking at slide eight, we continue to believe revenue from aftermarket will remain basically flat year-over-year. North America order in-take is stable; however, Europe continues to be weak. We believe revenue in the second half will improve due to seasonality and additional selling days. We are forecasting the Trailer business to be flat to slightly up year-over-year, although we are not quite as bullish as we were last quarter due to some softening in orders recently. At this time, we anticipate 245,000 units in fiscal year 2013, versus our prior forecast of 250,000 units, approximately a 3% increase over fiscal year 2012. Slide nine reinforces the point that we now believe production volumes in three of our addressable markets will be weaker in fiscal year 2013 than we predicted in November. They include medium and heavy-duty truck production in Europe, medium and heavy-duty truck production in India, and construction volumes in China. Please note that while these markets are showing more weakness than we anticipated in November, nearly all of our markets are forecasted to be down or flat year-over-year. This type of market cyclicality is typical in our industry. Although we operate under significant uncertainty, we are confident that the proactive measures we are taking to reduce our fixed cost structure will allow us to maintain the margin improvements made over the last several years and minimized cash outflow. As always, we closely monitor all of our end markets and we’ll continue to take appropriate actions to mitigate the effects of this global weakness. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks Chip and good morning everyone. On today’s call I’ll review our first-quarter financial results and provide an update on our 2013 guidance. On slide 10 you will see our first-quarter income statement from continuing operations compared to the prior year. Sales of $891 million in the quarter were down significantly year-over-year by $268 million or 23%. The decrease was due primarily to lower commercial truck production in all regions and a production step down in our China off-highway business. On our last call we indicated that our revenue and EBITDA would be the lowest in our first quarter, but this level of production was still lower than our internal projections, particularly in Europe and Brazil. Gross margin was down $23 million due to the steep decline in sales; however, gross margin as a percent of sales was slightly higher in the first quarter of 2013. The improvement is a direct result of our lower material costs and the margin enhancing actions completed last year, most notably pricing and the shrinking of our European manufacturing footprint. SG&A was $62 million in the first quarter of 2013, almost 5% lower than the prior year, as we continue to reduce the fixed cost structure of the business. Restructuring costs were $6 million this quarter, primarily related to two items; the announced consolidation of our remanufacturing facilities Chip mentioned earlier and the variable labor headcount reductions in the Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, in response to weaker market conditions in certain regions. This quarter’s restructuring costs were $18 million lower than the first quarter of 2012, which included costs associated with selling our French assembly operation back to Renault. Restructuring charges are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Other income in the current period was zero versus $4 million earned last year when we recognized a non-operating gain, primarily related to the cash sale of our remaining interest in Gabriel India. Earnings in minority owned affiliates were down again this quarter from the prior year by $6 million or 40%. This decrease was driven by lower earnings in our joint ventures in Mexico and Brazil due to the softer economic conditions in both markets. Interest expense was $29 million in the first quarter of 2013, $5 million higher than the prior year. The company recently repurchased approximately $245 million of the $300 million principal amount of our convertible notes due in 2026 and recognized a $5 million loss on debt extinction. Income tax expense was down substantially when compared to 2012, due primarily to lower earnings in jurisdictions in which we recognize tax expense such as Brazil and China. All of this resulted in an adjusted loss from continuing operations of $11 million or $0.11 per share, compared to adjusted income of $11 million or $0.12 per share in the same period last year. The decrease in 2013 was primarily associated with the impact of substantially lower revenue and the reduction in affiliate earnings. On the next few slides, I will discuss the quarterly results for our two business segments under our new reporting structure. Slide 11 shows first quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck & Industrial. As I mentioned earlier, production volumes year-over-year for heavy and medium duty trucks were lower in every market we serve. The most significant year-over-year decreases were seen in Europe and Brazil. The weakening of the European market beyond our original expectations is already affecting our outlook for the remainder of the year. Brazil is a different story as Chip reviewed earlier. The market seems to be recovering earlier than projected, which is helping to slightly offset Europe’s decline. We had some tough comparables year-over-year in Brazil due to the small pre-buy before January 2012, emissions change from Euro 3 to Euro 5. As a result our production in the first quarter of last year was very strong, but much lower in the following four quarters, including the first quarter of this fiscal year. While production is on an upward trend, the impact of the industry transition to Euro 5 emission standards last January, and the overall weakness in the Brazilian economy, resulted in lower production for us in our first quarter of 2013. Again, we are feeling much better about the outlook in this particular region, but we expect it will take some time for the production to ramp back up to levels seen in years past. Sales in the first quarter of 2013 were $715 million, down $260 million from the same period last year. Segment EBITDA was $34 million, a decrease of $27 million year-over-year. The decrease in EBITDA and significantly lower sales or what we call downside conversion was limited to 10% for the segment. This was due primarily to lower material costs and the actions executed in 2012, most notably pricing and the shrinking of our European manufacturing footprint. These margin-enhancing actions largely offset the revenue headwinds previously discussed, including weaker affiliate earnings from our joint ventures in Brazil and Mexico. Next on slide 12 we summarized the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. Based on our revision to the operating structure of the business, this segment no longer includes the financial results of South America and Asia Pacific aftermarket, as that has now been consolidated into Commercial Truck & Industrial segment results. The prior period has also been restated to reflect this reporting change. This equates to about $80 million of annual revenue that is now reported in the Commercial Truck & Industrial segment. Sales were $203 million, $15 million lower year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to lower aftermarket sales in North America. Segment EBITDA was $13 million, a decrease of $4 million year-over-year, but downside conversion was approximately 26%, which is fairly consistent for this business, especially since the affiliate earnings in our trailer joint venture in Brazil were down, which has a direct impact on our EBITDA, with no corresponding impact on sales. Moving to slide 13, I will summarize our sequential performance and then provide greater detail for our adjusted EBITDA on slide 14. Sales in the first quarter of 2013 were $891 million, a decline of $95 million or approximately 10% from the fourth quarter. This decrease in revenue was primarily due to weaker sales in North America truck, FMTV and aftermarket. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million, down from $79 million in the prior quarter. This decrease of $33 million quarter-over-quarter was driven by the significant decline in revenue. Adjusted income from continuing operations was a negative $11 million, a $42 million decrease from the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter were negative $0.11, down from the $0.32 in the prior quarter, also due to weaker sales and EBITDA. Free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was negative $91 million, a decrease of $128 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by lower earnings and higher working capital. Now let’s move to slide 14, which shows a sequential adjusted EBITDA lock from our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013. Walking from the $79 million of EBITDA generated in our fourth quarter, we had $30 million less EBITDA due to volume and mix, which was by far the most significant impact to us in the first quarter. The sequential reduction in sales was primarily seen in North America truck, aftermarket and FMTV. The negative mix was associated with FMTV, as our production took a step down of over 30% sequentially. We expected this in our internal planning and we are forecasting to maintain roughly this level for the next two quarters with another significant step down in our fourth quarter of 2013. Next we saw lower EBITDA, versus the prior quarter of $2 million, related to net material costs. We have reported favorable material costs in recent quarters, partially driven by modestly declining steel prices. While we are still seeing reductions in material costs, we have contractual pass-through mechanisms with our large OE customers, under which we flow through the benefits of the reductions and index steel costs. If you remember, there is a pass-through or recovery lag of about one quarter on average with our customers in North America. These pass-through mechanisms are now catching up with those declining steel prices, requiring that we pass-through those reduced costs to our customers through lower prices. And finally we have an all other decrease in EBITDA when comparing to the prior quarter of $1 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $46 million in our first quarter. This includes $6 million of improvement relative to the fourth quarter, related to a value-added tax contingency charge associated with certain aftermarket sales transactions trued up in the fourth quarter that did not repeat in the first. The favorability was more than offset by a combination of several negative factors, including foreign exchange and lower earnings from our minority owned joint ventures. While our year-over-year downside conversion on lower sales was 12% this quarter, our sequential downside conversion was about 35%, which is much higher than the typical 15% to 20% we told you to expect in changes from revenue. The past two quarters we reported a decline in sales, but were able to minimize that downside conversion to 10% or better. Unfortunately, this quarter we saw significant mix impacts resulting from the decreases in FMTV and Aftermarket, two of our most profitable businesses that we were unable to offset in the quarter. However, the January 8 restructuring announcement and resulting reduction of 200 salaried positions should have a measurable impact going forward, even on this trough level of revenue. The benefit of the recent reductions announced in January was intended to substantially mitigate the margin impact of lost FMTV production occurring at the end of the fiscal year 2014. Our proactive response to these reductions will now help us partially offset the profit impact to the revenue headwinds that continue to impact our business in 2013, which as we mentioned are below what we originally projected. Slide 15 summarizes our income tax expense for the first quarter of 2013. Our effective tax rate on income not subject to valuation allowances was 28%. Our total effective tax rate was negative 167%, as the loss in jurisdictions with valuation allowances more than offset income just mentioned. In 2013, we do expect the majority of our income will be in regions with no valuation allowances, therefore we’ll be moving to a directional guidance on income tax expense for 2013, versus using an effective tax rate that isn’t very meaningful, and I’ll discuss this in a few slides. Now, let’s turn to slide 16. For the first quarter free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was negative $91 million, $81 million lower than the same period last year. This was driven primarily by higher networking capital, including the decrease in factory. With volumes declining so rapidly the last couple of quarters, we have been unable to drive inventory down fast enough. We manage inventory down to be in line with current production requirements, but this is a process that takes time, especially as production has continued to decline rapidly for several quarters in a row. In addition, we did intentionally build selected inventory banks in the United States, to mitigate the risk of a potential dockworker strike that was avoided, and in Brazil to prepare for the ramp-up in production occurring this quarter. Total free cash flow for the first quarter of 2013 was a negative $106 million, $86 million lower than last year, primarily due to the reasons just mentioned. Next I’d like to review our fiscal year 2013 outlook on slide 17. As Chip discussed earlier, the demand assumptions for many of our key end markets in 2013 are much weaker than we hoped, and have taken another step down from when we last spoke in November. As a result, we now expect sales in fiscal year 2013 to be approximately $3.8 billion, down around $600 million from 2012 and $200 million lower than we were expecting in November. Our revenue outlook is based on our market assumptions that Chip outlined on slides six through nine. Last quarter when providing our initial 2013 guidance, I stressed the significant volatility in many of our addressable markets and that volatility continues to be a net negative, especially in Europe, China and now India. However, even with our revised revenue assumption for 2013, we still expect to earn an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 7%. When we gave the 2013 guidance during our November call, we stated that the benefit of the business segment rationalization formalized on January 8 was not included in this guidance. Further with $4 billion of revenue, we expected to adjust the 7% margin up after we had quantified the restructuring benefit at our February Analyst Day. We now expect these savings, which begin in our second quarter to offset the EBITDA margin impact of $200 million of less revenue. The full impact of the cost reductions will be discussed next week as we committed back in November. We are also maintaining our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations at $0.25 to $0.35 for 2013. Free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring is expected to be slightly negative, down from our original projection of about breakeven. Now, let’s turn to slide 18 for a wrap-up with some of our key planning assumptions. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million, as we continue to manage investments in line with market dynamics, but still investing to drive operational efficiency and productivity improvements. Interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million, higher than our original guidance due to the new convertible debt transaction recently executed. Cash interest payments are unchanged at $75 million to $85 million and cash income taxes are now expected to range from $45 million to $55 million for 2013, as our production outlook for China and India have come down. As I mentioned earlier, we are no longer providing an estimate for our 2013 effective tax rate, but we do expect income tax expense to approximate the low end of the cash tax guidance. As we discussed on our November call, we will provide you with details of the cost reduction actions and corresponding restructuring cash guidance for 2013 at our Analyst Day on February 5. Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Chip, where he will summarize Meritor’s 2013 priorities.
Chip McClure: Thank you Jay. Let’s turn to slide 19. As highlighted this year, we are challenged with significant volume pressures. As such, we are closely managing and taking actions associated with each of the priorities we identified this fiscal year. We are adjusting our global work force as needed to align with market demands in each region. Earlier in the call we noted several restructuring actions that we executed in the first quarter and early in the second quarter of this fiscal year. As we see our markets start to rebound like in South America, we remain focused on execution. This includes managing capacity, pricing for value, investing intelligently and maintaining high levels of quality, safety and delivery. We will remain focused on rigorous cost management and will take necessary actions to ensure we are managing the business at an optimal level. We continue to implement appropriate balance sheet strategies such as the successful convertible transaction we completed in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We’ll hear more about these strategies from our Treasurer, Carl Anderson, next week in New York, and we are working hard to maintain our leading market share positions in all regions of the world. We are committed to developing new technologies and products, specifically in the areas of safety, fuel economy and environmental, and we will prioritize those that provide high value to our customers, including drivers, owner operators, fleets and OE’s that work in global applications and enhance our margin. We look forward to seeing you at our analyst event in New York on February 5. Now, we’ll take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital: Yes. Just want to go through and just sort of at a higher level, it sounds like when you talk through the sequential decline and just where you landed this quarter, that FMTV and military was roughly where you expect. I wanted to just -- one, was FMTV and military roughly where you can expect it and is the miss versus consensus, anything just maybe us getting the cadence wrong? Two, was vis-à-vis your expectations, was this mainly a volume gain impact in the quarter? And then three, where do you stand on rolling through contractual adjustments, price increases and other reengineering efforts and their ability to offset some of these volume pressures?
Jay Craig: Sure. Thanks Brian, this is Jay Craig. I will answer the questions sequentially. You are correct and as far as our expectations for revenue, I think FMTV as I mentioned in my comments, came in where we expected. I think the markets that came in a bit shorter than we expected were primarily in Europe, North American aftermarket and in India. So those markets came in weaker than we expected. I think particularly in Europe and India, those markets have been very difficult to call for us, as well as I believe everyone in our industry as I have interacted with them and read their comments publicly. So I think that’s where as we looked at it sequentially from Q4 to Q1, where the adjustments were. As far as volume and how we react to that, obviously there is a big impact from our equity earnings and JVs. Also those come through pretty heavily as we see volumes movements in North America and Brazil, and then as we look at the contractual price downs, we usually see the largest impact of those in our first quarter. Some of our contracts, particularly outside the U.S. still have some annual provisions in them, so they tend to be heaviest, the adjustments for those in our first fiscal quarter and we expect it to abate somewhat as the year goes on. As far as how we react to it, we had a very good quarter operationally in terms of the reducing material costs where we can control that. We actually are on our expectations, which were quite aggressive for that for the year. And also in our labor and burden improvements in our plants, are actually on are very, what we thought were aggressive planning assumptions. And then as both Chip and I mentioned in our comments, the actions taken on January 8 should help us significantly in reducing SG&A and fixed costs, so we do see our ability to expand margins sequentially benefiting quite significantly from those actions.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital: Okay, and in terms of the equity income, can you just maybe recap if we kind of compare the $9 million this quarter to the $15 million a year ago, sort of what the major sources of change were?
Jay Craig: Yes, the major sources of change would be as you would expect in Brazil and the U.S. So they would be our two JV’s with the Randons in the Brazilian market, one in the breaking area and one in trailers, and then obviously the Meritor Wabco JV and our Mexican JV, Sisamex. So those are the big JV’s with probably a lesser extent of an impact from our Indian JV, AAL and our Chinese JV was roughly flat.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital: Okay, so when you think about sequential or year-over-year incremental margins, because that’s a significant driver, how should we think about kind of teasing that out when we think about the volume effect on EBITDA?
Jay Craig: The earnings tend to move pretty well correspondently to the movement in markets. So our expectation as you can see from our guidance is that for example the Brazilian market strengthened sequentially throughout the year. So I think we expect and you should expect that the two JV’s in Brazil and performance should improve throughout the year as well. That is also our assumption in North America Truck, the strengthening in the back half of the year, so you should expect our JV’s there to perform more strongly as the year progresses.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital: Okay, thanks.
Jay Craig: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Good morning.
Jay Craig: Good morning Brett.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Let’s see here. Yes, just kind of tailing onto Brian’s question, maybe kind of taking it from a little bit different tact, I guess my first question is cadence of sales through the remainder of the year. If I take $3.8 billion divided by 4, I get $950 million. Obviously you are at $890 million for this quarter and so the expectation seems to be that your sales are going to improve as you move through the year. So can you talk a little bit about the cadence of production and the cadence of sales as you move through the year?
Jay Craig: Brett, this is Jay again and good morning. I think if you recall in our fourth quarter, we showed a four-panel chart that showed for the key markets what our volume expectations were by quarter, represented by lines in those charts. We will be updating that for our Analyst Day on Tuesday and showing that to the audience on that day. But just as a preview for that, I think we expect that as we move to the second quarter, the revenue should be fairly similar to this quarter and then a recovery in the third and fourth quarter, driven primarily by three main markets, North America, South America and the aftermarket. We expect that China and India will roughly be flat for the year and I would add, that’s really the biggest change to our guidance from what we are speaking about today as compared to November. As you may recall, we expected a recovery particularly in China in the back half of our fiscal year, but we have kind of now flat-lined our expectations for the rest of the year and I think you are seeing out in the marketplace people having great difficulty forecasting how the Chinese construction market will perform for the rest of the year and so we thought it best to drive the business on the assumption that it’s just flat for the rest of the year and push the business internally based on those assumptions.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thank you. And then from a margin standpoint, similar question. Obviously reporting adjusted EBITDA margins of 5.2% in the first quarter to get to 7% for the year, you have to track out the remainder of the year at 7.6 % and so how should we think about the cadence of margins? It sounds like restructuring is going to play a fairly large role. That is going to have a partial impact on the second quarter and then it sounds like your sales are going to be higher in the third and the fourth quarters. So it sounds like maybe we see kind of a sequential increase in margins as we move from the first to the second to the third and into the fourth quarter.
Jay Craig: Yes, I think there’s a couple of big things and we’ll walk you through in detail that next week, actually. It will be Kevin Nolan walking through that and you will see really two big impacts; the one you mentioned being the restructuring. It was very, very significant, that restructuring. As you may recall, we expect it to offset the entire margin loss for the difference between our margin on FMTV and our Commercial Truck products, so a very significant restructuring. We’ll walk through the details of that on Tuesday and the expected quarterization of that. We’ll give a rough idea of how that plays out. The other big move unrelated to volume as we have previewed earlier is we implemented fairly significant pricing actions in our aftermarket business on January 1. Those have a little bit of a lag effect, as you would expect. Our customers react to knowing that and tend to pre-buy a little and then we tend to see the benefit of that begin towards the end of January and then carry on through the year. So those are two of the biggest movers of our margin, independent of volume.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thank you very much.
Jay Craig: Thank you Brett.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer from Wolfe Trahan. Please proceed.
Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Hi. If I could just actually start with a quick follow-up on the aftermarket comment on pricing. So would you expect aftermarket sales to take a little bit of a hit sequentially going from 1Q to 2Q?
Jay Craig: We think any negative impact from that pricing will be more than offset in the traditional spring selling season we see for brake replacement. So we think that impact will overwhelm any negative impact from pricing. In addition, you should remember there’s obviously more selling days in our second fiscal quarter, the first calendar quarter, than in our first quarter, because of the Christmas holiday and those time periods. So I think those two impacts should more than over compensate for any negative reduction in volumes due to the pricing change.
Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Okay, thanks. And a couple of just questions around -- I guess related questions around cash flow materials in Brazil. With the inventory ending the quarter a little bit ahead of where it seems like you’d like, do you expect that to become a tailwind to cash flow over the next couple of quarters, a little bit more than normal, and then I guess on a related note…
Jay Craig: I’m sorry, Tim. I guess I would say this phrase, it’s better. We are driving the organization very hard and the team is working very hard at getting the inventory out. In their defense, when you get this enormous volatility of customers pulling weeks of production very late in the planning process, inventory can get backed up, particularly as you come through a holiday period, because we tend to build inventory in anticipating of ramping production backup beginning in January. And so in defense of our material handling team, it is a very challenging environment for them when it hit. Now, and there were also the two major impacts that I mentioned, that I don’t want to underestimate. We did take some defensive actions, knowing that there could have been a dock strike and a large part of our raw materials and our semi-finished materials come from overseas, with long supply lines and we wanted to make sure those weren’t disrupted if there was a dock strike, and we did purposefully build some inventory in Brazil in anticipation of the ramp-up we are seeing, so we are happy we did that. So we are very focused on that. We do expect that the inventory reduction throughout the year should become a net benefit to our working capital sequentially throughout the remainder of the year.
Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Thanks, and then a couple of sort of related follow-ups on that. Will materials costs become a little bit of a tailwind to margins, I mean in terms of relative to what materials costs are in that inventory and with the fuel costs that you are seeing or does the backup of inventory sort of mute the benefit from raw materials?
Jay Craig: We will walk you through in detail the purchasing and the expected material cost benefits on Tuesday as well. We continue to have some contractual price refund mechanisms in subsequent quarters, although somewhat more muted than we see in the first quarter as I mentioned earlier. But we are really making very, very good progress on our aggressive material cost reduction efforts and we’ll be walking people through that on Tuesday. So I think we could see it as a tailwind for the rest of the year.
Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: And if I could sneak one more in for Chip, I mean do you see any impact from the announcement recently with Volvo taking a stake in Dongfang? Does that have any opportunities or risks to your business?
Chip McClure: I think it’s just an indication of what I’ll call more the globalization of the market in China. Obviously you continue to look at it. There’s consolidation and there’s also globalization, both of which is taking place in China and I think Volvo and Dongfang are doing that. Volvo has been and will continue to be and we are looking forward to continuing to be an important customer to us on a global basis. We currently support Volvo in many markets around the world, both here in North America, Europe and in parts of Asia that way. So we are following like the others. But I think so to answer your question, I don’t see an impact that way. What I do see it is, more in a macro level, but it’s just an indication of the globalization of the truck market in China and what I would envision over time is similar to what we saw in automotive is, will there be some consolidation within the production capacity there at some point in the future? So just more of a step on a macro level. On a micro sense Volvo continues to be an important customer to us and just, we’ll continue to support them.
Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Great, thanks very much.
Chip McClure: Great, thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A portion of the conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Christy Daehnert for closing remarks.
Christy Daehnert: Thank you for your attention on today’s call. For any follow-up questions, please reach out to me directly, and that concludes today’s call.

Charles G. McClure: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying fiscal year 2012 was a challenging year, as we faced weakened markets throughout the second half due to global economic slowdown in our sector. This softening was driven by escalating recessionary forces in Western Europe, flat and slowing truck production volumes in North America and reduced national infrastructure investment in China. In Brazil, impacts of Euro 3 inventories and sluggish Euro 5 acceptance drove a decline in truck production since January of 2012. All that said, Meritor's management team faced these challenges aggressively. Together with a strong and realistic focus on cost controls and incremental cost containment, we mitigated the impact of declining sales volumes, all while still making strategic investments to improve manufacturing processes to meet or exceed our customers' expectations. I want to emphasize that despite the global sales challenges, our EBITDA margins increased year-over-year due to the achievement of the 6 execution actions we committed to during the fourth quarter of 2011. While global market forces are beyond our control, our management team’s focus on the drivers of profitability demonstrates our collective strength and commitment to skillfully manage turbulent global markets for the benefit of our shareholders, our customers, our employees and our communities. Let's turn to Slide 3 for more detail on our fourth quarter and full year results. Sales for the fourth quarter 2012 were $986 million, a decline of $127 million or 11% versus the third quarter. This decrease in revenue was driven primarily by weaker end markets. Adjusted EBITDA was $79 million, down from $92 million in the prior quarter. We were able to generate our EBITDA margin of 8% despite the significant revenue headwinds we faced during the quarter. This is a testament to the hard work of all our teams around the world to carefully manage costs as volumes contracted in the second half of fiscal year 2012. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $31 million, a $6 million decrease from third quarter. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter were $0.32, down from $0.38 in the prior quarter. Free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was $37 million, a decrease of $19 million from the third quarter. However, fourth quarter cash flow included the impact of an additional $25 million voluntary pension contribution. Jay had mentioned on our prior earnings calls that if we were able to generate sufficient positive cash flow this quarter, we'll reduce the opportunity to prefund some of our pension obligations for 2013. For fiscal year 2012, sales ended at $4.4 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $345 million and margin of 7.8%, a measurable improvement over our 2011 margin despite declining revenue in many of our global markets. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $111 million and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.14. Free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was $22 million in 2012 and included total pension contributions of $102 million. Overall, I'm pleased with the strong execution that led to increased EBITDA margins, strong free cash flow generation and increased income year-over-year in the face of global recessionary forces. Let's turn to Slide 4. Among the highlights of our business accomplishments in the first quarter, first in India, we received a multiyear award from Daimler Commercial Vehicles for Meritor hub reduction axles. Beginning in fiscal year 2014, the axles will be produced for heavy-duty dump trucks, known as the tippers, over the next 8 years. The hub reduction axle for Daimler has been adapted for conditions in India, with 18-ton cast housings for heavy-duty mining applications. Second, in our Trailer business, Wabash National, one of the leading producers of trailers in North America, selected Meritor trailer axles to be standard equipment on all trailers it produces. Third, in our defense business, 2 of 3 OEMs selected by the Department of Defense for the final Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase of the JLTV program contain Meritor content. Specifically, our ProTec High Mobility Independent Suspension will be integrated into Lockheed Martin's vehicle. Meritor's wheel-end and brake components will be included in Oshkosh trucks offering. Both will advance to the next round of the Army and Marine Corps JLTV development program, which we anticipate will be concluded over the next 27 months. And finally in September, we introduced our latest and most technically advanced generation of drive axles and brakes during the commercial vehicle show in Hannover, Germany. In the right column of this slide, you will note our team earned a number of awards and recognitions demonstrating our customer service excellence. Among them, PACCAR recognized our focus on product quality by presenting their 2011 Quality Achievement Award to 4 Meritor manufacturing facilities. The award is among the industry's most demanding due to high standards for product quality and integrity. Meritor facilities receiving this prestigious award were Newark, Ohio; Manning, South Carolina; and Laurinburg and Forest City in North Carolina. The fact that 4 of our facilities have earned the PACCAR Quality Achievement Award during each of the past 3 years is a testament to our commitment to quality. Thomas Built Bus, a subsidiary of Daimler Truck North America and a leading producer of school buses, presented their 2012 Outstanding Supplier Silver Award to our Manning, South Carolina brake plant. The award recognizes only the best suppliers for quality, delivery and service. The Intelligent Transportation Society of America recognized our advanced brake technology joint venture with MeritorWABCO for its OnGuard collision mitigation system. OnGuard includes collision warning with adaptive cruise control, active braking and collision mitigation to assist drivers in maintaining a safe driving distance and reducing rear-end collisions. In recognition of our growing remanufacturing business, ReMaTecNews, an international news magazine for remanufacturers, presented Meritor its 2012 Remanufacturer of the Year award. ReMaTec cited Meritor is taking remanufacturing to a new level of sophistication and product excellence. Our remanufacturing operations encompass 5 sites in 5 countries and a substantial portfolio of drivetrain and wheel-end components. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to invest in innovation to sustain our leadership in drive axles and brakes. Many of our product innovations were showcased at the commercial truck show in Hannover in September. Our 17X axle was well received for the single-reduction European axle market. It is the industry's lightest axle system in the 13-ton class with improved ratios to meet upcoming emissions regulations. Our ELSA brakes were also well received in Hannover. They offer the attributes of improved performance and reduced weight together with improved durability, resulting in a lower cost of ownership for both the European and North American markets. In India, our MS 04 series axle offers a wide range of applications for the minibus, truck and off-highway vehicle markets. As a fully dressed axle, the MS 04 series offers an optimal combination of efficiency, durability and mobility. And finally, Meritor's innovative SMARTandem offers attractive weight savings with an estimated 2% improvement in fuel efficiency. The 6x2 configuration features 1 drive axle and a nondrive tag axle. This configuration reduces friction while delivering a weight savings of 400 pounds. Turning to Slide 6. You'll note our business success was driven by outstanding execution by our Meritor team. As discussed earlier, despite revenue headwinds, Meritor's fiscal year 2012 EBITDA margin increased. This performance was driven by a number of well-executed actions at the end of 2011 and the beginning of fiscal year 2012. Among those actions, our North American Commercial Truck team secured an improved pricing structure more closely aligned to the Meritor value proposition. To further improve manufacturing efficiencies in Europe, our team completed a rationalization of our European manufacturing footprint to reduce fixed costs while maintaining the appropriate level of capacity to meet future increases and demand as economies in that region recover. We executed aggressive material cost recovery initiatives with our customers to mitigate the impact of rising global commodity costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, we successfully completed the exit of our European Trailer business. In North America, our defense team managed to return our production back to peak levels without issue. This allowed us to serve our nation's vital tactical-wheeled vehicle programs with seamless consistency. And at the end of fiscal year 2011, we also initiated a program to trim our executive ranks. Turning to Slide 7. We took the following actions in 2012 to maintain our strong liquidity position. First, we amended and extended our $515 million revolving credit facility from 2014 to 2017, inclusive of a $100 million term loan. In addition, we entered into a new $100 million U.S. securitization facility expiring in June of 2015. This new facility provides higher advanced rates and reduced pricing from the facility it replaced. We also were pleased to receive rating upgrades from S&P, which is further evidence of our strong liquidity and improving credit profile. Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our 2013 forecasted production volumes for the 3 geographic regions of the Commercial Truck segment. In the upper left, we provided our fiscal year 2013 North American industry forecast for medium- and heavy-duty truck volumes. Today, we believe the softening observed in the industry during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 will continue into 2013. Our forecast for 2013 combined volumes is approximately 420,000 units. This includes a forecast of 230,000 Class 8 trucks and 190,000 Class 5-7 trucks. This market softening is based on an assessment of the dealer inventory levels nearing all-time highs and an OEM backlog-to-build ratio of less than 4 months. In South America, the softening we experienced in 2012 following the emissions change in January has stabilized. But we believe we'll remain at this level for the first half of our fiscal year with limited visibility for near-term recovery. Our fiscal year 2013 forecast for medium- and heavy-duty trucks reflects this outlook, where we expect 159,000 units of production, down about 5% from prior year. In Western Europe, we are forecasting the medium- and heavy-duty truck industry volumes to decrease in fiscal year 2013 to 370,000 units. This represents a 5% decrease over fiscal year 2012 industry volumes. The decline is expected to continue throughout the fiscal year due to prolonged economic headwinds, coupled with no anticipated prebuy demand from Euro 6 emission changes that will be effective in January 2014. Now let's turn to our Industrial segment market update on Slide 9. Our Industrial forecasts for fiscal year 2013 are mixed. In China, the reduction of infrastructure spending and higher levels of dealer inventory continued to impact the production of cranes, loaders and other excavating equipment. As a result, inventory corrections are expected to continue for the next several quarters. While the government has announced programs to support increased infrastructure spending, we have not seen any favorable impact of these actions to date. Consequently, we are forecasting fiscal year 2013 off-highway production to be down 8% to 10% from 2012 levels. Turning to India. We are forecasting a small increase of approximately 4% in medium- and heavy-duty truck production from 335,000 units in fiscal year 2012 to 348,000 units in fiscal year 2013. The forecasted increase is due to the anticipated positive impact of government stimulus focused on investment in the country's infrastructure. Within our defense business, our Caiman production ends in the first fiscal quarter of 2013 with no additional sales forecast beyond that point. Also FMTV production decreases significantly in 2013. We expect production to step down almost 30% year-over-year as this program ultimately concludes in late 2014. As you know, this is a significant mix impact that will place pressure on our EBITDA margins in fiscal year 2013 and beyond. As I will address on upcoming slides, we are already beginning aggressive actions to operate in this new environment of reduced defense spending and to mitigate the impact of this loss margin. But first, let's turn to Slide 10 to review the Aftermarket & Trailer segment. We expect our global Aftermarket business to be roughly flat, driven by softening market conditions in our core markets throughout the world. Unless we see a significant increase in economic activity in our core markets, we do not expect measurable growth in this business. Moving to Trailer. Our forecasted industry production in North America is expected to improve by 5% in fiscal year 2013 to 250,000 units. Orders and build rates remain healthy to date. Order boards have been filling at a rate consistent with typical seasonality and cancellation rates remain very low. Overall, we are seeing most of our markets in all 3 segments down in 2013, especially in the last calendar quarter of 2012, which is our first fiscal quarter. However, we are optimistic about markets in the back half of the year as we will show in upcoming slides. Let's now turn to Slide 11. As I indicated at the onset, Meritor recognizes it cannot control geopolitical economic forces that impact our markets. However, our management team continues to implement the aggressive actions required to adapt to the rapidly changing environment in which we conduct business. As we've already reviewed, we successfully implemented many margin-enhancing actions in 2012. While we are disappointed that markets continue to be soft in most of our major regions of operation, we are moving aggressively to address our cost structure and adapt to this changing environment. Similar to our response to previous significant changes in economic activity, we have reacted quickly by adjusting variable labor costs due to weaker markets in Brazil, Europe, the U.S. and China. These actions will reduce our workforce by approximately 800 people. This includes 50 salaried and 750 production workers, of which 350 are contract and temp personnel. Cost savings associated with these actions should be evident by the second fiscal quarter of 2013. Within our Aftermarket segment, we are taking actions to consolidate our remanufacturing activities through the closure of our operation in Mississauga, Ontario and the consolidation of our North American remanufacturing operations into a center of excellence in Plainfield, Indiana. In addition, we are making structural cost reductions to respond to the expected medium-term decline in the defense business and the impact to us. Recognizing our near-term declining military volume and the related contraction in the Industrial segment in total, we are rationalizing our business segments from 3 to 2 going forward. We wish to emphasize that the rationalization of our business segments is a long-term structural change to the organization and not just a short-term tactical action taken in response to current market conditions. The expected financial benefit of these structural cost reduction actions together with other initiatives are expected to be significant to substantially mitigate the loss margin associated with the FMTV program. We'll provide you the details of these actions during our Analyst Day on February 5. At that time, we will review with you in detail both the short-term actions reviewed today and the longer-term structural changes and how they position the organization going forward. These actions are not easy. They're extremely difficult for us and our employee base, but unfortunately are necessary given the economic conditions we faced. I want to take the opportunity to thank the leadership team here for their attention and focus on the next phase of implementation. We must execute these actions so that we don't lose the financial benefit of all the hard work the team have put forth over the past year to improve EBITDA margins in 2012. We can't lose the positive momentum achieved even with these challenging market conditions. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay as he walks through the more detailed financial review.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Thanks, Chip, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our guidance for 2013. Slide 12 compares our actual results for fiscal year 2012 to the revised outlook we provided on August 1. Sales for the year were just over $4.4 billion, which was in line with our outlook as the third quarter weakness experienced in Brazil and China continued through the fourth quarter. In addition, we saw fourth quarter weakness in North America across the segments, which drove us to the lower end of our sales guidance range. We delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.8% or $345 million, which was at the midpoint of our range. Given the global market contraction that frankly was far from what we were expecting at the beginning of the year, I'm extremely pleased with this performance. Our margin was 30 basis points better than last year despite there being over $200 million less in revenue. We view our ability to overcome these revenue headwinds and improve our margins as an impressive achievement. We've laid out very challenging goals for this organization a year ago. And every quarter, we updated the external investment community as we made progress on achieving those goals. We executed this plan and I can't emphasize enough, this was no easy task. We had tough discussions and negotiations with our customers in many cases, but the team delivered. We recognized that our work isn't over to achieve our long-term margin objectives we established for ourselves. But I do want to recognize the tremendous accomplishments of this team in 2012. Unfortunately, the global economic downturn has somewhat overshadowed the meaningful improvements we've made to the core profit generation capability of the company. 2012 adjusted income from continuing operations was $111 million, just above the high end of our guidance. And we earned $1.14 in adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2012, again at the high end of our range. Free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was $22 million. As Chip mentioned earlier, this amount includes total pension contributions in 2012 of $102 million, of which $25 million was voluntary. Our effective tax rate came in essentially on plan at just over 40%. Overall, we delivered solid financial results in 2012 and the strong execution of our teams around the world helped to offset the revenue headwinds we experienced in nearly every international end market we serve. We are better positioned today than we were a year ago in so many respects, and that should also allow us to capitalize on the eventual rebound in the global markets. On Slide 13, you will see our fourth quarter income statement from continuing operations. We also included a similar slide for the full year 2012 in the appendix for your convenience. Sales of $986 million in the fourth quarter were down $231 million year-over-year or 19% due to Commercial Truck production in all regions, continued pressure on production in our China off-highway and India on-highway businesses and the softness of the Aftermarket. Gross margin was roughly flat year-over-year, even with the significantly lower sales resulting in gross margin as a percent of sales expanding by 180 basis points. This is a reflection of the fact that we have been able to sustain the financial benefit of the 6 execution items we implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and the early part of 2012. SG&A of $80 million was much higher in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus the same period in 2011. This was related to a onetime, noncash year-end valuation adjustment to our estimated asbestos liabilities totaling $18 million, substantially related to legacy Rockwell plants. In working with our actuaries, we determined that the experience data was now consistent enough to enable us to make a 10-year estimate of this viability versus the 4-year period we were limited to previously. This 10-year period is also consistent with the period over which we evaluate our other pool of asbestos liabilities in the dormant legacy Maremont subsidiary. Although the impact of this change on ongoing future expense is expected to be immaterial, these actuarial valuations are inherently dependent on many assumptions related to an environment that is continually changing. Because of the onetime nature of this change in estimation period, we have excluded the financial impact from adjusted EBITDA and are treating it as an adjustment to our earnings. This is consistent with our treatment of that $16 million gain on sale of property during the third quarter. Excluding this charge, SG&A would have been slightly lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Restructuring costs were $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, of which $3 million was associated with the European salary headcount reduction program we announced 2 quarters ago affecting the Commercial Truck segment. We also incurred $5 million in the current quarter related to a recently approved restructuring plan for additional headcount reductions, primarily in the Commercial Truck segment in response to weaker market conditions in certain regions. We have also announced the closure of 1 remanufacturing plant in Canada. Remaining costs under this program are expected to be approximately $13 million and substantially incurred in 2013. The asbestos liability remeasurement and restructuring charges are both excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Other income was down $6 million from the prior year as we recognized a $5 million nonoperating gain on the settlement of a currency hedge in last year's fourth quarter that did not repeat in 2012. Earnings in our minority owned affiliates were down over 40% or $8 million year-over-year. This decrease was driven almost entirely by lower earnings from our brake and trailer affiliates in South America, due to the continued effect of the emissions change this past January and softening economic conditions in the region. Interest expense of $23 million was in line with the fourth quarter of 2011 and has been fairly consistent for several quarters. Our effective tax rate was 58% for the quarter, which is higher than what we consider a more normalized rate. I will review the fourth quarter and 2012 fiscal year tax rate in more detail later in the presentation. We earned $0.32 per share of adjusted income from continuing operations compared to $0.45 in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily associated with the reduction in affiliate earnings and the 2011 nonoperating gain that didn't repeat again this year, as discussed earlier. On the next few slides, I will discuss the quarterly results for our 3 business segments. Slide 14 shows fourth quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck. Production volumes for heavy- and medium-duty trucks were lower in all 3 regions, North America, Europe and South America, relative to the fourth quarter of 2011. The most significant year-over-year decrease was seen in Brazil as we have yet to see any real recovery in our revenue. While our production levels have stabilized, the impact of the industry transition to Euro 5 emission standards this past January and the overall economic downturn continued to impact our production. Despite these significantly lower sales, segment EBITDA margin increased to 7.9% compared to 6.4% in the prior year. The increase in margin reflects the benefit of the pricing and European footprint -- profit movement actions completed at the beginning of our second quarter. In addition, we have seen meaningful material performance in this segment year-over-year. These margin-enhancing actions more than offset the South America headwinds previously discussed, including weaker affiliate earnings from our brake joint venture in that region. Now let's turn to Slide 15 to review the Industrial segment results. Fourth quarter sales were $222 million, a decrease of $47 million or 17% year-over-year. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales in China and India. Despite the lower sales, the Industrial segment EBITDA margin increased slightly to 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012. The impact of lower sales in the Asia Pacific region was more than offset by improved sales mix as our FMTV production increased in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus the same period last year. Next, on Slide 16, we've summarized the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results. Sales were $248 million, $26 million lower year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to lower Aftermarket sales in Europe and North America. Segment EBITDA decreased $12 million, driven primarily by 2 items, downside conversion on lower sales and a $6 million charge related to a value-added tax contingency associated with certain sales transactions, which is expected to be nonrecurring. Now let's move to Slide 17, which shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from our third fiscal quarter of 2012 to the fourth. Starting with the $92 million of EBITDA generated in our third quarter, we then reduced that by $15 million due to volume, mix and pricing, the most significant of these being volume as sales decreased sequentially. But this was offset slightly by positive pricing in our Aftermarket business. Next, we've identified a $9 million improvement in EBITDA versus the prior quarter due to reductions in material costs, including improvements in our freight expenses in the fourth quarter. The next item on the block is the charge for $6 million related to a value-added tax contingency incurred in our Aftermarket business that I just discussed on the previous slide. We don't expect this to be recurring, but this did negatively impact our EBITDA in the fourth quarter. That leaves an all other decrease in EBITDA, when comparing to the prior quarter, of $1 million, yielding adjusted EBITDA of $79 million in the fourth quarter with an 8% margin. We are very pleased with this performance given the continued revenue headwinds. We are able to manage the downside conversion by proactively managing our cost structure, as volumes have pulled back and maintained the benefits of our 6 execution actions from earlier in the year, another testament to the effectiveness of our teams globally. Slide 18 summarizes our income tax expense for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012. As I stated earlier on the call, our effective tax rate was 58% in the fourth quarter, as no tax benefit was recognized on the $18 million onetime charge related to the remeasurement of asbestos liabilities. For the year, our effective tax rate was 41%, in line with our expectations. Now let's turn to Slide 19. For the fourth quarter, free cash flow from continuing operations, before restructuring, was $37 million, $10 million higher than the same period last year. Lower earnings and higher pension contributions in 2012 were more than offset by outstanding working capital performance and reductions in capital spending dictated by market dynamics. Total free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $31 million, $8 million higher than the fourth quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the reasons just mentioned. And remember, the fourth quarter and full year 2012 figures include a $25 million voluntary pension contribution that Chip mentioned earlier. For the full fiscal year, free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was $22 million, $16 million higher than 2011. Again, our improvements in working capital and decreases in capital expenditures more than offset the significant increases in our pension contributions. Total free cash flow for 2012 was a negative $12 million, an improvement of $58 million. Reduction in cash required by our discontinued operations, off slightly by higher restructuring cash payments in 2012, partially led to the improvement year-over-year along with the other items just discussed. Slide 20 describes our current pension and retiree medical status. As of September 30, 2012, our U.S. and global pension plans were $529 million underfunded compared to $557 million underfunded at the end of fiscal year 2011. The underfunded position improved over the last 12 months as our asset returns exceeded our planning assumptions and we made sizable contributions to our global plans. Unfortunately, discount rates moved against us, which negatively impacted our reported funded status. In the U.S., we saw the discount rate at the end of September 2012 drop to 4.2%, down significantly from 4.9% seen at the end of 2011. But even with the significant declines in discount rates, our global pension funded status improved as our discount rate hedging strategies cushioned the negative impact of declining rates. For fiscal year 2013, we expect global pension expense to be 0. This is due to better-than-expected investment returns and significant contributions made in 2012, partially offset by the lower discount rate I just spoke of. In 2013, we will be winding up and annuitizing one of our significant Canadian pension plans as required under Canadian pension rules and regulations. The expected onetime settlement costs related to this windup are not included in our pension expense assumptions. We are currently planning to contribute $73 million to the global pension plans in 2013, a decrease of $29 million year-over-year, as we prefunded $25 million of contributions in our fourth quarter of 2012. The amounts in 2013 include an estimated $5 million to $7 million of contributions related to the Canadian pension plan windup I just mentioned. OPEB expense was $42 million in 2012, and we expect a slight decrease in 2013 to $41 million. This level has been fairly consistent over the past few years and benefit payments continue to approximate the expense running through the income statement. In 2013, we'll expect ongoing OPEB benefit payments of $40 million. Next, I'd like to review our fiscal year 2013 outlook on Slide 21. As Chip discussed earlier, the demand assumptions for many of our key markets in 2013 are much weaker than we hoped, particularly in the global commercial truck and China off-highway markets. We also expect to see a significant drop in our FMTV production, as that program winds down over the next couple of years. As a result, we expect sales in fiscal year 2013 to be approximately $4 billion, down around $400 million from 2012 and much lower than we were expecting about 6 months ago. Our revenue outlook is based on our market assumptions that Chip outlined on Slides 8 through 10. Similar to last quarter, I want to stress that there is still significant volatility in many of the markets we serve, especially in North America, China and Brazil. But this is our best look today based upon our detailed bottoms-up forecast and input from our customers. Given our revenue assumption for 2013, we expect to earn an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 7%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be $0.25 to $0.35, reflecting lower pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring is expected to be about breakeven, with the decrease in earnings largely offset by lower pension contributions and capital expenditures. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 is forecasted to be around 50%, with a higher rate at the beginning of the year and reductions in that rate expected with each quarter as we progress through 2013. We expect the higher effective rate primarily due to the decline in revenue and earnings in our North American and European Commercial Truck businesses and our military business. As you recall, because we have a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions, we do not get a tax benefit when earnings decline. Now let's turn to Slide 22. While we are not providing quarterly guidance, I did want to take the opportunity to comment on the volatility we anticipate in 2013 and the effect we think it will have on the quarterly timing of revenue in some of our businesses. Chip already reviewed the markets earlier in the presentation, but I wanted to expand on that further. There is a lot of data and commentary out there on the North American truck market. And while we do not believe fundamentals, we do believe that fundamentals continue to be positive, Class 8 orders have pulled back over the past couple of quarters and many fleets remain on the sidelines. We were encouraged by the October net orders, however, it remains uncertain when they will translate into builds and if that trend will continue or even strengthen. For now, we are forecasting a step-down in our first quarter with increases each quarter as we move through 2013. We don't expect to get back to production levels we had in our fourth quarter of 2012 until sometime during the second half of the year. Europe overall remains an area of concern as it seems there are more indications the economy will weaken further before getting better. The fourth fiscal quarter for this business is always the weakest because of the summer shutdowns. So we do expect a small uptick in the first quarter. Revenue should then remain flat until our third quarter, with the seasonal falloff again in the fourth. Keep in mind we are expecting 2013 to again be weaker than 2012, which had already stepped down 10% from 2011. So overall, we are expecting revenue to remain weak in Europe, which also carries over to our Aftermarket business. In Brazil, we think the market is going to bump along where it has been since January with no real revenue increase until our third fiscal quarter. While we have seen some pickup in order activity over the last couple of weeks, it is unclear if this is an indication of a recovery. As of now, we aren't seeing a meaningful impact of the government incentives on our business. Historically, these incentives have driven demand increases, so we were hopeful and continue to closely monitor our order patterns there. Until we see a significant shift in momentum, we don't feel comfortable forecasting a recovery any sooner than the May-June period of 2013. For China, there is still too much inventory in the channel for construction equipment. So we think production will remain at this depressed level for a few more months and begin to increase as we get into our second fiscal quarter. But even then, we are still expecting volume to be below 2012 levels. Next, I want to talk about our military revenue even though it is not on the slide. For FMTV shipments, Chip already mentioned the year-over-year decline of 30%. This step-down will be felt even in our first quarter. We are forecasting shipments to be modestly stronger in the first half of the year than in the second half, as production schedules start to ramp down towards the eventual end of the program in late 2014. For the Caiman program, we will have production only in the first fiscal quarter. So total military sales will be the strongest in the first quarter, then step down slightly in the second with payment production completed, and finally, will decline modestly from there as FMTV starts to drop off a bit more later in the year. Finally, we always want to remind everyone that our quarter typically -- that our first quarter typically has the least amount of selling days out of the entire fiscal year. That holds true for 2013 with 5 fewer selling days in Q1 versus the fourth quarter of 2012. This is mostly due to the seasonality associated with holidays around the globe in December. So as you think about our full year guidance, you should expect that the first quarter will be our most challenging quarter of the year from a revenue and margin perspective. Please turn to Slide 23 for a review of some of our key planning assumptions for fiscal year 2013. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million as we continue to manage investments in line with market dynamics, while continuing to invest to drive operational efficiency and productivity improvements in our manufacturing facilities. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million, in line with 2012. Cash interest payments are expected to be $75 million to $85 million, down slightly from 2012. We expect to pay cash taxes in the range of $50 million to $60 million in 2013. And finally, with the announcement this week of the rationalization of our business segments and the additional actions Chip described that are under development, it is premature for us to provide an estimate of restructuring cash at this time. We plan on providing detailed information on this topic at our Analyst Day on February 5. Now I will turn the call back over to Chip, where he will wrap up with a summary of our 2013 priorities.
Charles G. McClure: Thank you, Jay. Let's turn to Slide 24. I wish to stress that our fourth quarter financial results were solid and in line with our expectations. Despite weakening sales volumes driven by stressed market conditions outside the U.S., we were able to maintain improved adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year through cost controls and continued manufacturing efficiency improvements. This performance was driven by the focus, the attention and the flexibility of our management team to deliver on our commitments. In 2013, our team will demonstrate this same resolve. Our priorities will be to: maintain flexibility in uncertain market and successfully execute as global markets recover; remain focused on rigorous cost management; continue to implement appropriate balance sheet strategies; and continue to invest in new product developments and maintain market and technology leadership positions. Again, we'll review these strategies and actions in greater detail during our Analyst Day on February 5. Now I'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.
Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital, Research Division: It's actually Steven Hempel on for Brian Johnson. I just had a question around the litigation with Eaton. Could you provide just an update on that litigation, the expected dollar amount, as well as the possible timing of the trial date?
Charles G. McClure: Well first, I can't give you -- this is Chip. And I can't give an update on the dollar amount, but let me just for the audience just to let you know that back on September 28, the Third Circuit court did find in favor of Meritor, supporting the jury's finding that Eaton had engaged in anticompetitive conduct and actually remanded the case back to district court for further proceedings on damages. Eaton did appeal that. And on the 26th of October, so just last month, the circuit -- Third Circuit court did deny Eaton's petition for a rehearing on this. And so at this point, it looks like it's going to be remanded back to district court for proceeding on damages. There is some initial contact starting even later this month, but really can set timing at this point. But it has been remanded back to district court for damages and expected to proceed that way.
Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just a follow-up in terms of looking out to 2013 revenues here. On Slide 22, it looks like you're expecting obviously the back half to be a little more revenue back end-loaded. Is this the way you guys are looking at revenue for 2013, to be more back end-loaded? And then if you could just sort of hit on the margins as well. I understand we've got some puts and takes with lower FMTV production. If you could possibly try and bucket the revenue and margins into China off-highway, military and commercial vehicle, that'd be kind of helpful.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Sure. Steven, this is Jay Craig. Using Chart 22 -- and I don't think this is too dissimilar what you're hearing from others in the industry. The one thing to remember is given our September 30 fiscal year, as you look at our first quarter, which is the fourth calendar quarter, I think we, and most of the industry, are looking at -- looking for that to be fairly weak around the globe in all commercial truck markets and in the Chinese construction market. We think there's a lot of positives later in the year, whether it be the runoff of the Euro 5 engines in Brazil and the effect of the stimulus actions that have been taken in that economy, the benefit of the stimulus actions in China on our sector and off-highway that we think will benefit us in the second half of the year. We think the fundamentals in the North American truck market are very strong, and we view the recent declines up until October orders in order activity to really be temporary and that the long-term dynamics are very strong. And improving, given the improvement housing market in the U.S., which should drive additional demand as well. I think the most difficult one for us to call is Europe. There is an emissions change coming at the end of 2013, the beginning of '14. Our hope was that would provide at least a floor to the demand in Europe. So far we are not seeing that. We're still seeing a slight step-down. But we're hopeful as we get towards the back half of the calendar year that, that looming emissions change could provide some order activity as we go through that market. Now as far as the impact on our margins, I think it generally flows with the volume puts and takes that I just walked through. Other than a couple of specifics, we tend to get higher margin expansion within Brazil recovers because of some of our unconsolidated joint ventures in that market. Also China tends to be a higher-margin region for us. And then offset by some declining -- continued declining volume in FMTV. But as Chip spoke to, we're already looking through with the rationalization of our business segments. We're looking to take some very significant cost reduction actions in anticipation of the runoff of the FMTV program. And as we'll walk through in our Analyst Day in February, I think you can anticipate we should start to receive the benefit of those actions in our margin towards the latter half of the year.
Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Perfect. And just one quick follow-up here. I'm just trying to bucket the China off-highway, military and commercial vehicle. Obviously, we're looking at 2013 volumes down $400 million. I was just wondering if you could try and roughly break out the reduction. Is it roughly equally split between those 3 segments in China off-highway, military and commercial? Or is it more geared towards military?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I would say it's -- I think we're not providing those details today within the segment. But obviously, the China off-highway market has stepped down very significantly. And as Chip mentioned, FMTV volumes this year are coming in 2013. We expect to be about 30% lower than 2012.
Charles G. McClure: Yes. Steven, just to add to that. I think if you look at the China off-highway very quickly, that has been soft in China for a period of time. So that has actually been carried for the last couple of quarters in 2012. And then the military step-down, as you look at it, really is beginning this fiscal year just from a timing point of view.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Graham Mattison from Lazard Capital Markets.
Graham Mattison - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Just a question. On the -- in the past, you'd said that you needed about $5.2 billion to get a 10% EBITDA margin. Given the changes that you've made in the cost adjustments, can you give us a sense of what type of revenue you need to get back to that 8% to 9% level or even to the 10% level now?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I think obviously, we've taken out a lot of fixed cost on the business. I think our thought is it's measurably lower than that number. I think as we get to February 5, we'll probably give you some indication of where we think that point may be as we talk through the details to the rationalization program of going from 3 to 2 segments. But I think you can expect it's measurably lower than the $5.2 billion we gave guidance to you before.
Graham Mattison - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: All right. Great. And then just looking at South America, what's underpinning your expectations for the May-June pickup? Is it the run through the Euro 3 inventory? Or is there something else behind that we should be thinking of?
Charles G. McClure: Graham, this is Chip. And if you look at it, one is, similar to what we have in North America, the age of the fleet is 1 driver that way. Second, you had to -- as you move from Euro 3 to Euro 5, you have to have access to ultra-low sulfur fuel, which outside of the urban areas, was not present out in the rural areas during the middle part of this calendar year. So that kind of slowed it down that way. So as you look at it, I think those are a couple of drivers, as you look at it, that as we look to anticipate kind of that pickup that way. The third thing that the Brazilian government has done very effectively in past is they've actually provided incentives, whether on the tax side or their interest rates that they refer to as FINAME, that have helped to kind of do that. The government has stepped up to do some of that. And right now, that -- but again, we haven't seen the effect. And again, I think part of that is driven by the lack of our access to fuel and some of that. I'll also tell you a fourth factor is again Brazil is more global and tied probably to some of the slowdown even seen in China. So there's been some macroeconomic things taking place that way. But having said all that, you then kind of look fast-forward. There's some shorter-term things like with the World Cup and some -- World Cup and the Olympics coming there, which will be a short-term infrastructure build. And then long-term -- longer-term, as you look at the presence of oil and natural gas that are drivers that way. So that's why we've kind of back end-loaded it, but do envision that as you go out into the second and third quarters of next calendar year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Two regional questions for you, and then one on just margins. First on, in Europe, in the statement you said earlier that you're not factoring in any kind of a prebuy due to the change in regulations into next year, is that something that you're factoring in just so you have a fairly cautious and easily defendable expectation underpinning your numbers? Or is that really the feedback that you've gotten from customers that you've spoken to in the region? And then secondly on the demand side. Can you tell us is there a mix impact in your North America business on the truck side from Navistar? Clearly, with the transition at the 13-liter, the expectation is that they're going to lose some share, and they're a pretty big customer for you. So maybe you could touch on those 2 things and have a follow-up on margins.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Patrick, this is Jay Craig. I think in Europe, what we are cautioned by is that in the U.S., if you recall, the most recent recession offset any benefit of an expected prebuy back in 2010. So we have seen a similar condition occur. And so I think that's really the issue that we see why we're a bit cautious in Europe. It's just -- and I think that is consistent with our largest customer, Volvo. If you read some of their latest earnings announcements and through our discussions with them, they are starting to have that same caution as well. And then I'm sorry, if I could just have you repeat the question on margins, that would be helpful.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Well, I didn't ask yet. Actually I just wanted to find out whether Navistar was an issue in terms of how you're looking at North America was the kind of the second part of the question, just given the transition of the 13-liter engine next year, which could potentially affect their share, and they're a big customer.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Well, we have seen, I think, as you're reading, some fairly material market share shifts in North America. But I think as we've always stated, I think the great benefit we have with our current business model is we are standard vision [ph] effectively on 3 of the 4 OEs. And the 3 have large fleet exposure. So I think you can even -- if you box our revenues to what we performed this year in North America as compared to the industry, you can see we've had very little impact to that market share shift. So we just continue to work closely with all 3 of our customers and try and support their success as best as we can.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just quickly on margins, if I may. I believe your guidance implies a decremental of about 15%, which is pretty good, just given the extent of the revenue decline that you're forecasting. And also just in the context of having a mixed headwind from slower Industrial -- or military rather. So is what's going on there really just kind of digging deep into more restructuring actions in Slide 11? Or is there anything else that I'm not sort of factoring in there as we think about that number?
Jeffrey A. Craig: Just a few things. I think obviously, the adjustments to the fixed costs that we continue to make just recognize the realities of government spending in our markets. I think it's had a very significant favorable impact. I think our team has done a great job of staying ahead of those issues. I mean remember, FMTV doesn't go away for almost 2 years. But we're almost 24 months ahead of time taking the actions necessary to adjust to that environment. And also, though, we've seen some great benefits from the price increases we've put in last year. The closure of our Saint Priest facility in Europe and we're getting the fourth quarter benefit of that. We only got 3 quarters of it last year. And also we've had some great material performance out of our purchasing team. We're really getting on stride, getting our stride and affecting material cost reductions that are not just related to just the index [ph] reduction.
Charles G. McClure: Patrick, this is Chip. And hopefully, what we demonstrated in the last 4 to 5 quarters is the fact that we do respond proactively as opposed to reactively to what we see in the market conditions. And to kind of reinforce what Jay said, the FMTV doesn't really wind down for another 2 years. But we're trying to do that proactively at this point. And that is part of what you're seeing as you look at that kind of margin walk going forward. And hopefully, the last 4 to 5 quarters have demonstrated our team's ability to be able to do that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer from Wolfe Trahan.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: If I could ask the margin/Navistar question in a little bit of a different way. With their Garland facility closing in, I guess, the near-term, can you give us a sense of -- if that's going to have any sort of outsized impact on margins in the fiscal first quarter or fiscal second quarter and maybe that margin impact recedes through the year? And from a logistical standpoint and/or materials cost, could there be any efficiencies there as you adjust to that?
Jeffrey A. Craig: Tim, this is Jay. Good question. We are studying that impact. Obviously, we serve Navistar's Mexican facility, which is expected to be the significant beneficiary of that transition of production out of both our joint venture in Mexico and our wholly owned operation. So we do have local production to serve their needs. So I don't think we're as concerned about the logistics cost as we are just kind of the legal structure of some of those earnings going through our joint venture in Mexico. And we're still analyzing that. But I think you can take away that in our guidance we've anticipated the impacts of that change that should occur later in our fiscal year.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Okay. And another follow-up on Brazil. It did seem like a lot of that European OEMs were fairly constructive on orders in the quarter and we started to see at least October sales looked a little bit better. I was wondering, I guess, why you're not seeing a pickup until, I guess calendar second quarter. I think maybe perhaps it was [indiscernible] who actually said that some of the current incentives would require delivery during the calendar first quarter of the year. And I'm just wondering, obviously, there's always a lot of uncertainty around Brazilian incentives and when they'll be extended, but yes.
Jeffrey A. Craig: This is Jay. [ph] We're reading the same things you are and we're having conversations with our customers in Brazil. And I think the overall impression of that market is mixed. I think you're seeing some people see the increase in October registrations to be a very positive sign as are we. But we just are a bit cautious whether that is the signal that there's a long-term recovery coming in the market. And the other item to keep in consideration that I mentioned earlier in the Q&A is because of our September 30th fiscal year, our first fiscal quarter ends here in December. And even for the people seeing the market, I think, on the more favorable side, they expect that benefit in the new calendar year. So that there's a little bit of mix and match on fiscal versus calendar year relative to our guidance.
Charles G. McClure: And just to reinforce, Tim, we have seen obviously, as you've indicated the last couple of weeks, that kind of uptick and it's probably a little too early to call it that way. But as Jay said, we are getting through the first quarter already, so it's really in the second and third quarter. But as we met with a lot of our customers both there and also at the Hannover truck show, there is optimism as you look at it going into 2013 because of the fuel availability and also the government's actions that they're taking to stimulate these moves. So we certainly feel it is going to occur, it's just a matter of the timing of when it does occur.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Okay. And then one more quick one on Wabash. I'm guessing, even though you weren't standard on Wabash trailers prior to this recent contract win, that you still had a pretty decent percentage of their production just from customer spec-ing activity. Can you give us a sense of sort of what the incremental increase...
Charles G. McClure: Now first of all, Tim, your statement is fairly correct. I mean, we were a fairly large supplier to them prior to having standard position. So it's more just kind of a reaffirmation by our customers through long-term commitment on that. But I think your statement is that so. So there is some incremental increase that way, but a lot of that was already reflected in the sales we were getting prior to having standard positions. So it's more a recognition of both our customers and our customers' customer support for our products in the trailers.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Okay. Any sense of -- are you going from 30% of their production up to 80%? Or is it something smaller than that? Or can you maybe have any...
Jeffrey A. Craig: I think, Tim, our plan is on February 5 at our Analyst Day, we're going to be providing a little more detail on all the wins we've had the prior 12 months and what we think the potential impacts are on increase in market share or revenue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky from Sidoti.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I was wondering on this Eaton lawsuit. Is this the final appeal that they can do? Or can they still take that to the Supreme Court?
Charles G. McClure: Yes. They can still take it to the Supreme Court if decide to do that. But at this point, it appears like the activity is taking place at the district court as far as where it's been remanded back to circuit court. So yes, there is still that one final ability if they want to go to the Supreme Court. But at least at this point, as I kind of indicated, discussions are already starting back at the district court level, so expect it that way.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: So that's a positive indicator that it might not escalate, but you still don't fully know yet?
Charles G. McClure: Still don't know. But yes, I would view that as positive. And obviously, the actions in the last couple of months we view as positive, too.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. Then do you need to share any these benefits when you do get some renumeration with your former JV partner? And is this going to be taxed at all?
Charles G. McClure: The answer is yes. This was done jointly with our partner, so it would be done that way.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Obviously, we have very significant NOLs in the U.S., so we -- the tax charge for us would be very de minimis.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. But should we assume like a 50-50 split with the JV partner?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I don't think we've disclosed -- obviously, there's compensation to our attorneys. There's compensation to the partner. We haven't disclosed the arrangements we have with those parties.
Charles G. McClure: And Robert, the other thing I'd also mention, back to the Supreme Court appeal, and I am by no means a legal expert. But my understanding is that they really do accept very few appeals to go to Supreme Court. So I feel pretty good that from a circuit court, being remanded back to district court.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. But you're not ready to give any kind of guidance as to how much the split would be with...
Jeffrey A. Craig: No. Obviously, gain contingencies would be great. But we're operating the business as if it's 0. And any benefit of that would just go towards our long-term goals of deleveraging the balance sheet. So that's how we’re treating it.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: And then 2 other kind of free cash flow questions. I guess first off on CapEx for next year. What programs did you pull back on? And are you taking advantage of any of the cyclical weakness to rebuild any machines? Or do you think everything is okay for the next upturn?
Jeffrey A. Craig: We think the guidance we gave for next year is above our ongoing depreciation and amortization. So I wouldn't think of it -- I would think of the last few years as being fairly heavy investment periods, and we're really getting more back to normal than the opposite. So I don't think -- as we've looked at the plan, we feel like we're significantly constraining capital investments that we think are required to keep to increase our margin and increase productivity.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. So all production capacity looks to be okay if you do get an uptick in volume. There's not going to be any kind of rebuild situation like we had last year.
Jeffrey A. Craig: We think better than ever, we -- obviously, we have some operational hiccups almost 2 years ago now. But we have been operating in an extremely volatile environment very effectively for almost 2 years now. So I think we are very confident in our ability to...
Charles G. McClure: And as a small microcosm that I indicated with this ramp-up on the FMTV, the military program, which we were able to do. And again, as both our internal production and with our suppliers, I think we clearly demonstrated the ability to kind of manage that ramp-up very effectively.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then finally for free cash flow for next year, do you see free cash flow being an outflow in the beginning of like this next quarter and the quarter after just based upon the securitizations still come down with volumes? Or do you see inventories...
Jeffrey A. Craig: That's a good question, Rob. I think as you typically see with us, the first quarter is usually an outflow. I don't think we anticipate anything that will change that pattern. And it has to do with obviously Europe, we intend to see some securitization outflow from the volume shifts in the first quarter, the holiday period. As I've mentioned before, some of -- a lot of our customers are calendar year end. Some of those payments seemed to arrive a day or 2 after the end of the calendar year. So we tend to see an outflow in the first fiscal quarter, but that's all incorporated in our annual guidance.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Christy Daehnert for any closing remarks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Meritor Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Christy Daehnert, Director, Investor Relations. And you have the floor, ma'am.
Christy Daehnert: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Call. On the call today we have Chip McClure, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jay Craig, our CFO. The slides accompanying today's call are available at www.meritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call, which we're recording, is the property of Meritor, Inc.

Let me now refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you'll find a reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Chip.
Charles G. McClure: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3 for detail on Meritor's quarter-over-quarter performance. Revenue was $1.1 billion in the third quarter, a 4% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. This decline was primarily due to unfavorable currency exchange of approximately $30 million and significant deterioration in China and India, and we'll provide more detail later on the call on that. Adjusted EBITDA decreased from $95 million to $92 million quarter-over-quarter. EBITDA margin, however, increased from 8.2 % to 8.3%, despite the revenue decline. The execution actions we highlighted in prior quarters are providing the sustained financial improvement we anticipated. Adjusted income from continuing operations increased from $32 million to $37 million, or 16% from the second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.05 per share to $0.38, as we continue to experience a more normalized tax rate. Free cash flow increased $115 million in the third quarter, from negative $69 million in the second quarter to positive $46 million in the third quarter. This increase resulted primarily from improvements in working capital. Before we move to an analysis of the global markets, let me highlight that given the current global economic climate and the challenges inherent in projecting industry production volumes, we'll use internal Meritor industry forecast this quarter. These volume assumptions underlie our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2012 that Jay will detail later in the call. Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a discussion on Meritor's Commercial Truck segment in North and South America and Europe and the industry dynamics that affected the business in the third quarter. The charts at the top of the page reflect our geographic revenue allocation in the first 9 months of both fiscal year 2011 and 2012. We've experienced a considerable mix shift in regional sales between North America, where we've seen good growth, and South America, where we've seen significant contraction in the second and third quarter of the fiscal year. We've shared with you in the past that South America represents our highest-margin region of the world for the Commercial Truck segment. The long-term improvements we executed this year in the form of pricing and manufacturing footprint rationalization have helped us to offset the impacts of the economic slowdowns in South America and Europe. This regional shift would have been significantly more impactful prior to the implementation of these actions. The table in the bottom right indicates the status of our forecast for changes in Commercial Truck production volumes. At this time, Commercial Truck volumes in North America and Europe remain in line with our prior guidance. We do see some downside risk in North America, with modest upside potential in Europe. While North America remains stable, lower order intake may affect the remainder of fiscal year 2012 into 2013. We are maintaining our forecast for an increase of approximately 25% in truck volumes in North America and a decrease of 10% for Europe. Our volume forecast in South America has further declined from our forecast last quarter. We now believe that truck production in South America will decrease more than 20% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, the anticipated recovery in Brazil in the second half has not occurred, which drove our forecast for the year down from what we expected last quarter. Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss more specifically our industry outlook for North America and Western Europe for fiscal year 2012. We expect Class 8 volumes to be 291,000 units for the fiscal year, up nearly 30% year-over-year. However, we continue to closely monitor market conditions. In Class 5-7, we anticipate industry production to be at 172,000 units, up approximately 8% from fiscal year 2011. Longer-term forecast continued to show growth, but at a slightly slower rate. Current data indicate downward pressure on the build rate of Class 5-7. In Western Europe, we continue to expect the truck market to be down year-over-year due to the ongoing economic conditions in that region. We are forecasting industry truck volumes in Europe at 365,000 units in fiscal year 2012. Truck orders in the region have stabilized and are in line with expectations. Meritor's largest customer has publicly reaffirmed their market outlook on a calendar year, down 5% from 2011. The normal summer shutdown period in this region will drive a weaker fourth fiscal quarter. Looking forward, certain major European truck manufacturers have launched their Euro 6 solution. We anticipate a possible pre-buy, starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 due to the price the increase associated with Euro 6-compliant trucks. As I noted earlier, the recovering South America has not occurred to the level we expected. If you turn to Slide 6, we'll provide further detail. Meritor is now forecasting industry truck volumes of 153,000 to 163,000 units in South America for fiscal year 2012, a decline of more than 20% year-over-year. Medium- and heavy-duty production declined in the second quarter of the calendar year from the prior year. This decline in production is outpacing the decline in sales, thus, reducing inventory. While Europe 3 inventories are being depleted, unfortunately, they're still higher than initially believed when we spoke to you last quarter. And Euro 5 acceptance has been slower than originally expected due to higher truck prices and the difficulty in obtaining S50 diesel fuel and urea-based diesel exhaust fluid, both required for Euro 5 engines. It does not appear that the NAMI [ph] incentives we referenced in our second quarter call have had a significant impact yet. We do, however, continue to believe that South America will return as a strong market as early as fiscal year 2013. We anticipate economic growth to be driven by governmental actions promoting production and consumption, stabilized inventory levels and greater availability and distribution of Euro 5 diesel. Let's turn to Slide 7. Our industrial forecast for fiscal year 2012 is mixed. In North America, our expectations for defense are stable and have not changed materially since our second quarter call. The outlook for China and India, however, is weaker than we previously thought. Both countries are experiencing a slowdown due to the impact of domestic economic issues, as well as effects of the European debt crisis. Last quarter, we believed industry production in China would be down for the year, approximately 10%. We've revised that to a closer to a 15% decline year-over-year. While many dynamics are at play, infrastructure projects have slowed, which is driving much of the off-highway decline. Our production is expected to be down more than that, given the mix of products we supply in that market. We also expected India to be relatively flat. We are now revising that forecast to indicate more than a 5% decline year-over-year. Reduced growth and inflation is driving lower forecasts. On the bottom half of this slide, we reiterate our forecast for FMTV production, which has returned to peak volumes, as expected. If you turn to Slide 8, we'll provide more detail in the industry production outlook and market dynamics for China and India, both of which have now become a first half, second half story in terms of the effects on Meritor's end markets. In China, the typical spring seasonal peak for the off-highway segment did not occur in our third fiscal quarter. Meritor's end markets related to infrastructure activity are down. The reduction of infrastructure projects in the region is negatively affecting crane production and loader and excavator volumes are down with the slowing of the housing sector. These declines are being partially offset by the mining segment, which is stabilizing, and the bus and coach segment, which is improving. Our sales in China are expected to be roughly 30% lower in the second half of fiscal year 2012, as compared to the first half of the year. If you look at the bottom half of the slide, you'll see we expect the India truck production to be in the range of 305,000 to 320,000 units. India's GDP growth in the second quarter of this fiscal year was at a 9-year low. Inflation is below last year's level, but still a concern in the market. Several factors are contributing to the economic issues in India, including weak exports, overstocked inventory and declines in investment, driving lower production volumes. Our sales in India, including the effects of currency, are now expected to be about 40% lower in the second half compared to the first half of fiscal year 2012. The Indian government, however, has recently indicated that a major investment in the country's infrastructure is being considered and could play a significant role in reviving the sluggish economy. Let's turn to Slide 9. As we look at the Aftermarket & Trailer segment, our outlook for aftermarket North America and Europe has weakened from our previous expectations, driven by the mild winter, slight economic softness in North America and weaker currency translation. Truck ton miles are down slightly from last quarter's forecast to 2.7 trillion miles. As you'll recall, this is one market indicator we use to forecast revenue in our North American aftermarket business. Year-over-year, the U.S. truck ton miles growth rate has slowed, with June increasing at the slowest pace in 3 months. While the aftermarket business experienced year-over-year growth in the first 2 quarters of this fiscal year, we had an unexpected year-over-year decline in the third quarter, primarily driven by Europe and South America. In Europe, customers are de-stocking and moving to lower price points due to the economic conditions in the region. In North America, the third fiscal quarter's typically a revenue peak, driven by seasonal maintenance. This maintenance, however, was pulled ahead to the second quarter due to the mild winter temperatures. Also, fleet utilization declined year-to-date in the second quarter of 2012 calendar year from the same period last year. If we look at fleet utilization at truck ton miles, we believe fleets may be putting more miles on fewer trucks, thus requiring slightly less maintenance overall. In Asia-Pacific, however, footprint and product line expansion are offsetting the impact of the current economic climate. Our forecast for the trailer business is basically unchanged from the previous quarter. For North American trailer production, we're forecasting 237,000 units in fiscal year 2012, a 22% increase from fiscal year 2011 and just slightly below our forecast last quarter. However, the market appears stable and order boards have leveled with a low number of cancellations. For our fourth fiscal quarter, we are expecting a typical slow period. Overall, we expect sales for the Aftermarket & Trailer segment to be roughly flat year-over-year. Looking at Slide 10, we've highlighted for you new business in each of our segments. In spite of the temporary market weaknesses we outlined, we continue to be encouraged by significant new wins around the world. In Commercial Truck, we were awarded the rear axle for the new VW 10-ton truck being launched this quarter. And we were named the dual-source supplier to Iveco for inter-axle drivelines in Brazil. In North America, major fleets, such as Waste Management, Air Products and Canadian Cartage, are specifying Meritor disc brake technology. As a result, the brake is being made available as an optional feature with the major North American OEMs. Our joint venture MeritorWABCO was recently awarded standard position for its anti-lock braking system at Navistar. International ProStar and Lonestar Class 8 trucks featuring MeritorWABCO ABS with optional electronics stability control and on-guard safety systems. In our Industrial segment, we're working closely with our customers to engineer and bring products to market that are customized by application and offer benefits in terms of efficiency gains, weight savings and extended durability. In India, we launched our 2-speed green axle with Tata Motors and the Ashok Leyland through our automated axles joint venture. This axle is customized for local operating conditions with extreme great capability and delivers up to 10% fuel savings. We also introduced off-highway axles with 2 new customers. Also in India, we recently shipped a new military 6X6 axle prototype to one of our customers. In China, we introduced 3 new axle models for the mining truck market. We have more than 50% market penetration with the 4 largest OEMs in this segment, and we plan to launch heavier axle capacities in fiscal year 2013. And in North America, we are aligned with 3 prime contractors on the JLTV-funded U.S. military program, as we've noted in past quarters. Two of those 3 were included in the tech demo phase, which we believe positions them well heading into the down select in late August. In the Aftermarket & Trailer segment, our MTA trailer suspension has been specified by Bynum Transport, a specialized tank truck transportation company, and we're seeing increasing strength in orders for our RideSentry trailer air suspension, which is a revelation in trailer undercarriage departure. This year, we opened a new aftermarket warehouse in Singapore that will supply Southeast Asia. This facility will provide commercial vehicle axle, brake, driveline and suspension parts to distributor's in the region, along with thousands of truck operators. And we opened a new aftermarket facility in South America, complete with offices, a training center, warehouse and operations. Meritor was also awarded business for private label brake shoes from a major distributor in North America and was awarded a contract to remanufacture trailer axles for the intermodal market. We're working on to expand our reach by offering market-leading technology and products that benefit our long-standing and new customers whether commercial vehicle OEM, fleet, owner-operator or aftermarket customer. Let's now turn to Slide 11. In spite of our focus and execution, we are pleased to say we are winning new business based on market-leading products for our customer. We have executed operational improvements and increased productivity and significantly reduced premium cost. And despite recent declines in revenue, we have enhanced our EBITDA margin to levels not previously sustained by the business. We've restructured the business where appropriate to fit current market conditions, and we are generating positive cash flow despite revenue declines and are maintaining an adequate level of liquidity to manage all cycles. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay, as he provides you with a more detailed financial review.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Thanks, Chip. Good morning. On today's call, I will provide a detailed review of our third quarter results, as well as our guidance for fiscal year 2012. On Slide 12, you will see our third quarter income statement from continuing operations. Overall, we delivered solid financial results despite the decline in sales. For our third fiscal quarter of 2012, we are on $0.38 per share of adjusted income from continuing operations, compared to $0.30 in the same period last year. Sales were down $159 million year-over-year or 13% due to the lower production in Brazil, Europe, China and India, as well as weaker currency translation. The decreases we saw in the European commercial truck market were in line with our internal forecasts, but the sales reductions in Brazil, China and India were far worse than expected. Gross margin was down just slightly year-over-year. But more importantly, gross margin as a percent of sales improved to 130 basis points in spite of the sales decline. We are pleased with this increase, as it is a reflection of the financial benefit of the execution items completed at the beginning of our second fiscal quarter. SG&A was $4 million lower year-over-year and has again been maintained at a consistent level of approximately 6% of sales. Restructuring costs were $3 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2012, primarily associated with the European salary headcount reduction program we announced last quarter. The remaining anticipated costs under this plan are approximately $2 million and are expected to be incurred in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012. Next, we recognized a gain on sale of property of $16 million during the third quarter. This gain is associated with the sale of excess land at our commercial truck facility in Wales. The property gain and restructuring charges are both excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Other income was down $4 million from the prior year. Last year, we recognized a $5 million nonoperating gain on the collection of a note receivable related to a previously divested business. Earnings in our minority-owned affiliates were down over 40%, or $9 million year-over-year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower earnings from our affiliates and South America to the recent emissions change, softening economic conditions in this region and the impact of foreign currency translation. Interest expense increased $3 million year-over-year, due to amortization of incremental fees associated with the renewal of a revolving credit facility during the quarter and the write-off of previously deferred fees, in connection with the termination of our existing U.S. securitization program. In June, we entered into a new $100 million U.S. securitization facility, with more efficient pricing, and terminated the existing facility, allowing us to extend the maturity to June 2015. Our effective tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which is lower than what we consider to be a more normalized rate. I will provide a more detailed update on the effective tax rate later in the presentation. On the next few slides, I will discuss the quarterly results for each of our 3 business segments. Slide 13 shows third quarter sales and segment EBITDA for Commercial Truck. North American production volumes for heavy- and medium-duty trucks increased 15% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 as compared to the same period a year ago. However, the increase in sales in North America was more than offset by lower sales in South America and Europe, as production volumes in these regions were down 18% and 13%, respectively. In South America, the industry transitioned to tighter emissions standard requirements for commercial vehicles, resulting in lower production volumes beginning in our second fiscal quarter of 2012. The recovery has been slower than previously expected and we do not see production returning to 2011 levels during fiscal year 2012. I'd like to emphasize the point Chip made earlier regarding our geographic sales mix in this business unit. In the past, the significant change in sales mix, with South America becoming a smaller portion of the segment, would have deteriorated our EBITDA margins, as South America is the most profitable region in this segment. Now with the actions we've executed, the impact of reduced sales in South America has been more than offset, and we are very pleased with the results. The effects of foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by $47 million compared to the same period a year ago, as the Brazilian reais and the euro weakened against the U.S. dollar. Segment EBITDA margin increased to 7%, compared to 6.4% in the prior year despite lower sales. The increase in margin reflects the benefit of profit improvement actions completed in the second fiscal quarter, which was only partially offset by the South America headwinds previously discussed. Now let's turn to Slide 14 to review the Industrial segment results. Third quarter sales were $242 million, a decrease of $66 million, or 21% year-over-year. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales in China and India. Despite the lower sales, the Industrial segment EBITDA margin increased to 150 basis points, to 8.3% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. The impact of lower sales in the Asia-Pacific region was more than offset by higher FMTV sales and higher pricing on other North American products within the segment. Next, on Slide 15, we summarize the Aftermarket & Trailer segment financial results, comparing the third fiscal quarter of 2012 to the same period in 2011. Sales were down $13 million year-over-year, to $265 million. The decrease in sales is primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales by $10 million compared to the prior year. In addition, sales of our core aftermarket replacement products were lower, partially offset by higher sales of products for trailer applications in North America. Segment EBITDA decreased $11 million, and EBITDA margin decreased to 9.4%. The decrease was primarily driven by higher material costs, lower affiliated earnings from our trailer joint venture in Brazil and weaker foreign currency translation. With the pricing actions we just implemented on July 1 in North American aftermarket, we expect to begin recovering some of the incremental material costs seen in this segment. Slide 16 shows the sequential adjusted EBITDA walk from our second fiscal quarter of 2012 to the third. The first line item shows that EBITDA improved $4 million due to the impact of higher pricing on both our North American military and commercial truck products and favorable mix in our North American Commercial Truck business. This good news was only partially offset by the lost EBITDA from lower total company sales. Next, we identified a $4 million increase in EBITDA versus the second quarter, which relates to a charge for a legal contingency incurred in the second quarter that did not repeat to the same extent in the third. The depreciation of the Brazilian real and the euro was a significant headwind in the third quarter, resulting in weaker translation of earnings, as the reais and the euro depreciated against the dollar by almost 14% and 6%, respectively, from the second fiscal quarter to the third. That was the primary driver of the $6 million decrease quarter-over-quarter due to foreign exchange. The next item on the walk summarizes the quarter-over-quarter impact associated with the reduction in earnings of our unconsolidated joint ventures, primarily in India and Brazil. We then had an all other decrease in EBITDA when compared to the prior quarter to the current of $3 million. That yields an adjusted EBITDA of $92 million in our third fiscal quarter, or 8.3%. We are very pleased with this performance, given that we are able to improve our EBITDA margin through outstanding operational execution, despite the revenue and currency headwinds. Slide 17 summarizes our income tax expense for the third fiscal quarter of 2012. As I stated earlier on the call, our effective tax rate was 19%. If you exclude the gain on the sale of land I highlighted earlier, our effective tax rate was 25%. Favorably impacting that rate was the fact that we generated earnings in certain jurisdictions where no tax expense is recognized. We expect our effective tax rate to be at a more normalized level through the remainder of fiscal year 2012. Now let's turn to Slide 18. For the third quarter free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring was $56 million, $35 million higher than the same period last year. Improved earnings and working capital performance, more than offset higher pension and retiree medical contributions made this year. We had about $15 million of mandatory catch-up pension contributions made to our U.S. pension plan during the third quarter, which will not recur next quarter. In addition, we did elect to pull forward a portion of other required pension contributions originally planned for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 to the third. Those are both reasons why you see such a step up year-over-year in that line item. Total company free cash flow was $46 million, $47 million higher than the third quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the reasons just mentioned, along with less cash required for our discontinued operations. Moving on to Slide 19, I'd now like to shift your focus to a review of our fiscal year 2012 revenue. Last quarter, we had reaffirmed our guidance at approximately $4.8 billion. There were several assumptions included in that guidance that have unfortunately deteriorated sharply since our last earnings call. Starting with foreign currency, we assumed exchange rates would stay relatively flat to the ending rates as of March 31. Instead, exchange rates weakened significantly in the last 90 days, most notably, the Brazilian reais and the euro, as I discussed earlier in the presentation. Next, and the most significant overall, is the weaker Brazilian commercial truck market. When we've reaffirmed guidance on our last earnings call, we thought the low point for truck part production would occur in our second fiscal quarter, with a meaningful recovery in the third and fourth quarters. That recovery did not occur in the third quarter to the extents expected, and we are no longer anticipating any meaningful recovery in the fourth quarter. The changes we've seen in the India market are the most surprising, as we, along with many in our space, were expecting India to remain fairly stable. In fact, we had cited that region to have production upside opportunity to our fiscal 2012 revenue guidance. Just a few months ago, we were expecting the Indian market to grow in the second half of the year. But given the changes we've seen over the past 90 days, we now expect revenue to be down approximately 35%, excluding the impact of currency in the second half of our fiscal year versus the first half. Turning to the aftermarket, we expected to see continued levels of demand for our products in North America, with the typical spring-selling seasonal uptick in our third fiscal quarter and some carryover effect into the fourth quarter. However, due to the reasons Chip's discussed previously in the call, third quarter sales actually came in lower than the second quarter, which, as you know, is quite than usual. We expect that softness to continue through the balance of the fiscal year, especially with the slowdown in the overall U.S. economy. Finally, in our China off-highway business, we anticipated continued levels of demand for our products, with an expected uptick in the spring, consistent with traditional seasonality. Like aftermarket, that uptick did not occur, and sales were actually lower sequentially in the third quarter. We expect sales to remain at that lower level in the fourth, as OEMs continue to reduce their inventory. Our guidance now contemplates China off-highway sales being approximately 30% lower in the second half of the year versus the first half, which is significantly worse than what we expected previously. Putting together the impact of all those factors, we are now adjusting our full year revenue guidance from $4.8 billion to a range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. And we have noted on the bottom of the slide that approximately 25% of that change in guidance is associated with currency headwinds, while the remainder is due to weaker end markets. Now let's turn to Slide 20, where I will review our revised fiscal year 2012 outlook. Based on the items I just summarized, we are forecasting fiscal year 2012 sales to range from $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming that we see stabilization in global currency markets. Next, given the changes in our revenue outlook, we are lowering our fiscal year 2012 adjusted EBITDA margin to a range of 7.6% to 8%. Our prior year guidance range from 8.2% to 8.6%. Last quarter, I mentioned that even if the Brazilian markets took longer to recover, we thought we'd still be able to achieve results in the original EBITDA margin guidance range. However, the unanticipated revenue and currency headwinds globally I discussed on the prior slide were too significant for us to hold the bottom end of the original range of 8.2%. Adjusted income from continuing operations is now expected to range to be $85 million to $110 million. Previously, this range was $105 million to $135 million. Our range for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations has been reduced to $0.90 to $1.15, from $1.08 to $1.39. Our guidance for free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring remains unchanged, at $0 to $50 million. And we are reaffirming our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 to be approximately 40%. Now let's move to Slide 21, which summarizes our revised planning assumptions for fiscal year 2012. We have lowered our range for capital expenditures to $90 million to $100 million based upon reduced spending in Brazil and China, in response to slowdowns in those markets. Previously, we expected this investment to range from $100 million to $110 million. We have refined our interest expense guidance and now expect total fiscal year 2012 interest expense to be approximately $95 million. Previously, we had disclosed a range of $85 million to $95 million, which included the impact of retiring the $84 million debt maturity in March 2012 and the new $100 million term loan added in April 2012. Cash interest payments are expected to be approximately $85 million, while previous guidance ranged from $75 million to $85 million. We've reduced the range of cash income taxes we expect to pay from $65 million to $80 million, down from $55 million to $65 million in fiscal year 2012, primarily due to the lower volumes we are now expecting in Brazil and China. And finally, we are still forecasting restructuring cash payments of approximately $20 million. Now we will turn the call back over to Chip, where he will wrap up with a summary of our 2012 priorities.
Charles G. McClure: Thanks, Jay. Let's turn to Slide 22. We remain committed to the priorities we established early in the year. We executed actions in the second quarter this fiscal year that are driving sustainable improvements. Despite the revenue impact this quarter from deterioration in the global markets, we are pleased that we're able to expand our adjusted EBITDA margin to 8.3%. Last year, we told you we were taking pricing actions with our customers. Upon a detailed review of the Meritor value proposition, we work with our customers to adjust pricing appropriately. We've carefully evaluated the need for strategic investments in advanced manufacturing. We're make investments in several regions of the world, and they're paying off. We work with our customers and suppliers daily to manage demand and capacity at a more detailed level than ever before. And we continue to drive the development of products for our customers to improve their overall competitiveness. We've launched products across all business segments in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific that are driving the business wins I highlighted earlier in this call. The Meritor brand represents market-leading OE and aftermarket drivetrain solutions that are fuel-efficient, durable, reliable, lightweight and supported by customer service and aftermarket support that is second to none in the industry. Finally, we maintain our commitment to delevering the company as we look to degenerate sustainable positive free cash flow. The extended maturity of our revolver and U.S. securitization facility and debt repayment features on our amended credit facility provide us with the financial flexibility to support the company's needs over the next several years. We're seeing results to the actions we implemented this year on our financial performance, but continue to identify actions that will provide further performance improvement opportunities. While managing appropriately to the changing-demand conditions taking place in our end markets around the world, we will maintain our diligence around these priorities. Now let's take your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Chip, on Slide 10, I was wondering if we could dig through that a little bit, if there's any way you can characterize a couple of things. How much of this new business here is new business to Meritor versus replacing existing contracts? If you can give us any idea of an aggregate, the revenue impact of that, and then the timing? And I think, at some of those, you talked about whether you're in production now or not. But the timing of when you -- when that hits the revenue line.
Charles G. McClure: Well, a fair amount of this is actually new incremental business in different markets. If you look just kind of quickly down the MeritorWABCO anti-lock braking system now being standard is one that's been an ongoing project that -- with Navistar that way. If I look at the green axles, and India's another example, we're really kind of bringing some of our latest technologies to India that way. We'd certainly be -- 2 new ones out in those arenas. And the Aftermarket & Trailer one, I think the important thing, as you look at that, is just the fact that we've really taken our aftermarket footprint that has been very successful here in North America, transferred that to Europe. And what we're highlighting in the bottom couple of bullet points there is doing the same thing in Singapore and South America. So that truly is new business and new market opportunities as we look at it that way.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And could you put any revenue number on that? I mean, you've been focused all along on getting the business and the footprint right. This is really the first time there's organic revenue that we're talking about, and if you could characterize that in any fashion would be great.
Charles G. McClure: Yes. I don't know if I can really characterize it in detail. Obviously, the disc brake is new business that way. The JLTV is one that, obviously, is in the future that way. But, Dave, I think it'll be difficult to go much beyond that at this point.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then one other item. As we look at the FMTV now that we're back on the volumes that we were before, and it's been a long 2 years getting there. Can you give us any sense on what that revenue impact is for you today versus 2 years ago when it went out? And then what the margin profile of that looks like today versus what it was 2 years ago when it went out?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I don't -- we do not disclose, David, separately the revenue of our military business within the Industrial segment. We have stated that the FMTV is one of our highest-margin products. And I can -- think you can see that, as you look at the margin comparison year-over-year with higher FMTV volumes and their impact on Industrial segment margins from last year. But we do not break that out separately, and actually, have been requested by some of our customers to be a little more opaque on some of what we're disclosing.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, I appreciate that. I guess, I'm trying to get the context of what the revenue is now versus 2 years. Just -- is it higher or lower? What are the margins...
Jeffrey A. Craig: Oh, I'm sorry, David. It is meaningfully higher than it was.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And is the profit margin on that better than it went out for BAE or...
Jeffrey A. Craig: No, we mentioned that when we transitioned from BAE, we actually saw pricing declines on when we moved to providing content for Oshkosh. And if you compare it to a couple of years ago, actually, David, it's relatively flat. So I -- if you compare it to last year, it's significantly increased from the prior year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky with Sidoti & Company.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I was just wondering on the -- Jay, you mentioned you pulled forward some of the pension contributions of the quarter. I was wondering what some of the rationale behind it is, what we should be able to -- for the fourth quarter and kind of any comment on the new pension contribution legislation that was passed.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Sure. For the rational for the fourth quarter -- is we've been quite pleased with the investment performance of our advisors, so we saw cash flow coming in strong this quarter. And we elected to pull forward some required contributions from the fourth quarter. As far as the impact to the legislation, we think it will measurably reduce our required contributions. And as we -- when we reach the end of next quarter and provide the guidance for fiscal 2013, we'll be able to mention the impact that we're working on right now with our actuaries of that.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. Would you be thinking about voluntarily contributing, if it does go down significantly, just to kind of continue to true-up that or delever, I guess, that line item?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I think we'll be choosing between that option and other delevering options. We have quite a bit of flexibility under our new revolver for pulling forward some of the bond purchases and getting some of our on-balance-sheet debt reduced. So we'll be choosing between those options and what we view to be most efficient. But certainly, if cash flow continues to come in strong, as it did this quarter, we will be taking advantage of one of those options or more.
Robert A. Kosowsky - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe for Chip, you mentioned in the last sentence that you're looking for margin preservation actions, so are you thinking about cutting more costs? I know you had a restructuring -- a little restructuring in Europe, but kind of any other kind of contingency plans you guys are thinking about, and how much you've implemented them?
Charles G. McClure: Yes, we clearly continue to do that and I think you did just hit on one of them when you talk about the action we did take place in Europe earlier this year, recognizing the softness we're seeing in Europe. And yes, we will continue to do that. On the materials side, we continue to look at our direct material optimization programs to try and address that. We look at all factors of our cost. It's certainly not our position today to kind of give any specific numbers, but that is something we continue to do. I think a real credit to the team as we did see the softness in the markets and have been able to respond nicely. So I really do credit the organization for being aligned in doing that quickly. So suffice it to say, we'll continue to do that to make sure we respond accordingly to the market dynamics out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Denoyer with Wolfe Trahan.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Chip, in the past, you said that you can have the flexibility to export some parts up from Brazil or vice versa depending on market needs. Are you doing anything -- are you accelerating anything in that respect, exporting from Brazil, given the weakness of the currency at this point?
Charles G. McClure: Well, actually, what we are able to do is -- yes, we have talked about that the last couple of years. As we made the investment on the manufacturing side, we want to make sure the manufacturer was much more flexible. I'll use the Americas as an example. And yes, we have the ability both ways, in a lot of ways when we have the strong market in South America, we were actually taking some of the capacity we had here in North America to provide there, and we continue to do it both ways. So what it's doing is -- if I look at it right now is, specifically, as we're seeing the softness in South America, it's actually truing up capacity in North America for us to support the strength in North America. So it's -- we do have the flexibility to do that. In this specific case you're bringing up, Tim, it actually has freed up some of the capacity we've had here in North America that allows us to do that, to support the actual manufacturer up here. Then on the brake side, clearly, we are taking advantage of that from Brazil. So it was a combination of both, but at the end of the day, the flexible manufacturing footprint we have allows us to do that now.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Okay. And then a follow-up going back to the slide on new content. On disc brakes, specifically in North America, can you give any -- just rough sense of what you would expect take rates to be just -- is it 5%, or 10%? I mean, I think it's pretty clear that it's still a pretty drum-brake heavy market. Is that fair to say?
Charles G. McClure: That is very fair to say. If you look at it. Clearly, in Europe, disc brakes are very strong there. Here in North America, a lot of it is still drum brake. With the latest legislation, FMVSS last year of the stopping distance, our drum brakes were able to perform even with the reduced stopping distance. And part of what you have here, in particular, is the fleet's really -- if they can keep the current products and service and parts inventory, which lean toward drum brakes, they will certainly do that. But I think, overall, as you look at it, at least in the short, medium term, there'll still be a low percentage. But having said that, you are starting to see more of a global perspective on the brake side, which I think will drive over time to more disc brakes. But as you've said, Tim, I think you're right, as it'll still be a lower percentage here in North America.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Okay. And then if I could just sneak one more in for Jay. In terms of -- you talked about South America as the highest-margin region. Is that still true in the current quarter? I mean -- or are we getting towards parity, given the weakness in South America and the pricing [indiscernible].
Jeffrey A. Craig: We certainly have grown much closer to parity with -- for 2 reasons. One, the South America profits do include the profits we've rolled up from our unconsolidated JVs, so we've seen declines there that have really geometrically affected the margins coming out of South America. But on the positive side, the improvements we've made to the profitability of our European and North American truck businesses over the last 6, 9 months have really markedly increased the margins of those businesses to close that gap.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Okay. Is it roughly similar in the current quarter?
Jeffrey A. Craig: In the current quarter, roughly similar. Year-to-date, it's roughly equal.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.
Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Jay, if I can ask, the lower CapEx for 2012, what's driving that? Is that just being more efficient, or are you moving something to 2013?
Jeffrey A. Craig: We've actually moved some projects, particularly some expansion projects we had for both China and Brazil. We've pushed those out to await just the evaluation of how long those market downturns will last. So we are not investing as quickly as we had planned in some of the expansion opportunities we saw in those markets. Those would be the 2 most significant changes we've made in CapEx planning.
Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. And Chip, staying on the topic of 2013, I know you're few months out from your December Analyst Day, but if you can talk about what you're seeing, just going forward, in the next year -- right now, just apart from what's going on in the macro, do you feel pretty good about where you guys are with execution, your targets? And in a normal macro, should you get back up to your margin targets for next year?
Charles G. McClure: The answer is yes, I feel very good about the actions we've taken and the alignment that way and the response we've even done in the more recent softening of the market, so I feel very good about that. And kind of as we talked and you kind of look at the different market dynamics kind of around the world, but from a operating perspective, I feel very comfortable with it. As I kind of indicated, the question is what happens in North America, the balance of the year with the order intake. I do think that as you look at Brazil and China, in particular, it's not a matter of if, but when they come back. Europe, I think, is a longer question that way. And I think India, as I indicated, will continue to make investments in infrastructure and other things to address that. So as I look going into 2013, I feel, from an internal operating point of view -- I feel very good and comfortable with the actions that have been taken to do that. And clearly, the results of this quarter and last quarter have kind of indicated, even with soft markets, we've been able to do that. And essentially, what we're doing is, as you look at that, even as we look at our planning, we're actually developing other plans for not a significant rebound, some of these markets early in '13 anyway. So I think we are positioned well for that.
Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Very good. And finally, Jay, a housekeeping question here on the litigation charge. Any outlook on that? I mean, is that something that's going to continue in the coming quarters, or is that just a...
Jeffrey A. Craig: We had minor true up this quarter. We're working on settlements of that case. And like many of these large cases, they tend to get settled in pieces. So as we reach final settlements with some of the plaintiffs, I think we may see some additional minor true-ups, but I, obviously, we're not expecting anything in the magnitude we saw in the second fiscal quarter when we recorded $5 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can you give any color -- and it seems -- why the broad range of guidance, given that there's only 2 months left in the year? I mean, is it -- I mean, what is driving that high level of uncertainty?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I'm sorry, could you just repeat the first part of the question? I broke up a bit on the guidance.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Why -- it seems like a fairly wide range, given that's there's just 2 months left. I mean, what markets are sort of driving that?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I have to admit, the magnitude of the declines we saw, particularly in China and India, over the last 30, 60 and 90 days, we are not certain if those markets have found their floor. I think we're feeling more confident that the Brazilian market has found its floor. In the last few months we've seen our production and sales numbers flattened out and uptick ever so slightly. But in China and India, the slowdown has been so rapid and so significant, we're just trying to make sure we know where the floor that market is before when we get all the inventory cleaned out. And then we have put in those numbers some risk indication in case North America softens towards the end of our fourth fiscal quarter. As I'm sure all of you are aware, the recent order activity has been weaker than what we believe is required to sustain current production levels. And if those orders continue weak, we think towards the back end of our fourth quarter, we may have some risks in the North American truck revenue.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And can you remind me what percent of your sales are in China and India?
Jeffrey A. Craig: If we go back to the Analyst Day presentation we gave last year, in the China and India, some portion of the Industrial segment is about 50% of the total Industrial segment. And then, if you take our Industrial segment, is roughly about 20% of the total company. I think you're talking about 10% to 15% of sales that come out of China and India for the entire corporation. And I want to go back and check all that math. That's just something that's going on off the top of my head, but it's around that order of magnitude.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And in terms of -- I think, your original second half EBITDA margin guidance was for 9%. What do you need to do to get back to that level? Is that a function of the markets? Or are there actual additional restructuring actions that you could take to get there if those margins don't recover?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I think the main thing we needed was, as we've stated all year long, we needed the recovery in the back half of the emerging markets. We needed China to stay stable, which it did not, and see the spring selling season, and we needed the recovery of the Brazilian market. So basically, it was a volume issue. And you can see from the margin walk, we're getting all the execution required, and that we anticipated, we're just not getting the volume we expected. And as Chip mentioned in his portion of the call, I think as we come into fiscal '13, and looking forward when we provide guidance on that at our Analyst Day, we'll, actually, at this point in time, we're looking -- we'll probably present a scenario of what if volume stays flat for another year or so on all these markets and how will we continue our margin expansion walk that we've moved so significantly recently. So we're looking at the markets and saying, "Okay, maybe we won't get the help from the volume. And what should we be doing about it to make sure we continue on the margin expansion path?" And so we'll be presenting more of those details as we look at these markets over the next few months.
Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just one last question. I mean, how much visibility do you get on orders, particularly in China and India? I mean, do you have a sense of what they're going to be over the next few weeks or...
Jeffrey A. Craig: In China, we get a very good insight, because our main business, the off-highway business, is a joint venture with our primary customers, so we're in continuous contact there. We did see concerning inventory buildup of the last couple of quarters that we've mentioned. So I think we get a very good view on that. In India, somewhat less so. And you didn't ask, but in North America, we have the typical 8-, 10-, 12-week order board that were continuously reviewing with our customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citigroup.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just want to go back to Ravi's question on fiscal '13, and make sure I understood it -- the answer correctly. So kind of based on what you're doing internally on margin initiatives that you've talked about in your preliminary view of the global markets, and then, particularly, hopefully recovering South America, should we be expecting directionally fiscal '13 EBITDA and EPS to be up from fiscal '12? Is that sort of what the message is?
Jeffrey A. Craig: For the full year, on a run rate basis, without further actions, it could be relatively flat. On a full year, because a lot of our margin expansion actions occurred in the second quarter, it has the potential on flat revenue to be higher, obviously, depending somewhat on mix. But it should be higher. What we talked about on the last question is, I think, what we believe is it's prudent for us to look at, what if the, if our global economic -- the markets we participate in look to be staying flat for another 12 -- or in excess of that time period, 12 months or more, what should we be working on to continue to expand margin? And we're looking at those plans now and we'll be talking more about that in our guidance in the Analyst Day.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then it seems like the implied decremental margin from the prior to current revenue outlook is actually a bit lower than what you've had in the past. You've been able to obtain margins somewhat better. Is it fair to sort of assume that maybe you can get that 10% margin goal maybe on slightly lower revenue than what you thought previously? Or is that not accurate?
Jeffrey A. Craig: Well, I think what we've stated before is about $5.2 billion of revenue is required to hit -- annually, to hit that 10%. And that's what I've been to speaking to into the last few moments. I think it's incumbent on us to look at what if that revenue level is not able to be achieved in the near future, what can we do to continue to march above the 8%, 8.5% margin level and get closer to that 10%? I think it's a little premature for us to talk about in specificity, can we do that and how? But we think, as a management team, we are required to look at that. But I -- to go back to your first comment, we're very pleased with the negative conversion number being so low on lower volume. And that's really a function of all the actions the business has executed.
Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then 2 follow-ups. One, could you quantify the higher material costs that hit you in the Aftermarket & Trailer segment? And I think you may have mentioned it earlier, but I may have missed it, what your minimum pension requirements are now for fiscal '13, given the new laws and some of the step ups you talked about in the past?
Jeffrey A. Craig: It really -- the material cost hit us for early in Q1 and then continued in aftermarket and continued into Q2. We haven't really disclosed what the magnitude of that was. We do pricing in the aftermarket group in January and July. And so we think we recapture a significant portion of that right now with the additional pricing we put in place in July. So we think we're starting to claw that back to a significant degree right now. As far as the pension contributions, what we've stated previously was that we saw the higher levels of contributions we had in 2012 continuing on for a couple more years. And in fact, we thought it might be slightly higher in fiscal '13. The effect of the new legislation, along with, if we choose to make some advanced contributions at the end of the year, may change that relationship for fiscal '13 and beyond. So we'll be disclosing that towards the end of the year. And sorry to be somewhat circumspect, but it really depends on how our free cash flow comes in next year and how we choose to use that cash flow to delever.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Even if you would not like to guide to a fiscal or quarter 2013 end market performance, could you at least perhaps talk qualitatively about the commercial and specialty vehicle markets in Brazil, India and China, as we go into next year? What are the puts and takes there beyond easier comps? And when should some of the pressures impacting these markets begin to pass?
Charles G. McClure: Yes, Ryan, this is Chip. Let me go and start with that, and let me start with South America. As I said earlier, if you look at it, there are several dynamics that I think are taking place, it's a -- it's not a matter of if, but when these markets come back. And as you look at it, I'll do it on several levels. The government clearly stepped in, and as I said in my comments, they've done some things in the past, either with tax policy and/or interest policies to try and encourage purchase of vehicles. That has -- that literally got started mid-spring, has not taken effect yet, but I think the government's willingness to do that shows a willingness to try and kind of spur that economy that way. I think the second thing that people talk about, which is really kind of the short-term kind of thing, the World Cup in '14 and the Olympics in '16, I think will have some impact. I think a bigger, long-term impact is the fact that there's been large amounts of oil discovered off the coast, and more recently, shale gas in country that I think will really position the country long-term. So if you look at that in Brazil, whether it's from the -- and, I guess, the third thing is when we just look at the age of the fleets there, there's no question on that. And a lot of our OEM customers are putting additional capacity in there. So when you look at it in Brazil, I think those are the dynamics and really does become a matter of when, not if these markets come back that will drive it that way. I will -- just one last thing on Brazil too is, it is impacted by -- because its -- one of its largest trading partners now is China. So I'll then move to China and say, that obviously, what's occurring in China more recently has had some impact on Brazil. And if I then move to China, and as Jay said, in our case, the large portion of our business in China is in the off-highway. It is in a joint venture with our partner, who is actually our major customer, so we have pretty clear visibility that way. If you go back to 2009, huge investment in infrastructure there, which I think really helped to pilot the country out of the global recession. Until recently, there wasn't as much of that investment. That investment is now starting to be put back in place by the government to try and stimulate that having a GDP that was a little lower than they wanted. I think it was a concern. I think on the flipside, they're trying to balance inflation. So when you look at it, I think a couple of things in China. One is the markets we're in, the off-highway, is driven a lot by infrastructure build; secondly, by just housing starts or building starts to a lesser extent. And then thirdly, in the mining areas I've indicated. So as you look at that, those will come back over time. It's being driven by the government. And what we're seeing more recently is increased investment in that stimulus. I think the other thing, when you look at China is also a new leadership coming in later this year, I think may drive some of the dynamics both before and after that. So again, in that market we do expect to come back. It's just -- it's a matter of when, not if. I'm just trying to figure out when that is. In India, a little bit of a different dynamic. And as we said, this has been more recent. I think even the most recent news, with the infrastructure, vis-à-vis, the grid issues they've had, I think, is highlighting the electrical grid, when I talk about it that way. And then you move to the infrastructure. I think what you will start seeing there in India is the government starting to invest more in infrastructure, both hard infrastructure vis-à-vis road and rail, which in -- for us, in India, it's more on-highway than off-highway. So I think that will help us, but that's probably a little bit of a longer road that way. And then more recently, with what's happening with the electronic -- in the electric grid, the need to strengthen that infrastructure. So I think as you look at -- in all 3 of those regions, I think government will have some influence on it, to a less extent in Brazil than in China and India. And then other dynamics, as I indicated, whether it's needing to upgrade the grid in India, expand the grid in country in China, or, as I indicated, in Brazil with the -- more with gas and oil being the driver long-term. So as you look at that long-term growth, it really just becomes a matter of, as Jay indicated, looking at short-term, what's going to happen from a global perspective.
Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That was really very helpful. Just last question, quick then. I know you cited truck ton miles and then earlier pull ahead of demand. But I'm curious as to any additional thoughts you may have on the weakness on the North American aftermarket. Just -- and it seems a little surprising, given the oft-cited age of fleet issues there. Could you speculate on those pressures? And when do you think they might abate? Or if not when, at least what would it take for those pressures to abate?
Charles G. McClure: Well, first of all, I think, some of it was a timing issue, as I said, with the mild winter, so there's a pull ahead on the maintenance side that way. I think it's just kind of a reflection of the uncertainty in the economy in general. So I think it was more of a timing issue there. You're right, as you look at it, you look at it -- you look at Class 8 markets, the age of the fleet, it's still old. The large fleets are still buying. The large fleets still have access to capital, so all those dynamics are taking place. And really, when I talk about it, I'm talking about '12, '13, '14 as far as the time frame, of which aftermarket will follow very closely with that. So it's more 2 things: One, the timing issue would be mild winter. And then secondly, just probably a little bit of concern or uncertainty with what's happening with the economy, which, to me, as a short term is kind of going to wait and see for a short period of time.

N. Thomas Linebarger: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I will summarize our second quarter results and talk about our key markets. Pat will then take you through more details of our second quarter performance and provide an update on our full year guidance. We delivered strong profitability in the second quarter despite the challenging economic environment and continued investment in new products and growth initiatives. Revenues for the second quarter were $4.45 billion, a decrease of 4% from the second quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of currency movements and divestitures, revenues were flat year-over-year. Second quarter EBIT was $663 million, a decrease of $44 million or 6% compared to the second quarter of 2011, excluding gains related to business divestitures. EBIT percent for the quarter was 14.9%, the second highest in the company's history. Gross margin at 27.2% set a new record for the company, reflecting continued progress in driving productivity and lowering product coverage costs. For the second half of 2012, revenues increased by 5% -- sorry, for the first half of 2012, revenues increased by 5% over last year, and our EBIT percent increased from 14.6% to 14.8%. We delivered incremental EBIT margins of 19.4%, very close to our long-term targets despite the lower-than-anticipated revenue growth. As previously announced, we now expect full year revenues to be flat with 2011, a reduction from our previous guidance of 10% growth in revenues. Continued weakness in some international markets, particularly in Brazil and China, coupled with slowing orders in the U.S. truck, oil and gas and Power Generation, have caused us to lower our outlook. I will talk further about our outlook for a number of these markets, and we have included a supplementary slide in today's earnings release presentation that quantified the change in revenue guidance by business segment and by market. We expect to deliver EBIT margins in the range of 14.25% to 14.75% in 2012, a decrease in our full year guidance of 0.25 point but continuing our trend of increasing profitability year-over-year. In the second quarter, we continued to experience year-over-year growth in North America, offset by weakness in a number of international markets. Although our revenues in North America increased, the rate of growth has slowed recently. Our second quarter revenues grew in North America by 12%, significantly lower than the 40% growth we experienced in the first quarter. In the North American heavy-duty truck market, our Engine shipments increased by 13% compared to the second quarter last year. Order rates have slowed recently, and we are now lowering our full year market size expectation to 260,000 units, growth of 14% when compared 2011, but down from our previous forecast of 278,000 units. We expect to achieve full year market share of 40%, unchanged from our previous guidance. Orders in the North American medium-duty truck market have also softened, and we are lowering our market size estimate to 104,000 units from 117,000 units. We continue to expect our market share to exceed 50% for the full year in this market. Our North American on-highway products continue performed very well in the market. We are very pleased with the reliability of this product as evidenced by our product coverage costs, which declined again this year and by the performance and fuel economy demonstrated by our engines in operation. We have now shipped more than 300,000 engines, equipped with our SCR technology, and the market feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Our market share has grown in both heavy- and medium-duty truck and bus markets in the last 12 months. Also in North America, demand from Chrysler for the Dodge Ram truck remains strong. Our shipments increased 23% in the second quarter, and we still expect full year shipments to increase by 30%. In the North American construction market, we experienced strong demand in the second quarter where engine shipments increased 23% year-over-year. On the other hand, demand in the oil and gas market in North America has continued to decline as natural gas prices have remained low. Unit shipments declined by 32% in the quarter, and we now expect full year demand decline by 41% compared to 2011, a change from our previous guidance of a decline of just under 20%. In mining, our unit shipments declined 6% year-over-year in North America due to lower orders from the coal industry. Globally, strong aftermarket revenues contributed to revenue growth in the mining market year-over-year. In our Power Generation business, we recorded growth of 23% year-over-year in North America. Unfortunately, we saw the rate of new orders decrease starting in April. Although we have seen some signs of improvement in orders in July, we lowered our expectation for full year growth to 15% from our previous guidance of 20%. Approximately 2/3 of our Power Generation growth in North America this year is coming from new products rather than underlying market growth. In international markets, our consolidated revenues declined by 16% year-over-year, with the most significant declines experienced in China and Brazil. In China, our domestic revenues across all end markets, including the revenues of our joint ventures, declined 25% year-over-year in the second quarter. The most significant decline was in the construction market, with our revenues down 55%. The second quarter 2011 was an extremely strong quarter for this market, and this represents the toughest quarterly comparison for the year. Having said that, demand across the industry remains weak and the rate of GDP growth has slowed, causing a reduction in investments, both in infrastructure and private residential construction. We have now lowered our full year expectation for industry-wide excavator sales to down 35% from our previous forecast of down 15%. Our production will run below industry sales as OEMs lower their existing inventory levels. Although the Chinese government has taken steps to stimulate growth, the steps taken so far have been less significant than previous programs and have not been targeted specifically improving short-term demand in the markets that we serve. As a result, we no longer expect any improvement in demand in the second half of the year. The outlook for the truck market in China has also weakened as overall growth in economy has slowed. We now expect the market, heavy- and medium-duty combined, to decline by 17% compared to our previous forecast of a decline of 10%. Second quarter Engine revenues were down 29% year-over-year, with volumes marginally higher than the first quarter. Truck volumes will be lower in the second half of the year than the first, with the third quarter expected to be the weakest quarter of the year. In the Power Generation market, we're also lowering our expectations for 2012 in China. In aggregate, the Chinese economy experienced 0 growth in electricity consumption in the second quarter due to the slowdown in industrial activity. Second quarter revenues, including joint ventures, declined by 17% from a very strong quarter in 2011. We now expect full year revenues to decline 5% compared to our previous expectation that revenues be flat. We expect our domestic revenues in China across all end markets and including joint ventures to decline by 13% compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 5%. Decreased demand for construction and truck engines will be partially offset by stronger aftermarket sales and increased sales of light-duty truck engines. In India, the economy has also slowed. First quarter GDP was 5.3%. It was the lowest recorded in 9 years. Our revenues included -- and revenues, including joint ventures, declined by 4% compared to the second quarter of 2011. In the truck market, industry-wide sales declined sharply in June, with Tata and other OEMs taking shutdowns as they lowered their build rates. Second quarter production volumes at our Tata Cummins joint venture declined by 35% year-over-year. We now expect industry sales in the Indian truck market to decline by 8% compared to our previous assumption of 7% growth. Declining confidence in the economy coupled with the addition of a new excise tax on commercial vehicles is driving our lower outlook. In the Power Generation market, demand continues to be driven by power shortages in India despite the weaker economy growth. Shortages have been experienced in a number of regions in the country, increasing demand for our lower horsepower products. Demand for high horsepower products, typically more linked to general infrastructure and economic growth, weakened in the quarter. In total, we expect revenues in rupees to increase 16% year-over-year, but revenues reported in U.S. million are now expected to decline by 1% due to the devaluation of the rupee. Previously, we had expected our revenues in dollar terms to increase by 10%. In Latin America, our revenues this year continued to be impacted by the difficult transition to the Euro 5 emissions standard in the Brazilian truck market. Unfortunately, the economy in Brazil has also slowed. For the full year, we now expect our total revenues in Latin America to be $1.5 billion, a decline of 17% year-over-year compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 6%. A lower outlook in the Brazilian truck market, coupled with lower demand for Power Generation in the number of markets in the region, including Brazil and Argentina, is driving the lower outlook. We now expect industry sales in the truck market to decline by 33% compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 19%. Truck prices increased approximately 15% with the implementation of Euro 5 at a time when the Brazilian economy faltered. Consequently, demand for new trucks has been very weak. Through the first 5 months of this year, less than 6,000 Euro 5 trucks have been sold to end users industry-wide. Despite truck OEMs lowering build rates, Euro 5 truck inventory across the industry built up to approximately 39,000 units at the end of May due to the weak level of retail sales. We expect it will take some time for sales to recover enough to reduce inventories and justify significant increase in industry build rates. Although we anticipate a difficult start to the year, retail sales of Euro 5 trucks have been much weaker than most participants expected. In Europe, on-highway demand has largely trended as we expected, with full year forecast lowered modestly. Power Generation sales were down 22% year-over-year as demand clearly weakened in the second quarter across most major countries. As I discussed in our first -- during the first quarter recall, our Power Generation business got off to a slow start in Africa and the Middle East. Importantly, our business improved in the second quarter in both regions. In Africa, second quarter revenues increased 72% year-over-year, and revenues in the Middle East increased 24%. Clearly, we are experiencing challenging conditions in a number of markets. We are confident that in time demand in Brazil, China, India will improve, and these markets will continue to offer higher growth opportunities than in developed markets. Higher rates of GDP, rising income levels, increasing investment in infrastructure and societal demands to improve air quality will all improve our business. Despite the weaker economic outlook, we are pleased with our performance in expanding gross margins and continuing to deliver strong profitability. We have taken actions to manage our costs. We remain confident in our long-term prospects as evidenced by the recent announced increase in our dividend. Our future growth will continue to be driven by the 4 key macroeconomic trends driving our industry: increasing the global emissions standards; the price and availability of energy; globalization; and increased investment in infrastructure, particularly in the developing economies. We will continue to invest in our growth programs to ensure that we benefit from these trends. Thank you for your interest today, and now I'll turn it over to Pat.
Patrick J. Ward: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues were $4.45 billion, a decrease of 4% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 12% over the prior year, driven by strong demand from on-highway and construction markets while outside of North America, sales were down 16% as a result of weaker demand in several markets, most notably China, Brazil and Europe. Compared to the first quarter, sales were flat. We experienced low demand in the heavy- and medium-duty truck markets in North America and Brazil and the construction market in China, offset by higher revenues in Power Generation, with the first quarter typically a seasonal low point. Gross margins were a record 27.2% of sales, up from 25.9% last year despite the lower sales revenues. The improvement over the prior year was driven by manufacturing productivity improvements, price realization, lower warranty and material cost, along with a more favorable product mix. Gross margins also improved compared to the first quarter despite flat revenue as a result of productivity improvements, lower warranty cost and product mix. Selling, admin and research and development costs were up $54 million from last year and were $18 million higher than the previous quarter. The growth in spending was driven primarily by the search and development for new products. And we've also been investing in distribution network and IT infrastructure. Joint venture income of $104 million was 11% lower than a year ago and on par with the previous quarter. Year-over-year, more contributions from joint ventures in China and in India were partially offset by an improvement in North American distributors. Sequentially, joint venture contribution was relatively flat. Second quarter EBIT was $663 million or 14.9% of sales compared to the 15.2% we reported last year, excluding gains related to business divestitures. Compared to the first quarter, EBIT margins improved 20 basis points despite the flat sales revenue. And as Tom just mentioned, for the first half of 2012, EBIT margins improved to 14.8%, up from 14.6% for the same period last year and were also a full 1% better compared to the second half of 2011 despite 7% lower revenues. Earnings per share in the second quarter were $2.45 compared to $2.41 in the second quarter of 2011, excluding gains from business divestitures, and the tax rate was 25% in the quarter. Let's now move on to the operating segments and discuss second quarter performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 2% over last year. In North America, we experienced stronger demand across on-highway markets and in construction. That was partially offset by weaker demand in the oil and gas market as a result of lower natural gas prices. Demand in international markets was lower, with on-highway markets in Brazil and construction markets in China showing the more significant declines year-over-year. Foreign currency movements had a negative 2% impact on segment revenues in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down 1%. Demand from heavy- and medium-duty truck markets in North America were lower in the first quarter, but this was partially offset by stronger demand from Chrysler. Outside of North America, tough markets in Brazil and construction markets in China both were sequentially weaker. Despite lower Engine shipments, segment EBIT was $376 million or 13.2% of sales, up from 13% last year as a result of more favorable product mix, better pricing for parts and industrial engines and lower warranty costs. This was partially offset by weaker contribution from joint ventures in China and India, along with increased spend on growth initiatives. Compared to the first quarter, EBIT margins decreased 10 basis points due to higher warranty costs and research and development spending. For the full year, we now expect revenue for the Engine segment to be flat with 2011 levels. This is a decrease from our previous guidance of an increase of 10% due to lower-than-expected demand in the on-highway markets in North America and Brazil, as well as in the China construction and the U.S. oil and gas markets. Demand for engines for Power Generation has also slowed. Segment EBIT projections for the full year remain unchanged at 12% to 13% of sales. In the Components segment, second quarter revenue was $1 billion. Compared to the prior year, revenues were flat with growth in North American on-highway markets offset by lower demand from international on-highway markets, foreign currency movements and the impact of divestitures completed last year. Compared to last quarter, revenues were down 6% as a result of lower demand in on-highway markets in North America, Brazil, China and India. This was partially offset by higher aftermarket demand, primarily for filtration products. Segment EBIT was $116 million or 11.2% of sales, down from 11.6% last year. Despite flat revenue, gross margins did improve. However, this is more than offset by increased research and development costs and currency movements, which had a negative 50-basis-point impact on EBIT. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins declined 1.8% due primarily to lower volumes and increased selling, admin and research and development costs, some of which were acceptable to the highlight acquisition. We're now forecasting revenue growth of 5% this year. This is a decrease from our previous guidance of up 10% due to weaker demand in on-highway markets in North America, Brazil and China and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Segment margins are now expected to be in the range of 11% to 12% of sales, which is below our previous guidance. The reduction is the result of lower volumes and additional spending associated with the acquisition of Hilite. In the Power Generation segment, second quarter sales were $909 million, flat with the prior year and 17% higher sequentially. Growth in North America was offset by lower demand in Europe, China and Latin America and from the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Sequentially, revenues improved from a seasonally weak first quarter, with the Middle East, North America, U.K. and China showing the largest improvements. Demand in Africa also improved significantly after a weak first quarter. Segment EBIT margins were 10.3% in the quarter, down from 11.6% last year. Gross margins remain stable. However, increased spending on growth initiatives and lower joint venture income resulted in a decrease in EBIT margins. EBIT margins did improve 60 basis points from the first quarter as a result of stronger volumes and spending on selling, admin and engineering increasing at a lower rate than revenue growth. For 2012, we now expect segment revenues to be flat with 2011. This is a decrease from our previous guidance of up 5% to 10%. In North America, we now expect growth of 15% compared to our previous expectation of 20% growth. The growth in North America will be offset by lower demand in China, Latin America and Europe. Segment EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% of sales. And for the Distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $794 million, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year and 2% compared to the prior quarter. Currency movements reduced revenues by 5% while strong demand for parts and service in most regions offset weaker demand for engines in the oil and gas market in North America and in some segments in Europe. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, the higher parts and service sales offset weaker demand in the oil and gas market in North America and in the industrial markets in Europe. Segment EBIT margins for the quarter were 11.6%, down from 13.5% a year ago due to the impact of currency and increased spending to build out our Distribution network, particularly in Africa and in China. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins decreased 50 basis points largely due to foreign exchange and increased SAR spending. For 2012, we are now forecasting 10% growth over the prior year, with approximately 6% of this growth coming from acquisitions. This represents a reduction from our previous guidance of an increase of 20% due to declining demand for Power Generation equipment in a number of markets, lower engine demand in the oil and gas market in North America and the adverse impact of currency movements. We expect segment EBIT margins to be in the range of 12% to 13% of sales for the full year. As Tom mentioned, we're now projecting total Cummins revenues to be flat with 2011 levels, with growth in North America being offset by weaker demand in overseas markets. And we estimate that the stronger U.S. dollar will have a $500 million negative impact for the full year. EBIT margins for the company will be in the range of 14.25% to 14.75% of sales compared to the 14.2% margin we reported last year. Our second half revenues are expected to be 4% or $400 million lower than the second half of 2011. The midpoint of the EBIT guidance assumes second half EBIT margins will be 14.2% of sales, up from the 13.8% we reported last year. And as is normal, the fourth quarter will be stronger than the third quarter. Our assumptions in our guidance include the contribution from the joint ventures to be down 5% from last year, and the full year tax rate is now forecasted to be 26%. Finally with regards to cash flow, we now expect to invest between $750 million and $800 million during 2012 on capital projects. While working capital and in particular inventory grew in the second quarter, we expect to reduce this by around $200 million in the second half of the year. The balance sheet remains strong and pension is well funded, which gives us the ability to invest for growth and provide additional return to shareholders through stock buybacks and increased dividends. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares and earlier this month, we announced a 25% increase in our dividend. Although revenue growth has slowed in the near term, we remain committed to expanding our EBIT margins. We are pleased with our gross margin and EBIT performance in the second quarter despite the decline in revenues. And while we will continue to invest in critical growth initiatives, we have already adjusted spending plans in view of the reduced outlook for the remainder of the year. Now let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thanks, Pat. We do have plenty of time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready for our first question. Jasmin?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can you gentlemen say more about the actions you've taken to adjust the cost structure? Are we talking SG&A or production reductions and which businesses are impacted most?
Patrick J. Ward: Well, let me start with that one, Jerry. We've taken actions across the business. But I think it's really important to point out that the critical growth initiatives that we've talked about for some time now, we're not going to cut back on those. So they're really important to the long-term future profitability of the company, and they're kind of sacred. We are cutting back around areas such as travel, and we are looking to reduce the rate of hiring in some areas. We will freeze it in other areas across the company. But it's important we find the right balance of continuing to invest for growth while at the same time managing spending prudently across the company, across all 4 business segments and the corporate areas.
N. Thomas Linebarger: I would just add, Jerry, the leadership team here is pretty experienced with cost-reduction activities. All of us have been through it before. So every one of them in our recent strategy meeting had to come up with a set of reductions that they thought they would implement and still be able to meet the key -- strike a balance that Pat talked about, about investing in the key growth programs and making sure that they can still hit their growth targets and revenue commitments. So that's what we're trying to strike here, and I think every member of the team is committed to doing that.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And as a follow-up, I'm wondering, Pat, if you can bridge for us the margins you're targeting in Power Gen and Engines in the back half of the year versus back half of last year? On flat to down sales, you're looking for margins to be flat to up. Can you just step us through the major moving pieces there?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, let me try and take this one, Jerry. I'll give you a high-level bridge from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. And the first half of the year was considerably better than the second half of last year. We do expect revenues to be flat, maybe slightly better in the second half of the year than the first 6 months that we've just gone through. That being said, there are a number of headwinds coming our way, so the product mix is not as favorable in the second half of the year. We've talked about reduction in oil and gas. We've talked about reduction in Power Gen. So in the high horsepower engines where we do have some margins, we see a lot of negative mix going on there. Warranty costs are expected to grow a little bit in the second half of the year. And joint venture income will certainly be down in China and in India, more so in the third quarter, I expect, than the fourth quarter but it's definitely softened. Now on the other hand, we've seen terrific work so far in the manufacturing plants to improve productivity. We expect that will continue as we go into the second half of the year. The supply chain savings that we've talked about, the 1% margin target for 2015, we're on track there, the 0.2% or maybe even a little bit better now this year based on what we've seen in the first 6 months of the year. And finally, material costs are almost certainly going to be better in the second half of the year than what we've seen in the first half of the year. And that's a combination of metal markets being a little bit better than what we thought they're going to be and just ongoing good working cost-reduction with our supply base.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Crédit Suisse.
Jamie L. Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Two relatively simple questions. One, if you could just expand within North America and Power Gen. Last quarter, you talked about some weakness in orders. You still cited North America is up. I think you said in your prepared remarks that things in July looked a little better. So can you just give a little more color there and comment on the overall competitive environment? And then my second question, just with regards to Pat, as you're thinking about your guidance cut for the year, generally the thing I like about Cummins is you make a cut and it's big so there's not generally risk in the back half. I guess what I'm concerned about is I still look at your North America ACT forecast or your North America truck forecast, which is essentially in line with ACT. So what gives you confidence orders pick up in September? Or could you just speak to where you think the risk is to your guidance in the back half?
Mark Smith: Okay, Jamie. This is Mark. I'll answer the first part of the question on Power Gen and North America. So the first thing to remember is we are expecting 15% revenue growth in North America on Power Gen, but 2/3 of that is coming from new products rather than the underlying market. And that remained like a stable forecast for the full year. We have seen orders bounce around. So for the base business, originally we're expecting 10% growth for the full year, and we've now lowered that to 5%. We did see a pretty sharp drop in incoming orders around the middle of March, April time, and we talked about that on the Q1 call. Orders stayed down for a while and then have picked up a little bit recently, so a kind of 10% growth underpinned with the new products, 5% from underlying market. I think market’s reasonably competitive at this point in time. But I think based on current trends, it's a little hard to exactly forecast, but we feel good about the 5% underlying market growth.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Jamie, I guess the other thing I would just say is the volatility of the market has obviously picked up some. To talk about recent order trends and things that's obviously a little frustrating even for us because we would have liked to have had a better view of what our current guidance is back when we gave our first quarter call, but things fell off quite quickly. And we saw the order rates trending down in April, and we just didn't know how lasting or how big a deal that was. They stayed down through all of Q2 and then recently have picked back up a little bit. So it's volatile, and we just don't exactly know how to read it other than generally speaking, as Mark said, we've got some new business in the market that's helping us, plus we've got a pretty broadened global business that's helping us. So all in, we feel good about the Power Gen forecast, but we are definitely seeing more volatility in order rates in a number of markets and in a number in North America that you highlighted. I've got Rich here though, Jamie. Let me ask him to comment a little bit on the ACT forecast in the North America truck market.
Richard J. Freeland: Jamie, this is Rich. So yes, as you noted, we've taken our forecast down from the 278 production build down to 260. So that implies we're basically building at a 280 the first half of the year, building at a 240 rate the second half of the year. And so a few things we're looking at. One is, as you're aware, net orders have been weaker than that the last few months. I think that will probably continue through July. The things we're looking at that give us some confidence is one is retail sales. That averaged over 24,000 last 4 months. So you think at a 240 rate, that we'd be building at 20,000 a month. So retail sales are coming in higher than that. Conversations we've had with lots of customers, especially, again, more geared towards the larger customers are saying they're sticking with their second half order rates that they're going to continue with. The backlog remains pretty strong. So here we are in July, and there's well over 80,000 in the backlog. And I think lastly, we will see just the normal seasonality and some elements of increased orders in November, December ahead of the emissions change or greenhouse gas change in 2014. So I think it's obviously a moving target. But the net of that, I think the 240 build rate is balanced and right for the second half the year.
Jamie L. Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then I'm sorry, just last question, Pat. Can you just quickly quantify what's the material cost benefit in the back half of the year?
Patrick J. Ward: Well, for the first half of the year, Jamie, we'll be 3/10 or 4/10 of a point benefit. Second half of the year, we expect to be 1%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI Group.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to delve a little bit further into the second half margin guidance. Obviously, the margin guidance is pretty impressive. And the 2 businesses that stick out is the Power Gen business, the margins in the first half the year were 10.1. You're implying they go up to 10.9. In Distribution, it was 11.9 in the first half, and they go up to 13.1. But can you take us through a little bit what you're seeing? I think you mentioned in Power Gen, the mix is a bit adverse. I'm just trying to understand why the margins would go up first half to second half? I mean, you are implying the revenues go up a little bit sequentially. Some of that -- some could be just better overhead absorption, but just trying to better understand that part of the margin guidance.
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, so we'll start with Power Gen. Their gross margins have actually been doing quite well over the last few quarters. And some of that has been masked by mark-to-market adjustments we've had to take on forward contracts with copper. So we don't see copper decreasing further beyond this point. So we don't expect to see any more of those mark-to-market adjustments having kind of negatively impacted their margins in the first and more so in the second quarter of the year. So as volumes pick up in the second half the year in Power Gen, I expect their gross margin to improve and then not to fall to the bottom line. Tony and his team are thinking all over the cost management activities in the Power Gen groups, so I feel pretty good about their ability to expand margins from where they've been in the first half of the year. Distribution, they suffered a little bit in the first half of the year as I was taking in the earlier remarks on higher currency impact than what we had anticipated. They're down almost 2 points from a year ago, and half of that is currency and half of that is just increased SAR spending on key initiatives for them in the future. I think the revenues are going to improve in the second half the year. There's no question to that in my mind. I think the mix we're starting to see in that business is starting to move more towards aftermarket and away from whole goods which, again, will give them a lot more of a bump as we go forward.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: All right. That's helpful. The backlog at the end of the second quarter, do you have any color at all you can provide us on where the backlog is at the end of the quarter year-over-year?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Backlog for what, David?
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I’d don’t know if you have a total company number. I'm just trying to get a feel for you were down 4% revenue for the second quarter back half and implied down 5%. Just trying to get a little feel for kind of where we're launching from on a backlog going into the second half in the growth rate.
N. Thomas Linebarger: We don't have an overall one because it's just so different by markets. I think Rich talked a little bit about where he sees industry backlog for North America, so we’ll have different numbers for different, but some of our businesses operate with no backlog ever. So it's just too wide a variety.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: All right. I'll just wrap up then. The related one is share repo. What should we think the second half the year maybe at a minimum compared to the run rate we've said in the first half of -- in the second quarter was, whatever, 188 million-or-so of repo. How should we think about the next couple of quarters on share repo?
Patrick J. Ward: We're not really going to change any part of our strategy or our planning when it comes to returning value to shareholders. So we said before, we'll look to do that by growing the business profitably. We'll look to do that by increasing the dividend, which we just did, and we'll look to do that by buying back stock. And we go into the year, as you know, with a target to reduce stock by 1%. If the market price is attractive, we may do more than that. We did more of that in the second half of last year. So we have the flexibility. I'm not going to commit a number just now, but we certainly don't see any change in the way we want to look after shareholders when it comes to dividends and stock buybacks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Vertical Research Partners.
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: I just wanted to drill into the Power Gen segment a little bit. I assume that your outlook in the comments you made today were made in advance of any changes relative to the terrible outage they're having in India. Does that have the potential to affect anything this year? And then just in general, in 1Q, did you -- I'm trying to figure about the gap between the Indian segment stationary power and then Power Gen revenues. Did you overbuild a little bit and then -- or underbuild a little bit this quarter and the rest of the year?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Rob, I'll start with the India thing. You're totally right that we did that. All the comments we made were before we considered that. And really, I don't exactly know how it's going play out. It is terrible, actually. There's quite a bit of problems going on even in some of the bigger cities like Delhi, with mass transit basically unusable. So it is a bad situation for them. It's unfortunately reflective of the stability of the power grid broadly across the country. And that helps our business, of course, because that's a lot of reason why people buy standby generators. But definitely there's great need for much more stability than it had. We will definitely see what we can do to help in different parts of the country with trying to stabilize the grid, as well as provide emergency services. That's one of the things we do regularly and do best. So we'll be actively trying to help what the impact is. It's just way too early to tell. But I think it talks about why we have -- why we're optimistic long run about our participation in the Power Generation market in India. There just is a lot of grid improvement and other kinds of things to do there, and that's kind of where our products are targeted.
Patrick J. Ward: I think the second part of the question on inventory, the drop that we see in demand in the latter part of the second quarter kind of took us by surprise. And across the business, we ended up with more inventory than we anticipated. So as I said in the earlier remarks, we intend to work that down through the start of fourth quarter and get inventory back into a more normal target range for us.
N. Thomas Linebarger: I should add to that, that there's not really any area that's got a lot of extra inventory or where we've seen a lot cancelations. As Pat said, it's just across several parts of the business. The deceleration happened faster than we could adjust, and we're now going to adjust that to the next couple of quarters. So there's no area we're particularly concerned about, but there are several areas where we'll have to take production rates down below what sales have been. That's what affected our guidance for the second half.
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: That's very helpful. Can I ask real quick on the oil and gas, which I know is small. But did your outlook assume that new builds -- I know the revenue outlook but I don't know how much is aftermarket. I don't know but it seems new builds go close to 0. Are you still getting orders for new builds in that market and do you assume to continue to get orders in the back half of the year. I'll stop there.
Richard J. Freeland: Yes -- this is Rich. Yes, we're continuing to get orders for new builds. We're down over 50% from where we were in the first quarter, but there is a level of that coming in. And then the parts and service business has remained pretty steady. So while there's been some shutdown, we've remained slight growth on the parts and service side of that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer with Wolfe Trahan.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: A couple of questions on the Components margins. Pat, can you quantify the impact in 2Q of the Hilite acquisition? Was there an impact? And can you also just talk about the revenue and margin profile of that acquisition?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. So in the second quarter, we incurred about $5 million of cost relating to the acquisition, so that's about 50 basis points. In the second half of the year, as we look forward in our guidance, we think that the ongoing cost with that technology business that we purchased is going to cost us about 0.5 point at the Components segment level under margin both in the third and fourth quarter. With regards to the profile of the business, I mean, this is a technology that we went out to purchase them. So it's not really -- it's not one of these big acquisitions you see other companies do. We've always said that where we attractive opportunities to move faster with technology development, that's what we'll be interested in. And that's exactly what this deal is. I think the revenue benefit in the second half of the year is going to be fairly modest. It's probably going to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million. But overall with the cost structure, with the technology investments we're seeing there, it will have a negative impact at a segment level of about 0.5 point.
N. Thomas Linebarger: The technology there helps us across our entire after-treatment business, so we'll see the technology impact our after-treatment business totally. But the big next hurdle for that business is really Euro 6. So Euro 6 is where the volume starts to turn up and the opportunity further shows, it also affects Tier 4 Final. And as I mentioned, it will affect all of our business. But if you want to think, "So when does this thing start to show some positive benefits?" It's not -- even though a technology investment, it's not 100 miles off Euro 6 and Tier 4 Final relatively close in time.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: And is it fair to assume that the liquid-base SCR, the doser, is lower cost than the ARS ones they are using now in North America truck?
N. Thomas Linebarger: What I'll say about that now because new products -- and of course, we want to make the proper announcement at the proper time. Our target is to provide customers with better performance at a lower cost across this technology. That is -- in an after-treatment, the name of the game is being able to give people the ability to integrate effectively in a very complex system with higher liability, lower cost and better performance. That's what we're thinking this technology brings us. Especially across the large engines, the technology is pretty unique. And so we think it will be -- we think it will give us an advantage with customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.
Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Tom, I want to ask you about the mining business. You mentioned that it was a little bit softer in the U.S., but you have a big international business. What's your visibility like in that business and what are your customers telling you? There's a lot of noise out there, as you know, in the system.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, there is a lot of noise. I’ve got Richard. I'll let him comment. But I would just say at a high level, our view about the mining business is that we have pretty -- it's one of those markets where we do get reasonably good visibility. We are able to look out pretty far in terms of order rates and backlogs. We do have -- there's now 1 million customers that we're serving there, so we can kind of see what they're doing. And we can watch commodity prices with relatively -- with relative ease. You can kind of see what the numbers are and see what drives what. Obviously, our view of the market changes when we see commodity price changes dramatically, but we do have reasonable lead time on that. And Rich, I know, has been in conversation with a number of customers, so I'll let him comment further about what he's seeing.
Richard J. Freeland: Yes, so we're still in the guidance of up 7% for the year. Coal obviously is our biggest concern with commodity prices coming down, so that's the one we're paying the most attention to. Copper, iron ore, gold, those remain strong. We have not seen a lot of cancellations, small numbers. We've seen some delays. And so it's one we'll be watching. I think through the balance of the year, it looks pretty solid. And just one, we'll have to pay attention to going into 2013. Order boards are still strong as you know. In our orders and there's a delay, we have a lag effect on our side. So folks are still building out equipment. We're still shipping engines. So I feel pretty confident through the balance of 2012 that we’ll see not a lot of changes.
N. Thomas Linebarger: I do think, Andy, it's one of these things where if copper, iron ore prices fall off a lot again, we would then change our outlook probably for 2013. Again, it's unlikely to have a big effect in the second half of this year. But change in commodity prices down would affect prospects for next year and vice versa. Of course, if they strengthen or get some underpinning for where they are, we think that will help next year. So we're keeping our eyes really closely on this. And everybody knows the things to watch here in terms of commodity prices. But right now, the good mines still are keeping their equipment running and ordering new equipment -- the good mines, I mean, the ones that are a low-cost operation and effective and are still doing it. New mines, we've seen a bunch of announcements about people saying they're going to postpone activity on new mines. I think you've probably read some of those, but existing mines are still going.
Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Tom, that's helpful. So kind of similar but maybe a little different, a place where we have -- it's more difficult to get visibility is China. I know you've talked about China. Your OEMs sometimes tell you one thing and then something else happens. The confidence level that you have from the OEMs now as we go forward, given that China at least is sort of making more noise about infrastructure investment and sort of doing the right thing, how comfortable are you that we won't need to change our Chinese forecast again when we go forward?
N. Thomas Linebarger: I think you've characterized it well that it's difficult to get good numbers. I think the OEMs, in their defense, suffer from the same lack of information that we do, to some degree. The published numbers are not often timely or not often complete. And there's even some game playing by the OEMs in terms of how they put the numbers, how they feed the numbers into the market, research work. So I think there is some uncertainty around the numbers. And I think there's also a debate within the Chinese government about what they want to do with the stimulus program. I've met with members of the government while I was there last, that there's clearly -- the #1 priority is to make sure it's a soft landing, not a hard landing. But there's also priorities within the government about shifting the economy a little bit away from only internal infrastructure and into consumer-based economy, which you've probably read some about that. And there's also a sense that the last stimulus program kind of over stimulated. There ended up being quite a bit of waste in some of the programs, and they ended up with a big bump that they have to recover from when inflation overruns. So I think there's just different parts of the government and different goals they're trying to manage here. So I have high confidence that they will stimulate, and they will continue to work on the economy to ensure it's not a hard landing. In other words, it doesn't get a lot worse than it is now. But I do think it's hard to say how quickly it's going to improve, especially in this infrastructure side. And we were feeling reasonably confident that they would stimulate enough to clear the excavator inventory and to get construction going by the fourth quarter. As you know, from our remarks, we have now -- our view has dimmed on that, and we think it will not do enough to clear the inventory and begin to increase build rates this year at all. We think it will be in the next year before that happens now. When and how, we're just not sure. So I think it's uncertain. I would be very careful about anyone who says they're certain about what's going to happen there because I think it's hard to know. And certainly, any one OEM would not be a reliable estimator.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Curious about sort of the cadence of the quarter. It seems like -- please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems likes things sort of changed fairly rapidly through the quarter. And I'm wondering, you made a couple of comments, Tom. I think that you thought things had sort of stabilized. And I wondered if you could just sort of take us through the key end markets where things really did deteriorate and whether they have stabilized and if you even have any kind of quick look into July?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, Steve, it's a good question. Because again, we left the first quarter call with a couple of troubling signs but not a clear view really of where the rest of the year was going to go. So we were unable to change our guidance in a way that was any more accurate than what we already had. That was unfortunate. Because, as you said, it changed pretty quickly. April was a very good month for us, and then May and June were weaker. And that was the cadence, basically. And what -- I think what made it worse is that our view was that as we saw those numbers weakening, we didn't see instigators that we're going to make them improve quickly and turnaround. Good examples we talked about today, North American truck, while we do see some improvement in the back half of the year, we didn’t see a way we were going to get back to 278,000 units. And we saw the order rates dropping. You saw them, too. But the -- we were all debating in April, was that just a one-off with special causes. And then as we went through the rest of the quarter we said, "No, it looks like it's going to stay." In China, we saw a bunch of new data come out, a bunch of information about how inventory had changed in the first quarter or in this case, had not changed very much about in excavators was disturbing news for a whole bunch of people and made us rethink where we were. Truck markets in China, same kind of thing. India economic results were much worse. Excise taxes got implemented. There was some debate about where they were. And then I mentioned Brazil, where what we saw -- we saw Euro 5 transition struggling. That was evident, but the combination of the worsening economy and how badly retail sales were going was just kind of came to light during the course. So we saw a lot of negative news about how things were progressing. I mean in all of those things, you hear about stuff. But then when OEMs actually take build rates down, which they do over and they don't do -- they do that for a few months, you know now you're going to have to lower your realistic expectations. That's the example that happened in Brazil. So anyway, a lot of those things happened in the quarter. They made us change not only our view of the quarter, but our view of the year. And we just felt like given what we saw in May and June, we wanted to get out and tell you guys that things had changed in just 2 months. With regard to change now, it's not that there's been significant improvements anywhere. It just looks like we've kind of now captured this new environment as best we can. I did mention that there's volatility and hard to know in some places like China, and the Power Gen orders have been bouncing around. But broadly speaking, we feel like we've reflected the environment that we're experiencing now, and so that's why we feel good about the guidance. But I would say it's a much more volatile economy than we were looking at in the first quarter of the year, and it's much harder to predict.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So just to be clear, can I say the last few weeks have sort of stabilized or they remain volatile and you just think this captures it?
N. Thomas Linebarger: I think the second thing is more accurate. They remain volatile, and we think we've captured it. We think we better characterize what we think is going to happen because when we're out in the first quarter call, it's when everything was starting to get a little bit squirrely. We now had 3 months to look at it and say indeed, it is worse.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just a follow up, just to broaden that out a little more. Feels like a lot of companies this quarter have sort of taken the tack that things have certainly slowed here, but we're still in a growth market. '13 and '14 are probably still up years. We don't want to cut a lot of muscle here, so we're willing to build a little inventory. We're willing to keep our R&D spending going, et cetera. Would you to put yourself in that camp? Are we still in a growth market of a kind of a longer-term backdrop or are you kind of more nervous? And what would you have to see to really start to batten down the hatches?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Definitely, we would put ourselves in that category of seeing our long-term growth prospects remain the same but the basic characteristics of our industry, as I mentioned in my remarks, have not changed. Our view still is developing countries will be growing faster than developed countries and investing in infrastructure and our position there remains strong. We will still be investing in new products and technology. The Components business, for example, we've got a lot of promising technologies there that will require investment. We'll still be spending money there. Having said that, we do know how to reduce costs, and we are starting to reduce costs. So we're striking a balance now is the way I'd characterize it. And obviously, we can change that balance pretty rapidly. There's a whole bunch of us here that have a set of programs that we know what to do when we need to do it, and we will be monitoring. In a volatile economy like this, watching closely all the time and making adjustments on the fly is exactly what we need to do. Having said that I feel, like those others do, that the characteristics of our industry are still ones that will give profitable growth over a sustained period as the economies return. The question for us, and I think probably for a lot of people, is when do the economies return? What's the instigator that gets things back? And I think that's where there's a fair bit of uncertainty and frankly, right now, a fair bit of negative yield.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.
Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered. But I'd say somewhat tongue in cheek, we've gone almost an hour and nobody has asked about it, natural gas, which I think is a big change from 1 quarter ago or 2 quarters ago. Maybe if you could just update us in terms of your outlook for NAFTA heavy-duty. Have you seen any change in demand for CNG equipment or CNG-related engines?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, well certainly, the demand on our natural gas engines has increased significantly versus a year ago. The volumes in the second quarter were double. So there's definitely more -- we're definitely seeing more demand. We're seeing a lot of inquiries. So it's an active market for sure, and we expect that to grow. It's still, if you look at the overall mix of business relatively low compared to the total, but it is growing. And we are active in the market. Rich, I don't know if you want to comment at all about anything else?
Richard J. Freeland: No, that's fine.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. So I think that's -- we are seeing active. We are seeing growth, and we are seeing a lot of inquiries about it. And with gas prices where they are, I just don't expect those are going to slow down. I think there's going to be a lot of people that are going to try to get natural gas into their on-highway truck engines among other applications and see if they can get the overall cost to work out when they look at where they can fuel, on how they maintain, all that kind of thing, because prices are really attractive today.
Richard J. Freeland: It remains, as you know, somewhat infrastructure constrained so places where that's not a constraint like refuse market where you can go out, refuel. We've seen high market share in business move there. But I think it's going to be mostly driven by as infrastructure builds out and you can take advantage of these lower prices.
Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Sure, I appreciate that. And then as my final quick follow-up. We know that Navistar is going through a supplier selection process for its SCR components. Is that something you're prepared to talk about? Are you bidding in that business? Have you been invited to bid? Is it something that you'd be interested in or is it an Engine plus after treatment or nothing?
Richard J. Freeland: Ann, this is Rich again. As you said, lots of speculation, rumors out there. A couple of things we do know is the technology now settled out, EGR versus SCR and with their announcement moving to the SCR. Another thing we know is Navistar is -- remains -- is a large customer of Cummins. And 25% market share we still have in our NAFTA business, again, outside of the U.S. So we know where the technology is. We know -- we've been partners or customers for long time and have maintained discussions, relationships even despite the competition we've had the last couple of years in the U.S. How this technology changed impacts their product plans, we don't know. And so it wouldn't be appropriate for me to add to that speculation of how that might turn out. And so I’d really need to direct you back to Navistar on how -- what their product plan will be and who their resources will be to meet that product plan.
Mark Smith: Okay. I think that's the end of the hour. We appreciate your interest and your questions, and I will be available for follow-up. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation, and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

N. Thomas Linebarger: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I will summarize our first quarter results and comment on the outlook for our key markets. Pat will then take you through more details of our first quarter financial performance and provide an update on our full year guidance. We delivered very strong results in the first quarter. Revenues were $4.5 billion, an increase of 16% over the first quarter of 2011. Three of our 4 businesses reported higher revenues than a year ago, with the Components business achieving record revenues. First quarter EBIT was $658 million, an increase of 24% over the same period last year, continuing our trend of growing earnings faster than sales. Both revenues and EBIT represent a new first quarter record. We delivered incremental EBIT margin of 21%, consistent with our plan to meet our long-term targets. EBIT percentage for the first quarter was 14.7% with the Engine and Components businesses delivering record EBIT percentage. The Distribution business delivered significant improvement in EBIT percentage from the fourth quarter levels, due to better mix and lower costs. EBIT percent in our Power Generation business also improved from the fourth quarter, despite a drop in revenues of $140 million. Based on the improvements we saw in the first quarter, we remain confident that EBIT margins for both the Distribution and Power Generation businesses will improve during the remainder of the year. We are maintaining our full year guidance for the company of revenue growth of 10% and EBIT margins of 14.5% to 15% of sales.  In the first quarter, we saw mixed economic conditions across our markets. And although our guidance for the full year remains unchanged, our outlook has changed in some markets. Overall, demand for our products has increased in North America, in heavy, medium and light duty on-highway markets and in the construction market, offsetting weaker-than-expected demand in China. We now expect our domestic revenues in China across all end markets and including joint ventures to decline by 5% in 2012 compared to our previous guidance of no change year-over-year. In India, our forecast for revenue growth of 7%, including joint ventures, remains unchanged from our previous guidance. In Latin America, our revenue guidance is also unchanged with a weaker outlook for trucks in Brazil offset by stronger demand in our other businesses.  Now let me discuss some of these markets in more detail. Revenues in North America were very strong, increasing 40% from a year ago. The Engine and Components businesses delivered strong growth in on-highway markets. We benefited from strong market share for our Engines in the North American heavy-duty truck market in the first quarter, with our share reaching 45% compared to 33% a year ago. We shipped to more than 20,000 15-liter engines to the North American market, setting an all-time record.  Our total Engine shipments to this market, including our 12-liter engine, increased by 118% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Through close cooperation with our OEM partners and strong execution from our manufacturing and supply chain teams, we were able to quickly ramp up our production to meet strong demand for our products. We now expect our market share to reach 40% for the full year, the top end of the range of our previous guidance. And we are maintaining our forecast for the market size for heavy-duty trucks in 2012 at 278,000 units. In the North American medium-duty truck market, we also delivered very strong performance in the first quarter, with our market share increasing to 52% from 50% at the end of 2011. Our engine shipments to this market increased by 62% year-over-year. We are maintaining our full year market size projection of 117,000 units, and we expect our market share for the full year to be at least 50%.  We continue to receive very positive feedback about the performance and reliability of our North American on-highway engines. We have now shipped 256,000 engines equipped with our SCR technology, and our customers are pleased with the fuel economy improvements that we have delivered.  At the recent Mid-America Truck Show on Louisville, we announced that we will meet the 2014 efficiency and greenhouse gas regulations a year early. And we will deliver a further 2% improvement in fuel economy above current levels. Also in North America, demand for our light-duty engines from Chrysler increased by 27% this quarter, and we now expect full year volumes to increase by a full 30%. In North American off-highway market, the Engine business experienced strong growth in mining and construction engines with unit growth of 53% and 52%, respectively, versus the first quarter last year. The Power Generation business delivered 24% revenue growth year-over-year in North America against a relatively weak first quarter last year.  Our international revenues declined by a little under 2% with growth in Australia, Mexico and Eastern Europe offset by softer near-term demand in China and Brazil. In China, our domestic revenues across all end markets, including the revenues of our joint ventures, declined by 16% compared to the first quarter of 2011.  We experienced a decline in our shipments to the construction market, primarily engines for excavators as monetary tightening by the government impacted construction activity. We now expect the market for excavators to decline by 15% for the full year 2012 compared to our previous guidance that the market would be flat year-over-year. We expect to see improvement in demand later this year, with fourth quarter volumes expected to be the highest for the year as excavator manufacturers increase engine orders in order to complete production of excavators ahead of this peak spring selling season next year. The truck market in China started to soften in the third quarter of last year following a number of years of very strong growth. Fortunately, OEM and dealer inventory levels have dropped significantly over the last 4 quarters. As we start to see improvement in the Chinese economy in the second half of this year, we should see production volumes at our Dongfeng Cummins joint venture increase. For the full year, we now expect the truck market heavy- and medium-duty combined to decline by 10% compared to our previous forecast of down 5%. In the Power Generation market in China, our revenues including joint ventures increased 13% compared to the first quarter of 2011. We are maintaining our previous guidance that revenues will remain flat for the full year. As you will recall, we experienced very high demand in the second and third quarters of 2011 due to widespread power shortages in the country. We now expect domestic revenues in China, including joint ventures, to be down by 5% for the full year.  In Brazil, our revenues across all businesses declined 18% year-over-year, driven by lower demand in the truck market. We planned for low first quarter production volumes in the on-highway market with the change in emission standards from Euro 3 to Euro 5, and with the engine transition occurring at MAN as we have previously discussed. Our shipments declined by 48% in the first quarter as OEMs continued to sell Euro 3 compliant trucks that were produced last year. We now expect industry production to decline by 19% for the full year.  We did begin shipments to MAN in Brazil of our new Euro 5 compliant 9-liter and 3.8-liter engines and SCR Systems in the first quarter. I recently visited our operations in Brazil to see our progress in ramping up production, and I'm excited about the prospects for these new products, as well as our aftertreatment systems. I look forward to updating you as sales of our Euro 5 products increase in future quarters.  Our Power Generation business delivered 37% revenue growth in the first quarter in Brazil and we expect strong demand to continue, driven by instability in the grid and ongoing investment in infrastructure. The economy in Brazil softened a little in the second half of 2011, but we are encouraged by the recent interest rate cut by the Brazilian Central Bank. In the rest of Latin America, we continue to see strong demand for trucks and mining equipment. Our total revenues in Latin America, including Brazil, are expected to reach $1.7 billion this year, a decrease of 6%, in line with our previous guidance as increases in Power Generation and Components revenues are projected to partially offset the lower truck demand in Brazil.  In India, our revenues, including our joint ventures, were flat year-over-year. First quarter revenues for our Power Generation business were 4% lower. We have seen an improvement in order intake recently in our Power Generation business following a period of weaker demand in the second half of 2011. Power shortages in the south of the country are driving increased demand for our products. During our previous earnings call, we projected that our Power Generation revenues would increase by 10% for the full year 2012, and we remain confident in that guidance. Our unit shipments are expected to increase by more than 10%, but the depreciation of rupee will result in 10% revenue dollar growth in U.S. dollar terms, based on the current forecast and the exchange rate. Truck engine shipments at our Tata Cummins joint venture were strong in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year, though it is clear that we will have some softening in the Indian truck markets for the next several quarters. In total, including joint ventures, our revenues in India are expected to grow 7% in 2012, unchanged from our previous guidance. Despite softness in some of our key emerging markets, we remain confident that the prospects for growth in Brazil, India and China -- and we continue to invest in the products, distribution footprint and infrastructure that will support that future growth. We do expect our revenues in China, India and Brazil to be higher in the second half of this year than the first. In Europe, our forecast is largely unchanged from prior guidance although we continue to closely monitor our markets there. We project that total revenues in Europe will decline by 5% for the full year. In the first quarter, total company revenues actually increased 7% year-over-year but against a very weak comparison. We have seen some modest downward revisions to OEM forecast for on-highway markets. Construction volumes declined sharply from the fourth quarter of 2011 as expected, due to the pre-buy in 2011 ahead of Tier 4 emissions change.  Our Power Generation business got off to slow start in Africa and the Middle East, with first quarter company revenues down a combined 9%. However, we are confident that our revenues will increase in these markets as the year progresses.  As I've just described, we have experienced a mixed picture across our market in the first quarter. I'm very pleased that the company has been able to adjust to shifting demand patterns across geographies and end markets, and still deliver very strong performance. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we have made in expanding gross margins through efficiency gains, cost reduction work and improved quality. Improvements in gross margins are critical to both fund our investment in future growth and expand our EBIT margins. As an example of our investment in new growth opportunities, we recently announced that we have begun development of a new 15-liter spark-ignited natural gas engine for the North American truck market. We are excited about this program, and we've already received very strong interest from end users and OEMs in this new Cummins 15-liter product.  That concludes my comments, now let me turn it over to Pat.
Patrick J. Ward: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect our very solid start to the year, including record profits in both our Engine and Components segments. First quarter revenues were $4.5 billion, an increase of 16% from a year ago. Our sales in the U.S. were up 43%, driven by strong demand in both on-highway and off-highway markets in the quarter. Sales in the rest of the world were essentially flat compared to a year ago as a result of weaker demand in China, Brazil and India and due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, sales were down 9%. The decrease was driven by seasonality in our Power Generation business in Asia, weaker construction markets in China, the impact of a fourth quarter pre-buy for industrial engines in Europe and lower demand for on-highway engines in Brazil. Gross margins were a record 26.8% of sales, up from 24.8% last year. The improvement over the prior year was driven by stronger volume, improved pricing and lower warranty costs and to a lesser extent, slightly lower material costs. Margins also improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 despite lower volumes, as a result of operational improvements across all 4 segments, improved pricing and lower material costs. Our products have been performing very well in the field, which is evidenced by a reduction in product coverage as a percent of sales over the prior year. This percent, however, has increased from the fourth quarter due to the product mix shifting towards more advanced engines in North America as we discussed on our last call. Selling, admin and research and development costs were up $138 million from last year and were down $19 million from the previous quarter. As we've discussed before, we are focused on executing our growth plans, which have driven additional spending, particularly building out our distribution footprint in Africa, for example, and investing in new products across the company. Research and development spending increased 40% over the prior year as we continued to invest in the development of new products and technologies. Joint venture income of $104 million was 8% higher than a year ago and 3% higher than the prior quarter. Strong performance by our North American distributors and in the Chongqing Cummins joint venture in China drove the year-over-year improvement, which was partially offset by a lower contribution from the Dongfeng Cummins joint venture as a result of the softer truck market in China. Sequentially, the improvement in joint venture income came from our North American distributors. Earnings before interest and tax were $658 million or 14.7% of sales. This compares to 13.8% of sales last year, reflecting a 21% incremental EBIT margin. Compared to the fourth quarter, EBIT margins improved 90 basis points, despite the lower sales revenue. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $2.38 compared to $1.75 from a year ago with a tax rate of 27% in the quarter.  Now let's move on to the operating segments and further discuss first quarter performance and the outlook for the full year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 20% over last year. The increase was driven by strong demand for on-highway heavy and medium-duty truck engines in North America and global mining markets and improved Chrysler shipments. This was offset by weaker demand for on-highway engines in Brazil following the emission change and lower demand for excavator engines in China. Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down 7%. Sequentially, we experienced stronger demand for our on-highway engines in North America, which was offset by softer demand for construction engines in China and weaker demand in Brazil. Segment EBIT was a record $381 million or 13.3% of sales, up from 12.1% last year as a result of stronger volumes, improved operating leverage, better pricing in off-highway markets and lower product coverage costs. This was partially offset by an increase in research and development spending and lower contribution from our joint ventures in China.  Compared to the fourth quarter and despite the lower volumes and higher product coverage costs, EBIT margins improved from 12% to 13.3% as a result of ongoing productivity improvements, lower material costs and improved pricing. For the full year, we continue to forecast that revenue for the Engine segment will be up 10%, driven by improved North American on-highway demand and strong mining markets, offsetting weakness in the China construction, Brazilian truck and North American oil and gas markets. EBIT projections for the full year remain unchanged at 12% to 13% of sales. In the Components segment, first quarter revenue was a record $1.1 billion, up 19% from last year and up slightly from the prior quarter. Revenue growth in U.S. on-highway markets more than offset weakness in Europe and in China.  The Cummins Emission Solutions revenues grew 48% from the prior year, and the Fuel System business grew 28% as a result of strong demand in the North American truck markets. The turbocharger business was flat compared to the prior year due to weaker on-highway markets in China. Sequentially, new demand for aftertreatment following the implementation of Euro 5 in Brazil, more than offset lower demand in Europe and the impact from the fourth quarter sale of the Light Duty Filtration business. Segment EBIT was a record $143 million or 13% of sales, up from 11.4% last year. Stronger volumes and improved operating performance in our plants were the key drivers behind the profitability improvement. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins improved by almost 1% on relatively flat sales with operational improvements being a key contributor. We expect revenue growth of 12% this year as a result of strong demand from the on-highway markets in North America and the additional content required to meet the new Euro 5 emission standards in Brazil. EBIT margins are now expected to be in a range of 12% to 13% of sales. In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales were $780 million, down 2% from the prior year and 15% lower sequentially. Year-over-year, we saw strong growth in North America and Brazil. However, these improvements were more than offset by a lower demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the impact of the weaker Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar. Sequentially, improvements in India and Brazil were more than offset by weaker demand in most other regions, which is typical for the first quarter. EBIT margins were 9.7% in the quarter, down from 11.2% last year. Compared to last year, improved pricing was more than offset by lower demand and additional investments being made in growth initiatives. EBIT margins were slightly higher than those reported in the fourth quarter despite a 15% drop in revenue as a result of operational improvements, improved pricing and lower material costs. For 2012, we expect the Power Gen segment to grow between 5% and 10% as a result of improved demand in India and in Latin America. Though North America demand was strong in the first quarter compared to a year ago, we are seeing a few signs of weakness in recent order intake, which we will continue to monitor. EBIT margins are expected to improve as we go through the year and are projected to be in a range of 10.5% to 11.5% of sales for the full year. And for the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $775 million, up 21% compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by strong demand from mining and Power Generation markets in the Asia-Pacific region and construction equipment demand in North America. Sequentially, revenue decreased 7%, driven by lower demand for industrial engines in Europe as a result of the pre-buy ahead of the Tier 4 emission change last quarter, along with weaker demand in North American oil and gas markets. EBIT margins for the quarter were 12.1%, down from 13.9% a year ago, due to the impact of currency and increased spending to build out our Distribution network, particularly in Africa. Compared to last quarter, we did see the operational improvements we expected, and EBIT margins improved by 170 basis points. For 2012, we continue to forecast 20% growth over the prior year with approximately 7% of this growth coming from acquisitions, and we expect EBIT margins to be in a range of 12.5% to 13.5% of sales. As Tom mentioned, despite some movements in the different markets, we continue to project total Cummins revenues to be up 10% in 2012. EBIT margins for the company will be in a range of 14.5% to 15% of sales compared to the 14.2% we recorded in 2011. And as we discussed in the prior quarter's call, we expect material cost to be flat compared to last year with costs slightly higher in the second half of the year, and we expect pricing to add 50 to 100 basis points of margin for the full year. The only changes in our EBIT forecast compared to 3 months ago are for warranty cost to be 3.4% of sales, which is slightly better than before, but this will be offset by lower joint venture income, which we are now expecting to be up 5% over the prior year. We are currently projecting a tax rate now to be around 27% in 2012 excluding any discrete items. Finally, with regard to cash flow, we invested $126 million in capital expenditure projects with most of this targeted on new products development and investing in capacity ahead of demand. As we discussed in our last call, we expect to invest between $800 million and $850 million for the full year. The balance sheet remains strong and our pension plans are very well funded.  So despite the challenging conditions in some geographies and end markets, we are off to a very good start in 2012. And as you can see from the guidance, we are forecasting another record year while at the same time, making the investments necessary for future profitable growth.  Now let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thanks, Pat. [Operator Instructions] I will, of course, be available right after the call for any follow-ups. Sienna, we are now ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Tom, in the outlook for the Power Gen business, can you say more about which regions are driving the pickup from first quarter levels? And can you comment on how bookings trended over the course of the quarter?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. So as we talked about, in India, we are seeing stronger demand now, which is good. It's a big market for Cummins. China is still doing fine. It won't be as high as it was in the second, third quarter last year, but it's still going to be doing well. As we mentioned, we expect some pick up in the Middle East versus a pretty weak quarter. Brazil and Latin America continue to be doing fine, and we see good business there. The North America point we were making is we had -- North America was coming back, and this is sort of the second time we've seen this where North American orders picked up, and then they dropped off a little bit as the economy kind of flagged a little bit. They picked up again, as we talked about in some of our previous calls. And then we have just seen, in recent weeks, it's really just been weeks, some softening in the order book. We just don't really know what it means. We're not sure how much softening we're going to see in North America. But we've heard that pretty consistently from other folks as well. So we're just keeping our eyes on that one.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And on the point on Africa and Middle East, can you just say more about what's driving the timing of soft 1Q and pick up in coming quarters?
N. Thomas Linebarger: We're not entirely clear, to be honest. Right? What we know in Africa is that we've got a very aggressive plan to establish distribution and build it out to grow share in markets in Africa, and we didn't meet our targets for the quarter. We know that much. All the reasons we meet -- met, that there were some market issues. In Nigeria, in particular, there was quite a bit of problem, political violence and things in Nigeria, which slowed everybody's business down. Some places we also just didn't execute as well as we'd like. So that's part of it. In the Middle East, we just saw a little bit of a dip. We don't see any economic reason why that should continue. So our view is it's going to pick up. So both of those, they're not huge numbers in the grand scheme of things. They just were disappointing relative to what we expected.
Patrick J. Ward: That is if you look into the second quarter, we see some significant step up in the order book across the world, but exactly what Tom spoke about in North America. So second quarter will be much more in line with what I think we were projecting for the full year [indiscernible].
N. Thomas Linebarger: And we do have order book already for a lot of that. So it's not like we're guessing that. We do know that second quarter will be better. The North American piece is the one where we're still -- we're just watching closely to see what happens.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful context. And on the new product side, a number of significant new product announcements this quarter. I'm wondering if you can touch on what kind of sales contribution you expect from these products in aggregate, and can you give us an update on China engine regulations timing? That's it for me.
Patrick J. Ward: Okay, Jerry. So the new products announcement that we've had out, we talked about our -- the QSF industrial engine that's going to be more 2014, 2015. We just announced that at the intramatual [ph]. And then we've also talked about the dual-fuel option for our -- starting with our 50-liter engine for oil and gas applications and high horsepower. So again, those are going to be building over time. They're not going to have a huge impact this year, but just some example of many of the things we're working on new product growth.
N. Thomas Linebarger: And we've really got several waves [ph], as you know, Jerry, in new products, if I can comment on the China regs in that light. So we've got a whole set of products that we're introducing related to Tier 4 product. We've got products related to emissions releases in other countries as in China, for example, the new NS4 regulator are expected to be July 2013. And again we've [indiscernible] others because of agencies who are battling over dates both jointly announced [indiscernible]. So there's a whole bunch of products [indiscernible] and other similar down the road and then as markets moved out, we're introducing product [indiscernible] highway. We talked about new [indiscernible] products, et cetera. So, we do have a lot more out, and I think what we're expecting is over the growth period, the period to reach our growth target, new products will make a substantial [indiscernible] sales. But they're kind of coming out [indiscernible] out a year or 2 ago or the ones that are going to impact 2013 [indiscernible] plus the ones we're announcing now.
Operator: Your next question [indiscernible] Andrew Kaplowitz.
Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Tom, could you talk [indiscernible] heavy truck market. Obviously, some OEMs have talked about a slightly weaker market. You guys, the market looked very strong. Your market share is very high. So maybe you could talk about the visibility into that market that you see and recognizing that you've been sort of butting [ph] up against capacity anyway in that market.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Andy, I'm going to ask Rich to start with that one.
Richard J. Freeland: Andy, this is Rich Freeland. A couple of things. A couple of moving pieces here, but the fundamentals, I think, as we're all aware of haven't changed and we think remained very strong, so bullish. But what we have seen is the retail order aboard softening. So the retail sales -- so it was very high in Q4 and then has weakened here in Q1. And as we talk to people, and it appears it may have been a little overheated in Q4 as folks were concerned about delivery issues and lead time, and we're seeing some balancing. So we didn't overreact to the Q4 and didn't take our market projections up. And likewise, we're not over reacting to being a little lower than what the rate is right now. And so -- and we can look forward. Not out a long ways. As we look certainly into Q2, that tends to be playing out for us pretty well that where we're at with the 2.78. Just one other thing on North America. You may be aware of this, but we also -- we're benefiting some from export sales that we get. So production and NAFTA [ph] that shipped outside. So some of the offsets in the U.S., in fact, in Q2 have been covered by increased sales to Latin America, even into exports into Australia. So that looks -- so we think it's a pretty balanced view that we've got right now. Of course, we're monitoring close, and where we stand is pretty much in line with where our customers are and the feedback we're getting from them.
Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, Rich. That's very helpful. Tom, maybe if I could ask you about margins in the sense that you've got a lot of company initiatives around improving margins this year that you've kind of alluded to. You've talked in the past about supply chain initiative. Obviously, price cost looks pretty good. There's been a lot of focus on the weather in the first quarter. So maybe you could talk about -- the margins were very strong in the quarter. How much of this was maybe outside things versus the company really doing well in keeping costs down?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Pat, why don't you start and I'll finish?
Patrick J. Ward: Thank you. Yes, I'll be delighted to start. I was -- to me, the story of the quarter was the margin performance. And not just the incrementals that we talked about year-over-year, but if you look at what happened fourth quarter, the first quarter, our sales always drop off in Q1. But all 4 businesses just did a terrific job at managing costs, continuing to improve their productivity in the manufacturing plants. And we increased our gross margin and our EBIT margin in the first quarter. So I was thrilled with the performance of all 4 segments. It's still early days I think with regards to seeing real tangible benefits from the supply chain initiative. We are seeing some. I think in the last call we gave guidance of 0.2 improvement for the year, and we're pretty confident that we're going to see that. But most of the improvements that we see in the first quarter is down to what the manufacturing plants are doing in converting demand through their facilities and doing it in a very efficient manner.
N. Thomas Linebarger: I guess I would just like to add, I just like to highlight, even the 2 businesses that didn't see quite as strong of sales results, the Distribution business and Power Gen business, both also managed cost quite well. And the Power Gen business, as you know, we had better margins on lower sales as a comparison point, which is -- that's pretty a good performance. That's what we're looking for. And both of those business leaders and leadership teams are working hard on making sure that they're balancing their cost structure with what they're seeing. And I went through the markets and it's a mixed bag. There's a lot of volatility in our markets today. And what I think the businesses are doing well is they're capturing the opportunities that are there and they're executing and managing costs across the world, while still investing in growth. I just think that's a hard group of balls to keep in the air. And so I don't think it was a one-off. I don't think it had anything to do with the weather or anything else. I think pretty much folks have been doing what they need to do to keep margins growing while still investing for the future.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook, Credit Suisse.
Jamie L. Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question, I guess, Tom, not too surprising you took down your forecast I guess in China and truck on Brazil. Within China specifically, can you talk about what gives you confidence that things should improve in the back of the year, and how we should think about your inventory levels in the channel? And also it -- also your customers' inventory levels, I guess, would be my first question. And then my second question when you think about your markets, your targets for North America, I think this year you said it will go back down -- on truck will go back down to 40%. What are you assuming in the market relative to your competition for your market share to go back down? Do you see a successful engine launch in mid-year or just how we should think about how you're getting to that 40% number.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Let me start first with the excavator stuff. I'll then let Rich fill on some of the others. There's no question that we were negatively surprised by the excavator. That was probably another one where you warned me and I didn't listen. I'm just guessing. But we had -- there was definitely more inventory in the customer channel than we had expected, especially with our domestic customers. We are pretty clear on what our international customers had, our domestic customers. I don't think we got very clean messages from them about what was happening in the market. So we were negatively surprised. The end markets have also not done as well as we're hoping. But I think we understand the customer inventory much better now. And there is still some there, for sure, that definitely dampened demand in the first quarter, and I think will have effect on the second quarter as well. But our confidence is primarily based on economic recovery. So again, I think it sort of depends on your view about what happens in China with regard to economic recovery, but our view is that inflation has curbed in China, that the balance that the government's trying to strike between growth and controlling inflation has shifted, that there is a consensus that it's soft landing. You've got a new government coming in place, and that's basically what's driving our view about some sort of economic turnaround, which we think will have an impact on the construction market and the truck market. And so that's really driving our confidence. And again, with regard to inventory, just looking at the numbers that we see, we don't -- first of all, we're not keeping any, and we're not -- we don't have any inventory issues. But just looking at our customers, our view is that it will get worked down over these next several quarters, which means if indeed economic activity picks up, we will begin to see improved production levels in the fourth quarter. That's basically driving our forecast. Rich, you want to talk about truck?
Richard J. Freeland: Yes. On truck, kind of unlike excavator where we really don't have as good a data on what inventory looks like, we're developing pretty good information on this. I just returned from there 2 weeks ago and looked at all the data especially around inventory, both at our OEs and dealer. And that's been cleaned out of the system now. So it's back where it should be. So the increase we've got in Q4, which is not a significant increase, but the increase we've got built in is tied more, again, to macroeconomic. And there is a growing consensus on this, as I circled around and talked, that we'll see that recovery in Q2. And so I think unlike excavator we've got it a little bit more into the back end of the second half of the year. I'd look on the truck side kind of mid-year that we'll start to see that recovery.
Jamie L. Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then -- sorry, my last question just on your market share assumptions for North America to get to the 40% for the year?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. We had a very strong Q1 and ended up at right around 45%. I think our guidance has been 35% to 40%, and so we're now projecting to the top end of 40%. Our market share is tied really to -- in the short term, to what the production rate is at our customers. So we think going forward, our market share with each of the OEs will remain very close to what it is right now. And what we will see is we'll see some short-term adjustments as our customers either increase or reduce their build rates. And so you've seen with some of the recent announcements on reduced build rates, that will have an impact on our market share in the short term. And that's why we're projecting 40% for the year, Jamie.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan, JPMorgan.
Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Could you talk a little bit about your 15-liter natural gas engine spark ignition? Your competitors have been pretty vocal out there in the marketplace talking about the fact that 15-liter spark ignition simply won't work or would work technically, but you give up a lot of power and fuel efficiency. Could you just talk a little bit about your strategy of using spark ignition versus high-pressure direct injection, et cetera?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. Well, so we have, as you know, quite a bit of experience with spark ignited now in on-highway markets. Pretty much we're the only one with an on-highway presence today in spark-ignited engines or natural gas engines period, and we've been using that technology for some time. Our view, of course, is that the demand for spark-ignited natural gas engines is driven by the lower, much lower price of natural gas in the market today. It's still -- from a fuel point of view, there's not as much infrastructure. There's other adaptations that can be made for the truck to store the fuel that are difficult and still issues to be worked out. But the price of natural gas has come down low enough where there's a whole bunch of customers interested in trying natural gas to drive various kinds of fleets. They're already -- the ones that come back home every night are already using it. But some of the fleets that were doing regional hauls and things like that are interested in trying it. And of course, we have in our Cummins Westport joint venture, already -- we're already launching a 12-liter engine, which has got enormous interest. And the idea of the 15-liter engine is, as people continue to extend out the range with which they want to take natural gas engines, that's a natural extension to the 15 liter. So that's our logic. We have, as I mentioned in my words, people are -- customers are already telling us they're really, really interested in the product. So again, we'll see when we get there. But our view is if natural gas prices stay anywhere near where they are and infrastructure continues to build out, there will be significant interest in that technology. And we think it's the best match between simplicity, affordability, efficiency and performance for the customers. And all those things, of course, matter to our customers.
Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Indeed. And secondly, my follow-up is back to the Power Gen. You talked a bit about orders dropping off slightly in the last few weeks. Can you talk about which regions that happened in or which applications? Is it industrial, is it oil and gas related? Can you just give a little bit more color on what where specifically you're seeing the weakness in orders?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. The weakness is in North America and it tends to be on the large projects orders. So what we've seen is global softening in data centers and healthcare in particular. But outside North America, I don't think we're seeing anything in terms of softness, actually it's strengthening.
Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So you're still seeing strength in oil and gas. Is that correct or have you seen some weakness in that segment also?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Are you talking about Power Gen or are you talking about Engine?
Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Power Gen, yes.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Power Gen, no difference in oil and gas. Again, the comments we've made about oil and gas are primarily related to the frac-ing markets. So we have -- our growth in oil and gas from an Engine point of view has been across several, but the biggest growth in the recent times has been the frac-ing market, which, as you know, has slowed down quite a bit as natural gas prices have gone down. So that's the part that's sort of softening. All -- the rest of the Power Gen -- oil and gas markets including the ones that need Power Generation equipment are not particularly slowing.
Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. But frac-ing, you have seen some slowing? I just want to make sure that I don't misinterpret.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. Right. And the frac-ing, just in terms of how we count things, because again, everyone has to figure that out, we put frac-ing -- the engines that we use for frac-ing rigs are in the oil and gas segment of our Engine business. And that's the part that we mentioned in our remarks looks like it's slowing pretty significantly as a result of natural gas prices falling. Frac-ing units have been moved to other uses, which again they're still running. We're still servicing them and we're still doing a lot of aftermarket business there, but they're not buying new engines for more frac-ing.
Operator: The next question comes on the line of Timothy Denoyer, Wolfe Trahan.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Can I ask a couple of questions on SCR in terms of Brazil this year and China next year? And can you give us any sense of your expectations for market share in those 2 markets?
N. Thomas Linebarger: I -- boy, market share in Brazil. I'm not sure I could give you market share in Brazil, Tim. Let me just comment a few pieces on SCR in Brazil, and then I'll let Mark see if he can get -- scramble to get some numbers for you. But in Brazil, our SCR systems are primarily being offered to a couple of our customers that we've been partnering with, MAN and Ford. We are trying to pursue other customers. But we're -- on a launch basis, we're primarily with them, and that includes the engines that we make but also some engines that they make we're pursuing SCR systems on. And so that's why we're seeing even -- we're seeing growth even as, for example, on MAN, we had -- they switched to one of their own engines but we're still able to sell them aftertreatment systems. So in that sense, our business, it looks like it's going to grow quite rapidly in Brazil. As I mentioned, I was just down there. I visited our aftermarket division. I also visited some customers, and the ramp up has gone very well. The transition -- it was a big deal for Brazil to go to Euro 5 because they skipped one level. So a significant increase in the complexity of their engines and aftertreatment systems. And the ramp up went very, very well, and our customers were really pleased with our performance. So I'm very -- really excited about that. In China, there's still a fair bit of room to cover. Since we're not really launching until the middle of 2013, we know that we'll be on the Cummins engines and the JV engines that we're making. We're still working on markets with other customers. We have some very good -- some very likely customers, but we really aren't in a place to announce anything with them yet, both from a confidentiality point and just a readiness point of view.
Patrick J. Ward: What I would say, Tim, is first quarter was fairly light on Euro 5 engines, but our aftertreatment revenues were approximately $20 million this quarter in Brazil, so that's all new. Previously we'd said $100 million to $130 million of revenue this year will be towards the lower end of that given the change in the market guidance. But that's going well. And we have -- we've got significant known customer wins not just in China, Russia. We're working with some in India for future products, and we've got some new customers in Japan. So clearly, working on all other new things in the aftertreatment business and to the parts and Components. And that's why we're still confident in the strong growth rates and Components going forward.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Right. And Tim, we just don't -- I mean, again, it's just not appropriate to announce new customers just because they haven't announced. When they announce, we can announce.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Sure. Understood. And then just a quick follow-up in terms of the India truck market. You said there was a little bit of slowness there recently, it seems like with interest rate cuts and starting there. What's going on there?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. Tim, so the government's kind of reimposed a 2% excise tax on trucks, so that -- we're seeing some near-term impacts of that. I think India we're clearly not back to full robust growth yet. So I think it's a little movement around the orders. But overall, we haven't changed our full year expectation for the market.
N. Thomas Linebarger: In India, Tim, a couple of things going on. First, unlike in China, what I mentioned, inflation is still high in India. So there's still -- while they've tried to -- they've had one rate decrease, it was a one small decrease against 11 or 12 increases previously. So they're still in this the tough balance between inflation and growth. They've also seen lower tax revenues. So they're doing a whole bunch of things to raise new taxes, all of which has kind of got the economy in -- it's not that it's not growing it's just not growing as robustly as it was previously. And there's still quite a bit of to and fro and to figure out how they're going to get back there. Again, we have confidence that they will, but I think the next couple of quarters are not going to be as strong as their previous kind of high. It'll take them a little bit longer, I think to, get back to where they're seeing robust growth. Our Power Generation business is still doing really well, and part of that is some improvement as you've mentioned in some capital purchases. But largely, what we're seeing is power shortfalls in parts of the country. And that's been the experience with our Power Generation business for many years is that we -- it's some combination of nonresidential construction spending and just power issues that drive the Power Generation business. And in this case, it's largely driven by the fact that they just have power shortages.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten, Longbow Securities.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: I mean, just a clarification. So you've heard several times of lower product coverage and -- in the first quarter and lower material costs. Can you give us a magnitude -- we've got $0.07 break from a lower tax rate that was unexpected and we'll get that for the year. Can we get a little bit of some measure of what that is? I mean, I'm sure it's not that significant, but I just thought it...
Patrick J. Ward: Well, on the product coverage, it's down about 0.6 from the first quarter of last year. So again, I made some comments that went around, but really pleased with the quality of the new products and we're at 15-year lows now with regards to product coverage. So year-over-year, that was a nice boost for us. Material costs were not as significant in the first quarter. Year-over-year, we were somewhere, what, 0.2, 0.3 of a point, Mark?
Mark Smith: Yes.
Patrick J. Ward: Improvements. So that gives you a sense of the 2. The former one, it was much more of a tailwind than material cost year-over-year.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And one other comment, and I just want to apologize in advance, but Emerson reported a lousy quarter today, and they talked about China not getting better for an extended period of time. And in your forecast, you've had a rolling forecast for improvement in China as -- you had New Year, mid-year and now it's probably a little later. Can you give us some idea what the sensitivity would be, and I assume it's probably not more than nickels and dimes. And I just wanted to ask, if we don't get much improvement in China over Europe for the rest of the year, I just sort of get some idea that market is so sensitive. But am I right in assuming that it's sort of maybe nickel or dime or something like that difference between if you do or don't get the improvement for the rest of the year?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Eli, a couple of things. First, in Europe, we don't have any forecast for a significant improvement nor have we ever. So I think that we have not changed anything there. The only thing that happened, it was in actuals. We saw an improvement in Europe and that was just because we had a very low comparison a year ago. In China though, I would agree with your point to some degree, especially in the excavator market, where we underestimated I think the inventory that was in our customers' hands. That has, again, now dampened our views of demand. And to be honest, we should have had a better view of that than we did. But in terms of our view of China, we've sort of felt like a second half -- in terms of economic recovery, second half is when we would see it, and we still believe that. Again, timing and China recovery, to your point is -- we're not -- we can't foresee the future, but that's our view based on everything we look, and we watch it a lot. Rich was just there talking with customers and other leaders. I was -- I'll be there in June, and I was there late last year. So we're doing everything we can do to try to make our best view. And what you've seen is presented as our best view of what we think is going to happen in China. If things don't recover as quickly, we'll deal with it. Again, it's hard to give a forecasted estimate because it depends on how much and at what markets and all that kind of thing. And so I can't give you an estimate, but we'll deal with it and we'll adjust expectations as necessary. But right now, what you have is our best view.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman, Cleveland Research.
Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company: First just a quick clarification. I know it's small, but can you remind us how big the oil and gas business is in the Engine segment?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. So we -- it's about a $300 million business that we talked about growing to $1 billion over the next 4 to 5 years. And so -- and we've said that would be down 19%. So there's a piece of it. U.S. will be down more than that. The parts business remains strong. We're still adding -- we're adding frac-ing rigs still in China, in Argentina. So the net of that is the 19%.
Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company: Okay. Got it. And then, Pat, could you talk about the cash flow for the quarter and your expectations for the remainder of the year? And if you have any kind of working capital targets that you're trying to steer towards?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. So cash flow in the first quarter is always our weakest point of the year. We've seen that last year. You see that again this year. I expect cash to be a positive inflow now for the next 3 quarters. With regards to working capital, again, I'm really pleased with the performance of the businesses here. Although working capital to dollars went up by around $200 million in the first quarter, when you look at it as a percent of sales, Adam, and compare it to the same point last year, we're 2 percentage points better. So working capital probably got a little bit more as we go through the rest of the year and the business continues to grow. But overall, cash flow will be positive. Net cash flow will be positive for the full year. And I think we talked in the last call that our target for 2012 from cash from operations is just over $2 billion again. So very strong year with regards to cash.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann, Jefferies & Company.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Most of these have been answered, I guess, but I'm curious what you're seeing in the mining markets now, where I guess you've been focused in on some growth, but we're hearing some signs of weaker production levels in various parts of the world. Can you just update us there?
Mark Smith: Yes. Steve, this is Mark, I'll start and Rich can chip in. But I mean demands remain strong, both in our customers in the U.S. and across the board. Like everybody else, we're seeing negative headlines on the U.S. coal, but that doesn't represent a significant part of our business. So right now, we continue to experience robust demand across the globe.
Richard J. Freeland: Yes. This is one where we have pretty long lead times and pretty -- so we look at the order board and just back from our biggest customer. And again, we're looking at double digits, kind of the 10%, and that order board's pretty full, and so it's really sold out almost through the end of the year right now on the mining side.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And you haven't seen anybody asking to push out orders or anything?
Richard J. Freeland: We have not. We have not.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Andy Casey, Wells Fargo.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a quick question. As Steve indicated, a lot have been answered already. In the North American exposure, your comments on Power Gen and the weakness that we've been seeing in truck orders, have you seen any sort of similar trends in your other exposure for that region?
N. Thomas Linebarger: No. If anything, our demand from client has actually increased since the last -- our last guidance, Andy. So that's strengthened, generally. Mining's actually gone up a touch. I mean, not significant. So generally no, we have not.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Timothy Thein, Citigroup.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just on the Components margin. As we move through the year, I'm curious as to the interplay within the various segments and how that -- how you expect that will impact the margin given that Emission Solutions drove the bulk of the growth along with fuel systems. How do you see the interplay as we move through the year? Presumably if, given your expectations for recovery in the truck market in China helps to drive turbos, but just curious how that impacts you from a mix perspective.
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. Tim, we don't give specific guidance for profitability within the segment. But what I will say is that we expect it to remain very solid all through the remainder of the year. And so we had fantastic first quarter. That caused us to increase guidance for the full year. We will incur more investment and spending research and development projects as we go through the year. But putting that aside, we are still [indiscernible] and all 4 businesses [indiscernible] are performing exceptionally well [indiscernible].
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then, Rich, on the on-highway market in China, does the -- I recognize this is a longer-term move, but just curious in terms of the capacity ramp up or start up at DCEC. Is that at all impacted [indiscernible] in terms of your term conditions to the truck [indiscernible]?
Richard J. Freeland: We'll follow through with that. We've -- quite frankly, over the last 1.5 years, we've been busting at the seams with what we had and working 7 days a week, almost 24 hours a day. So with the adding of about 50,000 capacity, we'll follow through with that, and that'll get -- be in play later this year, be available later this year.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Our view is that addition of capacity actually has the opportunity to not only improve capacity, but also improve productivity. Because we're just too stretched there. Working 3 shifts and that many days is not the right way to do it. So adding a little capacity so we can operate closer to where we want to even at current demand will be better in terms of productivity and quality.
Mark Smith: Okay. I think time's up. Thank you very much, and I'll be available for your call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Cummins Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jasmine, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, to Mr. Mark Smith, Executive Director, Investor Relations. You may proceed.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jasmine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; and our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because there are a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with the copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. With that out of the way, we'll begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Well, as my first teleconference as Chief Executive, I'm conscious of my now retired boss' parting piece of advice which is, don't screw it up. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll also talk about our outlook for 2012. Pat will then take you through more details of the fourth quarter financial performance and our current forecast for the year. We delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter, finishing off an outstanding year for the company. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $4.9 billion, an increase of 19% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a new quarterly record. Fourth quarter EBIT, excluding onetime items, was $677 million, an increase of 25% over the same quarter last year, continuing our trend of increasing profits faster than sales. Including onetime items, EBIT was $768 million.  All 4 businesses reported higher sales than Q4 2010, and the Engines, Components and Distribution businesses all reported record sales in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter EBIT percent was 13.8% with the Engine and Components businesses delivering significant improvement from a year ago. The Distribution and Power Gen businesses had declines in EBIT percent from a year ago due to currency, commodity costs and a number of onetime items that we do not expect to repeat. As a result, we expect to see margins improve in both businesses in the first half of 2012. For the full year, Cummins sales topped $18 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year, which is terrific performance given the economic uncertainty in a number of regions in 2011. Our revenues have grown a total of the 67% over the last 2 years, and we ended 2011 with revenues 26% above our pre-recession peak. Full year EBIT margin, excluding special items, reached 14.2% in 2011 and was also a new annual record. All 4 businesses delivered double-digit EBIT margins for the year, with the Engine and Components businesses delivering record EBIT percent. In addition to strong revenues and profits, we also had a solid cash flow performance in 2011. Cash from operations totaled $2.1 billion, driven by both our strong earnings results and improvement in our working capital efficiency. Our strong cash flow performance has allowed us to continue to fund our investments in future growth, while increasing returns to shareholders. We increased our dividend by 52% in the third quarter and repurchased 6.4 million shares during 2011. Our strong performance was also recognized by all 3 major credit rating agencies, with all 3 upgrading our rating during the year. Before I turn to our outlook for 2012, I'd like to make a few comments about some of our key markets in 2011. Let me start with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 50% in 2011. The North American heavy-duty truck market reached approximately 230,000 units in 2011, an increase of 77% over 2010 levels. Working very closely with our key OEMs and supply chain partners, we were able to quickly ramp up shipments of our heavy-duty engines while increasing our full year market share to 38%. Fourth quarter shipments of 15-liter engines to the U.S. and Canada were just 14 engines short of our all-time record. Total 15-liter shipments to all markets globally did reach a new record. The U.S. medium-duty truck market size reached approximately 98,000 units in 2011, an increase of almost 40%. We maintained our leadership position in 2011 with market share above 50% for the fourth quarter and the full year, and we ended the year with very encouraging order trends. As we approach the launch of our engines for EPA 2010, we said that it would take 18 to 24 months for the market to assess the different technologies and competitive offerings. We were confident in our technology then, and now, 24 months later, we are delighted with the strong customer acceptance of our products. We believe that our market position demonstrates that we delivered on our promise to provide significant fuel economy benefits, while meeting the toughest performance and emission standards in the world. In addition to delivering industry-leading fuel economy, our engines are proving to be extremely reliable. And our warranty costs, as a percentage of sales in 2011, were the lowest we have experienced in more than 15 years. We take a long-term approach to our technology development to ensure that we deliver the right technology to the market. For example, 10 years ago this month, we announced the formation of our Emission Solutions business to develop after-treatment products, well ahead of market demand for the technology. This business has been a key enabler to the success of our Engine business and now has leading market share in the U.S. and Europe, achieving revenues of more than $1.2 billion in 2011. Today, we have shipped over 209,000 engines equipped with our Selective Catalytic Reduction or SCR systems, and customer feedback continues to be extremely positive.  Our international revenues increased by 27% in 2011. We achieved record full year revenues in Australia, in China, India, Latin America and Russia. We received a lot of questions over the past few months about market conditions in China and India. In China, demand softened in construction markets in the fourth quarter, while sales of truck engines improved modestly from third quarter levels. As a point of reference, during 2011, the truck market in China for heavy- and medium-duty trucks combined declined 9% to just under 1.2 million units, still 3.5x the size of the U.S. market. Our market share in 2011 in China was 11%. The excavator market in China continued to weaken in the fourth quarter, although the full year market size of 174,000 units was 5% higher than 2010 and this still remains the largest single market for construction equipment. Across all construction segments, our market share reached 13% in 2011. The market for Power Generation equipment increased 25% in 2011, driven in part by power shortages in the country. Our revenue increased by 40% over 2010 levels. In the fourth quarter, demand for Power Generation equipment came in a little ahead of our third quarter guidance, offsetting weaker demand for excavators. Full year revenues from our China operations, including joint ventures, reached $3.7 billion in 2011, an increase of 21% year-over-year and in line with the guidance we gave during the third quarter earnings call. In India, the truck market remained strong all year, with the industry sales growing by 12% to 370,000 units. Our market share reached 44% in the fourth quarter. As expected, our sales of Power Generation equipment declined in the fourth quarter in India, although new order intake has already started to improve. Full year revenues from our India operations overall, including joint ventures, were $2.3 billion, also up 21%. Now I would like to provide our overall outlook for 2012 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are currently forecasting total company revenue growth of 10% in 2012, and we expect EBIT to be in the range of 14.5% to 15% of sales. This would represent good progress towards our 2015 goals of reaching $30 billion in sales and 18% EBIT. In North America, we expect strong demand to continue in 2012 in a number of end markets. We expect that the market size for heavy-duty trucks will increase 21% to 278,000 units, and the medium-duty truck market is expected to grow 25% to 117,000 units. Mining and oil and gas markets are expected to remain strong, with OEMs reporting stronger order backlogs. Shipments of our engines for the Dodge Ram pickup are expected to grow by more than 10%. Power Generation revenues are expected to grow by 20% in North America, driven by data center demand, improving nonresidential construction and the launch of some new products. We expect our consolidated revenues in Latin America will decline by approximately 6% next year. The decline in revenues is driven by an expected 5% decline in the Brazilian truck market and the impact of the MAN engine transition that we discussed during our third quarter earnings call. Growth in the Components and Power Generation businesses will partially offset the decline in on-highway engine revenues. In China, we expect domestic revenues to be flat in 2012, with demand for construction equipment and trucks projected to be stronger in the second half of the year than the first. For the full year, we expect the truck market, heavy and medium combined, to be down 5% from 2011 and the excavator market to be about flat year-over-year. Inflation concerns appear to be moderating in China, and there's a growing expectation that the government will start to ease monetary policy, which would be a positive move for our end markets. Demand for Power Generation equipment and mining engines remain strong, and we expect good growth in engines for oil and gas applications in 2012. In India, the market for commercial vehicles remained strong throughout 2011, and we expect the commercial vehicle market size to grow a further 7% in 2012 to 398,000 units. Order trends for Power Generation have improved recently. And after relatively soft first quarter, we now expect 2012 revenues to grow by 10% driven by continued government investment in infrastructure. Inflation concerns in India also appear to be moderating. We do not have a clear picture of full year 2012 demand patterns across our end markets in Europe. Our current expectation is that our full year revenues in Europe may be down 5% year-over-year, with demand for trucks and construction equipment expected to decline. We do expect to some segments in end markets such as mining and Power Generation in Russia to show good growth. In 2011, our European revenues accounted for less than 15% of total company revenues, and we have very limited exposure to Southern Europe. We expect -- we continue to make progress in the execution of our growth strategy in Africa. In 2011, our revenues grew by 49%. For 2012, we expect to generate growth of further 30%, driven by -- primarily by our Power Generation and Distribution businesses in Africa. Cummins delivered good performance in 2011, and we continue to benefit from our leadership position in a number of end markets and geographies. As we have discussed, we have plans in place to generate continued strong growth, and we remain focused on further improving profitability across our businesses. None of this would have been possible without the commitment of our customers and partners, and I would like to personally thank them for their confidence in Cummins. I would also like to thank all of our employees around the world for their dedication and hard work in 2011. I want to give special recognition to the Cummins employees in our manufacturing plants, parts and logistics operations and our supply chain organizations, whose dedication enabled us to meet rapidly growing customer demand in several regions and end markets. Now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our 2011 performance and 2012 guidance in more detail.
Patrick J. Ward: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The results which we are reporting today represent the best year in our company's history in terms of revenue, profitability and operating cash flow. We experienced strong growth across all 4 business segments and in every major region. In fact, the company saw record revenue in the U.S., China, India and Brazil, which represents a significant achievement when we consider the uncertain macroeconomic environment that we faced in 2011. Full year revenues for the company were $18 billion, an increase of 36% over the prior year. Earnings before interest and tax, excluding the gains from the divestiture of 2 businesses and from the flood insurance settlement, increased 54% in the year to over $2.5 billion or 14.3% of sales, up from 12.5% in the previous year. Net income was $1.85 billion or $9.55 per share. Excluding the gains from the divestiture of the 2 businesses and from the flood insurance settlement, net earnings were $1.75 billion or $9.07 a share, up from $1 billion or $5.28 a share in 2010. We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, with revenues of $4.9 billion, 19% higher than the previous year and 6% higher than the third quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by stronger demand from on-highway markets in North America and Brazil, in construction and Power Generation markets in China, as well as in oil and gas and mining markets globally. Compared to the prior quarter, we benefited from growth in the heavy-duty truck market in North America, increased shipments to Chrysler and Power Generation demand in North America and in Latin America, offsetting the lower demand in China and India and the negative impact of currency as the U.S. dollar strengthened. Gross margins for the quarter were 25.2% of sales, up from 23.8% last year due to better operating leverage, lower product coverage cost improved price realization. Sequentially, the margins decreased 0.5 points from the third quarter's record level, primarily the result of a lower mix of aftermarket products, unfavorable currency movement and some one-off costs are not expected to repeat. Selling, admin and research and development costs increased compared to both the prior year and the prior quarter, primarily due to additional spending on research and development and on our strategic growth initiatives. Joint venture income was $101 million, 12% higher than last year and on par with the prior quarter. The improvement over the prior year was driven by the North American Distribution business and increased earnings at Tata Cummins in India. Earnings before interest and tax, excluding the gain on the sale of the Light Duty Filtration business and the flood insurance settlement, increased 25% to $677 million or 13.8% of sales, up from 13.1% last year and on par with the prior quarter. Currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on earnings for the company in total. Net earnings for the quarter were $548 million or $2.86 a share. Excluding the onetime items mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter net earnings were $491 million or $2.56 a share, which included a lower tax rate of 22.8% as a result of certain discrete tax adjustments that we booked in the fourth quarter. Moving on to the operating segments. Let me highlight their performance in the year and in the fourth quarter and conclude with the revenue and profitability expectations for each of them in 2012. Starting in the Engine segment, full year sales were $11.3 billion, up 43% from last year. EBIT increased 71% to $1.4 billion or 12.2% of sales, compared to 10.3% of sales last year. Fourth quarter revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 23% over last year and 4% over the prior quarter. Stronger demand for on-highway engines in North America, as well as for oil and gas and mining engines offset weaker demand in China for construction equipment. Segment EBIT margins were 12% in the quarter compared to 10.3% last year and 11.8% in the third quarter. Compared to the prior year, stronger volume and higher joint venture income more than offset additional investment in research and development. In 2012, we expect 10% revenue growth in this segment as a result of strong demand in North America truck markets and signs of improving demand for engines used in nonresidential construction. In addition, oil and gas and mining markets continue to be strong around the world. While some markets are clearly strengthening, we anticipate construction markets in China to be relatively flat with 2011. And as you heard from Tom, we expect year-over-year revenue in Brazil to decline following the introduction of the Euro 5 emissions and the changes at MAN that we discussed in our third quarter call. 2012 EBIT margins are forecast to be in the range of 12% to 13% of sales, and pre-volume leverage and joint venture contribution will be partially offset by continued investment in new products. In the Components segment, full year revenue was a record $4 billion, up 33% from last year as the truck markets strengthened in North America. EBIT for the year increased by 69% to $470 million with EBIT margins improving to 11.6% of sales, up from 9.1% last year. Fourth quarter sales were $1.1 billion, an increase of 19% over the prior year, driven by stronger demand in the North America on-highway markets. Sequentially, revenues increased 8%, driven by continued strong demand for components in North America and improved demand for turbochargers in China. EBIT margins for the quarter were a record 12.1% of sales compared to 9% in the prior year and 11.1% in the third quarter. The improvement in margins was driven primarily from higher volumes, improved productivity and lower product coverage costs. We expect revenue growth of 12% in 2012 as a result of strength in North America on-highway markets, additional content in Brazil for Euro 5 emissions and strong aftermarket sales. EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% of sales, with the additional volume and continued productivity improvements in our plants being partially offset by increased spending on new product development. In the Power Generation segment, full year sales were $3.5 billion, up 20% over the prior year. EBIT increased by 25% to $373 million, with EBIT margins improving to 10.7% of sales, up from 10.2% of sales last year. Fourth quarter sales were $920 million, an increase of 2% from last year, as improved demand in China and North America was partially offset by weaker demand in India. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 5% driven by the improved demand in North America and Latin America, offset by weaker demand in both China and in India. EBIT margins were 9.5% in the quarter compared to 10.2% last year and 10.5% in the prior quarter. Compared to last year, improved pricing and joint venture income were offset by investments being made for new growth initiatives and the impact of commodity price movements. Sequentially, the benefits of increased volume were offset by higher product coverage costs, more joint venture income due to typical seasonality in the Middle East and the impact of commodity price movements. For 2012, we expect the Power Generation segment to grow 10% as a result of improving demand in North America, Europe, Latin America and India. Demand in China will remain relatively flat with 2011 levels. We expect EBIT margins to improve and to be in the range of 11% to 12% of sales. The benefits of increased volume and better efficiency at our assembly plants will be partially offset by further investment in growth initiatives. And finally, for the Distribution segment, full year revenues were $3 billion, up 31% compared to the prior year. EBIT increased by 30% to $386 million and remained relatively flat at 12.7% of sales for the year. Fourth quarter revenues were $834 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year. This increase was driven by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region, Power Generation demand in North America and from oil and gas and mining markets, as well as from pre-buy activity in Europe ahead of the Tier 4 Interim emissions change. Compared to the prior quarter, sales increased 7%, driven by strong growth across several regions, which more than offset unfavorable currency movements, which had a negative 4% impact on segment revenue. EBIT margins for the quarter were 10.4% compared to 11.7% last year and 13.3% last quarter. Compared to the prior year, margins were impacted by a mix shift away from the aftermarket towards whole goods from unfavorable currency movements, increased spending as we expand our footprint and upgrade certain facilities and lower joint venture income as a percent of sales. Sequentially, the margin decreased due to the same factors, with currency even more of a headwind relative to third quarter levels. For 2012, we are forecasting 20% growth over the prior year with approximately 9% of this growth coming from acquisitions. We expect EBIT margins in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of sales. As Tom mentioned, we're projecting total Cummins revenues to be up 10% in 2012. And similar to last year, we anticipate the second half of the year to be slightly stronger than the first as on-highway markets in Brazil normalize following the Euro 5 implementation and as the China construction and truck markets strengthen in the second half of the year. Gross margins will improve as a result of a stronger volume and from price realization of between 0.5% and 1%. Material costs are currently projected to be flat relative to 2011, and warranty costs are forecast to increase slightly to 2.5% due to the mix of product sales in 2012. The benefits from our forecasted growth will be partially offset by continued investment in new product platforms and other growth initiatives across the company. Joint venture income is expected to grow 10% and remain flat at 2.3% of sales. And as a result, we are projecting an EBIT margin of between 14.5% and 15% of sales, which at the midpoint means 21% incremental EBIT margins year-over-year. We are currently projecting the tax rate to be around 29% in 2012, excluding any onetime discrete items.  Finally, let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. As you've already heard from Tom, we had a very strong year from a cash flow perspective, generating a record $2 billion in cash from operating activities and then using that cash to reinvest back into the company and also to return value to our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our pension plans remain very well-funded and our debt-to-capital position at the end of 2011 was 11.8%. Our strong balance sheet allows us to increase the level of investment we make in the research and development of new products and technologies, on strategic growth initiatives and on capital expenditure programs. We plan to increase our capital expenditure from $622 million in 2011 to between $800 million and $850 million in 2012. The majority of this investment will continue to be targeted towards capacity expansion and new product development such as expanding our natural gas offerings and developing new large displacement engines. In addition to investing for future growth, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and sustainable dividend growth. 2011 was a terrific year for the company, and we look forward to continuing our track record of profitable growth in 2012. Now let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Pat. We're about ready for questions. [Operator Instructions] So with that, we'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Henry Kirn with UBS.
Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: As you look out to 2012, could you give some color on what you expect for seasonality?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, I think –- Henry, the seasonality is not [ph] going to work unlike what we seen in 2011. First quarter tends to be a little bit quieter for demand in our Power Generation business and parts of the Distribution business given the holidays in Asia. So that tends to be the weakest quarter of the year relative to the other 3. And as I said in my comments, I would expect revenues in the second half of the year to be slightly stronger than the first. I think last year, there was like a 47-53 spit. This year, it's going to be very similar to that.
Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And the related follow up, was there any impact to your expectations for first quarter demand as a result of brake supplier issues?
N. Thomas Linebarger: No, no change.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays Capital.
Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Tom, in Power Generation, it seems like your tone actually has gone quite a bit better, I'd say, over the last 3 months, especially in North America. What are you seeing specifically in North America that maybe has changed your tone? And how does it look in '12 in general?
N. Thomas Linebarger: It's mostly just been driven by better order intake. We -- I think we discussed on previous calls, we started to see a little improvement in maybe the second quarter of 2011, and we thought things were going to get better, and then they kind of didn't. We just -- U.S. economy just seemed to go back flat again. And then what we saw towards the end of the year was better order intake in North America. So we're still -- it's still a tenuous recovery, as you well know, in nonresidential construction. But it's just looking better, and our tone’s matching that improved order intake.
Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, that's fair. And -- sorry, and then in North America in general, Tom, your visibility around the oil and gas markets in particular, I mean, natural prices have gone down, but we know you're doing oil shales and all kinds of business like that. So how do we sort of view that market in '12?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, we are -- of course, reading the same stories with interest about natural gas prices going down. And we -- our view is it can't help but have an effect on demand. We will see effect on demand in North America. But what we're seeing as the upside is that international markets are getting going in the oil and gas markets. Examples are China, Argentina’s another where exploration is really getting going. So we're kind of looking across the world and saying, "Hey, we think it looks better." But I do agree that the prices and the stuff you're hearing in North America can't help but temper demand.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.
Michael Shlisky - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's Mike Shlisly filling in for Ann Duignan. Just a quick question on pricing in 2012. I did notice there were some gains in pricing you had in 2011. I was wondering sort of globally if you could just kind of maybe just walk us through [Audio Gap] pricing in the various regions over the next couple of quarters?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, overall, we're looking at pricing of between 0.5% and 1% of sales. That's not too dissimilar to what we've seen back in 2011. Most of the placing actions you're going to see in the parts and service business, in our industrial business with mining, oil and gas, commercial marine, less so on the on-highway businesses be they in North America or anywhere else.
N. Thomas Linebarger: And if I know, that structure there -- so with OEMs, we typically have structure agreements that go over the period of an emission cycle or something like that. So there, we do not see price realization within the cycle, whereas Power Gen aftermarket and things like that, our Distribution sold businesses, they go right to end-user customers. And there, we have more pricing flexibility. So where we see costs increasing, we are able to pass on some price increases assuming the markets accept -- can accept it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Vertical Research Partners.
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Two quick questions. One is just on materials. I think I heard materials impact on Power Gen margins. Engine margins are pretty good. Was there something just timing-wise in materials spend or commodity and is the outlook comparable to that too?
Patrick J. Ward: We took a lot of overhead in the fourth quarter and some copper price movements with regards to our forward contracts. But other than that, there wasn't anything significant with material with regards to the fourth quarter. As we look into 2012, again, back to the remarks I made in the script year-over-year. We're looking at material costs being flat, which probably means in the first half of the year, they will be a little bit better than the first half of 2011. And our expectation is metal markets will appreciate as we go into the second half of the year and the comparisons will not be as good, second half to second half.
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: Great. And if I can just do 2 on the warranty, I know we'll see this when the K comes out, but did you -- where did you end up on warranty expense, warranty experience? And do you have a cushion going into next year if experience was better than you thought? And if you wouldn't mind, oil and gas, are you having positive conversation with people on the QSK95 and on offshore, or is that too soon?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, I don't think I’ve got any cushions going to next year. On warranty, it turned out to be really good. I think the quality of the new products that we launched in 2010 in North America has been terrific. And if you look on warranty expense last year in total for the company, it was 3% of sales. This is 2010, sorry. 2011, that dropped to 2.3% of sales. As we look forward into 2012, we're projecting a slight increase to 2.5% and naturally just due to the mix of products in 2012 relative to 2011 as the growth in products carry a slightly higher warranty rate than the mix we experienced in 2011. But overall, warranty, I'm really, really pleased with the performance of those new products that came out last year. And then sorry the question on oil and gas, again, was what?
Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.: It was just whether you're having any conversations on -- what the reception was for the engine launch if you're having conversation on planning out of sort of offshore rigs that might be built over next several years really?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Well, again, we're still in, as you know, in the middle of that program. We announced the program and the timing and -- but we are having discussions across our segments, including oil and gas, on 95, and the reception was terrific. I mean, I personally attended the events and met with the -- I mean, 70 or 80 customers from around the world, including many from oil and gas and people were really excited about the engine. As we talked about it, it will be the largest high-speed engine. And so for places like oil and gas where getting more power in a single package is a big focus, they're excited about that. So my expectation is that we'll have very good reception, and we're now committed to meeting targets in timing on that Engine.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can you, gentlemen, talk about the major pieces of your CapEx program? Any new capacity expansion or new product plans beyond what you discussed in September, or is the Africa distribution build out meaningful portion there?
Patrick J. Ward: I think it's very similar to what I talked about back in September. We're expanding capacity in North America. We're seeing increased demand for our heavy-duty products and we're ramping up capacity at our Jamestown plant, which manufactures our 15-meter engines. Elsewhere around the world, we're investing facilities in Brazil and Turkey and China and India, all pretty much focused on adding capacity given what we see ahead of us. And I think, Jerry, you're pretty familiar with the investments we're making in the development of the new larger displacement engines as one example of what we're doing from a new product development perspective. So I'd, say, what 70%, maybe 75% of our total capital in 2012 will be focused on new product development and capacity expansion.
N. Thomas Linebarger: And the only thing I'd add, Jerry, to Pat's comments is that there is a fair bit rate in [ph] new products, which again is capacity, but it's targeted. A lot of our investments in emerging markets are targeted at new products where we're launching in those markets, new -- cost reduced or new technology products to meet new emissions targets and so a lot of that investment is going in over the next couple of years in both India and China.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And on that note, we've got national 4-engine standards coming up. And obviously, you're investing capacity ahead of that. I wonder if you could talk about your market share expectations on the after-treatment side? And maybe talk about the light-duty diesel turbo product and how the uptake there is going if it's not too early to talk about those items?
N. Thomas Linebarger: It is early on both those items. As you maybe know, the NS4 deadline was actually announced by the government, which was both good news and bad. On the not as good news, they said they pushed it back to the middle of 2013, which -- and we were sort of -- I guess the industry was sort of anticipating January 2013, although we didn't know. The good news part of it is that the 2 rival government agencies who were the ones kind of battling with each other and was creating all the uncertainty jointly announced the deadline. So from our point of view, that adds certainty and sort of adds -- it makes you feel like it's actually going to happen that way, which is a big deal for us. So we now feel like we have a target to shoot at as do our customers, which we think helps drive the capacity investments, the target dates on new product releases, which is terrific. With regard to how much share we'll have and those kind of things, it's definitely premature. But you can bet that on both the turbocharger and the after-treatment side that we are in active discussion with just about every significant OEM there about how we can be a part of their technical solution.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI Group.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Looking at the guidance, the industrial revenues, the up 5%, I wanted to discuss a little bit, the up 5%, you would think there could be a little upside there, but maybe we need to talk a little bit more about the base case you have for North America with oil and gas and maybe some capacity constraints? But I would think the up 5% looks beatable, while the medium-duty outlook, is there a little downside risk there just looking at Brazil down 9%? And maybe I'm overstating the MAN platform loss and -- but I'm trying to think through Brazil is a big piece of that international part of truck medium bus? So can you first discuss the industrial engine revenues, the up 5%? Is there more capacity constraint than I realize, or do you have more of a decline baked in for North America oil and gas in that piece? I'm not sure why that shouldn’t be up more in '12.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Well, I think there's a couple of factors when you're looking at the global industrial demand, David, and number one, our base assumption is that China is flat year-over-year, which is an important market in this part of our consolidated revenues. The second piece, in Europe, we saw some pre-buy activity on some of the smaller engines around the Tier 4 Interim emissions regs, which we expect will be -- lead to some lower revenues in that segment. So those are down. Mining, we've got strong back order backlog in mining, clearly, globally, U.S. and international markets. Oil and gas remained strong. We've heard some rumblings of some tight capacity on the frac-ing rigs themselves, but the order rigs [ph] remained strong. So I think it's a combination of all those different factors that have us up 5%, which sounds less than your expectation.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the medium, the -- you say up 7% in total. But Brazil truck shipment’s down 9%. Is that an -- I'm sorry, maybe I missed it. Was that an industry comment? I'm just thinking some share loss?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. Brazil truck, our assumption is down 5%. We talked about the MAN transition with our new engines ramping up in the second half of the year.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So you're down 5% for the industry, and you're down 9% for yourself even with some platform loss?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Right, with some different factors in there, yes.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, then I'll just wrap up with the balance sheet. Obviously, we are [Audio Gap] very strong net cash here over $1 billion. The share repo for the quarter was actually a little less than I would have thought. How should we think about the balance sheet usage for '12?
Patrick J. Ward: Well, David, if you think it was similar to what I said before. That somewhere between 65% and 70% will go back into the Company in the form of capital investment programs, joint venture investments, working capital, and then the 30% that's left, we will look to return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and growing the dividend. So the reason why the share repurchases may have looked a little bit low in the fourth quarter was that we're fairly hefty in the third quarter. We bought back 6 million shares in 2011, which is a higher number than what we've done in the past. So when you look at what we did from a share repurchase perspective and what we did with the dividend in 2011 and compare that to total profit after-tax, about 30% [ph] of what we earned after tax we returned to the shareholder in one of those 2 forms. So we felt quite good about that.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And those percentages you were giving, those were of what, of your expected cash flow for the year?
Patrick J. Ward: Of my cash flow.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Well, that's I'm saying. The balance sheet is net cash $1 billion. I'm not even considering any future cash generation.
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, I like having a strong balance sheet, David. My intent is to keep a strong balance sheet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: The model seems pretty strong with formal baton toss, so, Tom, I'm sure you'll adhere to Tim's wisdom. So a couple of questions. If I could return to the last question that David just asked, if you have roughly $5.5 in net cash today and you could add maybe another $5 after CapEx in dividends next year, can you give us an idea as to what metrics you're looking at to manage your cash level? And how strong is strong, I guess, is the question?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. Well, again, we don't have plans to grow our cash balance indefinitely. So we're very conscious of the fact and we talked to our investors all the time. And what they look for us to do is, first and foremost, reinvest back into the company where we think we've got good profitable growth opportunities. They see the track record, and that's the feedback we get any time without talking to investors. Obviously, we look to increase the dividend. We look to buy back stock when it makes sense, and we did a little bit more of that in the third quarter, given where the price dropped to. When I look at our plan over the next 4 or 5 years and what it takes to get to $30 billion in sales and what that means for capacity investments, and we've got that quite well modeled out. Now as we talked through in our September analyst day, there are different scenarios that can come into play here. So I think we've got good plans with regards to cash management. We watch that relative to our peer companies to make sure it doesn't get out of sync. I think the balance sheet is in good shape. Just know that pensions are incredibly well-funded, and our goal is to keep it that way and invest back into the Company where we see these really good opportunities for future profitable growth.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Thanks for that, Pat. And then if I could turn back to, I guess, a little more near term, the 2012 guidance. When you talk about some of the emerging markets strengthening in the back half of the year, can you indicate whether that's due to more comparisons, or if you're including an assumption that the various economies reaccelerate?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. I think that's -- Andy, that's really related to the comments we made about interest rates and moderating of inflation. So our view is China has got a couple of things going that suggests that GDP will begin to improve again. Number one is that, as I mentioned, inflation is starting to moderate and we're just watching a lot of signs that suggest that the government may begin to ease cash flow restrictions. Of course, they'll do what they're going to do, but that's what it looks like. And the second thing is they've got a new government coming in. And again, I think it's going to be -- and a whole bunch of things they want to do like add to the housing stock and things like that, that I think is going to be able to drive demand. China, like every other economy, has its own set of challenges and has to manage them. But I think those signs point to improvement in the economy in the second half. The India story is a little bit more complicated in the sense that they don't have as clear signals about moderating inflation, but there are some signals there. And again, what our folks are telling us and what I'm reading and seeing suggest that, again, we'll start to see improvement in the Indian economy as inflation moderates, interest rates come down. And that allows economic growth. And again, their government is also continuing their infrastructure build-out, especially in roads, which is, of course, pumping investment in the economy. So both those things are telling us that markets -- those markets just look stronger in the second half.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Would the same be true of Brazil?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Well, Brazil, the main issue there is that the truck market had a pre-buy, and so we think they've just got to swallow that for one. And, as you know, it's a pretty big one. They're going from Euro 3 to Euro 5, pretty big change in technology. So there's a little bit of -- that affects us pretty significantly there separate from the economy. So there's the economic trend going on there, but there's also that -- one of our heavy end markets is having that sort of non-economic driver as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer with Wolfe Trahan.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: A quick question on Emission Solutions in the quarter. I'm not sure if I missed this earlier, but it was up about, I think, 22% quarter-to-quarter. Can you talk about what drove that? I'm guessing that it's not really anything in terms of Brazil Euro 5 related yet, is it?
Patrick J. Ward: No, that was North America truck demand that drove that.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Okay. So that's -- even though it grew 20% and North America grew sequentially 10%, it's just you're getting just more content there?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes. It's primarily North America.
Mark Smith: Yes. We can get some timing issues there. But, yes, it's North America.
Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.: Okay. And then just as a follow up to -- can you give a sense of your expectations for next year in terms of North America heavy-duty market share?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, we still expect to stay in that sort of -- we've kind of said we think we'll be 35% to 40%, and that's still –- of course, we ended with that 38% for the year. And that's still the range we're expecting to be in. A lot of it depends on the success of our customers. So the more successful our customers are, the more [indiscernible] of our share. So we're really working really hard to make sure our customers do better. Those are our partners like PACCAR and others, making sure they're winning share in the market using our engines.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.
Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: My question has been answered.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Tom, you let your numbers do the talking. You don't have to worry about anything else. Just a couple of minor fine points. Pat [ph], what was the FX impact on the fourth quarter both in top line and bottom line? And what are your assumption for the impact –- until you guys have some foreign currency assumptions in 2012?
Patrick J. Ward: That's a good question. So let me take you through the fourth quarter, and then I'll talk about 2012. So the fourth quarter relative to a year ago, we had about $40 million, $45 million impact in the top line, so a little bit less than 1%. And that was below $10 million in the bottom, so it was not significant at all. It was more significant on the top line relative to the third quarter. If you remember, the rates in Q3 compared to Q4 were very different. The impact on revenues in the fourth quarter was about $130 million lower because of FX. But again, given the mix of currencies and how we operate around the world, it was less than $10 million in the bottom line. So not significant year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter from an EBIT perspective. From -- let me just backup for a second. There was one exception to that and that was Distribution. So within the 4 segments in total, we're okay. Distribution, though, are very exposed to currency given that it tend to have a cost structure U.S. dollars and revenue in all local currencies. So they took a bigger hit and that was one of the reasons why their margin suffered a little bit in the fourth quarter. In terms of 2012, for guidance, based on the rates we were seeing about 10 days ago, we were looking at a $300 million headwind in currencies on the top line year-over-year. And again, probably less than 0.1 point impact on EBIT. So not material year-over-year from an EBIT perspective, but about, as I say, $300 million on the top line, so 1.5% of sales.
Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And just a follow up, you talked about pre-buys in Europe and pre-buys in Brazil. Did you see any evidence of any pre-buys in the United States from the tax issues?
Mark Smith: No, not significant, Eli.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Industry was pretty busy.
Operator: Your next question is a follow up from Mr. Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just 2 quick ones. First, on the Brazil side, Mark, it sounds like you've picked up some market share relative to, I guess, what you were afraid you'd lose on the MAN platform. Can you just talk about where you're picking up the incremental business from? And just give us some more context there?
Mark Smith: Maybe I mischaracterized things, Jerry. So the market is down 5%. We will be down more than that because of the engine change. There's really been no change in which platforms we're on. Of course, we're getting more content on the Components side with the SCR system going into Euro 5. And in general, we've said in Latin America, our revenues will be down about 6%. Trucks will be down more than 5%, but the content for Components plus continued growth in Power Gen and some other on-highway markets get us back to about down 6%.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Remember, Jerry, the basic structure we -- with MAN is that we're launching a smaller engine with them and larger engine with them. And in the 6, 7 there -- we are 6, 7 which has been kind of the mainstay of our business with them over many years. They are using their own engine to replace that. So that's why we talked about the transition that we're building volume on the small engine and the large engine and -- but we're losing a bunch of volume in the 6, 7. And so that's what's happening over the course of the next 4 quarters or 6 quarters. And our hope again as we -- or our plan is to grow business with them over the years and surpass any peak we ever had. But we've got to transition here where we've got to build demand for those -- on those other engines.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sure. Pat, can you talk about now your expectations for SG&A and engineering spending growth this year relative to sales growth? And also touch on your input cost assumptions? I think last year, you delivered 50 basis points from productivity improvement. Are you dialing that in into your base case guidance as well?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, we are. I mean, we continue to push our manufacturing plants to continue to look for further productivity improvements. So that's a given every year. With regards to selling admin and research and development, as we look forward into 2012 -- I mean, we're going to go at 10% next year on the top line. We're going to grow our SAR at a faster rate than sales next year. And that's deliberate -- that's choices we are making that we think are important for our future growth in 2013, '14 and '15. So I would expect our SAR to increase as a percent of sales by maybe just over 0.5 point of sales. The research and development part in particular, I think for 2011, we ended up at 3.5% of sales, and our forecast for 2012 call that to increase to 3.8% for the full year.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And lastly, for the Distribution business, can you step us through the mechanism through which you're going to get the margin back? Is that -- are you pushing pricing over the next couple of quarters, or just help us understand how you drive that back into balance in '12?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, well to keep that in perspective, distribution had a terrific year overall. I mean, record sales, record profits. And for the first 3 quarters of the year, they were performing north of 13% of sales. In the fourth quarter, they were impacted by the -- there were really 3 items in the fourth quarter. One was the impact on foreign exchange, which as I described earlier on, was far more significant for them than any of the other 3 business segments. So that was probably a 1 point-of-sale impact for them. Secondly, there was a mix shift from aftermarket to whole goods. Through the first 3 quarters, somewhere around 55% of their sales were aftermarket, and that dropped to 50% in the fourth quarter. So between the mix shift, foreign exchange and then some onetime costs that we had in Distribution around some warranty issues, some severance costs that we took in Europe, that was really the drop in Q3 to Q4. And we expect most of that will kick back right away in Q1. So I expect the first quarter to be much better for Distribution than what you've seen in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Crédit Suisse.
Jamie L. Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just 2 quick follow-up questions. Most have been answered. One, just back on the market share in North America, your market share was -- I mean, I know you ended at 38, but the first 2 months of the quarter was exceptional. Can you talk about what drove it? Was it constraints from -- some of the other truck OEs on the engine side that we heard about, or was it issues with other concerns on engines with running out of emissions, credits, et cetera? And then just a quick follow up, Pat, you talked about seasonality, but what about seasonality with regards to the JV income line? Just with everything that's going on in China, et cetera, I just want to make sure there's no surprises in the first half.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. So, Jamie, let me just talk about market share. It is a little difficult from where we sit, sort out all the month-to-month changes because as you know, OEM build schedules, how they're dealing with backlog, a whole bunch of that stuff plays in there. And so we -- that's why we're pretty careful about saying which are real market share gains and which are not. So, again, I feel like the more average numbers are more instructive. So my view is 38 is a good number. The month-to-month ones were aberrations. They have lots to do with production. I don't see a lot of these big -- the things you mentioned, all of those reasons, they all may have had some effect, but they're not all visible to me how they play out. And again, our view was that the challenge for the industry through most of this year was trying to ramp up to meet the demand and do it in a cost effective way. And I think we feel good about how we did that. We think we helped our OEM customers across the board ramp up, and we dealt with our own constraints in supply chain and work through them and, of course, we tried -- did everything we could to help them be flexible to work through their constraints. So we feel pretty good about that. And I'm sure it helped that we were ramping up quickly, but how much, in which month, I just don't -- can't say.
Patrick J. Ward: And on the JV question, Jamie, last year, we were 2.3% of sales. It's not going to move an awful lot off that mark each quarter in 2012. So there'll be fluctuations in different areas, but we've got joint ventures in China, India, a substantial footprint in North America, as you know, so somewhere between 2.3%, plus or minus, 0.1 point is what you would expect through the year.
Operator: Your next question is a follow up from David Raso with ISI Group.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: The question is on the JV income. I thought it's pretty impressive that the Chongqing growth could offset the Dongfeng decline, and really looking at the whole year, it's kind of how it played out, right? Chongqing was always there to kind of offset the Dongfeng declines. When you look at '12 JV income for those 2 businesses, can you give us a little color on that? How are you thinking of those businesses year-over-year maybe in the context at a minimum of the up 10% for total JV growth?
Patrick J. Ward: I think year-over-year, David, Chongqing will continue to grow. CCEC will continue to grow for us. I mean, that's been a remarkable story. It’s one of the JVs that doesn't get any of the spotlight, but their performance over the past few years and their growth, top line and bottom line, has just been terrific. So I would expect them to continue to expand their contribution to the company. With the Dongfeng-Cummins joint venture, year-over-year, I think that's going to be fairly flat. We expect volumes to improve in the second half of the year from where we are in the first half of the year. So, all-in, it's going to be around the same type of number that we've seen in 2011.
N. Thomas Linebarger: I think just to add a little color to the Chongqing, David, so the Chongqing engine plant, its primary customer base is off-highway, construction markets and Power Gen market, and it's a joint venture that we manage. And what we've been able to do there is figure out a way to adapt our technology to local market requirements, I think, pretty effectively. Whether it was, we've kept cost down. We've kept moving technology but at a rate and pace that at least allows us to be competitive from a cost point of view. And I think that's really the primary driver of the success of our business there. So, again, as Pat said, it really has been a terrific joint venture and our view as it will continue to grow and have success.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And lastly, the nat gas strategy. There's obviously some off-highway aspect to it, but particularly on the on-highway from big-bore to the smaller engines. Can you take us through -- obviously, Pat's alluded to some pretty heavy investment around it. So either it be through Westport, independent, just give us a little color on how the company is thinking about the nat gas opportunity, particularly on-highway?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Right. So, first of all, a significant amount of our investment, as you guess, is off-highway in things like Hedgehog and things like that. There's a lot of investment there and technology driving off-highway. In fact, the market is more significant for Cummins off-highway today than on-highway. But, as you know, there's a fair bit of momentum building on-highway. It's historically been primarily a bus market in North America from an on-highway point of view. And now there is growing interest from truck companies to see if given the low prices of natural gas, this can be a way to reduce cost of trucking. And we're excited about that because we're -- we've been in it for 10 years now, and from -- so we've got a bit of a lead over others and we work -- we've been working most of our efforts in that through our Cummins Westport joint venture, and that's still the way we're doing it. And our view is, although it's still a relatively small market, just to give you a sense, it's less than 5% of our North American truck sales today are natural gas. So it's not a big number today, and it's unlikely to have a big effect on 2012 revenues or profits. We consider it an area of growth and opportunity for us and for our customers.
Mark Smith: Okay. I think that's the end of the hour now. I appreciate your questions and I will be available later.
Patrick J. Ward: Thank you very much. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 Cummins Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jasmine, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Mark Smith, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Jasmine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2011. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Solso; our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom Linebarger; and our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and in subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investor and Media. With that out of the way, we'll begin with our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom Linebarger.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Good morning. I will start this morning by sharing some thoughts on our performance in the third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. I will also update you on our long-term profitable growth plan. Pat will then provide greater detail in the quarter and our updated 2011 guidance. We delivered strong results in the third quarter. We continue to generate good revenue growth and gross margins with incremental gross margins of 30% year-over-year. All 4 businesses delivered double-digit operating margins. Sales for the third quarter of $4.6 billion were 36% higher in the same period in 2010. All 4 business segments reported higher sales, led in percent terms by the Engine and Distribution segments, which increased sales by 43% and 37%, respectively. The Components business also delivered very strong growth of 32% year-over-year. We reported EBIT for the quarter of $640 million, or 13.8% of sales, in the third quarter. This represents an EBIT of 43% year-over-year. Importantly, we continue to grow profits faster than sales. I would now like to make some comments about trends in our markets, starting with North America and then moving on to our international markets. Sales in North America increased 49% compared to the third quarter of 2010, with the Engine and Components businesses benefiting from the continued recovery in on-highway markets. North American shipments of heavy-duty truck engines more than tripled, and engines from medium-duty trucks increased by 92% compared to a year ago. We have now shipped more than 163,000 heavy- and medium-duty engines with our SCR technology in North America. Our engines continue to perform extremely well in terms of fuel economy and reliability, delivering benefits for our customers and resulting in lower warranty costs. For the North American heavy-duty truck market, we are still projecting a market size of 228,000 units for 2011. And we are confident, based on customer order trends, that we will achieve full year market share of between 35% and 40%, a little better than we projected last quarter. We also experienced very strong growth in mining and oil & gas markets. The Engine business set a new record for shipments of mining engines this quarter, reporting a 95% increase in units year-over-year in North America. Our engine shipments to oil & gas customers increased by more than 170%. Our Power Generation business experienced revenue growth of 25% in North America, but that was against a weak comparison. As we discussed during our recent Analyst Day in New York, demand for our Power Generation products has leveled off in North America. In the third quarter, we saw only 2% growth in revenues compared to the second quarter. Order rates are stable at this time with strength in data centers and telecoms offsetting weakness in nonresidential construction. Now I'll make some comments about our international markets. Total company revenues outside of North America grew 28% compared to the third quarter of 2010. During our second quarter earnings call, I provided full year revenue projections for our business in India, China and Brazil, and I would like to provide a further update today for these key markets. As you are aware, governments in India and China have been trying to manage inflation and have taken a number of measures, including increasing interest rates and tightening credits, to try to get inflation under control. The Reserve Bank of India recently implemented its 12th interest rate rise in the last 18 months, for example. Tightening monetary policy has had an impact on growth in both India and China. And as a result, we have seen some changes in our end markets since the second quarter earnings call. At our recent Analyst Day, I commented that we have started to see a slowing rate of growth in India, particularly in our Power Generation business. Typically, our aggregate revenues for all businesses in India are seasonally the highest in the second quarter, and that will be the case this year. In Power Generation, however, order rates have clearly slowed beyond seasonal patterns as concerns about a slowing growth rate have resulted in lower activity in commercial construction. We have also had to adjust our revenue outlook due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee. From June to September, the dollar appreciated by more than 9% against the rupee, lowering our reported revenues from India. As a result of lower demand on our Power Generation business and the dollar appreciation against the rupee, we are now projecting total revenues from our India operations, including joint ventures, to be $2.3 billion, down $100 million from our second quarter guidance. In China, we now expect our total revenues, including joint ventures, to reach $3.7 billion, an increase of 19% over 2010 but down $100 million from our previous guidance, primarily due to lower demand in construction markets. In construction markets, our OEM customers have lowered their forecast for the remainder of the year due to uncertainty about the near-term pace of growth, and in light of the recent credit tightening and government actions to cool the housing market. In our second quarter earnings call, we projected its full year unit sales for the excavator market would be 20% higher than 2010. We now expect the full year to be 10% higher than last year. We are confident that the market will turn to growth next year as the Chinese Government moves forward with its plans to dramatically increase the number of affordable housing units across the country.  As we had predicted during our second quarter earnings call, we saw a reduction in demand for truck engines at our Dongfeng Cummins joint venture in the third quarter as the Chinese truck market looks to an inventory correction. Current customer forecasts indicate an improvement in truck engine sales in the fourth quarter but slightly lower than we anticipated 3 months ago. Power Generation revenues in China remained strong the third quarter, growing more than 40% over last year. As we discussed last quarter, demand has grown due in large part to power shortages. We do expect demand to ease in the fourth quarter, though a little less than we had projected in our second quarter call.  Despite the revised outlook for India and China, we have enjoyed extremely strong rates of growth in both countries this year, and we remain very confident in the long-term growth prospects for our businesses in both countries. We continue to have a very strong year in Brazil and other parts of Latin America. Our 2011 revenue projection of $1.8 billion, an increase of 38% year-over-year, is unchanged from our second quarter guidance. In Brazil, starting next year, our business with MAN will undergo a long expected transition, with MAN reducing its own V8 engine for its Volkswagen-branded trucks business, replacing our ISB engine for the Brazil market. MAN will still use our IFP engine for lagging emission markets, for example Argentina. At the same time, part of the MAN range of trucks and buses will, for the first time, be powered by our ISF 3.8-liter engine and our ISL 9-liter engine. All Cummins-powered trucks will use our SCR aftertreatment.  Our average annual revenues for the MAN business over the last 2 years have been approximately $380 million. Although revenues will drop by approximately $170 million next year, based on current projections we expect to return to the current revenue run rates in 2013. We continue to have excellent relationship with MAN, and only last week, Cummins was recognized by MAN as its best aftermarket supplier for the third straight year.  Naturally, we spend a lot of time discussing our business in Brazil, China and India, as these countries are a significant source of revenue today and we have high expectations for future growth, as we discussed in our Analyst Day. We have also been investing in our capabilities in other emerging markets, which we believe offer long-term growth opportunities.  We are gaining traction in several other high-growth regions. We are expanding our footprint and product offerings in Africa, Russia and the CIS, Indonesia and Turkey, for example, and we are experiencing good revenue growth in each of these regions.  In Russia and the CIS, our third quarter revenue grew 54% year-over-year, and our total sales, including joint ventures, will approach $600 million for 2011, driven in part by sales of our ISF engine to GAZ, a leading light-duty truck OEM in Russia.  While we expect strong, profitable growth in both developed and developing regions of the world over the next 5 years, we will no doubt experience periods of volatility in some of our markets. We are well prepared to deal effectively with this volatility. In 2008 and 2009, we clearly demonstrated our ability to take actions to reduce spending without compromising our growth plans. We will continue to monitor our end markets closely, and we'll respond quickly and decisively when necessary. We remain committed to our long-term targets of achieving $30 billion in revenue and the EBIT of 18% in 2015. Our products are performing very well. We are investing to maintain our technology leadership, we have unmatched global distribution network and we have strong global partners.  Moreover, we are investing to strengthen our global leadership position. Last week, we announced the formation of a joint venture with LiuGong, a Chinese construction equipment maker in China, to produce engines for the Chinese off-highway markets. This new venture is consistent with our strategy of establishing and growing partnerships with industry leaders in key growth markets. The joint venture will begin production in 2013, and we expect this business to generate significant future growth.  To summarize, we had a very strong quarter with revenues up 36% year-over-year and good incremental margins. We continue to invest in our business to extend our market leadership position and drive future growth. 2011 will be a record year for the company in terms of revenues, earnings and cash flow, and we remain highly confident in our profitable growth plans through 2015.  Now I'll turn it over to Pat who'll go through the financials in more detail and discuss our full year guidance
Patrick J. Ward: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $4.6 billion, an increase of 36% from a year ago and slightly below the record levels reported in the second quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2010, the growth was driven by stronger demand for our products in the global mining, construction and oil & gas markets, as well as in the on-highway markets in North America and in Brazil. Sequentially, we continue to see strong demand from on-highway markets in North America and Brazil. However, these increases were offset by lower construction demand in China and lower power generation demand in India and in Latin America.  Gross margin for the quarter was 25.7% of sales. This level of gross margin represents strong improvement over the prior year due to better operating leverage from stronger volumes, improved price realization and lower warranty expense, which dropped to 2.1% of sales in the quarter. Also, keep in mind that the gross margin in the third quarter of 2010 benefited by approximately 1% from a revenue-based tax credit in Brazil. Excluding last year's onetime benefit, incremental gross margins were just over 30%.  Compared to the second quarter, gross margins as a percent of sales were largely unchanged, with benefits from the lower warranty expense being offset by higher commodity costs and increased operational costs, including premium freight as we overcame some supply chain issues and ensured all our customer [indiscernible] requirements were met. Selling, admin and research and development costs were up 37% from the prior year and 5% sequentially. Research and development costs were almost 60% higher than a year ago as we develop new products and continue to build on our technology leadership to ensure long-term, profitable growth. Projects are underway to expand the product line, including both higher- and lower-displacement engines, new natural gas offerings and new components, all of which will improve our competitiveness and open new markets for future growth.  Selling and admin expenses have also increased as we invest in our infrastructure and international distribution network to support future growth, as well as through the annual merit increases to our employees that went into effect in July. Joint venture income of $102 million represents an increase of 16% over the prior year, driven by strong mining and oil & gas markets in North America and industrial and power generation demand in China.  Compared to the second quarter, joint venture income decreased by 13%, as expected, driven by the lower demand for truck engines in China.  Earnings before interest and tax were $640 million, an increase of 43% from the prior year and 9% lower than the record second quarter performance. Incremental EBIT margins, excluding the onetime benefit from the revenue-based tax credit in Brazil in the third quarter of last year, were just over 18%. EBIT as a percent of sales reached 13.8% in the quarter compared to 13.2% a year ago and 15.2% in the prior quarter.  Net earnings were $452 million, up 60% from the third quarter of 2010, and earnings per share in the third quarter were $2.35, which includes a $0.15 favorable impact from discrete income tax items. This compares to $1.44 from a year ago.  Now let me provide some additional details on each of our operating segments. In the Engine segment, third quarter sales were $3 billion, up 43% in the prior year and up 2% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, this increase was driven by stronger demand in the on-highway markets in North America and Latin America and in worldwide mining, oil & gas and construction markets. Sequentially, both medium- and heavy-duty truck demand remained strong in North America, up 10% and 14%, respectively. We have also seen increased demand in global mining markets and in construction markets in North America and Europe, ahead of the Tier 4 off-highway emission change. However, these improvements were partially offset by lower industrial demand in China and in India. Joint venture income decreased by 5% compared to the prior year and by 29% sequentially. The driver for both the year-over-year and sequential reduction is lower on-highway demand for truck engines in China, as we discussed on the second quarter teleconference.  Segment EBIT was $349 million or 11.8% of sales. This represents a 57% increase over the prior year and is down 7% from the record set in the second quarter. Year-over-year, the benefits from better operating leverage and lower warranty expense were partially offset by an increase in commodity costs, and higher SAR spending to support future growth initiatives, particularly in research and development. Compared to the prior quarter, the benefits from reduced warranty were offset by higher commodity costs, increased SAR spending and a lower contribution from joint ventures in emerging markets, mainly China.  For the full year, compared to our previous guidance, we now expect a lower outlook for construction demand in China and lower stationary power demand in India. We now expect that the Engines segment revenues will be up 40% over the prior year, and EBIT as a percent of revenue will be between 11.5% and 12.5% compared to last year's EBIT of 10.3%.  Moving on to the Power Gen segment. Third quarter revenues were $874 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year but a reduction of 4% sequentially. Year-over-year improvement was driven by stronger demand in China, North America and Europe. Sequentially, however, we saw flat to lower demand in most regions. Modest increases in North America and the Middle East were offset by lower demand in India, Latin America and most of Europe. Segment EBIT was $93 million or 10.5% of sales. This represents a reduction of 5% from the prior year and 12% from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior year, Power Gen benefited from improved volumes and a higher joint venture contribution. These improvements were offset by investments in SAR required to support future growth initiatives through extending the Power Gen product range in gensets, alternators and other equipment.  Sequentially, improvements in joint venture earnings in China were more than offset by lower volumes in other markets and higher SAR spending.  Given the lower volumes at India in particular and some uncertainty in the developed markets, we are revising our full year revenue and earnings outlook for the Power Gen segment. We now project revenue to be up 18% over the prior year, and EBIT as a percent of sales will be between 10.5% and 11.5% compared to last year's EBIT of 10.2%.  In the Components segment, third quarter revenue was $1 billion, representing a 32% increase over the prior year and down 2% from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior year, all businesses experienced strong growth, driven by higher demand in the on-highway markets in the U.S. and stronger growth in the emerging markets. Sequentially, improvements driven by increased demand from on-highway markets in North America were offset by lower demand in Europe and China as well as from the impact of the divestiture of the exhaust business.  Segment EBIT was $113 million or 11.1% of sales, up sharply from 8.2% of sales last year and slightly below the EBIT performance in the prior quarter. The year-over-year improvement was driven by strong operating leverage from increased EPA 10 volumes and operational improvements. Sequentially, the reduction is the result of lower volumes, increased product coverage and higher research and engineering expenses to support future growth. Due to our revised truck market outlook in China and lower on-highway demand in Europe, we are revising our full year revenue outlook for the Components segment. We are now forecasting revenue growth of 30% over the prior year, while EBIT as a percent of sales will be between 11% and 12% compared to last year's EBIT of 9.1%. In the Distribution segment, third quarter revenue was $783 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year and in line with the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by mining and oil & gas markets in North America, power generation demand in Asia and industrial demand ahead of the Tier 4 emission change in North America and in Europe. Sequentially, growth in parts and service revenue offset lower demand for August. Segment EBIT margin was $104 million or 13.3% of sales. This compares to 12.9% in the previous year and 13.5% in the prior quarter. Compared to last year, this improved profitability is the result of higher sales and increased joint venture income.  Sequentially, the benefits from higher aftermarket sales were offset by selling and general expenses as we continue to invest in our distribution network globally, including Africa, as we previously discussed. For the full year, we are projecting revenue growth of 30% over the prior year and EBIT of 13% to 14% of sales compared to last year's EBIT of 12.8%.  So for the company, as a result of the lower near-term outlook in India and China and the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar against several currencies, we are now projecting 2011 full year consolidated sales to be between $17.5 billion and $18 billion. This still represents more than 30% growth over the prior year. EBIT will increase by more than 30% from last year and as a percent of sales will be in the range of 14% to 14.5%, up from 12.5% last year, with every business segment growing its profits at a faster rate than sales. This guidance excludes the impact of the exhaust business transaction in the second quarter and the light-duty filtration transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Also, in October, the company collected $40 million as the final settlement of a 2008 flood claim. This will be the reported in the fourth quarter results, but it is also excluded from our full year guidance.  The full year forecast for the effective tax rate is 29.5%, excluding discrete items. Including discrete items, the rate will be 28%.  Now before I turn it over to Tim, let me say a few words about cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations through the first 3 quarters of the year is just under $1.4 billion, already surpassing our best ever year. Our working capital metrics continue to improve, and working capital as a percent of sales is now below 18% compared to over 20% this time last year. Our pensions remain well funded. And year-to-date, we have invested $377 million in capital expenditure projects, and we are on track to invest a total of $600 million to $650 million for the full year.  During the third quarter, the company increased its dividend by 52%, and we purchased an additional 1.9 million shares of our common stock. This brings our year-to-date repurchases to 5.4 million shares at a total cost of $546 million, resulting in a reduction in our outstanding share count of almost 2%. And our debt-to-capital position at the end of September was 12.6%.  As evidence of the company's strong balance sheet and improved financial performance, our credit rating was recently increased by Standard & Poor's to A. This is the highest level we've been since the late 1970s and follows a similar upgrade by Fitch at the end of June.  And with regards to next year, we are in the process of developing our 2012 annual operating plan. As we discussed in our Investor Day back in September, there is uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions. But as you just heard from Tom, we will be prepared to deal with it. 2012 will be a good year. And consistent with prior years, we will provide 2012 guidance during the fourth quarter earnings teleconference.  Now before we open the call to your questions, let me turn it over to Tim.
TIm M. Solso: Thank you, Pat and, good morning, everyone. As most of you are aware, this is the last quarterly teleconference before my retirement at the end of the year. I will step down as Chairman and CEO of Cummins on December 31, leaving the company in the very capable hands of Tom Linebarger and his outstanding team. This leadership transition, only the fifth in the company's 94-year history, was announced in early June and has been proceeding seamlessly since then.  Succession planning and leadership development are a key part of the CEO's responsibility. Years ago, the board and I recognized in Tom the qualities needed to lead this company into the future. He is smart and energetic, he has the business know-how needed to help Cummins succeed in this today's highly competitive global marketplace. His many and varied experiences at Cummins have contributed to the breadth of his leadership skills. He lives the company's values and is a man of character and integrity. Tom has played an integral role in helping shape Cummins into the company it is today. He was instrumental in creating our key strategies in the early part of last decade. He helped the company through the downturn at the start of 2000 as the CFO and led the turnaround of the Power Generation business during that same time frame. He has significant international experience. At the beginning of the recent recession, Tom, Pat and the team took decisive steps in the face of rapidly declining markets. His quick actions helped us remain profitable during the global decline and led to a record year in 2010.  I am big fan not only of Tom but of his leadership group. Tom has built a talented, committed team that is the best I have seen in my 40 years with Cummins. I am confident that they will take the company to new heights of performance and global leadership.  We have had some remarkable success over the last 10 years. The company has undergone a transformation, becoming less cyclical, more diversified and more focused on results and expanding profits. Today, I believe we are better positioned for growth than ever before. Our record results this year despite all the uncertainty in the world say a lot about the performance culture at Cummins.  You heard us talk about macro trends that play to our strengths, including emissions standards around the world, globalization, infrastructure investment and the price and availability of energy. To take advantage of those trends and building on our industry-leading technology, we have many new products in our pipeline. Our position in emerging markets is second to none, and we have a foothold in promising locations such as Southeast Asia and Africa. We are investing in our distribution network to drive further improvements in customer service because we know how critical it is to take care of our customers' needs, every time, on time and in a consistent way around the world. We are also focused on enhancing our supply chain capabilities to improve cost, quality and customer responsiveness, and there is more.  As you can tell, I am very excited about the future of this company. I have enjoyed my career at Cummins every day and have had a lot of fun. I am passionate about our success and humbled by the opportunity to serve the company for 4 -- more than 4 decades. I want to thank all of you for your interest in Cummins, and I wish you all the best.
Mark Smith: Okay, I think we're ready for Q&A now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mr. Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research.
Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company: I guess first to start off here, can we dig into the joint venture income for the quarter and the outlook for the year, and maybe provide some details on what you saw at DCEC and how that's expected to trend going into the fourth quarter?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, so joint venture income came in pretty much exactly what we expect it to be for the third quarter. On the second quarter call, you heard Tom and Mark talk about the expectation for a slowdown in the China truck market in the third quarter, and that will impact the DCEC joint venture. And it played out almost exactly the way they had talked about that. We ended up building around 46,000 engines at DCEC in the quarter. That was down from over 60,000 in the first and second quarter. We are expecting to see some improvement as we go into the fourth quarter, but it will not get back up to the 60,000 units per quarter this year. So we'll see some improvement in Q4 but not back to levels that we enjoyed in the first half of the year. However, now, joint venture income is right on guidance that we gave back in July, and it will not change at this time around.
Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company: Okay. Got it. Great. And then can you talk about the order booking trends in the Power Gen business? And what -- maybe some more specifics on what you're seeing over in China and India? China sounds like a little bit better than what you were talking about before.
N. Thomas Linebarger: This is Tom. Yes, in China, we had some strength in the last couple of quarters because the power demand exceeded supply. And so the country was short on power, there were -- factories were being asked to get off the power grid for days or parts of days. And so what we saw was an increase in orders, especially for large generator sets, which serve as factory backup in that of case. And indeed, we -- that helped our demand in Q2 and Q3. And we -- everyone had expected, as the summer season comes to an end and demand softens and power grid catches up, that Q4 would be not as strong. And indeed, that's what we expect. The difference I made in my remarks is that the easing has taken more time than expected, so there's more people who are still ordering gensets. And we don't have a clear view as to exactly why what is. It seems as if people are still concerned about power shortages. So we expect easing. It's just that the market is staying a little bit up from what we expected. In India, on the other hand, the continued struggle the government has had with inflation control has meant that construction markets have really taken a hit. And therefore, power generation demand is indeed even softer than we anticipated. We expected a hit when we talked in the second quarter and the Analyst Day. But in fact, that hit has been even more as the construction markets have been hit by the government's tight monetary policy. Right now, the government is still trying to get inflation under control. Weakening commodity prices would serve them well, and I've talked about that in the Analyst Day. If we get some softening in commodity prices, that will help India, and that will, of course, help them and let them loosen some of their monetary policy and improve construction markets there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays Capital.
Vlad Bystricky: This is Vlad Bystricky on for Andy. Can you just talk about strong demand in both Brazil on-highway and industrial engines ahead of the Tier 4 change coming next year? Do you -- are you anticipating at this point a large drop-off in those businesses next year?
Mark Smith: Well, of course, we're not right now giving specific guidance. But I think certainly for Brazil, every on-highway emissions change, we do see a period of correction after the emissions change. What we've said on the last call is we felt we were going to see about -- a pre-buy of about 10,000 units this year. That's actually moderated in the second half, and we'll see maybe a pre-buy of about 5,000 units. So I think there'll be some easing earlier in the year. Of course, we're getting more content with the emissions change, which we benefit from with our emissions solutions business and the introduction of our SCR as well. And then the Tier 4, that's particularly on the small end of -- small end equipment, below 174 horsepower. We've seen a little bit there in Europe and a little bit in the U.S. That's not a huge revenue driver for us. I think we're thinking about 6,000 units of pre-buy, but pretty low average selling price relevant compared to our average business.
Vlad Bystricky: And then one just quick follow-up on the emerging markets, in particular China and India. Can you talk just a little bit about the cadence through the quarter and whether those markets continue to weaken or whether you're starting to see signs of stabilization, particularly on trucks in China and the India power demand?
Patrick J. Ward: Yes, let me start and Tom can jump in. I think in the truck market, as I said, and as answer in the question from Adam, we are seeing some small improvement in demand as we go into the fourth quarter. Not terribly significant yet, but it is showing better signs. Construction is deteriorating, so, well, the truck quarter was lower than what we had anticipated when we gave second quarter guidance. And the fourth quarter is turning out to be a softer quarter again than what third quarter tended to be. Power Gen, although it did come down -- is coming down in the fourth quarter, it's probably going to end up better than what we anticipated. So the other 3 big markets, Tom, do you want more?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Well, I would just add Tim and I and Pat were all in China last week, and we got to see a lot of this stuff firsthand and talked to a number of OEMs. And definitely, while things have softened some in the second half, optimism is still very high for next year. And we've given you guys a lot of detail on how things have come off a little bit, $100 million or so from what we thought in the second quarter. But what we see still is very, very strong markets. I mean, excavator market, despite really, really bad year by -- in relative terms, will still be up 10% year-over-year. And most of the people we talked to expected them to be up next year again as a result of this big move the Chinese Government is making to add affordable housing units. Similarly, with the truck market, there was this pretty significant inventory correction, and most people are projecting the truck market to again increase next year. So again, we're very optimistic about the market, and it's just a question of at what rate things return, at what rate does the government start to let off some of its tightening policies. So again, we really don't know the answer to that, but what we expect is that it's a relatively short period, and we'll start to see growth again.
Patrick J. Ward: And we've experienced rapid growth in demand for our products in China. The revenue this year, when you include our joint ventures, as Tom said, it's going to be around $3.7 billion. That's double what it was 2 years ago. So we are seeing this kind of near-term, short-term slowdown in some markets. But there's no question, well, China is the right place for us to be longer term.
N. Thomas Linebarger: And then we're -- our next steps is that we're -- we've just announced this LiuGong joint venture, which expands our presence in off-highway and will create growth in 2013. And we're still talking with other partners about expanding existing joint ventures into new areas for further growth. So we have quite a bit of growth left to go, even beyond the economic growth forecasts for China.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies & Company.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Tom, in your prepared comments, you talked about being more flexible and being able to respond if market conditions were kind of weaker. And I guess I wonder if we're at that point. I think you were quoted recently as talking about how the U.S. and Europe might already be in recession, and I just wonder if you guys are doing anything at Cummins to kind of batten down the hatches for a tougher environment going forward.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, Steve, I appreciate you bringing up that article.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: No problem.
N. Thomas Linebarger: That -- as you guessed, I regretted that interview. I -- just for what it's worth, my view in that interview was exactly the same view I gave in the Analyst Day of we really just don't know where the markets are going. There's a fair bit of volatility, especially in Europe and the U.S., as to what's going to happen. And that's exactly where we remain today, and I feel like things haven't changed there. And we are, as a result of that, tightening some spending. So we have its -- we are reducing sort of discretionary spending areas to say, "Where we can cut back, we are." We're making sure that we're keeping all of our growth plans in place. We're not doing anything dramatic, but we are reducing discretionary spend wherever we can. We have reduced hiring rates, and we'll continue to do that for a while until we just understand kind of what the next steps for these markets are. We just -- we're kind of in that period of wondering how long the low-growth period goes and what happens in China and India with regard to them coming back to growth. So we're acting now, but it's not a huge change. It's just taking a look at every place we can cut back some -- pretty easily.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So as we model the company, should I be thinking about SG&A down a little bit or CapEx down a little bit? Or is it just going to be more of a rounding kind of below the surface?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Well, I think, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves on guidance and I -- for next year. So let -- give us time to kind of put together the whole plan, and we'll give you a really good view of it. But what you should expect from us is that we'll continue to look at markets to say, "Where we think it's time to make significant moves, we will and we won't hesitate." Right now, we're kind of in that mode of saying, "Discretionary spending, we're going to slow down, hiring we're going to slow down, but we're going to keep driving on growth." So I guess what that tells you, we're still expecting to invest in our growth initiatives completely because we still think the most likely case is a slow-growth period for a period of time and then returning to growth. And so that's what we're basically planning on.
TIm M. Solso: Let me remind you of, this is Tim, of the 10,000 or 20,000 -- 2008 and 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008, in October, the sales fell off between 25% and 60%. Tom and the team were able to reduce spending and headcount as early as December, and we still earned 2.4% EBIT in that quarter and each quarter in '09 sequentially got better. We took a second round in January in Power Generation, acted at the end of the first quarter. So if we have some kind of issue, and I don't think it will be anywhere near what we saw in the '08 time frame, I think we've demonstrated that we can act in a very quick period of time when the spending is – subsides.
N. Thomas Linebarger: But I think to that point, Steve, we do not see this period as like that one yet. I mean, it doesn't mean it can't be, but we just don't see it that way. And we kind of see it the same way we laid out in the Analyst Day, which is that it looks like the most likely case of slow growth and that the inflation and monetary tightening that's going on in China and India will ease over some period of time and we'll see growth in both those economies. That's, we think, the most likely case is.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Great, that's helpful. And then just final on that one is, does it change your view of kind of capital allocation, uses of cash here? I'll leave it there.
Patrick J. Ward: No, it doesn't change at all, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.
Jamie L. Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'll refrain from the Financial Times article. But I guess, I just wonder why -- I don't know, it seems to me like at some point why -- I guess I wonder why we didn't preannounce the quarter or the earnings, because it does sound like there was a change in tone from the Analyst Day versus the Financial Times article. So one, if you can address that. And then my second question is I'm just thinking about your longer-term targets that you gave at the Analyst Day. And I think to achieve your long-term targets, you had to sort of think about get to about a 20% incremental margin. And it sounds like we're going to be about that range in 2011 based on your guidance. So just trying to think longer term, just given where we are in the cycle, how you continue to put up that 20% margin, incremental margin, the puts and takes of how we get there.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Again, just going back to the same point, Jamie, my tone didn't change at all. What the guy told us to write about was what he wanted to write about. So my -- I gave him the same balanced view that I gave the analysts about me not knowing where things are going to going -- where things are going and the chance -- that there's a chance that we're already there and there's a chance that we're going to have slow growth, and there's a chance that it would snap back quickly and my most likely case was it was slow growth. And he printed what he printed. So I had no new information then about anything than I had when I talked to you guys. And by the way, I still don't have a better view of it even today. What we have a better view of, as we talked about, was what happened in the third quarter, that's it. The rest of the economic outlook. I don't have any better outlook than I had back in the Analyst Day. So -- and our view on incremental margins, as you know that's kind of the whole -- I mean, that's exactly what we're building our whole set of strategies and plans around, is: where can we leverage our partnerships, our distribution network, our technology leadership to drive growth that yields incremental margins in line with our plans? That's sort of the whole point of it. And what we're trying to do is find those places where the technology we bring to bear provides enough value to our partners that we can earn that kind of incremental margins. The second thing we're doing is we're just trying to make sure that we're always thinking about cost in everything we do. It's how we develop the technology, so how we partner to do it, how we do it ourselves, how we set up our manufacturing plants and drive them for productivity. So all those elements are how we're going to do it. And again, it's -- that's pretty much what we focus on every day. I don't know what else to say about it.
Jamie L. Cook - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: But it doesn't sound like just -- and I know we're in the early stages. It doesn't sound like -- or maybe, it's a question that's better addressed to Pat: there's any big headwind, structural headwinds, we should think about in 2012 that would suggest that incremental margins would be below that level? As we -- I don't know what it could be but there -- you know what I mean? There's no big things out there that we should just be aware without you giving formal guidance for 2012?
Patrick J. Ward: So again, we're not giving formal guidance. You're absolutely right, Jamie, that there are no significant headwinds coming our way that we can see causing us problems in 2012.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Tom, can you talk about the extent to which you're underproducing demand in China construction and truck markets in the third and fourth quarter? I guess $100 million sequential decline in industrial engines sales next quarter despite the Tier 4 pre-buy suggests a pretty sharp cut.
Mark Smith: Well, I think, firstly, Jerry, of course, the excavator market sell the largest market in China. We're importing those engines to the demand. So those, whilst it's very important, they're part of our broader manufacturing operations in our developed markets. So I think, generally, our volumes are quite good in our plants. I think in China, clearly the truck was down. It was in line with our expectations, and we expect some improvement in Q4. So I don't think -- that's not a major concern. We're not changing our capacity investments for the long term, as we've talked about. So not so significant.
N. Thomas Linebarger: And Jerry, just to that point, we were -- one of the places that we visited was DCEC, and they're -- they've been flat out, out of capacity for some time now. And we've -- as you know, we're adding some capacity in the fourth quarter here. And in fact, the building's up and the machines are going in, and we can really use it. So DCEC, which is not a significant contributor to the excavator market, as Mark said, that's not where we're producing most of the excavator engines. We're importing those. But from a truck point of view, we still foresee the need for more capacity at DCEC, and it's evident when you go there. It's not that they couldn't produce more in the third quarter. Obviously, they could because they produced in the second quarter. But they -- to get there, they were working 3 shifts. The place was running just too tight. And so what -- our view is that the incremental capacity we're adding is needed and will be used up very quickly.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sure, now I appreciate that. Where I was going with the question is typically, your customers cut their inventories of engines during adjustment periods like this. So I'm just trying to understand whether shipments coming into their doors are well below truck or excavator shipments that are coming out in 3Q and 4Q.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, I think, in the truck side, that things are balanced out a lot better than they were. So as you know, in China, we had a pretty strong finished goods inventory at dealers for a period, then the production of trucks backed off and then that drove back into the engine production. And I think at this point now, we're starting to see retail demand pick up, inventories are relatively level, truck production is relatively in line with retail sales and now engines are getting there, too. So on the truck side, at least, I think things are getting pretty balanced out after a couple of quarters of supply chain movements back and forth. On the excavator side, I just don't have as much insight into that. I don't know, Pat, if you have any. I just -- we just -- I don't have a good answer for your question, Jerry, so we'll to follow-up with you on that.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Appreciate it, Tom. And can you talk about when you expect China to implement national forest standards and touch on whether you've signed up any engine makers in China or Brazil to use your aftertreatment systems on the new Euro V and national forest standards, respectively?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, on the -- addressing the first question, NS4 [ph], we don't -- there is not a date published yet for when they're going to do it. I mean, the only date that exists is the 1st of the year, which is the one -- 1st of 2012, which is the one that they originally set down. Most market participants do not expect them, at least, to be implemented and enforced on that date. Most people think it will be some time in the middle of the year, or the end of the year is the most likely case. And the degree to which it'll be phased in across regions of the country is all basically supposition at this point. There's lots of rumors and lots of people's opinions about it. What we're doing as Cummins is we're ready for all those outcomes. So we've got products ready to supply our customers that meet the existing standards, that will meet the new standards. And so we're ready to go on whatever happens. So we just don't know, though, exactly how it's going to be implemented. And we, of course, voiced our opinion with the regulators, whenever we can, about the importance of having a firmer introduction schedule and about sooner is better. But we'll see what it's going to be. On CES. Pat, any comments on CES implementation in Brazil? I don't have any on Brazil. In China, Euro -- the NS4 [ph] standard is when we would begin to produce aftertreatment devices. So we don't have any sales of aftertreatment devices yet, and we won't until Euro 4 starts. But on Brazil, I don't have a look in -- other than what we've always already said on the MAN, the new vehicles, all Cummins. We're not able to say a lot about it.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, for non-Cummins engines, we don't have any comments on that, Jerry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI Group.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Obviously, the key to your stock as one's view on the emerging markets. I just wanted to get -- from your qualitative comments before, not trying to get a '12 guidance from you, but the industrial business next quarter will be down year-over-year and Power Gen as well, I mean, principally from the emerging markets being lower. But from all your qualitative comments, I mean, if you're looking at '12 and we're trying to model the quarters out in '12, it sounds like you're thinking those businesses return to positive growth in the not too distant future. Just so I can get an idea how you're benchmarking that emerging market exposure in '12, when do you see those businesses returning to positive growth year-over-year? This is Industrial and Power Gen.
N. Thomas Linebarger: David, I thought you'd say that the key to our stock was great leadership. So I'm a little disappointed with that, but...
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: That's a given, Tom.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. And the idea of -- I think the problem with answering your question is I think it just ends up us giving guidance. Again, let me just go back to what I can say about it, which is that in both cases, we see the underlying fundamentals of China and India and Brazil to be incredibly strong. And those views have not changed. What we had in China and India's case is the government acting to reduce inflation and basically restricting money supply or tightening credit policies, and both governments are trying to balance the need for inflation control with economic growth. And our view is that they'll manage that back to economic growth when they think they've struck that balance. And -- but again, the underlying drivers, the underlying fundamentals of both countries are incredibly strong. And we're well positioned in each of the markets to capture their growth. That will underpin our 2012 strategy and our -- beyond that, too. So again, beyond that, I think anything else I'd say is the same as giving guidance.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Well, I guess structurally, if I think about the JV exposure to emerging markets, obviously it's huge in Engines, huge in Power Gen, pretty big in Components as well. And you can back into the margins. Obviously, you've been making a healthy margin in those markets on the JVs. Can you help us on the consolidated emerging market exposure, all right? It's roughly 30% Engines, 50% or so in Power Gen. Are the margins selling in the consolidated business into emerging markets similar to the read we can get from the JV income? Like how would you bogey that versus, say, company average?
N. Thomas Linebarger: The margins -- first of all, Power Gen is not a big JV business, just -- sort of just to correct your first intro.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: No, I mean, over the -- what they have?
N. Thomas Linebarger: And very little is in JV. But in any...
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. So what they have, it's [indiscernible].
N. Thomas Linebarger: Right. So on the consolidated side, the point is margins for those are all basically a function of how much leadership position we have in the markets and how strong our products are relative to competitors. It's not a function of JVs or consolidated. So there's not a good way to answer your question by that split. There's not a good way to answer our margins by size of product or by country. In each case, if we have a leadership position, we have good products that are leading the market, we end with quite good margins. Where we're still developing leadership position or we're smaller share, then margins are tighter. That's a better way to think of it. And so JVs and consolidated don't help you much in terms of trying to figure out where margins are higher or lower.
Mark Smith: Yes. Just one other thing I'd say there. I don't agree that broadly, we're going to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter in all of our segments. In fact, that's not what's really implied in our numbers [indiscernible].
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: No. But then, you said it clearly. It's the implied industrial revenues are down 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and down 4% year-over-year in Power Gen, being driven by some of the emerging market weakness. So I'm just trying to handicap where you're headed in '12 for the emerging markets from the qualitative comments.
Mark Smith: Right. And I just want -- didn't want to leave people with the impression that we're ending Q4 with all of our markets in China down year-over-year.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: No.
Mark Smith: So we can talk some more, okay?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Tim, it's really been a pleasure working with you.
TIm M. Solso: Thank you, Andy.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions. First, on the expected 2012 MAN Brazil-related revenue, 54% decrease. Should we view that as heavily first-half weighted?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes, I -- look, it's not going to be only first half. Really, what's happening there, Andy, is that they're bringing their own engine to Brazil to put in the VW truck for the one displacement, the one engine. I mean, we are -- we've been working with MAN now for some time to introduce our smaller and larger engine into their trucks. And the good news for us is that the trend in the market is to move up in horsepower. So that, over time, will benefit us being in the larger-displacement engine. But the substitute rate and what happens with the pre-buy and after that, all that is stuff that we just don't know the answer to, right? How quickly will people buy the larger displacement? How well will the small engine take off? How well would our launch go on their engine? And then what happens with the pre-buy? There's a whole bunch of variables to figure out with regard to the quarter. All we wanted to make sure people knew is it's a transition that we've been working with them for some time. We feel very good about our relationship with them. We feel excited about putting these new engines in there. And so we'll be supporting them throughout their truck range, still.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then if we could go back to the European truck comments I believe you made in the monologue. We've been hearing varying things from the OEMs over there. Could you comment on kind of range or magnitude you expect Q4 truck production to be down? And are you seeing that as uniform by customer?
Mark Smith: Andy, this is Mark. So I think we've seen a modest decline in the second half of our forecast, maybe 3% or 4% really in -- on-highway volumes. Of course, it's not the largest market for those, but we do have turbo components business and some on-highway engines. So it's modest in terms of what our customers are telling us for the second half of the year versus what we saw in July.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then one last one. Are you seeing any sort of weakness other than some of the truck comments made by adjacent customers to you in the Middle East? Is there anything going on with Power Gen or oil & gas?
N. Thomas Linebarger: Yes. Middle East. Power Gen has definitely fallen some. So that -- in addition to comments you heard, we've definitely seen Power Gen orders in the Middle East tail off. I was there not too long ago, and there still is quite a bit of activity in construction going in the Middle East. So I do think we're still -- we're in a low, but I still think the underlying trends are for significant expansion of infrastructure. So we're seeing Power Gen slow down. I think a whole bunch of construction projects in Dubai went on hold and have stayed on hold ever since, which took a whole bunch of demand out of the market. But if you just go over the adjacent emirate, go over to Abu Dhabi, you see construction projects starting back up again. Saudi Arabia has got significant construction, Qatar has got significant construction. So again, our view is we're seeing a low, but we're likely to see growth again take off provided oil prices stay relatively high.
Mark Smith: Okay, and I think we're out of time now. So I'll be available for your calls later. So I look forward to continue our discussions.
N. Thomas Linebarger: Thank you, Andy.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

With those formalities out of the way, we'll begin with the remarks from our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom Linebarger.
N. Linebarger: Good morning, and thank you, Mark, it's nice to have you. I'll start this morning by sharing some thoughts on our performance in the second quarter and our outlook for certain markets for the rest of the year. Mark will then provide greater detail in the quarter and our updated 2011 outlook. As you can see, we had a very strong second quarter and delivered record sales and profits. We experienced growth in all major geographic regions, led by improvement in several of our end markets in the United States. Sales for the second quarter of $4.6 billion were 45% higher than the same period in 2010. All 4 business segments reported significantly higher sales led by the Engine and Components segments, which increased 53% and 42%, respectively. We reported EBIT for the quarter of $775 million, including a gain of $68 million related to the sale of the exhaust business. Excluding the gain, we reported EBIT of $707 million or 15.2% of sales in the second quarter. This represents an increase in EBIT of 76% year-over-year, continuing our trend of growing earnings faster than sales. Our Engine, Components and Distribution segments each reported record sales and record EBIT, and our Power Generation business also delivered strong growth and profitability. Sales in the U.S. increased 56%, with growth in a number of end markets. Our Engine business experienced strong growth in heavy- and medium-duty truck, bus, mining, oil and gas and construction markets. The Components business increased U.S. revenues by 44%, driven by increased demand in on-highway markets, and the Power Generation Distribution businesses also enjoyed strong growth. Staying on the topic of our U.S. business, I wanted to provide an update on our 2010 EPA-compliant engine launch, which continues to go extremely well. Through the end of June, we had shipped almost 126,000 medium- and heavy-duty engines equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction aftertreatment devices to North American truck and bus customers. Based on testing conducted by Cummins and confirmed by head-to-head comparisons conducted by our customers, we are confident that we are meeting our commitment to provide a significant fuel economy improvement over our previous engine and that we are delivering the best fuel economy in the industry. Our market share in medium-duty trucks in the U.S. has increased to 52% due to the strong reliability of our engine and the significantly advanced fuel economy it has over the competition. In the heavy-duty market, we have increased our penetration at PACCAR and freight liner this year, and we expect our market share of the overall heavy-duty market to reach the mid-30s for the full year. Our revenues in international markets remain strong in the second quarter as well. Our consolidated revenues in Brazil grew 40%, India 17% and China 34% compared to a year ago. Brazil continues to be a very important market for us, with all 4 business segments reporting strong growth year-over-year. We delivered record results in India this quarter, and our penetration at Tata exceeded 80% for the first time in our history.  I would like to provide a little more detail on our business in China and our outlook for the key end markets there. Before I comment on specific end markets though, I want to point out that we remain very optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for all of our businesses in China. We expect the Chinese economy to grow at a significantly faster rates than developed economies for many years to come. We also expected that the growth in GDP coupled with the need for a more efficient, clean power will continue to provide Cummins with significant growth opportunities in China.  As you know, the Chinese government has taken a number of actions this year to control inflation. And probably as a result, demand softened in most on- and off-highway markets in the second quarter. You will also have read about power shortages in China, which have led to an increased demand for power generation equipment. Our full year guidance for the truck market in China, heavy and medium combined, is that it will be down 5% year-over-year.  In the heavy-duty truck market, we saw significant increase in OEM inventory levels from the fourth quarter of 2010 to February of 2011. Inventory levels have declined significantly in last 4 months. We see the current reduction in industry orders as a correction, with the third quarter likely to represent the low point for the year followed by an improvement in the fourth quarter. In the construction market in China, approximately 60% of our revenues today come from sales of engines to excavator manufacturers. Industry sales of excavator equipment increased 29% in units for the first half of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, but the second quarter declined 33% sequentially from the first quarter. You will recall that industry sales in the first quarter were extraordinarily high and are more than 60% higher than the first quarter of 2010. For the full year, we expect the excavator market size to be up 20%, with the second half lower than the first. The market share of domestic excavator manufacturers has held up better than some of the international brands, and this has helped reduce the impact on Cummins sales. Power shortages in China have driven strong demand for our products. Second quarter sales in Power Generation business increased 53% compared to the second quarter of 2010, and we now expect a full year increase in sales of 30%. We do expect the moderation demand in the fourth quarter as the power crisis starts to ease. To summarize, there are several reasons why our revenues in China continue to grow in the second quarter: increased demand for power generation equipment; shared gains for our OEM customers in truck and construction; our joint venture with Foton increased revenue in the second quarter in line with our previous guidance; continued strength in the mining and marine markets; and finally, the decline in excavator equipment sales in the second quarter did not immediately impact our engine sales but will start to have an effect in third quarter. Demand for our products in China remains very strong and we expect to grow total revenues, including our unconsolidated joint ventures, by 25% this year to around $3.8 billion, very close to our previous guidance and still a record year. We are experiencing strong demand for our products across multiple regions and markets. Our products are performing very well, and we have strong leadership positions in many markets. And we are delivering excellent levels of profitability in all 4 businesses. We also generated strong cash flow this quarter. Furthermore, we demonstrated our confidence in our future performance by increasing our dividends 52%, and we also increased our share repurchase program during the second quarter. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance of the company as a whole and with each of the business segments. As a final note, we recently announced a transition in leadership, with Tim retiring at the end of the year. The company has a strong record of handling leadership changes very well. Tim and I worked very closely together for many years and a lot of time and thought has been put into this transition plan to ensure that the handover goes very smoothly. I can assure you that Cummins will not miss a beat in our strategic focus or execution of our profitable growth plans.  Now I'll turn it over to Mark to go through the financials in more detail.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Tom. Second quarter revenues were $4.6 billion, an increase of 45% from a year ago and 20% from the first quarter. These results reflect broad growth across all major regions in all business segments. Currency movements contributed just under 4% to revenue growth. Strengthening demand from our on-highway, oil and gas, mining and construction markets led to an increase in U.S. revenue of 56% from the prior year and 20% from the first quarter. International revenue increased 38% from the prior year and 20% sequentially. International growth was driven by on-highway demand in Brazil; demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment, particularly in China; and industrial demand in Europe ahead of the upcoming emissions change in 2012. We reported record revenues in China, India and Brazil. Gross margins improved to a record 25.9% of sales due to better operating leverage and stronger volumes, improved price realization and lower warranty expense as a percent of sales due to the strong performance of our EPA2010 engines in the field.  Selling, admin and research and development costs were up 38% from the prior year and 20% sequentially. The largest increase was seen in R&E spending, which is up 64% over the same period last year and 22% from the prior quarter. As we've discussed on previous calls, we're investing to ensure we maintain our technologies and leadership and to drive profitable growth. The increase in our research and engineering spend was concentrated within the Engine and Components segments. We continue to broaden our product range and develop technology to meet increasing demand for cleaner and more efficient power across global markets. Joint venture income of $117 million was 21% higher than a year ago and 22% higher than the previous quarter. These increases are driven by strong oil and gas markets served by our North American distributors and strong demand for Power Gen and mining products seen in China by our joint venture Chongqing Cummins. Dongfeng Cummins in China also contributed to the sequential growth.  Earnings before interest and tax were a record $707 million, excluding a $68 million gain from the divestiture of the exhaust business. This level of earnings in EBIT is an increase of 76% from the prior quarter and 33% from the first quarter. EBIT as a percent of sales reached 15.2% during the second quarter compared to 12.5% a year ago and 13.8% in the prior quarter. Currency did not have a significant impact at the EBIT level year-over-year. Earnings per share in the second quarter was $2.41, excluding the exhaust business transaction. This compares to $1.25 from a year ago.  Now let me provide additional details on each of our operating segments, as well as provide an update on our full year 2011 revised guidance. In the Engine segment, second quarter sales were $2.9 billion, up 53% from the prior year and 21% sequentially. This increase is driven by a continued recovery of North American on-highway markets, strong worldwide oil and gas activity, infrastructure development in China, as well as elevated demand from industrial engines in Europe ahead of the Tier 4 Interim emissions change in 2012.  Year-over-year joint venture income decreased 6% due to product mix at Dongfeng Cummins. Sequentially, however, earnings from our joint ventures increased 17%. This increase is driven by on-highway and industrial demand in China, particularly for high horsepower engines produced at Chongqing Cummins.  Segment EBIT increased to a record $377 million or 13% of sales. This represents a 91% increase over the prior year and a 30% increase sequentially. This increase was driven by strong operating leverage, positive price realization and lower warranty expenses as a percent of sales.  The continued strength of several end markets, including North America on-highway markets, global oil and gas and mining, along with strong on-highway demand in Brazil, requires us to increase our revenue and EBIT forecast for 2011. We are now forecasting Engine segment revenue to be up 45% over the prior year. Due to the improved revenue outlook and our improved forecast for warranty expense, we now forecast to earn EBIT of 12% to 13% of sales in the Engine segment. Moving on to the Power Generation segment. Second quarter revenue was $909 million, an increase of 28% over the prior year and 14% sequentially, driven largely by North America, Europe and China. Segment EBIT was $105 million or 11.6% of sales, representing an improvement over both the prior year and the prior quarter. Profitability was positively impacted by stronger volumes, price improvements and lower product coverage. We reaffirm our prior guidance for the Power Generation segment of achieving growth of 20% in revenue over the prior year and EBIT of 11% to 12%. In the Components segment, second quarter revenue was a record $1 billion, representing a 42% increase over the prior year and 12% sequentially. This is the first time that the Components segment has exceeded $1 billion in quarterly revenue, and all businesses within the segment saw year-over-year and sequential growth. This improvement is driven by continued recovery in North American and European on-highway markets. Segment EBIT was a record $120 million or 11.6% of sales. This compares to 10.3% of sales last year and 11.4% of sales in the prior quarter. Year-over-year and sequential improvement was driven by strong operating leverage from increased EPA 2010 volumes and operational improvements. We are confirming our 2011 guidance for record performance within the Components segment. We project revenue growth of 35% over the prior year and EBIT percent of 11% to 12% of sales.  In the Distribution segment, second quarter revenue was $785 million, an increase of 36% over the prior year and 22% sequentially. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the Distribution segment had organic growth of 26% over the prior year. This growth was driven by oil and gas markets in North America, increased power generation sales in Europe and the Middle East and stronger demand for parts and service. Segment EBIT margin was a record $106 million or 13.5% of sales. This compares to 12% in the previous year and 13.9% in the prior quarter. This improved profitability is the result of higher sales and increased joint venture income. Sequentially, we did see a change in mix as growth in whole goods exceeded our part sales as we expected. Due to improved demand for industrial engines and parts, we're increasing our guidance for the Distribution segment. We now forecast revenues will be up 30% over the prior year, and EBIT will be between 13% and 14% of sales. Now let me summarize our revised guidance for the company. We now expect revenues to grow 36% over the prior year and reach $18 billion. The benefits of high volumes will be partially offset in the second half of the year by higher product coverage and research and development spending. We expect to achieve full year EBIT of 14.5% of sales, which will be a record. Full year consolidated guidance, which we're providing, assumes product coverage to be 2.9% of sales for the full year, joint venture income to increase 19% over 2010 and research and engineering spending to be 3.5% of sales. The effective tax rate is forecasted to be 29.5%, excluding discrete items. During the second quarter, we did recognize a $68 million gain from the sale of the exhaust business. The annual guidance we're providing today excludes this gain and the expected gain from the sale of our light-duty filtration business, which we expect to complete in the second half of this year. During the second quarter, cash from operating activities was $656 million, a quarterly record. Our healthy balance sheet provides us with the ability to make the investments necessary to deliver profitable growth. Year-to-date, we've invested $215 million in capital spending and on track to spend a total of $600 million to $650 million during the year. Also, we will continue to mend the very high funding level of our pensions by contributing $130 million. As evidence of the company's liquidity, low debt to equity and strong financial performance, our credit rating was recently increased by Fitch to A-. This represents the highest rating achieved by the company since 1989.  During the second quarter, the company repurchased an additional 1.6 million shares of our common stock. This brings our year-to-date repurchases to 3.5 million shares at a total cost of $373 million. In addition, the company's quarterly dividend was increased last month by 52% to further reward our shareholders. We have committed to delivering sustainable dividend growth. We are pleased with the strong growth and improved operating margins across our business.  Before we open the call to your questions, Tim would like to make some concluding remarks.
TIm Solso: Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Recently, I announced my retirement from Cummins effective December 31 this year. I have worked in Cummins for 40 years, the last 12 as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. I will also be 65 years of age next March.  The company is operating extremely well right now and is positioned for even better performance in the future. So this is a good time for me to retire. I've been working with the board on this transition for some time. In Tom, we have a proven leader with an outstanding record of performance. Tom has built a very experienced and talented management team that is the strongest I've seen in my 40 years with Cummins.  I am extremely confident in Cummins future. We have a strong balance sheet. Our global footprint is well-established and growing, particularly in the emerging markets of China, India, Russia and Brazil. We have 56 joint venture partnerships and a global distribution network that is envied by many in our business. Our revenues grew 22% in 2010, and we are forecasting a 36% increase with revenues this year.  I would like to echo the comments from Tom and Mark about the strength of our financial performance this quarter. For the last 10 years, we have been driving the company to diversify and profitability grow revenues across geographies and end markets. The performance in the second quarter demonstrates how successful we've been. Revenues in all major geographic markets grew significantly, and all 4 of the business segments reported very strong operating margins, with 3 of the 4 businesses delivering record quarterly performance. For the first time, all 4 business segments will deliver double-digit EBIT margins for the full year.  I believe Tom and his leadership team will drive the company to new heights of financial performance and global leadership. I am more excited about the growth prospects for the company than I have ever been. Our products are performing extremely well. We continue to invest in new technology, and we have formed great partnerships around the world. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day in New York on September 13, when we will share with you our new long-term targets for growth and profitability.  I want to thank you for your interest in Cummins and your support through the years. Now I will hand it back over to Mark before we take your questions.
Mark Smith: Thank you, Tim. Consideration to who are with us on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you're free to rejoin the queue. Derek, we are now ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Timothy Denoyer from Wolfe Trahan.
Timothy Denoyer: A question on the Power Gen guidance. That was an area that last quarter you had cited as a place where there could be some upside as the year progresses. Can you talk a little bit more about how those demand trends are going? It seems like from the 20% revenue growth guidance that essentially implies that the revenue should be at or below the 2Q level in the second half in the third and fourth quarter?
Mark Smith: As we've talked about, we're seeing strong demand in China. But of course, as a percent of our total segment revenue, that didn't shift the needle a lot. The U.S., while it showed good growth in the first half from very low levels over the first half of last year, doesn't show a great amount of growth in the second half of the year. And then with China, we do see demand easing off there as the power crisis improves. So overall, we haven't changed the guidance.
Timothy Denoyer: Okay. And then kind of separately in terms of the -- can you talk about the longer-term strategy in light duty in the U.S., specifically with the development of the Nissan Titan program? And would you ever get into sort of a light-vehicle diesel more broadly in terms of the growing turbo market there and increased diesel penetration?
N. Linebarger: We sure hope so. As we've talked about before, we have a significant investment in light-duty diesel engine that we think could make significant penetration especially in lighter trucks than we're in today and in SUVs. And our view is given the fuel economy needs and greenhouse gas concerns that clean diesel is a good addition to transportation portfolio. So we're pushing hard for that to happen. There's still -- it's still not clear about what the rate and pace if that's going to happen, but I agree with your comments that there is more interest, both in terms of the DOE and as well as customers and manufacturers. The past 2 car business, as you know, has been a relatively rough area for the last several years so I think resources are limited compared to what they were maybe 5 or 10 years ago but they're coming back. And so we're hopeful. We're still working aggressively on finding the right set of partners for our light-duty diesel engine, and we're cautiously optimistic about it but we're not going to get ahead of ourselves.
Timothy Denoyer: Okay. And that light duty, it will be the 4-cylinder that was talked about in the second quarter, a government conference with Nissan. Is that commercial at this point?
Mark Smith: I think, Tim -- I think you and I talked about this. We do a lot of programs with customs [ph] on development side. It doesn't necessarily mean it's moved into a commercial -- you've got copy of a DOE presentation, and I think we've got no news to announce here. Tom has given you the overview.
N. Linebarger: Yes, it's basically research program at this point.
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG: A couple of quick questions. Same question which I sort of ask every quarter. I guess relative to your expectations in the second quarter, what is surprising you? Is it market share? Is it market growth? Is it execution pricing? Just run through sort of where you see the expectations on Q2. And then just my second question, you guys increased your outlook on truck in North America. PACCAR, at the same time this morning, lowered their outlook. So I'm just trying to get a feel for why you're more optimistic. Is it market share? Is it the truck OEs are dealing with supplier constraints that you're not dealing with? I'm just trying to understand the disconnect between you and another big truck OE?
N. Linebarger: Jamie, let me just first comment on the broad point about what caused a surprise. Off-highway engines are the most positive surprise. You talked about mining and oil and gas before. In fact, construction equipment engines were also stronger. We expected China will start to head down. In fact, it's been stronger longer than we thought. So those are all the sort of the positive surprises. With regard to North American heavy-duty trucks, we are expecting the full year to be a little bit better for our production than we put in the pen but not a lot more, and the first half was actually slightly worse. The second quarter was about on and first quarter was a little bit below. But trying to calibrate with PACCAR might be a little more difficult. I don't know, Mark, if you have anything to add there?
Mark Smith: Yes, because BNZ [ph] had a slightly different definition. So I've just seen that this morning, so I'll need to look at how their dicing the market.
N. Linebarger: But broadly speaking, we see the North American heavy-duty truck as having a lot of positive momentum in terms of order rates and some difficulty in the supply chain to actually produce the customer demand, which, on the one hand, I'm sure is very frustrating for PACCAR, which is making good improvement. I think we'd like to do more good improvement in terms of their revenues, but they're running into constraints. And at this point, it's not us, which is really important for us, obviously. But they are running into those, and I think that's probably frustrating them a little bit. But broadly speaking, I think order rates are good and outlook remains about like we expected.
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG: All right. So in summary, it sounds more supplier issues versus there's nothing on the macro front that you're seeing at this point that's causing any concern. Besides, you talked about China and it sounds like things get worse in Q3 and then eventually improve. But outside of that, you're not seeing anything macro that's sort of really concerning to you?
N. Linebarger: No. I mean, as you know, the general uncertainty in the economy is not making any of us feel really great. But from a truck market point of view, no.
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. I look forward to your long-term targets in September.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS.
Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank: Could you touch on -- and I think Jamie started to touch on it, but could you talk about any supply-chain impact to you? And then maybe how you expect to manage input costs in the back half of the year?
N. Linebarger: Yes, let me start with your first question about supply chain. As we've talked about, we're really -- since the beginning of the recovery for Cummins, which is all the way back in the second half of '09, we started to ramp a little bit and then by 2010, we were ramping pretty quickly. We've had to deal with supply-chain constraints, really dozens of them, from all over the place. We have a very global supply chain. And so trying to make sure people ramped up with us has been a challenge really since then. We started with high horsepower engines, trying to get people back in the game. We have the Japan issues to deal with. So what I would say is there's no single thing which stands out today as a unique problem with one supply chain or one area. I think it's a little bit easier, at least from what I heard from the truck companies, they're pretty clear about the 1 or 2 that are shorting them today, but they're kind of dealing with one set of products for one market and we're talking a broad whole bunch of engines from a whole bunch of different parts of the world. So it's a little bit more -- it's still difficult to say this is the problem or that's the problem. But we are actively managing supply-chain constraints. I mean, we have implemented some new processes to track where supplier capacity is. We've helped suppliers with funding, tooling early in their ramp up so they could be ready, lots of programs like that to make sure -- and right now, we feel, as I mentioned, that we're in reasonably good shape. We've brought down our lead times to market lead times in every one of our engines where we don't feel like we're holding up any of the industry in the truck side. So again, I don't want to -- it's always a struggle so I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. But right now, we feel good about that. On the material cost side, definitely commodities are rising this year. That is a challenge for us to manage. As we've talked about on this call before, we have delays between when the commodity start to go up in price and when we start to see them in our purchases in significant numbers, with the exception of a few places we see. We have precious metals in our emissions equipment, and we have copper and electrical steel pretty close to the raw commodity in our Power Generation business. And so those places, we see pretty quick cost increases, most of the other places we see delays, and we negotiate for as long with delays as we can. And then, of course, we also try to adjust prices wherever we can. And so all those kind of things make them spread. That will happen this year, and then we go for price decreases. So broadly, as a company, we think the commodity thing will largely become neutral for us across the year. But that isn't true in the Power Generation business where, in fact, we are seeing some increases, which is giving us a little bit increase in material costs in the second half.
Mark Smith: So I think, just to remind you, for the full year, we said we'd expect net 1% price increase across the company and about a gross 1.3% commodity costs challenge, partially offset by internal cost improvements and is pretty much playing out the way we had said for the full year so far.
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.
Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research: Could we dig into the Brazil market trends a little bit? The outlook there has been picking up to 30% growth from 20%, and we have this emissions change over that's coming up next year. So I'm wondering, how much the market might be down next year and then any platform changes that might be occurring next year that we should keep our eye on?
Mark Smith: Adam, this is Mark. Yes, we've definitely seen an increase in demand for truck engines in Brazil. And while we started the year thinking there wasn't going to be a significant pre-buy impact because OEMs are pretty tight on capacity, it seems like we've been able to find a little more. We estimate maybe up to 10,000 or 11,000 units increase in the second half of the year. Of course, for next year, we're not really getting into guidance for 2012 at this point in time. We update that later in the year, but we're definitely seeing a ramp up.
N. Linebarger: And the only thing I'd add, Adam, is we definitely will see changes in engines because we will be moving to Euro V. So those are programs we've been working on, as you guessed, for some time. We're also introducing some truck, introducing some new engines over the next several years but not is all happening as a result of the Euro V implementation. But we are upgrading all of our engines that are there to meet Euro V, and that is occurring in January. So that all is going through.
Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research: Okay, got it. And then just a clarification on the Components guidance for the year did not change even though the Engine segment revenues are going to be up. Is that all due to the divestiture?
Mark Smith: No, that's not really -- that's not the big driver. The big thing, Adam, is a lot of the growth in on-highway markets, today, aren't as significant for Components as off-highway. The aftertreatment system will come on for Tier 4 Final, which is the single biggest ticket item on revenue. China is down a bit, which is a consolidated part of the business in Components. So those are the biggest reasons why we haven't changed significantly.
N. Linebarger: So again, just thinking about it a little bit, I mentioned to you that the truck market is a little bit ahead of our guidance for the full year but not much. What's really been different is off-highway markets where, as Mark says, we don't have as many of the emissions components on, for example, aftertreatment so much on off-highway yet. It's growing as you know because of the implementation Tier 4, but it's not yet a big factor. And the China comment he made, we have a very significant turbocharger operation in China. It's a very strong market participant. And that business goes pretty close to the automotive business in China, which, as we mentioned, is a little bit down for the second half. Does that help?
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I wish to add my good luck to Tim and Tom and thanks for explaining how you intend to grow despite the China outlook. Can you talk about what you're seeing in Brazil outside of truck? We've heard some commentary through previous earnings about a slowdown second half versus first half. Are you seeing any of that?
N. Linebarger: Yes. Not a significant effect for us, I mean, we're still seeing our business Power Gen. Off-highway still remain strong and about the same, so no major change there for us yet. Mark?
Mark Smith: And those Power Gen and on-highway, our biggest segments for Brazil for those.
N. Linebarger: Right.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And then, a similar question of Europe outside of truck?
Mark Smith: We've seen -- well, construction's picked up to some -- we believe there's some pre-buy going on, on the below 174-horsepower construction. I think truck continues to improve a little bit but nothing dramatic but no significant negative signs.
N. Linebarger: And with the Power Gen business has not really recovered significantly, that's one of areas where it really hasn't recovered very much yet still, is in Europe.
Mark Smith: Russia will be the exception where we've seen strong growth across a number of end markets.
N. Linebarger: Yes, related to oil and gas.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thanks, and please pass on our condolences for Pat and his family.
N. Linebarger: Thanks, Andy.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Tim Thein from Citigroup.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: First question was just on the JV income forecast where you took that up from 15% to 19%. It looks like the unconsolidated sales targets for India and China were essentially left unchanged from last quarter. So I guess, should we assume that the majority of the increase is driven more by distribution versus the equipment ops?
Mark Smith: That's exactly it, and then that's the main driver. Tim, you've got it, and then our Chongqing Cummins joint venture, which is more related nonconstruction. Off-highway is also pretty strong in the second half, but distribution is the biggest point. You're exactly right.
Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc: Okay. Okay, and switching gears, you highlighted oil and gas several times and I wanted to -- again, maybe this is hopefully not to steal any thunder from your September meeting, but some of the major oilfield services companies have highlighted how the greater horsepower requirements and service intensity tied to the horizontal drilling is helping them achieve some pretty significant increases in revenue per rig. And I would assume that this plays right into your hands but hoping you could provide some color in terms of your revenue and margin opportunity, given your position today in well servicing but also as you look forward to the launch of your transmission and larger displacement engine?
N. Linebarger: Yes, you could have written a brochure for us there, Tim. We definitely do see it as an opportunity. Of course, in our -- in the scheme of our revenue, it's still a smaller portion. And so I think some of the companies that you may listen too, of course, have a bigger position and may be bigger numbers in it. But we feel like we've got a good position there and it's growing. And so we are making significant investments. As you did mention, our transmission but also in our -- in moving up in horsepower range in the engine side. We are also putting a lot of dedicated resources towards packages, creating packages for the oil and gas industry so purchasers can get closer to what they want right from us rather than having to do a lot of secondary engineering and dealing with quality issues, et cetera, which has been well-received. So we are making significant investments in the oilfields. And as you said, the higher horsepower needs and the urgency with which operators are trying to make sure they understand and make productive shale gas finds that I think are -- it's definitely serving equipment producers well.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.
Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I suppose -- most of my nitty-gritty questions have been answered but maybe you could update us on your warranty accrual costs in Q2 '11? And you noted that the engine seem to be performing better or at least in line with expectations. Is there a chance that warranty accruals could go down next year or we could see some reversals?
Mark Smith: I think either is possible but I think basically, as we've said, the performance is really good and that really led to some favorable adjustments here in the second quarter. Over and above that, we do have some campaigns and repair practices on our older engines and they were very low in the second quarter compared to historical trends. So we think that that's not a normal run rate. But overall, the confidence in the product is very high and our goal is to find the problems and fix them as quickly as possible to minimize the costs. And I think we're doing a pretty good job of that.
N. Linebarger: As a business -- Ann, we are very really pleased from the point of view of the 2010 launch and how well the results are coming in from a warranty point of view. It's not a place you ever want to get ahead of yourself, but we feel very good about where we are. And we have a pretty conservative and stringent way with which we adjust accruals, and we'll continue to follow that. So even -- we're not going to get ahead of ourself financially, but we feel great business-wise about where we are.
Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, that's helpful color. And so we shouldn't take Q2 and apply that going forward necessarily, is that what you're saying?
Mark Smith: No, the second half is going to be a little bit higher. That's what the guidance implies here.
Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then, can you talk a little bit about how the expansion plans and where you might be running up close to full capacity and where your priorities are in the near term?
N. Linebarger: Yes, from a capacity point of view, as I talked about, and the supply chain point of view, we have been managing bottlenecks throughout the supply chain in a whole bunch of different areas, both components and engines, not so much in genset, but in components and engines, now for several years and we've been moving them up. And they're not typically assembly issues, right? So we don't have assembly capacity point constraints in very many places. I can't think of any to be honest. It's almost all supply chain-related, and it's mostly components and it's not even the same components by engine. So that's really what we're managing from a capacity point of view. As you guessed, heavy-duty trucks, if we meet the forecast that we expect by the middle of next year, we'll be tight. And so we've been doing a lot of work on that now for more than 12 months, figuring out how we make sure we have enough capacity, not just on average for the year, but for any week or any quarter anybody needs a lot of them, how we're going to make sure. And so we've been using inventory, as well as capacity expansion, as well as shift patterns, et cetera, to manage that as an example. But then in high horsepower engine has also been managing capacity to make sure that we have enough of what engines are selling the best. We talked a little there about mining and oil and gas, which grew a little faster than we expected this year. So more demand for those particular models of the high horsepower engines has meant that we've had to get some capacity in those models. So a lot of work. But again, I would say to you that I don't feel against it in the sense that we're in a desperate situation anywhere but it's taken a lot of work across all of our product lines.
Mark Smith: I think the other thing I would add, Ann, is obviously at Tata Cummins joint venture, we've added 60,000 units of capacity this year. And at Dongfeng Cummins, we've also been working on adding additional 50,000, and you'll recall we're pretty much sold out last year.
N. Linebarger: Yes, those are examples, I think, like the Dongfeng Cummins ones to where, okay, demand is falling in China so why would you add capacity? And the idea there is that we think it's the correction, and we want to make sure we have capacity when the demand comes back. So that's an example of kind of our strategy to make sure that we don't get behind. We stay up and where we have assembly capacity we've got in place because it's in the broad scheme of things, relatively inexpensive relative to the revenue opportunity we have. And then, it's about managing the supply chain to make sure they keep up.
Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And just a real quick follow-up on that. Given everything you've said there, would you expect CapEx going into 2012 to remain at or above 2011 levels? Or is this you're kind of -- because of all of the capacity your putting in emerging markets, is this year kind of the peak?
N. Linebarger: Well, I don't want to get ahead of guidance, obviously, but let me just give you a broad view, which is I don't see us at any peak kind of idea now. I mean, we're going to continue to try to manage in our sort of 3% to 4% of revenue band, and we see ourselves growing now for several years and of course we'll talk a lot about that in September, about the rates of growth that we think they're going to be significant. So we'll be putting in the capacity to make sure that we can meet it. So definitely, I don't see that as a peak but we're going to be continue to manage our capital spending with discipline while still making sure we've got capacity to grow.
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Security.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Congratulations, Tim. We're going to miss you. It's been a privilege to work with you for the last decade.
TIm Solso: Thank you, Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: One thing that strikes me, I mean, it's hard to pick on anything in this quarter. Business is just spectacular. But the back of the envelope, incremental margins for all the sectors are almost uniformly similar. They go from like 14%-something to 18%, which is so much concern around the street about incremental margin. Are we sort of limiting in the profitability improvement we can get at this point? Did you have to fight for it? And what can we expect as we look out to this year into next year from that incremental dollar sales across the company because it's awfully uniformed per sector?
N. Linebarger: Yes. Pat talked about this a little bit but we definitely see one of the fundamental challenges for us. One of the things that we think is critical to achieving our target is to continue to generate incremental margins so that we can grow earnings faster than sales and that the incremental margin generation is kind of what really makes the targets. So we're very focused on them. So we don't think they're over or somehow we're not going to be able to get them anymore. That's kind of what our management team focuses on is how to grow but still grow in a way that we can generate those kind of incremental margins that we've been generating and will continue generating. You know that at the start of a -- after the anniversary [ph] at the start of ramp up, you get a little bit better incremental margins. But then after that, these things start to average out as you grow, and we think we can do that over a sustained period of time.
Mark Smith: And I think the thing that I'd point out here, Eli, is we're growing the incremental EBIT margins. At the same time, we're having a heavy investment in R&E to fund that future growth. So the gross margin expansion is good and from then the growth at the same time.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: And I guess, we can expect that profile as sort of the norm. We're just trying to keep as the norm in the next couple of years at this point?
N. Linebarger: That's exactly -- yes, that's exactly right, Eli. That's what you'll see when we talk in September, we talk about the targets. That's really going be what they're going to say. And of course, to say it is one thing, to do is another, but that's what our management team is focused on.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: On that point can we sort of -- I mean, it would seem that the component sector probably has the most leverage for improvement in the profitability. Of course, you have the divisions where you have mentioned the booming, Power Gen is quite strong but components seemed to be almost as if -- it's always been the step child. Is that area that could have the most improvement in profitability in the next couple of years?
N. Linebarger: I think Annad Hasim [ph] might take issue with the step child characterization there. But I get where you're going. They are now in double-digit return level. We're very, very happy with where we are now from a profitability point of view. Of course, we think they can improve. But I think -- the other thing to think with them is that we also think they have potential growth, higher growth. So we'll be balancing how much we're expecting from incremental margins and how much we want growth. For example, there we're likely to increase engineering spending at a higher rate because we think we've got an opportunity to launch a lot more products, especially in developing countries, so we'll be balancing that. So I guess I wouldn't say that that's the area where all the incremental -- a lot of the incremental EBIT level. We'll be looking for good incremental margins across all 4 segments and growth rates, good growth rates are across all 4 segments but a little higher growth rate in the Components business.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Tom, can you give us an update on your light-duty diesel turbo and high horsepower engine development programs? When do you expect to start commercial production? And in case you're feeling generous, what range of annual sales contributions are you targeting from those platforms?
N. Linebarger: Light-duty diesel, first of all, is still in the stage where we're looking for partners before we can say we're going to production. So we have an engine, it's designed. We have a plant or at least 90% of a plant. So we are ready to partner up. There'll be some engineering to do to finalize with our partners to get it launched. But right now, we have partners interested. The combination of those partners together does not reach commercial viability. So we're a significant partner short of being able to launch. And that we've been actively exploring partners now for the last several months. We have some good leads. We got -- deepened some conversations. So as I said, I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll find something but don't want to get ahead of myself. So that's light-duty diesel and I don't -- that's where it is. With regard to the high horsepower engine, we have a planned introduction and announcement about timing and things like that I'm ahead of now. So I don't want to say much more about that other than to say we are working on a larger engine. We will be looking to grow revenues. But that announcement has yet to come. Jerry, I don't know if you -- were you asking a little bit about the 2.8 and 3.8 that we've got with our Foton joint venture?
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I was asking about the turbochargers that you're developing to go in line with the Foton joint venture.
N. Linebarger: Okay, the turbocharger. This is the small turbochargers. Okay, I'm sorry, I missed your question. Well, you got a lot information, you didn't need then. Let's see if we can get you information you do need.
Mark Smith: So I think, Jerry, this is Mark, so the big ramp up in those turbos is going to be around the next emissions change in China. You will see some modest volumes here in the fourth quarter and then start to build up next year.
N. Linebarger: Yes, and remember that's Euro IV or whatever the China equivalent of Euro IV is. And that right now is scheduled to be the first of 2012. But there's debate about when the actual implementation will be, and we just don't know. But most market expectations I've heard are somewhere between January 2012 and January 2013. Again, everybody has a point to pick on the calendar but it's somewhere between those 2. And that will be a significant launch for the Components segment, I think you know that Jerry that's a small turbo but lots of volume. So a significant opportunity for us for growth there.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And, Tom, on that note, any opportunity to sell that turbo to other engine makers? And on that note, can you talk about if you see any incremental emissions solution sales opportunities to other engine OEMs in China and Brazil with your foreign national standards in '12?
N. Linebarger: Yes, no question about it, Jerry. We have already been talking with other potential customers for that turbocharger. We have, as you guessed, the development is a major activity for us. We're kind of doing things step-by-step but there's no question there'll be other opportunities for sale there, and they're significant. And, then on the aftertreatment side, we do believe that aftertreatment has significant growth potential in China. That's was when I was talking to Eli, that was one of the points I was making about growth in the Components business is that the developing countries like China, that as they begin to implement standards from Euro IV on, now they're having to add equipment that will help the engines meet emissions, and we are working actively on FCR and other aftertreatment devices that we believe a lot of engine makers will use and we think we'll have significant business growth as a result.
Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Basili Alukos from Morning Star.
Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc.: Just one broad question that's kind of following up on other questions, people have asked just about your guidance. I'd like to call myself an optimist, but all the news that you read in the paper, columns just had a few articles recently about China, India, as well as Brazil, as far as inflation, the Chinese PMI was about at 50. Obviously, what's going on in the U.S. with the debt. And then in Europe, they're struggling yet when you read your release and see that you've raised revenue guidance for the second time, just trying to figure it all out in light of the context of what's going on in the rest of the world. How you have such strength and is it mostly market share? Obviously, your share has been up so there's greater penetration which explains why the Distribution -- or excuse me, why the Components business was doing well. But just trying to kind of to figure it all out in light of kind of backdrops that don't seem as positive?
N. Linebarger: Yes, let give me you 2 general thoughts, and then we can see if I can -- we can be more specific. But generally speaking, as I talked about China as an example, which to your point there's been a lot of news about China and is it getting worse. A lot the news, I think, is about momentum. It's about the fact that is it going to get worse than it's been growing. And it's been growing at 9% or 10% GDP a year. And so the government has said we need to control inflation because they're getting housing cost inflation and other forms of inflation, which look like they could create problems for them long run. So they're watching out for bubbles. But they have a strong incentive to keep GDP growth up above 8%. So their playing a fine line between how much they restrain growth and how much they allow growth. But suffice it to say that there's significant growth still going on in China. And remember that even if they get down to 7% growth compared to 1% or 2% in the U.S., so these are other markets that are growing very, very quickly. And even the comparisons, if you look -- I've mentioned talked about the excavator market, which has clearly fallen off from very, very high construction equipment purchases driven by stimulus and just the general GDP growth, still we're talking about levels that are in Q1 was 60% higher than just one year before in China, which was already huge. So the growth rates are so big that even if they start to tail off a little bit, you're talking about gigantic business for Cummins. So there's definitely share gains in there. There a trends which are favoring local producers versus importers and we're, of course, a local producer and supplying local producers. We're growing our -- the size of our engines. We're adding the Foton joint venture, which is giving us new engines in China. We're bringing new products to India, same thing. So those are influencing it to but broadly speaking, I think when you look on the margin, you might say hey this looks a little bit worse, but when you step back from it you say what's the opportunity for Cummins, it's slowing down slightly but not very much. We can barely keep up. So that's the first point. The second point is I do think there is general uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe, and I don't know what to say to you about that other than I do think that some of our businesses like Power Gen still have more room to recover. And if things got better, if we started to see positive momentum in the U.S. and Europe and more confidence. We'd see those -- that business improve further. So we have more upside than we think we were experiencing. But there is that cloud hanging over that's I think keeping the growth of capital businesses like Power Gen slower. And then truck, on the other hand, which maybe could be slower too, is fast because for so many years people delay truck purchases. Now they're just desperate, they need new trucks because the cost of their old ones is now exceeded the cost of buying new ones from a total cost point of view, so they're buying new ones even in the face of some uncertainty in the economy. So I guess what I'm try to give these our business is going very well in I agree some uncertain times but it's mostly because we're positioned in these developing economies that are growing much faster and because some of our end markets are growing despite the uncertainty. I think when things get more confident, you're going to see even more growth for us.
Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc.: I appreciate it. That kind of helps round out the story. And I guess just a follow-up on that, and I think before Cummins has said that most of the segments with the exception of the Power Gen, tend to be leading or at least concurrent. And I'm just wondering kind of given that ECRI too has seen a slowdown but maybe some of the segments are kind of more concurrent to lagging versus leading. And maybe that's the reason why the potential slowdown might not necessarily be reflected in your numbers as you've increase your...
Mark Smith: Basili, it's Mark. I think, obviously, in the U.S., the truck cycle, the age of the fleets who have been on a depressed level or demand for a number of years and that's -- when you talk about components, that's a big driver. So the recovery in trucks in North America and a little bit in Europe is going to be driving that we believe we're in the front end of a multiyear cycle there. That's a particular reason why Components is picking up with the extra content at each at different emissions level.
Operator: And at this time, I am showing we are at the top of the hour.
N. Linebarger: Thank you.
Mark Smith: Okay. Well, thank you very much for your time today, and I will be available for calls shortly. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

T. Solso: Good morning. I'm going to start today by offering an overview of our first quarter results. I will then share a few thoughts on how the company is positioned to take advantage of our long-term opportunities. Tom will discuss our ability to meet the growth in demand we expect to see this year in all our markets. Pat will then conclude with a detailed look at our performance in the first quarter and share our updated guidance for 2011.  As you know, there are some debate over the strength and sustainability of the global economic recovery. We have a good perspective on the strength of the global markets, and we are seeing significant growth in demand for our products and services in nearly every geographic market we serve. In fact, we now expect our sales in 2011 to be almost 30% higher than in 2010 compared to our initial forecast of around 20%.  Our first quarter performance was very good. Sales of $3.9 billion represent the third highest quarterly sales in the company's history behind only our record performance last quarter and the second quarter of 2008 at the height of the last economic cycle. Our profitability as a percentage of sales represents solid performance and continuing improvement. Earnings before interest and taxes were 13.8% of sales in the first quarter. These earnings are higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 and the best quarterly performance ever at Cummins.  All 4 of our business segments reported improved EBIT percentage from the fourth quarter. The Engine and Components segments also earned record EBIT in the first quarter both in terms of total dollars and as a percent of sales. Our first quarter results reflect continued strong growth in key international markets especially China, India and Brazil. Consolidated sales in China grew by 66% from the same period in 2010. Sales in India increased by 31%, and sales in Brazil rose by 39%.  We also were starting to see signs of recovery in the North American truck markets. Shipments in North America heavy-duty truck market grew by 15% compared to the previous quarter, while medium-duty Engine segment increased by 14%. We have now shipped nearly 90,000 engines equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction aftertreatment systems in North America. Our engines continue to perform very well, and orders for the rest of the year are increasing.  Our performance in the first quarter was further confirmation that our work to keep the company strong during the recession continues to pay off. It also has strengthened my belief that Cummins is entering into a period of accelerated profitable growth over the next few years, driven by several economic and market trends that we have shared with you over the past 2 years. Those trends include the continued rapid growth in international markets especially in emerging markets like India, Brazil and China; tightening emission standards around the world; increased infrastructure and investment; and a widening gap between the demand and supply of electricity. We are beginning to see the impact to some of these trends on our business already. For example, Cummins global reach continues to play a large role in our success, and we expect that to continue well into the future.  We've talked at some length about our strength in China, India and Brazil. We have aggressive plans in place to build on our leadership positions in all 3 countries. We are investing in additional capacity, entering new markets and launching new products tailored to specific needs within those markets. We also are setting the stage for even longer-term growth by investing in Africa, which we see as an important market for Cummins over the next decade and beyond. Much like we did in India and China in the 1970s and 80s, we are committed to establish a strong presence across Africa early in its economic development.  Another of the global trends benefiting Cummins today that will continue to drive growth in the future is the tightening of emission standards around the world. As we are already seeing in North America, more stringent emissions standards played to Cummins' strength as a technology leader. This is true both for engines and critical components such as exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems and turbochargers. As new emissions standards are introduced for both the on-highway and off-highway markets around the world over the next several years, our Engine and Components segments will benefit significantly.  We will see increased sales of our engines and greater Cummins component content in both our engines and those made by our OEM customers. Our performance over the past years put us ahead of the growth plans we shared with you in March of 2010. We will update our long-term targets at our analyst day conference in September, once we have shared them with the Board of Directors.  I can tell you, however, that I am extremely bullish on the long-term future of the company. The work we have done over the past 2.5 years has created more global and more productive company. We entered the global economic recovery in the best financial shape in the company's history. 1 sign of our confidence and of our commitment to creating shareholder value was our decision in February to authorize an additional $1 billion in share repurchases. We repurchased $190 million worth of stock in the first quarter. As further evidence of our confidence in the future, we plan to revisit the topic of sustainable dividend growth with the board this summer.  Finally, we have the strategic plans and the leadership in place to take advantage of the significant opportunities in front of us. I'm confident that you will see a period of accelerated profitable growth from Cummins over the next several years.  Now Tom will provide more details about our plans for the rest of 2011, as we work to capture our immediate growth opportunities.
N. Linebarger: Thanks, Tim. I want to start this morning by echoing Tim's comments on our terrific first quarter results. Sales were significantly higher than the first quarter of 2010 and held up well compared to our record results in the fourth quarter, despite the typical seasonality in our first quarter volumes. Our gross margin of 24.8% in the first quarter was a full percentage point better than the fourth quarter and its highest level more than 10 years. Similarly, EBIT margins of 13.8% exceeded the fourth quarter and were a modern record for the company.  We'll share our updated guidance for this year in a few minutes. But I did want to say that our performance in the first quarter, especially in terms of profitability, was stronger than we had expected and has improved our outlook for the rest of the year. For Cummins, the recovery appears to have arrived, and the growth opportunities that we began preparing for during the downturn are clearly in front of us. We are now focused squarely on making the most of these significant short- and long-term growth opportunities. For 2011, that means being ready to meet large demand increases in many of our markets, including in the United States where we are already starting to see the recovery in the commercial truck and bus markets. Both our heavy-duty and midrange engines are performing well. Reliability is the best we've delivered in any recent launch, and the few economy improvement that we predicted are being realized by our customers. Cummins share of the 2011 purchases by the big U.S. trucking fleets remains very high. We expect to receive nearly 60% share of the medium-duty orders and 40% share of the heavy-duty orders from the top 200 fleet customers.  Significant orders include Warner, U.S. Express, Stevens Transport, Con-way TL, Penske Truck Leasing, Swift, Melton, Halliburton, Old Dominion, BJ Services and Waste Management. After a period of widely fluctuating demand in late 2008 through last year, we anticipate that 2011 will be the beginning of a period of sustained growth in our truck engine markets in the U.S. Demand is growing in other markets as well, and our focus is turned toward increasing capacity in key plants in our Engine and Components businesses ahead of the demand.  And we need to do this while holding on to as many of the efficiencies we have gained over the past 18 months as possible. This will be a challenge considering the speed with which demand is returning, but the operational improvements we made during the downturn are allowing us to ramp up more quickly and more efficiently than in previous recovery cycles. For example, average daily build rates at our heavy-duty engine plant in Jamestown, New York are expected to be 35% higher in the second quarter than they were in the first quarter and more than double what they were a year earlier. At our turbocharger plant in Charleston, we have moved up the opening of an additional assembly line from the fourth quarter to the second quarter to meet the increasing demand. The Charleston plant produces turbos for heavy- and medium-duty truck markets, and volumes are expected to increase 25% in the second quarter and remain high for the foreseeable future.  I also just returned from a week in Europe where I visited nearly all of our operations there. As you know, we have a broad manufacturing base in the U.K. where we make engines, generator sets and components for markets across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Production has increased at all of our U.K. plants, and we have invested additional capacity in high horsepower engines and turbochargers there. At each of our plants and technical centers that I visited, we held reviews focused on the same topic, namely ramping up production quickly, while maintaining the productivity and cost improvements we gained during the downturn. Our U.K. plants aren't alone in seeing increased volumes. We are working on projects to increase production and engineering capacity across nearly all of our businesses over the next 2 or 3 years.  Here are just a few examples. We're investing $50 million in our Power Generation operations in Fridley, Minnesota that will add engineering support, production capacity and office space over the course of this year. In Seymour, Indiana, work is on schedule to add manufacturing and engineering capacity to develop a new high horsepower engine, which will extend the upper end of our power edge. This is the first completely new high horsepower engine platform for Cummins in 30 years.  In Turkey, new filtration generator technology plants will be up and running in the next 2 years as part of a larger facility being planned in Izmir. Similar cross business complexes are underway in both India and Brazil. In India, we dedicated the first 3 of 10 manufacturing plants at our new complex in January, including a second manufacturing plant for our Tata Cummins JV that will increase capacity by as much as 90,000 engines a year. In Brazil, we will invest more than $100 million over the next 5 years to upgrade our current manufacturing facilities and to launch a second location that will house Power Generation and Filtration manufacturing plants, as well as the Parts Distribution Center.  And in China, we are increasing capacity at our Dongfeng Cummins joint venture by 50,000 engines this year. Already in this efforts though go beyond making sure we have adequate manufacturing capacity in advance of demand. As we've discussed in recent quarters, we are investing heavily in terms of talent and resources to create a globally capable supply chain that operates effectively across all our businesses. For more than a year now, we have been working to ensure that we have adequate supplier capacity to meet our production needs in every region of the world. This supplier capacity work has been critical to our ability to ramp up production and to meet rising demand.  We also recognize that customer support is going to be increasingly important to our success in the future. We are continuing our customer support excellence programs to make further improvements at our customer facing processes that will make us easier to do business with. We are increasing the use of customer-focused Six Sigma where we use our talented people and our Six Sigma tools to help our customers increase revenue or lower costs in their businesses.  For example, we worked with PACCAR, a Cummins partner and 1 of our most important customers to improve its ordering process with Cummins Emission Solutions plant in Wisconsin. The result was a 50% reduction lead time for parts coming from the Wisconsin plant and a corresponding reduction in inventory for PACCAR. In addition, we have expanded our service coverage for on-highway truck customers in China. We have tripled the number of service locations across the country that create a customer contact center designed specifically to help our on-highway customers in China. This model will be the basis for future customer support efforts in other end markets in China. Before I turn it over to Pat to discuss the details of our first quarter results, I would like to say a few words on the recent events in Japan. First, I want to commend our employees in Japan for their response to this tragedy. We are extremely fortunate that all of our people in Japan are safe. I'm personally grateful to them as they work virtually around-the-clock to ensure that our customers and partners in Japan are well supported despite extremely difficult personal circumstances.  Second let me just talk about the supply situation from Japan. Cummins has a number of suppliers in Japan though most of them are Tier 2 or Tier 3 suppliers. While many of them have been affected in some way, the disruption to our business in the first quarter was minimal. We have set up a dedicated cross functional team to identify and resolve all potential supply issues resulting from the disruptions in Japan. This team has been working for weeks and has been issuing daily reports to my leadership team. More importantly, they have already resolved dozens of potential delays and shortages and are actively working on the remaining issues.  While it is likely that we will have some supply delays in future quarters, we do not expect the impact of any of these delays to be long-lasting or material at this point. The situation in Japan is dynamic especially given the continuing aftershocks and potential power disruptions, so we will continue to actively manage this area. Now here's Pat.
Patrick Ward: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenues were $3.9 billion, an increase of 56% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth across all regions and all 4 business segments. U.S. sales, which represented 39% of our first quarter revenues were up 70% from a year ago as a result of stronger demand from our on-highway markets. International sales increased by 48% from a year ago with significant growth in China, India, Brazil and Europe through increased demand in the construction, mining, power generation and truck markets. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, sales were down 7%. However, as we commented in our previous call, the first quarter was shorter than the fourth quarter of last year by 2 weeks, so the actual weekly run rate of revenue improved across all 4 businesses.  Gross margins improved to 24.8% of sales with stronger volumes, good operating leverage and some pricing improvements offsetting the expected cost increases from warranty and material costs. Selling, admin and research and development costs were up $91 million from last year as we ramped up spending in some critical areas most notably in our investment in research and development, which increased by 40%. Joint venture income of $96 million was 26% higher than a year ago with continuing growth ranging from joint ventures in China, India, as well as through our North American distributors. Earnings before interest and tax were $532 million, doubled the amount we reported last year and reached 13.8% of sales. Compared to a record fourth quarter performance and despite the lower revenues this quarter, EBIT was virtually flat and increased as a percent of sales. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.75 compared to $0.75 from a year ago. Now moving on to the operating segments, let me give some more details on the first quarter performance, as well as the revised guidance for the full year. In the Engine segment, first quarter sales were $2.4 billion, up 68% from the prior year as North American markets begin to improve. The increase in North America is a result of improving economic conditions, as well as a depletion of transition engine inventory bought in advance of the 2010 emission change. We also experienced strong year-over-year growth from emerging market infrastructure spending, particularly for construction equipment in China and from commodity extraction worldwide for mining and oil and gas. Segment EBIT more than doubled from last year to a record $290 million or 12.1% of sales. This increase was driven by strong operating leverage with the increased volumes, positive price realization and higher joint venture income offsetting commodity cost inflation and higher warranty costs related to the increase in demand from new engines. As a result of the strong start for the year and our updated outlook, we are increasing both revenue and profit guidance for the Engine segment. Revenues are now forecasted to be up 35% over last year due to the strong recovery in the U.S. truck market and increased demand for our products in the construction, mining and oil and gas markets in particular.  Our commodity cost will continue to act as a headwind this year and warranty cost will increase, as we see more of our next year products as we go through this year. The higher volume and continued strong operating leverage is now projected to reach an EBIT in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% of sales. Moving on to the Power Generation segment. First quarter revenue is $795 million, an increase of 54% over the prior year. Sales were up in virtually every region with significant growth in particular in Europe, the Middle East, India and in Latin America. Segment EBIT was $89 million or 11.2% of sales compared to $34 million or 6.6% of sales last year. Our stronger volumes and operating leverage, along with some price improvements, more than offset commodity cost inflation. The increasing demand for products and services is being driven by infrastructure spending in the emerging markets and commodity-related demand globally. Demand in North America and Europe has started to recover, and we now expect revenue for the Power Gen segment to be up 20% over last year with EBIT margins of between 11% and 12% of sales. In the Components segment, first quarter revenues was a record $924 million, an increase of 47% over the prior year. Revenue improved across all businesses within the Components segment driven by strong recovery in North America and Europe, as well as in our Aftermarket business and through higher product content in North America on 2010 emissionized product. China and India also showed strong growth during this period.  Segment EBIT was a record $105 million or 11.4% of sales compared to $57 million or 9% of sales last year. The year-over-year improvement was driven by strong operating leverage, increased content on EPA '10 engines and productivity improvements. As a result of improved demand and stronger operating leverage, we are now forecasting the Components segment revenue to be up 35% for the year and profitability for the full year will be between 11% and 12% of sales.  In the Distribution segment, first quarter revenue was $642 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the Distribution segment had organic growth of 27% over the first quarter of last year. Driving this growth were oil and gas markets in North and in Central America, increased Power Generation sales in Europe and the Middle East and stronger parts and service demand.  Segment EBIT was a record $89 million or 13.9% of sales. This is an increase of 24% over the prior year as a result of the higher volumes and increased joint venture income. Also, last year we recorded a onetime gain of $12 million as a result of the consolidation of Cummins Western Canada. As a result of improving demand for industrial engines and Power Generation products we now forecast that revenue for the segment will be up 25% this year, and EBIT will be between 12% and 14% of sales. So as we look at the full year outlook for the company, we now expect revenues to grow on course to 30% this year and reach $17 billion with earnings before interest and tax of 14% of sales. As we discussed on our last call, our strong balance sheet allows for the strategic investments and increased capital expenditures necessary to achieve a period of sustained profitable growth.  In the first quarter, we invested $91 million in capital expenditure projects, almost double the amount from a year ago with most of this targeted on the new product development and investing in capacity ahead of demand. We expect to invest between $600 million and $650 million for the full year. In addition to this, we expect our unconsolidated joint ventures will invest more than $300 million in capital expenditure projects, most of which is targeted at increasing our capacity. During the quarter, the company repurchased almost 3 million shares at the cost of $190 million. And as we reported in the 10-K, we completed the $500 million program announced in 2007 and have begun the repurchasing of shares under the new $1 billion program announced in February. We also announced our intention to sell the exhaust and our light-duty Filtration businesses, both of which are within the Components segment. The guidance at the right of the day considers only ongoing operations and excludes any onetime gain from the sale of these businesses. Now before we open the teleconference to questions, I would like to inform you of a transition within our Investor Relations function. As most of you know, Dean Cantrell has been moving the Investor Relations functions for the past 6 years. Dean has been terrific in his role representing Cummins extremely well with investors and with Wall Street analysts, and I know many of you in the call today will share those sentiments. He has been outstanding ambassador for the company in this role, and we are all very appreciative of what he has done. Over the next few months, Dean will be transitioning into a leading finance position within 1 of our business units.  With that said, I am very pleased to announce that Mark Smith will be taking on the Investor Relations leadership role. Mark has been with Cummins for 15 years and has experience in the Power Generation business, the Engine segment, the corporate finance group, the Filtration business and for the last 5 years has been the finance leader for the Components segment. His knowledge of so many parts of the company, as well as being a strong leader in the finance function made him an excellent choice to take over in Investor Relations.  Now let us open the call to your questions.
Dean Cantrell: Thank you, Pat. [Operator Instructions] Alicia, we're now ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Tom, can you say more about the drivers of the sequential margin improvement in Components, perhaps comment by product line? And also, can you talk about what specific parts of the supply chain you're monitoring closely across your business at this point?
N. Linebarger: Okay. Well, let me talk about the supply chain. I'll let Pat say a little bit more about the margins in Components. In the supply chain, essentially for every 1 of our major products that we've identified who are the key suppliers in terms of especially those operations, which take longer time to build up adequate capacity. So there's a lead time to build up capacity and there's an investment to make. And so each of our purchasing groups, each have a list of the suppliers. And as I mentioned about a little over a year ago, we then said we want each of them to go and start having frequent communication with those the suppliers. Where necessary, we made commitments or investments, and we have then follow-ups, regular follow-ups with them to make sure we're adding capacity at the right rate. Lately, we've been spending a fair bit of time in the high horsepower arena making sure some of our key component suppliers can keep up. That's been an area that, as you probably noticed in our business, has ramped up very quickly and so we're making sure we have adequate capacity. But those same lists and those same activities go across the Components businesses, while there's key suppliers in Fuel Systems and turbochargers and emission solutions in exactly the same way. I made the comment I did about Japan because we set up a separate task force just for that because there, we're dealing with mostly, well really almost all Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers. So these are suppliers that we normally don't have a direct relationship with in terms of making sure they have capacity. But now we are taking that process back a tier to make sure that, that's also true.
Patrick Ward: So, Jerry, on the question on Components I think there's 2 factors there. First of all, clearly the increased volume and more content that we're putting on engines now has been a driver for the increased profit from the segment. But more significantly, I think given the comments we've had in the last 2 calls where we expressed a little bit of disappointment with profitability of the Components segment, you'll recall they did 8% profit in Q3, they did 9% in Q4. I think part of that was around productivity in a couple of the businesses, notably the Travel business and the Filtration business. And we said that by the end of the year, we expected to be through those issues and we are. So that's why I think you see the Components margin spike up to 11% as quick as what it has.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And, Pat, do you feel comfortable with no productivity issues as you ramp up about the Emission Solutions part of the business?
Patrick Ward: I feel very confident that the Emission Solutions business will do very well as we ramp up the volume.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And lastly on your EPA 2010 product lineup, can you talk about where your cash warranty payments are running today relative to your accrual rates or if you can comment on that directionally, if you don't feel comfortable showing specific numbers, that would be helpful. Thanks, Pat.
Patrick Ward: You'll see some more in the 10-Q when we file it but payments are running below the actual rates just now. 1 of the areas that we are seeing an improvement compared to 3 months ago is a full year forecast for warranty. We expect to be closer to 3.2% I think we said it was to be closer to 3.6% for the full year. So recognizes the confidence that we have that the new products are performing well, performing better than before we have anticipated, and I think that will be realizing the margin in the quarters to come.
T. Solso: And, Jerry, I think it's worth noting I mentioned the reliability of our launch being the best we've had. And I think that's what you're seeing in those numbers. We're not done yet. It's early an update. We make sure we keep focus on this. We don't count our chickens yet. But our returns so far in terms of how we've seen the numbers come in and what kind of issues we're facing look really good. So we're feeling very good about it. And of course, that helps our warranty payment but more importantly, it helps our customers. They see our product is performing better in the field. Reliability really matters to them. We think it's going to help our volumes and market share as well as warranty. So it's a really good situation for us to from the 2010 launch point of view. We feel very good about it.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG: Quick question, of course, I have to ask the question on guidance. This quarter you put up a 13.8% margin, you're guiding to 14% for the year. I guess I struggle with the number. Was there anything unusual in Q1 that helped you? Or are there any sort of headwinds in the back half of the year that I don't appreciate? Because I'm just thinking, when I look at your volumes in the back half of the year whether it's heavy-duty, medium-duty truck, even components, I would think your volumes should be accelerating based on just what you said about shipments last quarter. So can you help me on that? And then, Pat, how do we think about the elimination line for 2011? Because I'm just trying to square your guidance by, your margin guidance by segment with the margin guidance for the total company.
Patrick Ward: Well, let me take that 1 Jamie and then Tom can jump in if he wants to. I think there are certainly no unusual items in the first quarter. It was a very clean quarter from the results perspective. As we said before and as I said in my earlier remarks, we do expect warranty rates to increase as we go through the year and ship more 2010 product. That's probably the most significant factor in looking at the 14% guidance for the full year versus 13.8% in Q1. Most of that will impact the Engine business more than any of the other 3 segments. With regards to the eliminations in terms of guidance for that, I expect that inventory will continue to grow as we go through the year. And therefore, the eliminations from a sales perspective we can run around 20%. And from our profit an EBIT perspective, I'd expect elimination you see in Q1. I wouldn't expect that run rate for the full year. I would expect it to be negative but still down from the first quarter number.
Jamie Cook - Crédit Suisse AG: Great, yes. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. I wonder if Tom have anything to add.
T. Solso: Yes. So, Jamie, I don't really have much to add. I think Pat's got it right. We don't see anything particularly negative going the rest of the year. We're looking at increasing volumes, which accrues the margin. We are having seeing some slight negative to material cost. I think we've said about 0.3% hit as material cost continue to rise. Again, we're offsetting that in the Power Gen business with price. But we're not getting -- so that's just kind of keeping us even for the year. We're not really gaining much on price during the year. So we kind of forecasted with the warranty increasing and a slight headwind on commodity costs, some increase in margin based on the volume. But maybe again, some slight negative in terms of incremental margin, but not much. It's still a good incremental margin. We're still feeling pretty good about that forecast.
James Corridore - S&P Equity Research: All right. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer from Wolfe Trahan.
Timothy Denoyer: A quick question on North American market share. You gave some pretty impressive numbers with the 60% of medium duty and 40% of heavy duty with the top 200 fleet. There's certainly a lot of talk about shipping down 13 liter, but a lot of truckers seem to be very loyal. Is there any change to your overall guidance in terms of you've talked about sort of a low 30s percent in terms of the overall heavy duty? And I think it's 50% in medium?
T. Solso: Yes, Tim. We have talked about being 50% or possibly even better this year in medium duty in North America. And with regards to the heavy-duty Class 8 Group II, and after we've talked about a 36% market share for the full year. So those are consistent, I think, to what we talked about last quarter. We did take our market outlook up for the Class 8 Group II and all that particular market share, our market numbers are included in the presentation that's out there. So we are now seeing a 211,000 unit market on Class 8 Group II for NAFTA.
Timothy Denoyer: Got you. Thanks. And then on Power Gen, can you give a sense of the backlog there and any potential capacity constraints? Any benefit in that segment relative to Japan?
T. Solso: Yes. So backlogs are not they're pretty middle for us, pretty normal for us now. We're not in a significant backlog situation. But we're not where we were a couple of years ago either, too, where there's normal -- our backlogs were emptied out because its demand was falling. So we're in a position of increasing demand rather than decreasing, but backlogs are kind of that normal sort of lead time levels now in most markets. There was some extended lead times on large generators sets for a period of time. We've worked most of those down to pretty normal levels again as a result of increases in capacity. So we're feeling pretty good about that. You asked also about Japan and what I'd say about Japan is there are increased opportunities. We are actively trying to help our, obviously, our suppliers and partners with any kind of emergency power we can provide. And we're, of course, generally providing power in the market. There are very strict rules in Japan that are unique to that country. So 1 of the challenges for us and other providers of power or standby power there is you have to change your equipment or modify your equipment to meet Japanese standards. There are -- so that just takes a bit more time but we are doing that. And we have several partners we're working with on that. And we are providing -- we do see that as a potential improvement in our forecast in the rest of the year.
Timothy Denoyer: Okay. Great. And just overall, what is an average lead time just, I mean, can you give me a rough estimate worldwide is it 3, 6 months?
T. Solso: Yes, for which products? For the large ones or small ones?
Timothy Denoyer: Both.
T. Solso: So I'd say on the small ones, you might typically run something like it depends on the region but say anywhere from 4 weeks to 10 weeks, and on the large ones you might run anywhere from 10 to 16 depends on kind of which product. And again, they have been out in previous cycles where they're really sold out you'll go to 6 months or longer for a large 1. And that's why I said when we're back in our kind of 16 weeks or less kind of number is when we start to feel like we're now right at what the market demand is. Because most people since they're usually part of a construction project of some kind there's some sort of lead time, which is within the lead time of all the other things they have to do. And therefore, it isn't really the critical task.
Timothy Denoyer: Got it. If I can sneak 1 more in. What's your opinion on solid-state SCR for long-term Emission Solutions?
T. Solso: We are actually, we think it's a technology that may have promise. It's a technology that we've evaluated. We spent significant effort reviewing it. We actually have met the providers and talked with them technically about the opportunities there. At this stage, it's too costly and not ready to be used in the market. Again, there may be promise to it especially in applications where finding SCR or refilling SCR's difficult or challenging. You could imagine in a case where you're maybe far from road transport or something and therefore, it's hard to keep our store. Or a situation where it's not SCR is not widely available for whatever set of reasons. But right now, it's an interesting technology that's just not ready or not cost effective.
Timothy Denoyer: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Morgan Stanley.
Robert Wertheimer - Morgan Stanley: I guess just a couple questions. Just out of curiosity the high horsepower, are you anticipating that there could be a capacity crunch either for the industry or for you guys later in the year? I mean, with mining trucks booming and then electric power's been pretty good, I think in oil and gas maybe headed back up. You guys benefited from that last cycle. Are you able to say how much room you have for the upside? And out of curiosity on new platform, what exactly that's targeting?
N. Linebarger: Yes. I mean high horsepower has already been capacity constrained in this up cycle already for the industry, I mean. It's already been an issue. As I mentioned lead times went out for a while. So we're now getting our lead times back into where we want them to be, and that just tells you that since we're just now doing it, its tight right -- there's no question about it. We're working hard and a lot of it is in the supply base, which is why I mentioned the efforts we've been putting in there to make sure we have enough supplier capacity to make sure we can meet customer requirements, and I do believe that in the industry, those providers who are more -- ramp up more quickly, complete lead times at reasonable levels, will do better from a market share point of view than those that get stuck from a capacity point of view. So I guess my feeling is if markets continue on their certain trend, it will stay tight. And we're going to work really hard to make sure we're the 1 that has good lead times, as well as best products and best quality. So I think it's going to be tight for some time.
Robert Wertheimer - Morgan Stanley: And what enabled you to bring your lead times in because I didn't fully follow. Was it supplier side than it was factory optimization or capacity you added?
T. Solso: Exactly. We're doing both as you've guessed. But in this period, the biggest issue was getting suppliers ramped up as opposed to assembly capacity.
Timothy Denoyer: That's perfect. And the new high horsepower platform, is that a particular -- I don't know if you can give the horsepower range or if that's out yet or not, I didn't remember it. And then what end market if 1 in particular it's targeting?
T. Solso: Yes, we have not yet released information on its actual power range. We've said it's higher than our current products. We are definitely targeting power gen and large industrial markets. So you probably know those markets we serve today -- oil and gas, marine, et cetera. We'll be targeting those markets. So same end markets as we provide today and just larger power range. And expect natural gas and diesel kind of as we're doing with most of our product line today.
Timothy Denoyer: That was my follow-up. Thank you very much. That's perfect.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc.: Turning to look at to '12 a little bit. I mean, right now at least near term it's not a question of demand, it's a question of supply. So when you think about your capacity '12 versus '11, with all the things in motion, obviously [indiscernible] you mentioned now came off a couple of weeks ago. The investment store are still ongoing in China. But when you add it all up, and I know it's hard to generalize across Power Gen and a variety of business segments, but how are you thinking about your capacity addition full year '12 versus '11?
T. Solso: That will be greater.
N. Linebarger: Yes, very much.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc.: Obviously, the Power Gen -- that is a significant step up in capacity. The Tata, pretty material obviously, the China on the smaller leader so I mean is it...
T. Solso: You just haven't added it up, Dave. I totally get your question and not to be glib, we are definitely seeing an increase, and we're trying to think through as I mentioned in my remarks several years ahead to make sure we've got a capacity ramp up plan across each of our businesses and regions to meet the demand. And then of course, since we do a lot of intercompany supply, a lot of it is making sure that we're aligned between our companies on how much capacity we need. So the turbocharger plant has to be aligned with the Engine plants that it serves and with the generator set plant that it's serving. So that kind of alignment in addition to trying to make sure we're hitting the end market right is what we are targeting. We have a process by which we lay out our future capacity requirements for 5 years. Of course, as you guessed the year or 2 out is a lot better than beyond that, but we look at it long run that way anyway and we line up all those. We do that process every year in June with an update in September before we put together, start put together our plan. So we'll do that for several years out here in June, and we'll be able to look for 2012 and beyond. We did that last year, of course, so we had a view about what we needed to add in 2012. I just can't say based on all the adjustments we've made what the percentage increase would be 2012 or 2011 yet.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc.: I can ask in a different way. I mean, it sounds like you're very confident in how you're planning your CapEx demands going to be there. Can we try to think through the individual line items?
T. Solso: Yes.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc.: Where are the areas from suppliers you spoken to, from machine tooling, whatever it may be. When I look out to '12 and you have a bullish view on '12 demand. Where are the end markets, your business segments where you're most constrained to add as much capacity for '12 as you like?
T. Solso: I don't think there's any that we feel we're constrained.
N. Linebarger: Yes.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc.: Okay. So it's under of your control how much capacity you'd like to add and your suppliers can provide it for you?
T. Solso: Yes, I would just say from a historical standpoint, our capacity planning is much more thorough and robust right now. And the attitude in the past has been to have the capacity when we saw the demand we put the capacity in, and so we would have spikes where we were on allocation or on long lead times. And the approach now and has been really for the last year is to put in that capacity ahead of demand, and so we don't have those spikes that we've talked about and therefore, I think we have much better control. As Tom said, usually in the past we would look at our manufacturing capacity. Now we're looking to the supply chain all the way in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc.: Last quick 1, more on near term. On Distribution, the margin degradation that you have guided the full year to from the first quarter, when I think of how significant JV income is to Distribution business and most of that Distribution JV income is domestic. And I think about it as Power Gen, obviously parts and Filtration products and so forth for truck. It wouldn't seem to be a business that would feel much margin degradation that the rest of the year. Maybe I don't appreciate how the warranties flow through the distributors, but can you help us understand why the margins [indiscernible]...
N. Linebarger: It's simple, David. Business is good through the year. What we're expecting is because we think the whole goods section of business is going to grow, that's the Power Gen part and the Engine business. That from a mix point of view, we get a deterioration of margin. It's still great business so margin dollars and all that stuff looks great. It's just that if you look at the percentage EBIT, parts make a higher margin percentage than the whole goods do. So we just get a mix decrease. We just have quite a bit a pretty high mix of parts in the first quarter, and we think it will just be a little bit higher whole goods as we go the rest of the year.
David Raso - ISI Group Inc.: Understood. Helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes on the line of Henry Kirn from UBS.
Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank: It's Eric Crawford on for Henry. Getting back to your margin profile, it was just touched upon by a couple of different people. But you took up your Power Gen and your Distribution revenue guidance but maintained the EBIT margin outlook. So was just wondering if you could give a little more color on how you expect the mix in Distribution that you just touched on and price cost in Power Gen, how you expect those to trend throughout the year.
Patrick Ward: I'll start and then Tom can jump in. The Distribution did well. We are going to see a mix driven towards the whole good part of the business away from the aftermarket parts and service, which will dampen down the EBIT margins. At the same time, we're also going to continue to ramp up our investments in Distribution to make sure we'll grow a good platform around the world to support customers. So you should expect to see higher SCR spending Distribution as we go forward through the rest of the year than what you've seen in the first quarter. With regards to Power Gen, Power Gen first quarter was 11.2% of sales. We've given guidance in the range of 11% to 12%, so I would expect power gen if you just take the midpoint that would suggest they would be a little bit better as we go through the year and see more volumes come through. We do expect pricing to be a little bit better than material costs for the segment as we go through the year. But not significantly. I think pricing look at maybe in a range of 1.5% and material cost slightly below that.
Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank: But sorry, so the pricing will be a little bit better towards the end of the year?
Patrick Ward: Yes, we will have more pricing in Power Gen as we go through the year.
Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank: Excellent. And if I could another, you highlighted growth from Tata Cummins in India and was wondering if you could talk about the opportunity from that business in 2011 and beyond.
T. Solso: Yes. So Tata Cummins, that joint venture is the primary supplier now to Tata trucks for their on-highway, on-road truck trucks that serve the Indian market. So we started that joint venture many, many years ago it started with a relatively low share. We're now running at shares between 70% and 80% of the Tata trucks we'll have 1 of our engines in there. And so what our primary driver of growth out of that joint venture has been and will be that the Indian truck market, which is expanding significantly as they add roads and infrastructure across the country. So that's the primary driver that this year looks good, the outlook is good and the long-term outlook is also very, very good as road infrastructure gets built. In addition, though we are now because we are limited on capacity for a while. As we increase capacity, we also have the opportunity to use that joint venture as a source for engines that we can supply elsewhere in the world and other markets both on-highway and off-highway. It's a very competitive cost and very good quality engine and so we're going to start, Cummins is going to start taking Engines out in joint venture to use in other markets too which will again, allow us to grow more generally as a company.
Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank: That's helpful. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: A lot has been asked. Just a couple of detailed points, if I could. I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you remind me what the warranty accrual cost was in the quarter?
T. Solso: 2.9% of sales.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thanks. And then for China, still going very strong in a lot of your businesses. Do you have any updated outlook maybe, and if you have said it already, I apologize, for what you expect for the year?
T. Solso: We haven't talked about it. We still expect overall growth in our China markets and as really our outlook hasn't changed a lot from a broad point of view, meaning that we still see while some of the end markets may be flat to slightly up, slightly down our growth is going to continue because we are adding new, we have new markets that we're going into and we're getting share in a few spots. But that's the broad. So that hasn't really changed. If you get a little bit more focused now, you may have heard the truck market, many people expect the second half to be weaker than the first half. So our first quarter was actually quite good, maybe even a little better than we thought. But there's some sentiment that it will decrease, and there's end user or end market inventory in the truck part [ph] -- that dealers are holding more truck inventory now than they've held historically, which is why people are wondering about that. It remains to be seen, right? So we've been worried about that for some time, and it still continues to grow. So we just don't know about that part, but there's some I think reasonable likelihood that the market will be weaker in the second half than the first half. That will still probably put it at about equal year-over-year or maybe slightly down or slightly up just as we originally anticipated. Construction markets have been consistently strong. We, in fact, we expected some drop off after last year given how strong construction markets were last year. But they absolutely boomed, continue to boom in the first quarter and we see them continuing at least through the first half of the year. And then we'll keep our eyes open, but nothing on the horizon that says they're going to stop insignificantly at this stage.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thanks a lot, Tom.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.
Unknown Analyst - : Dan [ph] for Ann, JPMorgan. Just had a quick question. Most of my questions have been answered, but around your off-highway industrial Engine segment -- performed very well, and I think at Slide 10 it says you guys won a share in the oil and gas end market. And I was hoping you could provide more color there and is that sustainable? Thanks.
N. Linebarger: Sorry, I'm just getting over a cold. The oil and gas market, not only do we think it's sustainable. We kind of think we're just starting in oil and gas. So we are definitely seeing that as an end market that Cummins is going to continue to expand in and we are putting significant effort in doing so. We are obviously far from the largest player in that market so although we are expanding, there are others who are much, much larger than we are. But we are, especially in Well Servicing, we have a good position that we are using to expand into other segments of the business. What I'd say most is the market's growing. There may be some small share gains here and there, but the biggest benefit to us has been that the market is growing and we are growing the number of relationships we have. And our product line is expanding so we have more to offer. Those are the biggest changes in the market and those are continuing.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from Buckingham Research Group.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Can you give us a sense of what's changed so dramatically in your emerging markets business to allow all that capacity? Because you guys are crying at the beginning of the year, you're out of capacity, you don't have much and now looking at 25% and 30% growth.
Patrick Ward: I think at the start of the year, Joel, we said we expected India to grow around 25% and now we're seeing 30%; and China to grow 20% and now we're seeing 25% or 26%. So we did always think that the emerging markets would grow in 2011, we're just growing a little bit faster than what we thought 3 months ago.
T. Solso: Yes, I think context-wise, Joel, of the ones that I've listed in my remarks at the capacity increases -- the ones in the emerging markets were on those were unchanged from our original plan. So some of the ones we've had to speed up like, for example, the Charleston Turbo plant, some of the Power Gen stuff has been driven less by those emerging markets than they have by other markets. So I think while we are expanding some things faster than we planned, those big emerging market ones -- the Tata Cummins and the Dongfeng Cummins were exact on the docket. They're exactly the same projects we had in place when we talked to you about our guidance for the year.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And structurally, can you give us a sense of what's changing in your Engine business? When you gave us your long-term margins way back they were 10%. Now you're hitting new highs. Is it pricing? Is it the capacity that you're adding that's more efficient? Can you just give us a little flavor for what's shifting under the covers?
N. Linebarger: So I think that's a question better answered in our Investor Day when we get a chance to look long-term perspective because we gave your comment, I think is about structure is the 1 that take some historical and future perspective to answer properly. There's no question that our outlook today is stronger than our outlook was then, and part of it was just understanding some of the changes that have happened and trying to figure out what's going to happen with those in the future. So I think it's a question better answered with that kind of a long-term perspective. Obviously, though we are as you've said, feeling like our outlook is stronger.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Elias from Sterne Agee.
Ben Elias - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Thanks. Just a couple of follow-up questions. You did mention that your second quarter heavy-duty truck production would be up about 35% versus first quarter, is that correct?
T. Solso: Yes, in Jamestown.
Ben Elias - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay. In Jamestown. But the company on average, you're averaging about $330 million to $350 million. Would that be accurate? Are you close to 4Q '09 levels and when do you think you're going to be above that $400 million a day run rate?
T. Solso: So Ben, are you asking more specifically to the heavy-duty business or all Engine?
Ben Elias - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: The heavy-duty first.
T. Solso: Yes. We're looking at, Ben, about Q4. Versus Q4 '09, yes, Q2 '11 would look like it would be at a higher per day build rate.
Ben Elias - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: So it would be above $400 million then?
T. Solso: Yes.
Ben Elias - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay. Second question I was wondering if you could update us similar to sort of what Andy was looking for update us on production rates in China at least at your facilities, the ramp up at Foton? What’s in the sequential change or where you think you are on that light duty side?
T. Solso: When you're a number in Foton our we were delayed about a year off our original plant. We set a target this year for volumes, and I think we'll be close. Whether we'll make it all the way or not, I'm not sure. But we were close to our target volume this year. We're still struggling hard in the light-duty segment. This is the minivan and that segment to get our Engine, which is newer, better technology and increase the uptake and the end market in China. So it's still work for us to be done. We are obviously making some progress because volumes are increasing, but we'd like to be making more. So I think our challenge remains to work with our partner Foton to build demand for higher quality, more reliable, more durable product in that low end segment. In the high end segments, the move is sort of ongoing and going fast. In a low end segments, it still a tougher sloug [ph]. So I think we'll hit our volumes it still a tough, tough deal that's probably still work in front of us.
Patrick Ward: And just to add to that, Ben, we do expect to grow volumes in all engine joint ventures in China in 2011, so just adding onto Tom's remarks.
Ben Elias - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: And Foton was about 16,000 or 17,000 last year and you're looking at about 50,000 this year.
N. Linebarger: That's correct.
Ben Elias - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: And last question. Have you found a home for your light-duty diesel Engine in the U.S.?
N. Linebarger: No. The answer is we have not found a final workable plan. As we mentioned before the updates not much new to say that we have several customers who are interested and committed to going forward. And we need to find another large 1 or another a combination of customers that puts the project into the enough of a good financial results that we go ahead and go forward. So we're kind of still on that position. We're having active discussions which are positive and have good potential outcomes, but not closed yet.
Ben Elias - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot.
T. Solso: Yes.
Dean Cantrell: Thank you, everyone. I think that's all the time we have for questions today. Both myself and Mark Smith will be available after the call. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call in at the IR line of (812) 377-3121. Thank you.

Our press release, a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today’s webcast presentation, are available on our Web site at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. With those formalities out of the way, I would like to call your attention to our 2011 Analyst Day in New York on Tuesday, September 13. Please mark the date on your calendars as we will reveal our new five-year outlook for the company. Turning back to the fourth quarter results, we will begin our remarks with our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom Linebarger.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Thank you, Dean. Good morning. I will start today by sharing some thoughts on our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Pat will then provide greater detail on the quarter and we’ll discuss our 2011 financial guidance, while Tim will talk about our longer-term priorities. As you can see from the results, we had an outstanding fourth quarter capping a very strong year for Cummins. Our revenues in the fourth quarter surpassed $4 billion for the first time and were 22% higher than the same period of 2009. Fourth quarter EBIT of $541 million or 13.1% of sales also was a quarterly record and was 41% higher than a year ago. Our Engine, Components and Distribution segments reported record sales and EBIT in the fourth quarter. All three segments also earned record EBIT for the year. Our Power Generation business, which entered the downturn later than our other businesses, also saw dramatic sales and EBIT gains in the fourth quarter and full year compared to the same periods in 2009. Cummins full year sales of $13.2 billion were 22% higher than in 2009 and our second best sales year ever. Our profit results were even stronger. Earnings before interest and taxes of $1.7 billion or 12.5% of sales were more than double what we earned in 2009 and represent our highest annual EBIT ever. We continued to return value to our shareholders in 2010 as well. In addition, to a 140% appreciation in our stock price we increased our dividend by 50% in the third quarter and repurchased $241 million in stock over the course of the year. Our financial results in 2010 were much stronger than we had expected when the year began and can be attributed primarily to two factors which we have discussed over the past few quarters. The first is the strong growth we experienced in China, India and Brazil where our markets returned in dramatic fashion after relatively brief downturns in 2009. For the fourth quarter, our sales in China were up 92% over the same period in 2009. In India, sales increased 12% from the same period a year ago but were up 37% for the full year. And in Brazil, sales grew by 30% quarter-over-quarter, as we continue to see strong growth as the leader in the medium-duty truck market. I was in China last month visiting our plants and meeting with key customers and partners. The Chinese government is clearly concerned about inflation and has taken actions to reduce credit availability as well as ramping down its fiscal stimulus. These actions are likely to have some impact on economic growth in 2011 though just how much impact is not clear. I can say that at this point, demand in China remains strong in our market segments, especially in construction where infrastructure projects continue to grow, especially in second tier cities. In my discussions, our Chinese partners confirmed their long-term growth prospects and the increased role they would like Cummins to play in that growth, both domestically and internationally. I left feeling highly confident about our growth prospects, both near-term and long-term in China. The other major contributing factor to our success in 2010 was improved productivity in our manufacturing operations around the world. The actions we took during the downturn to restructure our operations have made our plants significantly more efficient. As a result, we saw improved margins as our volumes returned in many markets. Perhaps the most satisfying aspect of our performance in 2010 was the fact that we achieved record profitability despite significant weakness in the North American on-highway markets. For the year, our heavy-duty engine shipments in North America fell 61%, while medium-duty truck and bus shipments declined 44%. Fortunately, the declines in the North American on-highway markets were more than offset by strong gains in our industrial markets, as infrastructure spending increased around much of the world. For example, in the fourth quarter, our worldwide construction sales increased 138% and mining market shipments rose 81%. I also want to take a moment to recognize the work done by our people involved in the 2010 new product launch for the U.S. market, which is going very well. At the end of last year, we had nearly 62,000 2010 EPA compliant engines in the market. The engines are performing well and our heavy-duty customers are reporting fuel economy improvements of 5% to 6% over our 2007 EGR only engines. One indication of the success of our product launch was Cummins market share of the large fleets in North America last year. Just under 50% of the trucks purchased by the top 50 fleets in 2010 were powered by our engines. Furthermore, we are expecting many of these companies to significantly increase the size of their orders in 2011 as they move from a trial mode to real, real building of their fleets. Before I talk about our specific expectations for the North American truck markets in 2011, let me give you an overview of what we see for the large global truck markets in which we participate. I’ll start with China where the combined medium and heavy-duty truck market size was 1.2 million units or roughly four times the size of comparable markets in North America. We expect sales in those markets this year to be relatively flat compared to 2010, as the next level of emissions norms is being implemented. In India, the commercial truck market, which is comparable in size to North America, is expected to grow by nearly 10% to about 350,000 units this year. In Brazil, the commercial vehicle market is forecasted to grow by 12% this year to 208,000 units. And in Europe, demand for medium duty trucks, which is our primary market, is expected to increase by 20%. Finally, we expect the U.S. heavy duty truck market to grow by 50% to nearly replacement levels of about 207,000 units in 2011. In addition, we expect to see 40% growth in the medium duty truck market to 94,000 units. The global truck market demand for this year will drive significant growth in both our engine and components businesses in 2011. Beyond the truck markets, we are also forecasting continued growth in several other segments worldwide. For example, continued infrastructure growth in emerging markets will boost our sales to the construction markets, especially across Asia and in Brazil. Mining markets should remain as strong as demand for coal, copper and iron ore is driving capacity increases. And the demand for commercial power generation products and projects is expected to increase in the U.S., Europe and Middle East led by increased spending on data centers, infrastructure and oil and gas operations. Given the growth we are seeing in these and other markets around the world, we are forecasting strong sales and earnings growth in 2011. Our sales guidance for 2011 is for revenues to be $16 billion, up 21% from 2010. We expect EBIT to be 13.5% of sales as we fully leverage the increased revenues while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities. This year will be important in setting the stage for future growth, which Tim will discuss. Our capital investment will increase significantly from 2010 with almost all of that investment going to help us increase capacity, add new products or develop new markets. Let me close by saying that we are very optimistic about our opportunities in 2011 and beyond. We have aggressive plans in place to build off the success of 2010 and to take advantage of improving markets and longer-term growth trends. I’ll now turn it over to Pat who will give you additional details about the fourth quarter as well as our guidance for 2011.
Patrick Ward: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The results we are reporting today show solid progress within every business segment and positive momentum across nearly every region. Full year revenues for the company were $13.2 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year. Earnings before interest and taxes were a record $1.7 billion or 12.5% of sales. This compares to $774 million before restructuring charges or 7.2% of sales in the previous year. Earnings per share finished at $5.28. Now let me speak specifically on the fourth quarter and provide some more details on our performance. Revenue of $4.1 billion was 22% higher than both the previous quarter and the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross margins remain strong at almost 24% of sales. While spending on selling, admin and research and development came down as a percent of sales, it did increase in dollar terms due to increased investment in research and development on growth initiatives and as a result of higher compensation accruals. Joint venture income of $90 million was 34% higher than a year ago reflecting the strength of the emerging markets. EBIT was a record $541 million or 13.1% of sales, up from 11.4% last year and up from 12.3% from the third quarter, excluding the one-time benefit from a favorable legal ruling in Brazil on the tax treatment of imports that we discussed last quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.84 and included a tax benefit of $0.09 related to the recently enacted legislation impacting the research tax credit. Moving on to the operating segments, let me highlight the performance during 2010 and in the fourth quarter and then conclude with our revenue and profitability expectations for this year. In the Engine segment, full year sales were $7.9 billion, up 23% from last year. EBIT more than tripled from $252 million or 3.9% of sales to $809 million or 10.3% of sales. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $2.5 billion, an increase of 15% over last year. Our strength in international markets offset lower demand in North America on-highway markets. Sales were 21% higher than the prior quarter. Revenue from the on-highway truck markets benefited from the depletion of EPA 10 transition engine inventory and early signs of recovery in the North American heavy duty truck market along with strong demand in the emerging markets. Revenue from Industrial Markets was also strong mainly due to elevated demand in advance of the Tier 4 emission change along with increased activity in oil and gas markets. Segment EBIT margins of 10.3% in the quarter compared to 9.7% last year with stronger volumes, pricing and higher joint venture income offsetting an increase in material costs. Compared to the third quarter, the EBIT percent was down slightly as the incremental volume benefit was offset by increased product coverage costs and higher SAR spending, particularly on research and development. In 2011 we expect a strong recovery in the North American on-highway markets that will drive a 25% increase in segment revenue with EBIT margins in the range of 10% to 11% of sales. The leverage gained from this level of additional demand will be tempered by a higher mix of EPA 10 compliant engines impacting product coverage, increased investment in new product development, higher material costs and slower growth in joint venture earnings as we invest in capacity. Moving on to the Power Generation segment. Full year sales were $2.9 billion, up 21% from last year. EBIT increased 79% to $299 million or 10.2% of sales compared to $167 million or 6.9% of sales last year. Fourth quarter revenues were $903 million up 50% from the prior year due to improving economic conditions in many global markets. The incremental volume leverage along with pricing more than offset upward pressure on commodity costs and resulted in the EBIT margin improving from 5.7% last year to 10.2%. Compared to the prior quarter, sales were up 14% driven largely by stronger demand in the U.S., the Middle East, the U.K and Western Europe. The quarter also benefited from the completion of two significant Power Generation projects in Australia and in Nigeria. Despite the stronger sales revenues EBIT margins decreased compared to the third quarter as a result of rising commodity costs, higher product coverage and increased spending on growth initiatives. For 2011, the Power Gen segment will continue to experience strong demand from overseas markets as well economic recovery in North America. We expect that revenue will increase 15% over 2010 levels with EBIT margins in the range of 11% to 12% of sales. In the Components segment, full year sales were just over $3 billion up 29% from 2009. EBIT almost tripled to a record $278 million or 9.1% of sales compared to $95 million or 4% of sales last year. Fourth quarter revenues were $918 million, an increase of 25% over the previous year, driven by stronger demand in Europe, China, India and in the global after-market business. Although North American volumes declined year-over-year due to the pre-buy activity in the fourth quarter of last year, increased product content on the EPA 10 engine models resulted in higher North America revenues. EBIT margins of 9% were down from the 10% reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. The benefits from the higher volumes were offset by some increased expense related to manufacturing operations in our Filtration and Turbocharger businesses, higher investment spending in research and development and on growth initiatives and some higher product coverage costs. Compared to the previous quarter, sales were up 19%. Revenue increased across all four businesses within this segment driven by both the depletion of EPA 10 transition engines in North America and improved demand from OEMs in Europe, China and India. The additional operating leverage, coupled with some improvement in operational efficiencies at our manufacturing plants, improved the EBIT margin to 9% of sales, up from the 8% we reported last quarter. For this year, demand is expected to increase in North America and Europe and remain strong in the emerging markets. Revenue is projected to increase 25% over 2010 levels and we expect the Components segment to deliver EBIT margins in the range of 10% to 11% of sales. Finally, in the Distribution segment, full-year sales were $2.3 billion, up 30% from last year. EBIT increased to a record $297 million or 12.8% of sales compared to $235 million or 13.2% last year. During the fourth quarter, the Distribution segment took a majority interest in our former independent Boston distributor and consolidated its operations for three months. The consolidation of Cummins Western Canada and Cummins Northeast in 2010 had a dilutive impact on EBIT of 0.4% for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues increased 44% from the prior year. Nearly half of this increase is attributable to the acquisitions of our Western Canada and Northeast distributors. EBIT margins of 11.7% were lower than last year, due to a 1% dilutive impact of the acquisitions made during 2010 and from higher spending on growth initiatives. Compared to the third quarter, sales were up 22% with notable growth in Europe, South America and the South Pacific region. European sales benefited from pre-buy activity ahead of the Tier 4 emission change. EBIT for the quarter was 11.7%, a decrease from the prior period due to product mix shifting towards whole goods and from higher SAR spending. In 2011 we expect Distribution segment revenue to increase 15%. The volume benefit will be partially offset by additional spending on strategic initiatives and we expect EBIT margins to remain in the range of 12% to 13% of sales. As Tom just mentioned, we are projecting total Cummins revenues to be $16 billion in 2011 with EBIT margins of 13.5% of sales. We expect the benefits of the incremental volume along with some pricing improvement to be partially offset by increases in spending on research and development programs and on growth initiatives, along with higher product coverage costs and increasing pressure from metal markets on our material costs. We are currently projecting our tax rate to be 30% in 2011. Finally, let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong and debt to capital was 14.4% at the end of the year and our pensions are very well funded. We generated in excess of $1 billion in cash from operating activities for the full year. Our strong balance sheet and cash position have enhanced our ability to make increased investments in research and development projects, on strategic growth initiatives and on capital expenditure programs which will lead to future profitable growth. For example, we invested $364 million in capital expenditure projects in 2010. We plan to increase the amount for capital projects to between $600 and $650 million in 2011, with almost two-thirds of the spending targeted on expanding capacity and developing new products. In addition, our unconsolidated joint ventures will invest over $300 million in capital expenditure projects, again primarily focused on capacity expansion and new products. As well as enabling increased investments in our business, our cash position has enabled us to increase our dividend by 50% last year and reduce the net shares outstanding by 1% through stock repurchases. We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through sustainable increases in our dividend as well as through stock repurchases. 2010 was a terrific year for the company and we are well positioned to take advantage of the future growth opportunities. Now before we take your questions, Tim would like to say a few words.
Theodore Solso: Thanks, Pat, and good morning. As you’ve heard from Tom and Pat discuss, the company performed well during the fourth quarter and for the entire year. To put our performance into perspective, consider the fact that our record EBIT in 2010 exceeded what we earned in our second best year of 2008 by $400 million on $1.1 billion less in sales. As a result of the actions we took during the recession, we are operating more efficiently than at any time in our history. Our performance over the past two years has set the stage for what we think is going to be an extended period of significant growth in profits. Our business is generating record profits. We also have more than $2 billion in cash and available credit and historically low debt levels. As a result, we are well positioned to make the investments necessary to capitalize on the several long-term trends that are working in our favor. As a reminder, those trends are; we expect continued significant investment in global infrastructure over the next 20 years, which will benefit most of the markets in which we compete, especially the emerging markets. The cost of energy will continue to increase as will the disparity between supply and demand for electricity in developing economies. This will benefit our Power Generation, Engine and Components businesses. The emission standards in markets around the world will become more stringent and challenging to meet over the next several years. Tighter emission standards play to our strengths as a technology leader and provide a barrier of entry for new competitors. These emission regulations will also be instrumental in the growth of our Components businesses, which provide many of the technologies that allow engines to meet the new standards. And finally, the world economy will continue to become more global. Today nearly two thirds of our business comes from outside the United States compared to 40% in 2000. We are well established in large international markets and are already making new investments in newly emerging markets, such as Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. For example, our combined consolidated and joint venture revenues in China grew from $1.7 billion in 2009 to $3.1 billion in 2010. In India, we went from $1.3 billion to $1.9 billion and in South America we grew from $900 million to $1.3 billion. As we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, we see significant profitable growth opportunities for the company. As you’ve heard from Tom, we expect our growth in China, India and Brazil to continue this year although it will moderate from the explosive growth rates we experienced in 2010. We are expanding our capacity in China and India to meet the expected demand and are pursuing new markets in both countries. In fact, I was in India two weeks ago for the dedication of the first three facilities at our new mega site location in Phaltan, where we plan to invest nearly $300 million over the next three years. This is the first time in my 40-year career that we’ve opened three plants on the same day. We also have plans to build seven more plants at this site for a total of ten. The site will allow us to significantly expand our production capacity for engines, components and generators and eventually use India as a base for exports to Asia, the Middle East and Africa. I came away from my visit more excited than ever about the opportunities in India and the region. In addition to emerging markets, we also expect the U.S. economy to gain strength this year which should benefit all our businesses. As you’ve already heard, the North American truck markets are poised to rebound which will benefit both our Engine and Components businesses. As Tom said, our SCR engines continue to perform well and are delivering the type of fuel economy improvements we’ve promised our customers. We remain convinced and the market is confirming that SCR is the right technology to meet the current emission standards in the United States and Europe and increasingly in other markets. As we’ve said over the past few quarters, we have a plan to aggressively pursue new growth opportunities even as we continue to invest in additional capacity to meet the demand for our current products. To do that, we will ramp up our investment in capital, R&D and people significantly starting this year. Our capital investment will increase by almost 75% from 2010 and our R&D spending will increase by more than 40% from last year. Cummins is going to be a larger, more complex and more global company in the future. We will prioritize our work and execute our strategy so that we can take full advantage of the opportunities ahead. That’s a much different challenge than the one we faced the last two years and in many ways a more difficult one. It’s also more exciting and we are convinced that we have the people and processes in place to continue down our profitable growth path. Our people have done an outstanding job over the past two years to keep the company strong in a very difficult economic situation and I’m extremely optimistic about our future. Thank you and we’ll take your questions now.
Dean Cantrell: Thank you, Tim. Out of consideration to others on the call I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have additional questions you’re free to rejoin the queue. Ann, we’re now ready for our first question.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Jamie Cook – Credit Suisse: Hi. Good morning.
Dean Cantrell: Good morning, Jamie.
Jamie Cook – Credit Suisse: You probably won’t be surprised by my first question. I’m trying to understand your margin guidance in Engines given the top line growth. I think it implies an 11% incremental margin, so I’m just trying to figure out if you could outline what the offsets are. I’m assuming a lot of its material costs. And what your assumptions are for pricing or putting through surcharges. And then my follow up question is on your Power Gen guidance for top line. You’re assuming 15% growth which implies revenues of $3.3 billion which is below your Q4 run rate. So that seems conservative in particular as we hear about some strength in the developed world, in particular North America. So if you could just answer those two questions.
Patrick Ward: Okay, Jamie. I’ll take a stab at the first part and then between Tom and myself, we’ll answer the second one. Yes, you’re correct. Incremental EBIT margins, for the Engine segment, we expect to be around 11% in 2011. So the components that make that up, we get about 1.5 points of benefit from the additional volume. Warranty will be up though as we introduce these new products. We have said before that we always carry higher warranty accruals in the first couple of years of launch. So warranty will increase by 1% of sales for the Engine segment. Pricing we expect to be positive, between 1% and 1.5% of sales for the segment. But we see that being offset by higher material costs of four tenths of a point. We will make increased investments in research and development and in growth initiatives, and that will cost about 1% of a headwind against the numbers, most of that being research and development. Joint venture income is relatively flat in dollar terms next year. As a percent of sales it goes down, so that drives it down by about three or four tenths of a point. So there are the four or five main drivers behind the Engine business incremental margin guidance for 2011. On Power Gen, the fourth quarter, if you look at the fourth quarter when we had $900 million sales. Keep in mind that was a 14 week quarter for the company. I think your point is still valid that there probably is still some upside if the markets do materialize as well as what we expect. But at the moment we feel the guidance of 13% growth is probably appropriate.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Jamie, the only thing I’d add to the Power Gen guidance – we definitely recovered slower there and I think we still have a relatively conservative view about a North American recovery. There’s definitely recovery in there but it’s not – we’re not bouncing back to the levels we were and the non-res construction spending assumptions are not very aggressive. So I think – we’re watching that pretty close though. I got a little bit of pressure on Tony about that. I do feel like we have some upside and I do feel like if the non-res construction spending comes back as some people are forecasting, it’s kind of a mixed bag out there about what people are saying, but if it comes back like that, we will see stronger growth in Power Gen for sure.
Jamie Cook – Credit Suisse: But while it’s not in your guidance, are you seeing any anecdotal evidence because some of the industrial companies are starting to cite that. We’re seeing some constructive ABI numbers. So I understand what you wouldn’t...
Norman Thomas Linebarger: The answer’s yes. Jamie, we are.
Jamie Cook – Credit Suisse: Can you give me an example?
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Yes. Jamie, we are. The same kind of anecdotal evidence that you are seeing. And in fact, Tony is feeling good about his order book in North America. It’s getting better. I wouldn’t say it’s – he feels all the way there, but, yes, we’re feeling better about it. And so we’ll let the first quarter run and then we’ll see where we come out. And if we are seeing better answers on North America, you’ll see us push guidance up on Power Gen for sure. And we’re watching it really closely.
Jamie Cook – Credit Suisse: All right. Thanks. I’ll get back in queue.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Okay.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Good morning.
Theodore Solso: Hi, Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Pat, for the Component segments, can you talk about your sales outlook by business? I guess considering the sharp ramp in Emission Solutions and Fuel Systems production, why wouldn’t the Components business deliver stronger sales growth than you’re looking for in Engines this year?
Patrick Ward: Yeah. Most of the growth in the Components segment we’ll see come through Emission Solutions and the Turbocharger business in 2011. The Fuel Systems business does recover as the North American top markets come back into play. The Filtration business does not recover to the same extent given that it is primarily an after-market business. So you’ve got two of the businesses really coming back strong. One growing with the top market and the other really is up 5% or 10% for the year. So that’s the mix by business, Jerry.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: And, Pat, can you say more about your incremental margin comments around the raw material piece? What are your assumptions for raw material in place? Let’s say we get this deal. And the metal costs are surprising for the upside here, can you just step us through the pricing announcements you’ve made in the marketplace? I think you’ve got a bunch out on the Power Gen side. Can you just give us an update for the other businesses as well? Thanks.
Patrick Ward: Well, on the material costs, we do expect a headwind of somewhere between three tenths of a percent and four tenths of a percent net. The metal market part of that is going to go up by more than 1%. And just now we’re fairly confident we can offset around three quarters of that. We will continue to work at it. But that’s one of these issues we’re going to have to pay attention to through the year as there seems to be continued upward pressure on metal markets. On pricing for the company, we’re looking at pricing being up about 1% in 2011 versus 2010. That’s really coming through the Power Gen segment, it’s coming through parts of the Component segment, we’re seeing it in the Engine business, high horsepower engines in those markets being impacted favorably and the after-market business is also up by a couple of percent. I actually don’t have the specific numbers so maybe that’s something you could follow up with me after the call.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Thanks, Pat. And lastly, can you give us an update on Foton Cummins and Xian Cummins production rates in the quarter and whether you expect the operating losses in those businesses to narrow in ‘11. Thanks.
Patrick Ward: On Foton, we ended up building 16,000 engines last year, so that was up from 1,000 in 2009 and the fourth quarter production, shipments were around 8,000 units, so we did see a climb through the year. Our projection for 2011 is 50,000 engines in this year, so significant growth over the 2010 level. And then for the XCEC joint venture, we ended up building about 4,000 engines last year and we see that growing to 16,000 engines in 2011.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: I think one point I noted in my opening but we do expect, despite a relatively flat truck market, for our business to grow in China and specifically, we expect our truck business in China to grow. Those are really the two reasons that we expect our BFCEC expansion into light-duty trucks to start in earnest and then XCEC which is heavy-duty engines where the market is moving much towards, up in power range, up into heavy-duty. We’re getting some traction on our XCEC joint venture with Foton so with our partner from BFCEC those are definitely, starting significant expansions in 2011 and that’s helping is grow in a relatively flat market.
Jerry Revich – Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Robert Wertheimer – Morgan Stanley: Yes, hi. Good morning, everybody. Quick question on Industrial Engines, oil and gas was coming up strong. Can you talk a little bit about where that is within the oil and gas patch, whether it’s share or – I guess we’ve seen some companies reporting very strong oil and gas and some still not bouncing back. I know you had the potential to gain some share, so could you talk about the strength in the industrial in oil and gas please?
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Where we play most successfully in the oil and gas market is obviously in the well servicing, the frac rigs in the oil shale deposits that you see throughout the United States. That’s where we’ve seen a lot of success in those markets. You may remember back in the third quarter, we announced that we were getting into the Transmission business for the oil and gas and that will be product that will be coming online here towards the end of the year in 2011. And so we’re really seeing a lot of good share gains in that market. We don’t play in a big way at this point in a lot of the offshore drilling. We’ve got some efforts underway through the Distribution segment to establish centers of excellence in the Singapore area to really go after that offshore drilling market opportunity as well as in Houston with the onshore land drilling that’s taking place. So there’s some more opportunities for us in that part of the market.
Robert Wertheimer – Morgan Stanley: Perfect. And I wonder if you could touch on compression as well. And then my second question would be, I guess that’s two, but the second question would be just margins on engines in the quarter. Your revenues were up quarter over quarter. Margin’s a little soft. Could you do – was that pricing or materials hitting you negative and that normalizes out in the first part of the year?
Patrick Ward: Well are you talking Q4 over Q3 or Q4 over Q4?
Robert Wertheimer – Morgan Stanley: Over Q3. Sorry.
Patrick Ward: Yes. Compared to Q3 we were down – let me see if I can find my notes on this.
Robert Wertheimer – Morgan Stanley: I had you at 8.8 ex the JVs versus 9.
Patrick Ward: Yes. So we’re down five tenths of a point. Volume is clearly a positive benefit. We did see increases in material costs. We did see product coverage going up from 3.6% to 4.7% within the segment. We did see higher spending on R&D technology cost in the quarter.
Robert Wertheimer – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn with UBS. Please proceed.
Henry Kirn – UBS: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
Dean Cantrell: Good morning.
Patrick Ward: Hi, Henry.
Henry Kirn – UBS: Since your revenue run rate’s already ahead of the 2011 guidance, could you talk about how much pre-buy demand you saw from North American off-highway and Europe in the fourth quarter?
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Jerry, I think what we’ve or, Henry, we’ve talked about in the past is typically in the European market that we were aware that there were pre-buy underway. We ended up seeing probably close to 10,000 engines that were pre-bought in the European market. I can’t say that we really were seeing or have a way of identifying any pre-buy activity in the North American market. Obviously the EPA does not allow pre-buy for the Tier 4 market in the U.S. But in the European market it is allowed and we were aware of OEMs taking advantage of that.
Henry Kirn – UBS: And is it possible to give some breakdown in what you expect for JV versus non-JV EBIT in 2011?
Patrick Ward: Yes. I think that’s in the presentation that Dean put on the Web site. We expect JV income to be up around 5% in 2011. We are temporarily capacity constrained at some of the larger joint ventures, most notably the Dongfeng Cummins joint venture in Xi’an. But we’re making a significant investment in capacity to increase that by 50,000 units by the end of this year. Joint venture income grew – sorry joint venture revenues grew 28% in 2010. We expect joint venture revenues to grow around 15% to 20% in 2011.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: We also have been at capacity on the TCL Tata plant in Jamshedpur where capacity is 120,000 and they produced 146,000 last year. One of the plants that we opened two weeks ago is another engine plant that’ll have capacity of 60,000 with the possibility of going to another 120,000. And that plant will come online during the year.
Henry Kirn – UBS: Thanks a lot.
Dean Cantrell: And the TCL joint venture will actually be online this month, by the end of this month, starting production of its new 60,000 units.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Ann Duignan – JPMorgan: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Dean Cantrell: Morning, Ann.
Patrick Ward: Ann.
Ann Duignan – JPMorgan: Hi. The first just a definitional question. Product coverage, is that totally warranty costs? Or is there anything else in there like ongoing additions of technicians or fixed costs (inaudible) ?
Patrick Ward: Ann, it’s total warranty costs. There’s nothing else in there.
Ann Duignan – JPMorgan: Okay. Just wanted to make sure I got that right. And then my real question is, could you walk us through your outlook sequentially or year-over-year? North America heavy-duty versus medium-duty, just your shipments? Just given the lack of shipments Q1 this past year, what kind of ramp up should we see as we go through the year for your business?
Patrick Ward: I think on the heavy-duty truck in North America, I think about 35% to 40% of the full year shipments will take place in the first half of the year and then 60% to 65% in the second half of the year. On medium-duty truck, it’s a little bit more balanced, maybe 40% to 45% in the first half and 55% to 60% in the second half.
Ann Duignan – JPMorgan: Okay, and then just one other clarification. On the JV investments, I think you said there was an additional $300 million being invested in the joint ventures, CapEx for joint ventures. Is that 50/50 your investment and your partner’s investments around the world? Or, could just talk about what your contribution to that $300 million is.
Patrick Ward: Yes, our contribution is minimal. This is investments in the joint ventures are funding themselves. Primarily it’s Donfeng Cummins. There’s a little bit of finishing up with Tata Cummins, but relatively little investment on these capital projects that we talked about in joint ventures.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Just to be clear, that’s not cash flow that you’re going to see in our cash flow statement, Ann, that – if you could look into the joint ventures and their cash flow statement, you would see them spending the – the joint ventures spending the $300 million in CapEx.
Ann Duignan – JPMorgan: Okay. Perfect. That’s exactly what I wanted to make sure I got right. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten. Please proceed.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: Thank you. Good morning.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Hi, Eli.
Patrick Ward: Hey, Eli.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: A little clarification. You gave us product coverage, I think you said in engines were 3.6 to 4.7. Can you give us a product coverage number for the corporation in the quarter and the year and how to work that out for 2011?
Patrick Ward: Yeah. So let me give you a little bit of overall view of what happened in product coverage. You go back to 2009, our product coverage cost was 4.1% of sales. And in our call three months ago, we had guided product coverage for 2010 to be 2.9%. It came out at 3%. So it was relatively close to the guidance we gave. For the fourth quarter, it was up at 3.9%, so it was higher than what we had seen for the earlier part of the year. But that was expected. We telegraphed that before as we introduced more 2010 products, they will carry higher warranties. We did have one or two additional campaigns on all the products, nothing to do with 2010 product, that we also increased accruals for. But overall, we came in at 3%, which was not far away from what we expected three months ago. For 2011, we do expect product coverage for the company to increase and will be somewhere between 3.5%, 3.6% of sales for the full year. Probably starts off around 3.4% and end up around 3.7% by the fourth quarter.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Those changes just reflect the mix of new engines versus older engines and the fact that we start with high accrual rates and bring those accrual rates down as we get more experience with the engines and our actual payments begin to match – begin to play a bigger weight in our estimate of accruals versus what our standard rate is when we launch the product, so that’s what’s happening with those rates as we go. As Pat mentioned, we are feeling very good about the product quality of our 2010 engines so we expect the rates to come down as actual experience begins to flow in and play a larger role in the accrual rate setting process.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: And can you help me a little bit with the guidance of Engines because when I look at the – your assumptions, a lot of its EPA 10 compliant. And there’s a big price differential between EPA 10 and non-EPA 10. So how much of that 25% is because of the higher – the 25% is because of the higher prices of EPA 10 versus actual volume. I’m just trying to get some mix of how pricing because of the more expensive engine flows through here.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: I think, Eli, the way you should think about it and the way that we’re looking at it when we give you those bridge to the 2010 to the 2011, is we introduced the 2010 product in 2010. It carried a higher price increase relative to ‘09. And so as we’re bridging 2010 to 2011, we’re not really talking about price changes on EPA 10 product, we’re talking about volumes increasing.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: Yeah, but as I said, you’re going to have, a huge step up, 125% increase in heavy-duty shipments, 40%, 110% in medium-duty, and that’s all much more expensive engines versus what would have been shipped before. I just want to know whether...
Norman Thomas Linebarger: But not more expensive than was shipped in 2010, right, Eli? We didn’t ship any non-EPA compliant 2010 engines, everything had to be compliant in 2010 for us to ship, so like for like. Now if you go back to ‘09, you’re right that there’s both volume and price.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: And, I’m just trying to get some idea of that mix change, because the prices are up substantially.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Yeah. I think maybe you could, Dean could give you that if we went back to ‘09 because we don’t have those numbers handy with us relative to ‘09. But we could definitely say okay, from ‘09 what was the volume increase and what was the price increase in terms of the mix change. We just, but because it was all in ‘09 we don’t have numbers with us handy.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: And one final question. Could you talk about market share expectations for ‘11 versus ‘10 specifically in the North American market?
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Yeah. In heavy-duty trucks, we expect to be around 35% market share for the year. We obviously started out higher when much of the transition was happening. We finished the year right around 38% for the full year and so we expect to go into that year at that run rate. We expect to be around 35%. We’ll see how we go. We’re trying to help our customers obviously take share from folks that aren’t our customers and if we do better at that, our share will be higher and we’ll be working hard to do that. Right now we’re estimating 35%.
Theodore Solso: And it will be over 50% in the medium-duty.
Eli Lustgarten – Longbow Research: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Yeah. See you later.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Andy Casey – Wells Fargo: Good morning, everybody.
Patrick Ward: Andy.
Andy Casey – Wells Fargo: A couple of questions, first on supply chain potential to keep up with the ramp. Are you seeing any constraints at all, whether it be within your supply chain or elsewhere?
Norman Thomas Linebarger: We do see some, Andy. There’s no one thing that’s causing issues, but we are seeing ramp up issues in high horsepower. So, as we talked on our previous call about how we had gone to work on making sure that we had enough high horsepower engines by starting early with the supply base. I’m grateful that we did that because in fact demand did come faster than we expected and we were able to stay up with the ramp. But now on the QSK60 engines where demand has really increased quickly with all the market segments that we discussed earlier, mining and power gen, et cetera we are now extending lead times a little and that’s frustrating to us so we are trying to increase capacity again to keep up. And again, most of that is supply base, right? Our issue is not assembly capacity primarily; it’s making sure supply base keeps up. So that’s one issue that we’re dealing with. And then if you go back in the chain some Turbochargers we’ve had some issues ramping up in that area too, with suppliers. Assembly capacity is okay but keeping suppliers up has been a bit of a challenge. But again there’s nothing that’s unique or different. It’s stuff that we deal with every time we see ramp-ups. But we’re working on it pretty aggressively to make sure that we can have enough capacity to meet our growth. And Tim and Pat talked a little bit about where we are with our joint ventures and trying to expand capacity there. We’re working really hard in India and China to make sure those supply bases keep up as well because we have really big growth opportunities there and so we have a big focus on keeping supply chain free flowing.
Andy Casey – Wells Fargo: Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then if I could flip to cost. You walked through it for Engines. Could you give some sort of bridge for the Components because there was a lot of stuff that went on this year. And it looks like the 13% to 18% implied incremental margins might be a little conservative given the growth and the anticipated absence of the second half operational cost issues you encountered.
Patrick Ward: So you’re asking about the 2011 guidance on Components?
Andy Casey – Wells Fargo: Exactly, Pat.
Patrick Ward: Okay. Yes, so we go from 9% EBIT in 2010 to between 10% and 11% so call a midpoint of 10.5% this year. So my calculation, that’s 16% incremental EBIT margins which for that segment would be pretty impressive given the track record. Obviously, a big part of that is coming from volume. With sales being up 25% and given it’s going to come through in Emission Solutions business in particular. I think that will be a catalyst, if you pardon the pun, through much better margins. We do see material costs probably close to 0.5% favorable in the Components segment compared to the average of last year but we are making some fairly significant investments in this segment also on research and development that will drive the net margin down from what you think it might have to be for an incremental basis. Again, 10.5% – somewhere in the 10.5% range would be a – obviously a new record for the segment. And if we can get there – I think we’re getting on top of the issues that Tom talked about last quarter in our manufacturing plants and the Turbo business and Infiltration business that were dragging margins down in Q3. They were 8% there. And we got back to 9% in Q4. So we’re on track there. So you can expect to see that above 10% next year or this year.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: And really, Andy, on the incremental margin front, what we’re trying to do is balance the – gaining as much of the increased revenue we can in terms of leveraging the profits but then making sure we’re continuing to make the investments that we think continue to drive the growth forward. We’ve talked about the growth that we’re investing in India and China. But a big growth driver for the company going forward is going to be the Component segment, too. So we are definitely, significantly – we’re taking a share of our profitability and investing it back in R&D growth in products in the Components segment because we believe that’s going to drive a lot of growth. And that’s both in emerging markets and developed markets. So that’s definitely where some of the money is going. But most of the operational issues are getting behind us now and we expect to get a lot of leverage of increased revenues in 2011.
Andy Casey – Wells Fargo: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer with Wolfe. Please proceed.
Tim Denoyer – Wolfe: Hi. Good morning.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Morning, Tim.
Tim Denoyer – Wolfe: Quick question still on the Emissions Solutions. There’s been a couple of announcements recently in terms of the sale of the Tube business. Can you give us a sense of what kind of impact that’s going to have in terms of it and how that plays into the incremental margin discussion for components in 2011?
Patrick Ward: The size of that business is around $100 million so definitive guidance that we’ve given, the $16 billion, that is not included within that guidance at all obviously given the announcement in the last week or so. In terms of EBIT, it really doesn’t have any impact on the EBIT when you look at 2010 versus 2011 either, not material.
Tim Denoyer – Wolfe: Okay. Was that a – so non-material for the margin or the actual EBIT?
Patrick Ward: It’s not detrimental, not incremental to the EBIT margin year-over-year.
Tim Denoyer – Wolfe: Okay. And then just strategically in terms of that sale, was that just a low value-added business or what’s the rationale there?
Norman Thomas Linebarger: Yeah. So the sale of business – the strategy was trying to make sure we’re focusing on our primary commercial markets and not focusing on light-duty and passenger car and not focusing on the less value-added pieces. These pieces go back to an acquisition we did some years ago. And what we’re doing is keeping the pieces of that, that really have to do with our forward looking Emission Solutions and Filtration businesses. And the ones that really aren’t part of our segment going forward, they’re either serving markets that we don’t serve or they’re not utilizing the technology development we’re doing on Emission Solutions. And those are really the parts that we cobbled together and put into the sale.
Tim Denoyer – Wolfe: Got it. Thanks. Just one other quick one in terms of the non-segment items, Pat, there was $20 million in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of what that was?
Patrick Ward: Yeah. That’s the normal elimination of profit and inter-company inventories. The levels of inter-company inventory came down at the end of the year. That’s a trend we normally see. So we were able to release some of that profit that was held up.
Tim Denoyer – Wolfe: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Timothy Thein – Citigroup: Thank you. Good morning. First question was just going back to the Engine segment in terms of the margin outlook for 2011. Is there any way you can quantify potential mix impact from the aftermarket piece presumably, especially in heavy-duty, is going to represent a much smaller piece than it was in 2010? Is there a way to put any numbers around that?
Patrick Ward: There may be, but I don’t have it with me just now. So that’s one you need to follow up with Dean afterwards rather than guess at it.
Timothy Thein – Citigroup: Okay. And, Pat, while you’re there, did you say the total unconsolidated revenue growth that you’re projecting for this year is 15% to 20% for the whole piece? Or was that just, in the slide that’s showing China and India, up 17%? Is that what you were referring to? Or?
Patrick Ward: I was giving you all our unconsolidated joint ventures. We expect that the revenues will grow somewhere between 15% and 20% in 2011.
Timothy Thein – Citigroup: Okay. So that – again, I’m still having a harder time. I understand all the investment as it relates to the equipment ops, but if the Distribution piece, presumably that implies double-digit growth and I’m still having a hard time seeing as to why, especially that business, wouldn’t contribute more than, get you to more than 5% growth year-on-year in JV income. Can you just help me with that?
Patrick Ward: Again, we’re making fairly significant ramp up in our capacity in the joint ventures. And that’s adding cost to those businesses from what we have today. I think that the largest joint venture Dongfeng Cummins had a fantastic year in 2010. We went from 120,000 engines last year, sorry 2009, to 220,000 engines in 2010. And that is, by far, the most profitable joint venture that we have. But temporarily, capacity is constrained in that joint venture and will be for all of this year. So we’re making investments in the other joint ventures, but we’re not getting the additional profit leverage that we would have got had we had additional capacity for an additional 50,000 units at DCEC.
Timothy Thein – Citigroup: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI. Please proceed.
David Raso – ISI: Hi. Good morning.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: David.
David Raso – ISI: A couple of small items, on the inventory, typically third to fourth quarter, your inventory goes down. This quarter I see it went up a bit and on a year-over-year basis, it’s been a while when inventory’s grown faster than sales, in this case a lot faster. You did have a couple Distribution acquisitions during the quarter so maybe that explains some of it. But can you take us through that unique action in inventories versus sales?
Patrick Ward: Yeah, I think in inventory actually we’re pretty pleased the way it came out for the year. Our inventory turns at the end of the year, were close to six which was better that what they were at the end of third quarter and much better than what they’ve been all through the year and at the end of 2009. We are ramping up as we see stronger demand come ahead of us in 2011. When I look at working capital in total, David, I’m pretty pleased the way it came out, even though it went up in dollar terms obviously when you look at a percent of sales, it’s lower, as I said our inventory turns are better. Our receivable past dues are lower, our DSOs are much better than what they were a year ago. We only wrote off $3 million of bad debts in 2010 and we normally run at $9 million to $10 million a year. Overall, for the company, I’m feeling okay with working capital just now.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: You know what, Dave? The only thing I would add, I’m never really satisfied with inventory levels. There’s definitely improvements I think we can make but I think that the principal difference in this end-of-year situation versus prior is that we are seeing, continuing to see strong sales in Q1 and so in several of the places where we sometimes have lower inventories we actually didn’t lower inventories getting ready for sales in Q1. So that’s one seasonal or notional difference than you might see in previous years.
David Raso – ISI: Would that be related particularly to North American truck or industrial for construction, just to get some indication because it is bullish on the first quarter shipments given that inventory. It is unique, that movement.
Norman Thomas Linebarger: You’re right, but it’s all those. It’s high horsepower demand which is staying high both in Power Gen and Engines, it’s North American trucks and then it’s also construction. So all three of those areas are still staying strong and so therefore, we have higher inventory levels than we might otherwise.
Patrick Ward: The one thing to keep in mind as you build your models out for the first quarter, and this is not trying to give you colossal guidance, but keep in mind the fourth quarter was a 14-week quarter and the first quarter is a 12-week quarter. So even though demand per day is still increasing, we’ve got two fewer weeks in the first quarter than the fourth quarter when you do your models.
David Raso – ISI: As it relates to the working capital changes and cash flow, we don’t yet have the detail on the operating cash flow. But the implied operating cash flow in the quarter was about $387 million. But when you look at the balance sheet, the working capital was a use of cash of about $350 million. How do we square that up? Is it accrued expenses? Or what’s the number that gets you to that strong a cash flow for the quarter of working capital with that much of a use?
Patrick Ward: Yes let’s take that one up after the meeting. I don’t have that number in front of me just now.
David Raso – ISI: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Dean Cantrell: Okay. That’s all the – Anne, that’s all the time we have for questions today. I – we’ll be available today for your questions throughout the day so I appreciate everyone for dialing into our fourth quarter earnings call today. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2010 ArvinMeritor Incorporated earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brett Penzkofer, Senior Director, Investor Relations.
Brett Penzkofer: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the ArvinMeritor third quarter 2010 earnings call. On the call today, we have Chip McClure, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jay Craig, our CFO. The slides accompanying today's call are available at www.arvinmeritor.com. We'll refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call which we are recording is the property of ArvinMeritor Incorporated. It's protected by U.S. and international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the express written consent of ArvinMeritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me refer you to Slide 2 for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you will find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chip.
Chip McClure: Thank you, Brett, and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3. We're excited to announce today that we've reached an agreement to sell our Light Vehicle Body Systems to an affiliate of Inteva Products for approximately $35 million, consisting of $20 million cash and the remaining $15 million in promissory note. We anticipate this transaction to close sometime before the end of the year. This transaction completes our company's transformation strategy to refocus our organization so we can better concentrate on our strengths and focus on our core competencies in the commercial vehicle industry that will generate future earnings growth for ArvinMeritor. We're confident in the growth opportunities that the Body Systems business will create and believe that this business will be better served by an organization that's strategically positioned to invest in this development and growth. By redirecting the ER&D, capital investment and management resources to the businesses we choose to compete in, we believe we will provide better value to our shareholders and successfully work towards a stronger position in the marketplace. Now let's turn to Slide 4 to review our third quarter year-over-year results. We're pleased with the continued strong earnings performance we reported this quarter. As I'll outline in a moment, we reported higher revenues, significant improvements in EBITDA, demonstrating strong conversion on increased revenue and strong free cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter. While our earnings per share was lower due to increased taxes on higher earnings in emerging markets and our industrial business was down as a result of a decrease in the volume of certain defense programs, our strong conversion on growth in other business areas allowed us to continue to stay on track toward our long-term financial target. As we're outlined in the past, we're focusing on consistency and stability of financial performance, including managing the upturn in North American and Europe. Our third quarter results benefited from a gradual improvement in demand for commercial vehicles in both North America and Europe as well as the ongoing strength in Brazil, India and China. Sales of $1.3 billion this quarter were up $333 million or 35% from the same period last year. We're especially proud of the significant year-over-year EBITDA improvements we've been able to achieve as we continue to fully realize the benefit of rebounding revenue. We reported $76 million in EBITDA in the third quarter, which is nearly triple of what we earned in the same period last year. We also saw improvements in our year-over-year adjusted income from continuing operations, which was $2 million, up $26 million from last year. This amount would have been $17 million higher if we were able to recognize our tax benefits in the United States and the Western Europe. We earned $0.02 per share from continuing operations in the third quarter, which was significantly better than last year when we reported a loss of $0.47. This number also would have been significantly higher if not for the tax items previously mentioned. I'm extremely pleased to report that we generated $33 million in free cash flow this quarter, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of positive performance. I believe the consistency in our steady and stable cash flow conversion is a testament to how tightly we're managing the business. This improves our ability to make investments in our business such as our recently announced $22 million commitment to expand our research and development capabilities at our Troy, Michigan, technical center. Similar to our year-over-year results, we also experienced sequential improvements this quarter across our key financial performance metrics, and Jay will provide more detail on this later in the call. Let's now turn to Slide 5 to review the volumes forecasted in global truck production. Our expectations for commercial truck market remain in line with the industry experts and reflect a steady, positive trend. As you can see from this chart, North American Class 8 volumes are expected to steadily increase for the remainder of the year and longer term we're anticipating a significant increase in demand starting in 2011. The improvements we're seeing in freight tonnage, truck utilization, truckload rates and used truck pricing indicate that the recovery in the North American commercial vehicle market is underway. We believe the economic recovery and the need to begin replacing ageing fleet will continue to drive this upward trend. Many of our OE customers are anticipating a strong fourth and therefore asking us to prepare to ramp up production in the second half of the calendar year. We started to ship our all new 14X Axle this quarter to our major North American customers, and we're pleased to see excellent demand for this product. At the end of June, Hurricane Alex caused significant damage to the transportation infrastructure in Mexico, which impacted the region around our facility in Monterrey. We were fortunate that although this caused some supply chain disruptions at certain other supplier companies in the region, we did not experience material shortages at ArvinMeritor. We're proud of our team for reacting quickly and ensuring that our customers were taken care of during this natural disaster. And as a result, we did not expect any material financial impact from this event. In Europe, we continue to see a steady growth trend. Despite the economic concerns related to the sovereign debt crisis, European truck demand is beginning to show evidence of a recovery. Truck production showed positive momentum in June, with month-over-month increases in most of our European markets. In addition, year-over-year truck registrations turned positive for the first time since July of 2008. In line with the North American market, we expect to see more than 20% growth rate in Europe for 2011 and 2012. The Brazilian truck market continues to show significant strength as well. Truck volumes for 2010 are expected to surpass the 2008 record. As a result of these high volumes, we experienced an all-time production record in May at our Osasco plant. We believe production volumes will continue to be strong in this region, as the Brazilian government extends its tax incentive programs through the remainder of the year. Now let's turn to Slide 6. Recovery in the North American and European commercial truck markets has resulted in continuous growth in both the Aftermarket and Trailer businesses. In addition, the increasing age of the fleets in North America and cannibalization that occurred during downturn are expected to drive continued demand for replacement parts as truck utilization increases. As sustainability becomes more important across our global markets, our remanufacturing business will continue to grow as we increase our market presence in Europe, and launch our truck technique line of products in South America. Let's turn to Slide 7. Recent investments we made in our off-highway business in China are already helping us address increased demand and improve and localize our manufacturing and product capabilities. Although many economists are forecasting GDP growth in China to cool slightly from double digit growth levels to high single digit, we expect off-highway production to continue to be strong due to the government's infrastructure spending on high speed rails, new highway systems, and the continued modernization of China's infrastructure. We've also been experiencing solid truck production in India as the government continues to invest in this infrastructure, including roads and energy. As you can see from the chart on this slide, truck production in India is forecasted to be at record levels through 2012. Now let's turn to Slide 8. Regarding our defense business, as I mentioned last quarter, we're expecting FMTV volumes to drop in the near term as production shifts to a new prime contractor and as volumes decrease to more normalized levels over the long term. We are however diligently working on obtaining a number of additional military programs that we believe will help offset some of the lower FMTV volumes. Many of these programs relate to our new advanced product line up of independent suspensions. We expect to be able to announce a major award in the near future. Longer term, we're very well positioned on the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, or JLTV program which is scheduled to begin replacing the HMMWV fleet in the 2013 or 2014 timeframe. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks, Chip. Slide 9 compares our fiscal third quarter results to the outlook we provided last quarter. We exceeded our expectations for both sales and adjusted EBITDA, as we experienced growth in the North American and European truck markets as well as continued strength in the emerging markets. Our adjusted income from continuing operations was $2 million compared to the $15 million we reported last quarter. If you recall, there were $12 million of favorable discrete tax items in our second quarter results, which we did not expect to recur in the third quarter. In addition, strong performance in the emerging markets resulted in changes in the mix of income, which increased income tax expense. However, we continue to realize the expected operating leverage on increasing revenue. Free cash flow before factoring and restructuring exceeded our expectations. Headwinds related to the additional working capital needs associated with our increasing revenues did not prevent us from generating positive cash flow due to our continuing focus on working capital management. In addition, free cash flow of $33 million also exceeded our expectations for the third quarter, as rising revenues in Europe requiring working capital investment were offset by increased usage in sale or receivable programs. Turning to the income statement on Slide 10, we earned $0.02 per share of adjusted income from continuing operations in the third quarter as compared to a $0.33 loss in the same period last year. This EPS calculation was based on 96.4 million diluted average common shares outstanding in the third quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the additional shares from our equity offering completed in March. Third quarter sales were up $333 million or 35% year-over-year with virtually no net impact from currency movements in the quarter. As the truck markets in North America, Europe, India and Brazil showed significant improvement. Strength in our China off-highway aftermarket and trailer and light vehicle businesses also contributed to the year-over-year increase. This was partially offset by declining military volumes. Compared to last year, SG&A increased from 7.1% of sales to 7.4% in the third quarter. This is a result of increased costs associated with the restoration of compensation plans. Due to changes in remediation costs estimates at certain sites, we recorded a $6 million environmental charge in the third quarter, reflected in our other operating expense slide. This charge is expected to be one time in nature. Earnings in our minority owned affiliated doubled year-over-year to $14 million with noteworthy contributions from our joint ventures in Brazil and India, as well as our Meritor WABCO in North America, as each capitalized on the return of the truck and trailer markets in their respective regions. Interest expense of $27 million on a GAAP basis was slightly higher than the same quarter last year, primarily due to additional interest costs associated with our recently issued debentures. Our effective tax rate continues to significantly exceed normal statutory rates. As you can see on the first line of Slide 11, we remained a tax payer in many emerging markets which are experiencing profitable growth such as Brazil where we are not subject to evaluation allowance. However, we are currently unable to realize any tax benefit on losses in the United States and Western Europe, where we are subject to evaluation allowances. As Chip mentioned earlier, our net earnings would have been $17 million higher the third quarter if we had been able to recognize tax benefits on those losses in those jurisdictions. However, when our markets re-bounced to more normalized volume levels in the U.S. and Western Europe, we would not expect to pay taxes in those jurisdictions for the foreseeable future. Slide 12, shows segment and adjusted EBITDA for our core business segments, as well as for the light vehicle segment. In the third fiscal quarter, we achieved a total adjusted EBIT dollar margin of 6%, doubling last year's performance as EBITDA increased 171% to $76 million on a 35% increase on sales. The commercial segment recorded a significant improvement in EBITDA margin this quarter as we leveraged costs savings implemented last year to convert to higher volumes in Europe and the Americas. EBITDA margins in the Industrial segment declined 43% compared to the same quarter last year. Although we experienced higher sales in Asia-Pacific this quarter, those gains were more than offset by the decline in MRAP volumes year-over-year. Aftermarket and Trailer EBITDA margins remained flat year-over-year, as higher core product revenues in Europe and North America were also offset by lower MRAP service part sales as compared to 2009. Increased costs associated with variable compensation plans, which are fully allocated also negatively impacted year-over-year segment margin comparison. Light vehicle consistence consisting primarily of body systems delivered $15 million of EBITDA in the third quarter, up $21 million from the same quarter in 2009. Structural cost savings provided for continued conversion on higher volumes in Europe, the Americas and Asia-Pacific for our body systems group. Slide 13 displays the sequential EBITDA margin block for the second fiscal quarter. We continued to expand margins from 5.3% last quarter to 6%. In the third quarter margins significantly benefited from a 35% quarter-over-quarter increase in South American truck sales as well as a 13% increase in medium and heavy duty truck sales in Western Europe. In addition, EBITDA margins were driven higher by sales increases of approximately 6% to North America. Within the Industrial segment, we experienced deterioration in product mix resulting in a margin decrease of 50 basis points. During the third quarter, we recorded higher material costs, most notably steel which negatively impacted margins. We expect to recover the majority of these increases both in the next couple of quarters through our normal customer contractual mechanisms. As previously mentioned, changes in environmental costs estimates impacted our margins by 0.5% this quarter. Moving down to Light Vehicle Systems, improved operating performance resulted in a 50 basis point margin improvement. Let's turn to our third quarter conversion chart on Slide 14. We continued to scorecard our performance towards our goal of converting at a rate of 20% to 25% on incremental revenue until we achieve our long-term EBITDA margin target of 10%. We are pleased that we converted to the middle of range at 22%, excluding temporary cost reduction add-backs associated with variable compensation plans. We exceeded our expectations this quarter. However, we expect to perform on the lower end of the range in the fourth quarter as we have begun to experience reductions at the FMTV military sales, Chip described earlier. As we begin to see a recovery of the global commercial vehicle market, maintain structural cost reductions, and continue to execute our growth initiatives, we remain on track toward our 10% EBITDA margin target. Slide 15, shows free cash flow for the third quarter compared to the previous year. We achieved positive free cash flow of $33 million for the quarter, by containing the working capital build required for increased volumes. Our free cash flow in the third quarter was lower than last year due to the significant benefit we received from the unwind of working capital in the same period last year. Turing to Slide 16, we are proud to report the fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. For fiscal 2010 to-date, we have delivered a total of $80 million of free cash flow, as our core-end markets recover and we maintain our focus on converting earnings to cash. Turning to Slide 17, we continue to improve liquidity and reduce debt as earnings and cash flows improve. At the end of the third quarter, liquidity increased to $888 million, due to positive cash flow generation. In addition, long-term debt decreased as we opportunistically repurchased $18 million of our unsecured debt in the open market during the third quarter. On Slide 18, you will see our updated 2010 planning assumptions, which contain anticipated results from our LVS operations, including Body Systems. Body Systems is expected to be reported in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter, depending upon the pending sale. Expected capital expenditures have decreased to a range of $75 million to $85 million, which includes approximately $30 million for light vehicle systems. For interest expense we have tightened the range to $100 million to $110 million. The income tax expense assumption has been increased and tightened to a range of $65 million to $75 million as we continue to see market strength in Brazil and China, where we remain a tax payer. And similarly, our expectations for cash income taxes has been increased and tightened to a range of $45 million to $55 million. Turing to our outlook on Slide 19, which also contains anticipated results from our LVS operations. We expect sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income from continuing operations to be slightly lower in the fourth quarter, relative to the third quarter, as we experienced seasonal volume declines in Europe and China. Free cash flows, both including and excluding factoring and restructuring, are expected to be slightly negative, as we will incur approximately $38 million of semi-annual bond interest payments in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to Chip.
Chip McClure: Thanks Jay. Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to reiterate that we achieved solid results for the third quarter of 2010. The actions we took in 2009 to manage through the downturn have made us a stronger company today, and we are well positioned to capitalize the upturn we're experiencing in the Americas and Europe. We've also continued to make significant improvements to our business, both financially and operationally throughout 2010. We reduced our debt balance and enhanced our liquidity position. We expect to utilize this cash to invest back in R&D, which will support our effort to continue to develop advanced products that enhance our customer's vehicles in the areas of safety, efficiency and reliability. Our goal is to solidify ArvinMeritor's position as a leader in providing advanced drive-train, mobility, breaking and aftermarket solutions for the global commercial vehicle and industrial markets. While we continue to face ongoing macroeconomic and industry challenges, we're focused on our strategic priorities and operational initiatives, which are beginning to payoff. We're achieving significant EBITDA margin expansion supported by our ability to convert on sales, and we continue to maintain our momentum in generating cash. Thank you. Now, let's open it up to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital: Could you maybe help us dimension the impact in terms of EBITDA, the ramp down of the MRAP business?
Jay Craig: We do not disclose the separate profitability of our military business, it's contained in the Industrial segment. But certainly you can see from the margin decline this quarter that that business tends to be at higher margins than the other business contained in that segment. And again, our expectation is that trend will continue through the fourth quarter and possibly into next year. The one caveat I would say is that business tends to be very lumpy. We do have some potential awards out there in the future that hopefully may offset that if we're successful in winning those awards.
Chip McClure: There is really kind of three parts. Obviously the MRAP has wound down. There is that base business of the FMTV, which we've said is kind of going through a bit of a transition right now. We have indicated that there is some other programs that we're targeting that we anticipate being able to announce in the not too distant future, that kind of fill some of that gap; and then longer term when you look at it, the JLTV, which comes online on the 2012 or 2013, 2014 timeframe.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital: Can we look at that industrial mix 50 basis point impact, I assume that most of that is the impact of the various military program timings?
Jay Craig: I think more or less you can. I mean there is another impact which is, our business in Asia-Pacific is growing, and I think as you know, Brian, a large portion of that business is through a couple of JVs in India and China. We do report in our results 100% of the revenue from those joint ventures, and only our proportional share of EBITDA. So as those ventures grow, it does tend to mathematically compress our margins. So that impact is a factor in some of the decline in margins in the Industrial segment.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital: And other things in the margin walk, you implied the material economics could reverse later in the year?
Jay Craig: It should. I think as we said earlier, roughly about 85% of our customer contracts include automatic cost pass through mechanisms. They tend to have lags of three to six, and at the long-end, nine months. So we'll see the claw back of that in future quarters automatically flow through those mechanisms.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital: And the environmental liabilities, is that just a one time one quarter?
Jay Craig: It's just one time in nature. We had a couple of sites where we've had some updated information and felt it was prudent to put some funds away and make sure we get those sites cleaned up as appropriate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Starting off with the LVS business, divestiture, timing roughly, I know you said end of 2010. It sounds like you are still confident there. Is this a one or two month event or is this something that could actually drag out into your first quarter?
Chip McClure: Some of this is tied to the regulatory filings, in addition 14 different countries. So we're somewhat tied to that. And I think it'll probably bridge over that time frame. And so obviously, it is very much tied to regulatory bonds at this point. So do anticipate that will be a couple of months, but we still feel comfortable we'll get it done by the end of the calendar year.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Jay, I think we've talked a little bit about some of the liabilities in that business. Can you kind of dimension or give us a sense of what is going on with the liabilities? I guess the pension liabilities are the biggest sling factor here. Are you retaining those? Are they going with the sale?
Jay Craig: I think we'll be providing some updates on that over the next coming weeks. As you probably appreciate from the timing of the announcements this morning, this deal has literally just a sign. So rather than go through on this call and give out data that maybe erroneous, I would like to take the time with the team over the next few weeks. An update not only that information, but some of our planning assumptions that we share today will be providing updated ones, probably a couple of weeks out reflecting LVS being in a just continued operation, rather than give out the erroneous data, I would like to wait a couple of weeks on that.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And then what is left over after the body business goes, and what are your plans for the remaining portion of that?
Jay Craig: There is a couple of minor businesses. One of them is a plan specifically dedicated to a U.S. OE and then a facility over in Europe, in our light vehicle aftermarket. We anticipate that both those operations will also be classified in discontinued operations at the end of our fourth quarter, because we are very close on some transactions on those two remedies as well, although they are very de minimis in total. So basically the announcements today as indicated by Chip, really ramp up the transformation of the company to exclusively a commercial vehicles supplier.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And then, your taxes, and I am thinking longer term here. As we think about your longer term tax rate, and I am trying to think of how to dimension this. But in the past you've provided a slide, you titled "Path to longer term EBIDTA targets." You talk about a potential EBIDTA margin in that 10% range, maybe EBIDTA in the $500 million range or something along those lines. Obviously, substantial improvement in profitability. If you were to look at those kinds of numbers, what would be an effective tax rate with those kinds of numbers given your exposures geographically? Do you have any sort of a range or sense?
Jay Craig: I'm going to give you a couple of pieces of information. One, in our December analyst day, I planned on walking through this tax situation in quite a bit of detail and sharing a lot of information on how we plan to utilize those benefits. We're undergoing some very detailed tax analysis to make certain that we can share that data. But secondly, directly to your question, directionally the tax rate should be lower than the statutory rate, because we'll be utilizing the NOLs both from a book and tax perspective in the U.S. and most likely in some places in Western Europe. So I think directionally, it should be lower than the statutory rate. As far as honing in on what the specific number would be from the achieved level of profitability, I think it's just too difficult to call at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.
Itay Michaeli - Citi: I wanted to ask a question on the 10% long-term EBIDTA margin range. If you think about on one hand the lumpiness in defense and then on the other hand the volume targets you show I think in Slides 5 through 7, if we put those together, when do you think is a good timeframe to think about for reaching 10%? Is it somewhere between '11 and '12, or does it have to be after 2012 just in terms of what you are seeing in terms of the defense business and how that is offsetting some of the volume recovery?
Jay Craig: Well, I think there is a couple of points that we made previously and I think still feel comfortable with. One, we show that conversion chart every quarter, and we definitely have to be at or near to that 20% to 25% conversion to get there. I think there is a bit of cushion in that conversion. So there may be a couple of quarters. We may fall slightly short and still can hit that number. So that's the key to us. As we look at it internally, we spend as much time or more discussing that conversion internally as you would expect than we do here on the call. And then the second point I would make is what we said earlier is we expect to achieve those margin levels when customer and markets unbalanced globally return to normalized levels. And as we've looked at the normalized charts globally, they tend to look normal sometime in the '12 timeframe today. Now, that could change if those markets change in the future. But to us, that in total on a composite basis looks like relatively normal markets.
Itay Michaeli - Citi: Two quick follow-ups. One, can you help us just refresh on what the CapEx would be after the sale of Body Systems? And then two, the $6 million environmental charge, was that paid out or is that going to be paid out? Is that part of the free cash flow in Q3 or is that part of the Q4 guidance?
Jay Craig: The environmental is probably farther out in Q4. As you would expect, these come from doing additional analyses, which I am afraid technically is phase one. So you want to spend your time to make sure you do the right clean-up for both the property and the community at the time. So it takes a bit of time to get that done. As far as your question on CapEx, about $30 million is attributable to our light vehicle business. We are at the low end of our historical CapEx spent in total for the business this year, and we expect for the core business that that will be returning closer to what our depreciation expense is, which is around the mid-$70 million range on average. So it could be at that level or slightly higher in next year or future years as we do some additional investments, particularly in emerging markets. And some of this are high rate expansion return.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: I know you're going to give more detail on it as you go forward, but like on slide 12, looking at the EBIDTA from LVS, you had done enough restructuring in that business to have it in a positive EBIDTA territory, $15 million for the quarter. As we think broadly next year, that's going to be deconsolidated. So that will disappear. Will some of that unallocated corporate cost disappear or will there be other profitability offsets that will go away with that business you want, certain support functions and that sort of thing?
Chip McClure: Patrick, that's a very good question. Actually we have had this experience with the divestitures a couple of times. And so what we've learned from that in the past when we shut down the LVS divisional headquarters a little over a year ago now, we made certain that we did not add corporate cost back into the core business. So there is no corporate cost in the core business that is currently being allocated to the LVS business, including body. So when that business is gone, there is no overhead. We did not want to kind of fool ourselves into some margins that may be higher as we shrunk the business. So there is no corporate cost allocated to it.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Okay. So like pro forma, you just take the 15 out and you are kind of sort of where you would be. On your free cash flow guidance for next quarter, I guess that on first pass just seem a bit conservative. You guys have typically, I think, if I am not mistaken had a reasonably decent fiscal fourth quarter in terms of cash flow. I understand that with some of the capital structure changes you've done, maybe the timing of coupons is different, and it sounded like you called that out. Is that the only other thing at play, or are there a couple of other items to think about there?
Jay Craig: Essentially it really brings to light probably one of the biggest transformations for us from a financial standpoint, which is now the consistency of our working capital usage. Our DSOs and DPOs did not vary by more than a day this quarter, and we increased our inventory turns almost about a half turn. We expect that consistency to be retained through end of the fiscal year, through the end of September. In the past, we had enormous volatility in that, and it was really due to some mechanical operation of how we paid our bills which was done locally at the plant level. And we believe as they got busy at year end, they would drag out those payments. And sometimes the working capital statistics would be very volatile. So I think it's really more a testament just to how consistent the working capital metrics have become.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: And just last one, on the tax rate, I understand that as you guys become profit-making in those jurisdictions, you'll have NOLs that you can leverage. I guess my question is, in practice, how does that work? Do you have to first take down your allowances and write up your net tax assets before we start getting into that kind of a tax benefit or below statutory tax rate? Or is that something that could just like organically happen over the next couple of quarters as we just see the profit in your North America region go up?
Jay Craig: It will be the latter. In terms of our ability to reestablish those tax assets, it will take a period of time of utilizing them under the accounting standards before we are enabled to put them back on our balance sheet. It will take roughly about three years of utilization under the accounting rules before we are allowed to put those back on our balance sheet. So they'll just be almost recognized as you go, in terms of accounting and in terms of cash flow.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: But in sounds like, unless I'm misunderstanding this, you'll still be able to get a tax shield on the way up that will be reflected in your result. That's just I guess before you have kind of the ability to sort of accrue steadily up 35%, that might take three years.
Jay Craig: That will take a few years. Your statement's exactly correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Himanshu Patel with JPMorgan.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: Just going back to the 10% long term EBIDTA margin number, you guys originally provided that number arguably when the economy was a bit shakier. Arvin had only seen a few quarters of cash flow consistency then. I am just wondering, how are you feeling about that figure right now? Is it looking more conservative now, or is that still in your view a sort of a fair assessment of margins for Arvin?
Jay Craig: I think we are pleased that we are coming up on a full year of converting towards that target. So I think that gives us confidence. As far as ability to raise that I think we'd all say, let's get there first. I know Himanshu, you've been following us for quite bit of time in this. It's been a long time since Arvin's been there. So we have our team internally focused on, let's get there and then let's look for the best companies in our industry and set that as our next target. But on the flip side, as you appreciate, we're still confident we'll get there, but you get more and more pressures to bring cost back into the business that we as a management team have to make certain that we keep constrained so we can hit that target.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: And then just also on that margin number, how do you view that number? You mentioned vaguely that that could be kind of 2012 number if volumes normalize then. Should we view that as the case, or is it possible that that could be kind of a through the cycle average margin as well for Arvin where maybe there's periods you overshoot and periods where you're below?
Jay Craig: I think as I said earlier let's see us first get there. But we did state that we view long term that this is a through the cycle average margin we'd like to be. So in peak volume periods, we could be higher than that; and then in troughs, lower than that. But firstly, we'd like to see us get there. And we think there's enormous value for our shareholders, when we do.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: What was the pension and OPEB will that change with the Body System sale?
Jay Craig: It's a question that was asked earlier, specific to the pension liability. And I'd like to just hold off a couple of weeks and update all of that information, in a couple of weeks we'll put out some data, also including our outlook for the fourth quarter and our internal planning assumptions for the fourth quarter. Just so the field was virtually just completed early this morning. I just want to make sure we take the convenience of time to make sure we get all the numbers right.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: And the $35 million consideration is that kind of a net-net number, or will there be some true-ups in the end on working capital or whatever?
Jay Craig: It's the latter, in all deals there was some true-ups for the working capital and the balance sheet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Starting off here, if you can help explain, a little confusion for me because it looks like you guys had a really good quarter relative to what everybody was looking for and your stocks are down. Do you have any thoughts is there anything I am missing there?
Chip McClure: From our end I don't think there is, obviously we kind of put out there was the EBITDA targets and the conversion for the answer on those side, we'd say no, I don't see that. And obviously the latest breaking news on the LVS side, which as Jay said has just come out, is kind of very much in line to what we said, to get kind of get that done from a ongoing strategic transformation in company. So no both performance-wise for the quarter, whether it's EBITDA, sales conversion or free cash flow, we feel very good about what we accomplished this quarter. And as importantly, I think we position ourselves well for the market rebounds that we are beginning to see in the various markets, whether North America and Europe, and continue to support the strong markets in Brazil, India and China. And then I think as importantly with the latest breaking news of the strategic transformation we feel good about that. So the answer is no, we feel good about the performance at this point.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: That is the same view I have, obviously. Other people have different views. A couple of handful of things here, Jay, do you have the number of what the size of your NOLs are at right now?
Jay Craig: They're at $875 million in total, of which about is to be $525 million are in the U.S. And those are the actual tax benefit, that's not pretax income that will be shielded, that's the actual tax benefit number. We were seeing 525 in the U.S., but the effect of the healthcare change law, we expect might eat into $10 million to $15 million of those benefits. So you're probably at about $515 million in the U.S.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: So it is conceivable and through most of this up cycle, you are not a U.S. tax payer?
Jay Craig: That's correct.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: On the LVS business, can you give us directionally some thoughts as we remodel this impact on gross profit and SG&A?
Jay Craig: Well, as far as the SG&A, I did answer that question earlier, but there is no corporate cost allocated to them. So that should be relatively straightforward. And as far as your other question, again, I'd like to take the time if you can just give me a week or two, we'll be putting out kind of the last two pages of my presentation, our fourth quarter outlook and the internal planning assumptions. We'll update all of those, excluding LVS for folks out there. Just want to make sure, read through the final deal in detail and make sure we get people the proper guidance on that.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: What do you think the timing would be on providing that updated guidance?
Jay Craig: Just give us time to file the Q here this week and give us a week or two, just to make certain that everybody has looked at it closely and we understand it completely.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: I understand there's no corporate cost in the LVS, but don't they have some SG&A costs in there?
Jay Craig: Certainly, but it's all self-contained in the segment. If you'd look at some of our segments breakdowns as far as EBITDA margin, it should be all contained in there.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: On the defense business on Slide 8, how much of this run off of the FMTV did we see in the third quarter? Has that happened yet or is it really in Q4?
Chip McClure: No, actually when you look at it beyond that you'll see it going out into Q4.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: But did you have any of it run off in Q3? Is there a negative impact in Q3?
Chip McClure: No.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: The Brazil outlook, Chip, there is a lot of uncertainty here through the balance of the years. The volumes are obviously strong and the tax credits are in place. With the election, those credits expiring at the end of the year, with a lot of uncertainty of what calendar 2011 might bring. Do you have any thoughts or insights you can share there?
Chip McClure: Well, Dave, as you kind of said, first of all, the incentives going through the balance of year, we're obviously the beneficiary of that and seeing it very strong through the balance of this calendar year. Even with the elections coming up, it appears like there will be continuation of similar type of fiscal policy in Brazil, which I think bodes well. I think other things when you look at World Cup, the Olympics and then longer term the discovery of oil there all were called long-term positives. So as I look at it long term, look at it very positively. I think as you kind of talked about, we are watching very closely at it short term as you get into the early 2011. But we see indication we're getting at this point is kind of continuation of strength there, but time only will tell once the election is complete.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Where are you on the capacity utilization right now? Is there something you can give us?
Jay Craig: We don't historically disclose capacity utilization. So I don't think we've disclosed that in the past. I think what we've stated is as some markets rebound, we're confident that we can respond to that. So as you look at the some of the data Chip walked through in his presentation and you look at the rebound there, you may be able to imply some good range of capacity utilization figures.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: And then the last item there is if you look at the up-cycle here as volumes come back, there is some talk that volumes 12 months from now could be running double where we are today in the U.S. What's your strategy for managing that in terms of managing the classes they come back in, bringing people back in and ramping up the volume?
Chip McClure: David, I'll take a kind of a two parts. Within our own plants, I just made a recent tour of our plants here in North America, and we're clearly well positioned with that and are able to bring people back in and flex that accordingly to make sure that we've done that. And one of the other things I should mention is even during the depths of the downturn, we continue to invest in our capacity both here in the Carolinas and in Mexico. So internally, I think we've got it that way. I then look at our supply base, and one of the things we've done is a lot of capacity modeling out for 2013 with various ramp-up scenarios. You can almost picture a regular, green type of thing. So we know where those constraints are based on different volume consideration in our supply base and are continuing to work with our both purchasing, supplier, quality insurance and manufacturing side to be able to make sure we can manage that.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Robert Kosowsky with Sidoti.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: On the industrial side of the business, I was wondering on the military side, when is Oshkosh expected to be at full production for FMTV.
Chip McClure: It actually goes into effect in 2011. There was obviously kind of a ramp-up as far as getting the products validated by the government. So I think you will start to see kind of a slow ramp-down the end of this year and then a ramp-up during the beginning parts of 2011, and then it goes to Oshkosh. And I should also mention that we're also a participant in that, and literally some of that conversion is actually underway as we speak now.
Jay Craig: But I would say, Rob, the one caution is we have seen peak volumes because of a high level of activity in Iraq and Afghanistan. So even after the transition, I think our expectation is that the volumes on FMTV will return to more historically normal levels that we showed in Chart 8 that Chip walked through.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: And then to kind of counterbalance that, what would Asia Pacific have to do to keep you guys whole in the $20 million or so EBIDTA range? Is it possible for that market growth kind of fully offset that, or is there still a little bit of downside to the EBIDTA number?
Jay Craig: There are some other offsetting factors as well. There is some new military programs. Our military business, although a large piece of its core, is FMTV. As we had shown last year with the MRAP built out, we do have some other builds that come along in that business that add back. So I wouldn't focus exclusively. I can't say we are exclusively in Asia-Pacific. There are some other programs that certainly we feel very good about our chances of being included on.
Chip McClure: I think the other thing to look at that just from what I will call product and geographic diversification, if you go back to the depths of the economic crisis in 2009, there was no question that having the military and aftermarket business were ones that were certainly very supportive that way, but partly what we're looking to do is to make sure that we continue to be diversified geographically. So whether one looks at Asia or he clearly see a rebound here in North America or as we go into the off-highway and continue to expand that, I think one of the other things is independent of the segments is to also look at it from a total company perspective. And I think the advantage now that we are indeed able to focus strictly on commercial vehicle and industrial that the diversification product and geographic-wise should also help.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: But you guys would expect to see some weakness in EBIDTA in the next few quarters at least relative to this past quarter?
Jay Craig: Weakness in the industrial segment relative to the military business, I think what we guided to next quarter is really a dip that is specifically related to normal summer shutdowns in Europe, some seasonal nature of our business and the off-highway business in China. But I think our key message is that we still feel we're on track for our long term target up to 10% EBITDA margin.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: And can you give me a sense of your level of confidence in an upturn in Europe versus an upturn in North America on the truck side?
Chip McClure: If you look at the last couple of quarters, we've actually seen what I'll call kind of sequential increases there. See a couple of different drivers there. Our major customer over there, Volvo has done very well as it's come back. And kind of what we're seeing is, we continue to follow what's going on in Europe with the challenge with the sovereign debt issues and some of the other things. But kind of in Northern Europe, not seen that. The other thing is, also, there are some export opportunities we'll be able to take advantage of. So at least I look it at, whether it's from a customer's perspective, or even the production numbers that we've been seeing, we are seeing sequential increase for some of the drivers I just listed.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: Okay, do you have a sense of a kind of a tight supply demand balance over there or capacity utilization amongst the trucking fleets?
Chip McClure: We do the same thing. First of all, if you go back to 2007 and '08, if you remember, when the market yield was down significantly because of the emission change from 2007, Europe was going at record levels. So there's no question that the challenge they had in 2009 was a bit of a bleed off in inventory. The fleet over there is a newer fleet than the fleet that you have here, just because of the fact that the volumes were down for so long here. So I think you've got a little bit of a different dynamic there that we'll probably say, it'll be a little longer, as far as that, because the fleet is newer. But some of those other dynamics do say that we are seeing a slow but steady increase in Europe.
Robert Kosowsky - Sidoti: Can you talk a little bit about the aftermarket strength and also the trailer outlook?
Chip McClure: The aftermarket side, as I said, normally what happens is, they've got vehicles parked against the fence, the first thing they do is start cannibalizing the parts off of those to keep the other units that are out there running. That's done, so as they are ploughing units off the fence, the parts part of it, we're seeing an increase there. So clearly did not see the kind of drop-off that we did on the OE side there, and we see that kind of continuing. Another area of strength for us in the area of remanufacturing which we've talked about, that kind of being another strategic area for us in the aftermarket side and are seeing that grow both here in North America and in Europe and we will continue that way. And then on the trailer side we're actually seeing a sequential improvement, primarily here in North America and see that kind of continuing also.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Brett Penzkofer for closing remarks.
Brett Penzkofer: Thank you all for your time this morning. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to contact me or your communications contact. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Chip McClure: Thank you, Brett and good morning everyone. Now let’s turn to slide three to review some of our second quarter results. We are very pleased with the strong earnings performance reported in the second quarter. We benefited from ongoing strengthening and emerging markets and a slight improvement in commercial vehicle volumes in Europe. We’re proud of the year-over-year improvements we made especially in EBITDA and free cash flow generation. Sales in the second quarter were up $245 million or 25% from the same period last year. We achieved $64 million in EBITDA in the second quarter, double our performance in the same period last year.  Most importantly, we were able to continue our consistent conversion of those earnings to cash. We also saw improvements in our year-over-year adjusted income from continuing operations which was $15 million, up $26 million from last year. We are $0.18 per share from continuing operations in the second quarter which was significantly better than last year when we reported a $0.15 loss.  I'm extremely pleased to report that we generated $45 million in free cash flow this quarter. This is up from an outflow of $138 million in the second quarter of 2009. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter positive cash performance which demonstrates that we’re establishing the necessary discipline in driving cash flow generation.  Now let’s turn to slide four. Some of our year-over-year results, we also experienced sequential improvements this quarter across all of our key financial performance metrics. Sales in the second quarter were $1.2 billion, up $61 million or 5% compared to last quarter. We are beginning to see a good upward sales trend across all our markets.  South America is booming, India is back, China is at record levels, North America is steady and Europe is beginning to turnaround. EBITDA is up 14% quarter-over-quarter as a result of previous cost improvement actions, the benefit of which we continue to maintain. Adjusted income from continuing operations also improved sequentially as to our earnings per share and free cash flow. We expect to maintain steady performance next quarter. We anticipate markets in Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific to continue to strengthen while the North American market may soften in short-term as result of the emission changeover and lower demand for certain military products. Let’s now turn to slide five. Segment in regional diversity has always been a corner stone of our overall strategic plan, and we are pleased that we continue to benefit in the diversified business and product mix as well as global scale. As shown on this slide, our core business segments are commercial truck, representing 47%, aftermarket and trailer 27% and industrial at 26%. As volumes in Europe began to return to more normalized levels and as our business in Asia-Pac continues to expand, we’ll get close to achieving our goal diversifying our business globally with one-third in Europe, one-third in North America and one-third in the rest of world. In the first half of this year, our business in the Asia-Pacific region has grown from 10% to 14% of total revenues, and our business in South America has grown from 10% to 13%. Let’s now turn to slide six to review the trends that experts are forecasting global truck production. As you can see, while North American Class A volumes are expected to remain somewhat flat over the short-term in 2010, longer term forecasting anticipate an increase in demand solely in 2011. Class A production volumes are expected to be approximately 124,000 units for the 2010 calendar year, with forecast is predicting about a 50% rise in volumes in 2011 and a further 35% increase in 2012. Previous cycles are influenced by pre-buys and new emission requirements. But the upper trend that it expected in 2011 is different. This time, it will be driven by the economy and it did recovers the fleets will need to start with placing and rising vehicles. As you can see by the chart on this page, we are also encouraged by the strong growth that is expected in the Class 47 volumes over the next couple of years in North America. Today, we are better prepared and well positioned to capitalize in the upturn. The slight upswing when we experienced this year was an excellent pressure test of our ability to successfully manage additional demand without interruptions. Over the last couple of years, we’ve increased our investments in modernize our existing facilities and we opened a state of the art facility in Monterrey, Mexico to ensure will successfully manage the upturn. We also have in place rigorous processes to ensure the supply chains prepared to support this growth. These processes that were so successfully minimizing supplier disruptions in a downturn have been redirected towards actively managing the upturn. The European truck market is gradually recovering starting with higher volumes in Northern European countries, primarily in Germany, France and Benelux countries. Some of the Southern European countries especially Spain, are still running somewhat behind and continue to show very low volume demand. Although the economic indicators for Europe continue to show signs of uncertainty, we continue to see slow incremental improvements in our markets there. For example, for the first time in 24 months, March truck registrations in Europe were up 8.8% in the same period last year. However, we are closely monitoring the ongoing volatility in European credit markets and the impact it may have on customers end markets. Overall, we expect to see an order improvement in the next couple of quarters as our OE customers in this region gain sales for markets outside of Europe primarily from South America. As you can see from the chart on this page, medium and heavy duty truck production in Western Europe is expected to grow by 14% 2010, and approximately 50% and 33% respectively in 2011 and 2012. We believe we’ll benefit from the strong relationships we have with our European customers. For example, we recently signed a five year contract extension with the Volvo trucks in Europe to supply disc and drum breaks for the medium and heavy duty trucks. And we signed a three-year contract extension with (inaudible) to supply axles for their on-road medium and heavy trucks. Looking at South America, the growth trend for medium and heavy duty truck production continues to be strong and GDP is expected to grow by about 5% annually through 2015. As shown on the chart, you can see South American volumes are projected to strengthen through 2012. So consistent with our view from last quarter we are seeing our global markets continue to trend upwards and because of our truly global presence, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound across the globe. Let’s turn to slide seven, Asia-Pacific which represents 50% of our industrial segment will continue to be a strong contributor in the growth of our company. We are making investments in our highway business in China to address the demand and improve our manufacturing and product capabilities to support one of the largest off highly markets in the world. In our on-highway business we are announcing today our intention to relocate from Wuxi to a new production facility in Nanjing, China. This move will allow us to meet current and future capacity demands. Also in Nanjing we will be opening our first engineering and technical center in China to serve the regional needs of our customers. We expect the overall on and off highway markets in China to continue to grow and to benefit from the $580 billion government stimulus program that was implemented at the beginning of the financial crisis. At the BAUMA show a few weeks ago we also launched a new all terrain crane axle produced at our off-highway facility in China. This product which attracted a lot of attention from OE customers from around the world is our first off-highway axle design for the global marketplace. In addition to China, we are also seeing tremendous growth opportunities in India where for example, we are experiencing very solid growth in the commercial on-highway truck market. As you can see from the chart in this slide, truck production is expected to grow in India by about 4% in 2011 and 12% in 2012. In North America we will continue to benefit from the solid and steady specialty business which serves the bus, coach, fire and emergency segments. However we do see our North American defense business starting to slow down as the US government begins to reduce its requirements for the FMTV. This business has done well for us over the several last few years and has been a big contributor to our performance which helps us in last year’s challenging environment. The FMTV has been in production for 20 years and has been running at record volumes in recent years to support the increased troop requirements in both Iraq and Afghanistan. This program will continue to be contributor to our business but not at the high volumes we’ve experiencing over the past few years. In fact, we expect to see a considerable drop in the FMTV program as the government transitions its business from OEM to another and decreases its spend on defense program.  Volume levels for this program however are expected to pickup again sometime in 2012. We’ve been working on a number of other defense programs including the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle or JLTV defense program which is scheduled to replace Humvee in the 2013 or 2014 timeframe. Specific to the JLTV program, in April of this year the prime contractors delivered the demonstration test vehicle to US government and we are pleased to say we are working with two out of the three current companies bidding on this program.  Now let’s turn to slide eight, as you can see here approximately 72% of our global aftermarket and trailer business comes from North America, while freight ton miles in the US hit a low in 2009. We are expecting a steady recovery over the next several years. In addition, trailer production in North America is expected to more than double by 2012. While it is expected that trailer orders will continue to be flat in the third quarter. Our expectation is that we will some growth in the fourth quarter and more steady growth in 2011 and 2012 in both North America and Europe.  Trailer production volumes in North America are likely to reach about 100,000 units by the end of 2010 calendar year up from 80,000 in 2009 and growing to more than 200,000 by 2012. A similar although slower growth rate is anticipated in Europe moving to more than 115,000 units by 2010 from a row of 100,000 in 2009 and reaching more than 145,000 units in 2012. We are also beginning to see signs of increased aftermarket parts and remanufacturing demand in both the Americas and European markets. Incoming orders are up meaningfully from a year ago. Importantly, the after market business is growing significantly outside of North America which historically had been our primary market. Our European truck technique product line which we acquired two years ago has nearly doubled in size since last year. In the second quarter, we saw a 22% increase in sales in European aftermarket business from the same period last year. In fact, April was the best sales month ever for our aftermarket business in Europe. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig:  Thanks, Chip. As Chip mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the strong financial results accomplished by our global team this quarter. Most importantly, we have become much more consistent in our conversion of earnings to cash which as been a major area of focus throughout the organization. Slide nine compares our fiscal second quarter results to the outlook we provided last quarter. Both sales and adjusted EBITDA exceeded our expectations.  Our adjusted income from continuing operations was $15 million compared to the breakeven levels we reported last quarter. There were $12 million of favorable discreet tax items included in these results and I will speak to them in more detail on slide 11. But overall, the structural cost reduction actions we took last year continued to provide the expected operating leverage on increasing revenue.  We achieved positive free cash flow before factoring and restructuring, a $66 million despite our $33 million of semi annual bond interest payments made during the quarter. Our free cash flow was significantly higher than we expected as we continued to focus on working capital management and we’re partially assisted by the timing of our fiscal talent. Turning to the income statement on slide 10, we are into $0.18 per share of adjusted income from continuing operations in this second quarter. As compared by $0.15 loss for the same period last year. This result excludes $13 million of debt extinguishment losses associated with the tender offer for $175 million of our eight and three quarter percent notes which we completed in March. Also excluded from our adjusted results for two gains, $6 million dollar gain on full payoff of a note receivable that related to our sale of the emissions technologies business in 2007 and an $8 million benefit associated with the reversal of specific tax valuation allowances out the United States. Second quarter sales were up $245 million year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, second quarter sales were up $182 million or 19% as the truck and industrial markets in Brazil, China and India continue to be very strong for us. And the North American and European markets showed some modest improvement. On the year-over-year basis, SG&A increased from 6.1% of sales to 7.4% in the second quarter.  This was primarily due to the reinstatement of temporary cost reductions, including restoration of salary reductions and cost associated with variable concentration plans. Earnings in our minority owned affiliates were up significantly year-over-year to $11 million with the largest contribution coming from our joint ventures in Brazil, that’s a capitalized on the significant strength in truck and trailer markets in these regions. Again as mentioned earlier, our interest expense of $31 million for the quarter on a GAAP basis includes the extinguishment loss on our successful tender for the eight and three quarter percent notes. Our effective tax rate once again requires some additional explanation which is summarized on slide 11. As you can see on the first line of the slide, we will remain a tax payer in many other countries such as Brazil where we are not subjected to evaluation allowance. We are currently however unable to realize semi-tax benefit on losses in those jurisdictions which were subject to valuation allowances primarily the United States and Western Europe. We do not expect to be a tax payer in these jurisdictions for sometime when we have returned to profitability which is expected when our end customer markets recover to normal levels of demand. In fact 98% of the approximately $875 million of deferred tax assets expire after 2014 and more of than 80% expire after 2024. As mentioned earlier in the second quarter, we have recorded net tax benefits of $8 million related to the reversal of certain valuation allowances as well as some additional $12 million benefit primarily due to favorable adjustments associated with certain tax contingencies. These are not however expected to recur next quarter. As discussed earlier, the $8 million benefit was excluded from our adjusted income from continuing operations. Slide 12 shows second fiscal quarter segment adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA for our core business segments as well as the light vehicle segment. Commercial truck EBITDA and margin performance improved significantly year-over-year. As savings associated with cost and operational improvements allowed us to aggressively convert on the higher volumes experienced in Europe and the Americas. EBITDA margins in the industrial segment declined compared to the same quarter of last year, as the favorable impact of higher sales in Asia-Pacific this quarter was more than offset by the considerable benefit provided by MRAP shipments in the second quarter of 2009. Aftermarket in trailer EBITDA margins similarly declined year-over-year as higher core aftermarket in trailer sales this quarter were also more than offset by the benefit of MRAP service part sales last year. Light vehicle systems which consist primarily of our body systems operations earned $8 million of EBITDA in the second quarter. The structural cost savings we implemented last year allowed improved conversion on higher volumes in Europe, the Americas and Asia-Pacific. We are actively pursuing our strategy to divest the remaining LVS business and are working with interested parties towards the successful conclusion by the end of the calendar year 2010. In summary, total EBITDA for the quarter was $64 million up $32 million from last year with margins increasing from 3.3% to 5.3%. Slide 13, displays a sequential EBITDA margin lock for the first fiscal quarter. We continue to expand margins from 4.9% last quarter to 5.3%. In the second quarter, we benefited from increases in North American production as well as market share gains. In addition, higher medium and heavy duty production in Western Europe as well as the 25% quarter-over-quarter increase in South America truck sales provided significant margin improvement benefits. Margins also improved by 30 basis point as a result of our continuing performance plus productivity and cost reduction initiative. In the second quarter we experienced the full quarter effect of the previously announced reinstatement of temporary salary reductions as well as increases in accruals for variable compensation programs as noted on the temporary cost reduction line.  We don’t expect any further margin deterioration on the quarter-over-quarter basis going forward in this area as we believe this temporary cost reduction have reached full restoration levels. Let’s turn to slide 14, as I mentioned last quarter we planned to scorecard our performance towards our goal of converting at a rate of 20% to 25% on incremental revenue until we reach our 10% EBITDA margin target.  Net of the temporary cost reduction I just mentioned, we are pleased to report that we converted that to higher end of our target 25%. We do believe we will be at the lower end of the conversion target next quarter as we experienced a reduction in FMTV military sales which Chip discussed earlier. Turning to slide 15, let’s review free cash flow for the second quarter. We reported positive free cash flow of $45 million which was significantly better than the same quarter last year. This included an inflow from working capital despite an increase in sales during the quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, this was primarily due to cutoff issues associated with our fiscal calendar. Particularly the impact on days payables, which were approximately two days longer than normal as compared to the first quarter when they were three days shorter than normal. In addition, in this quarter we experienced some benefits from the mix of suppliers associated with seasonal product sales who provide longer payment terms. We also benefited in the second quarter from interest proceeds on the emission technologies note receivable mentioned previously. Our flows for the second quarter included decrease borrowings in our off-balance sheet factoring programs as well as payments from previously announced restructuring and trailing matters associated with discontinued operations.  Turning to slide 16, once again we are pleased with the stability of our cash flows quarter-to-quarter. In fact, this is the first time since of June of 2002, we had delivered four consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow. Moving to slide 17, as you know in the second quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions which significantly changed our capital structure and improved our liquidity.  We extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to 2014. We issued 20 million shares of common stock, resulting in approximately $200 million of net proceeds, issued $250 million of unsecured debt that matures in 2018 and repurchased a $175 million of existing 2012 unsecured debt. These actions significantly improved the maturity profile of our long term obligations and provided the financial runway for us to execute our gross strategies as a focused commercial vehicles supplier.  We also believe these transactions are all that is necessary from a capital market’s perspective to allow us to reach BB like credit statistics through normal balance sheet management as end markets recover to normal levels of demand. Slide 18 shows our current debt maturity profile. After completing the capital market transactions, we now have a clear runway until for 2015 maturity of $253 million. Turning to slide 19, we have continued to show progress on improving our liquidity and reducing the debt on our balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, liquidity increased to $834 million as a result of our continued cash generation and execution of the capital markets transactions. Simultaneously, we have reduced debt to just over $1 billion, the combination of which had significantly strengthened our balance sheet. On slide 20, you will see our updated 2010 planning assumption. Capital expenditures are unchanged and are expected to remain in the range of $90 million to $110 million including the needs of light vehicle systems. Interest expense is expected to remain in the range of $95 million to $110 million up to the capital markets transactions, as decreased borrowings are expected to offset higher borrowing cost. Note that we have increased our income tax expense assumption to a range of $50 million to $70 million primarily due to the market strength in Brazil and China, where we remained a tax payer. However, our expectations for cash income taxes are largely unchanged in the range of $30 million to $50 million. Turning to slide 21, we expect our sales and adjusted EBITDA to be flat in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. Our third quarter adjusted income from continuing operations is expected to be lower than the second quarter as a result of higher expected income tax expense due to the nonrecurring nature of the favorable discreet items realized this quarter. Free cash flow excluding factoring and restructuring is expected to be around breakeven as we believe we will experience greater working capital needs in the third quarter. And lastly we expect free cash flow to be slightly positive. I’ll now turn the call back over to Chip.
Chip McClure: Thanks, Jay. Before we open the call to your questions, I’d like to reiterate that we are hopeful that the rebound we are beginning to see in many of our markets is a start of a turn around for our industry. After spending 2009, reacting to the downturn and implementing some very tough cost reductions to get the results we needed to ensure our future, I believe we are now stronger than ever. Our accomplishments in the second quarter underscore the strength of our core business and demonstrated the initiatives would be implemented our working. We have cash flexibility to grow and are well positioned to take forward advantage of a global market as they rebound.  As we look ahead we’ll continue to focus on our priorities we align to you in December and these include a continued focus on cost management. Complete the sale of our light vehicle business which we are looking towards finishing sometime this calendar year. Successful execution during the rebound in our global markets, drive innovation by accelerating new products and advance fuel efficient technologies. Maintain our focus on sustainable profitable growth and continue to strengthen our balance sheet.  As the global markets recover and we leverage the strength of our worldwide operations, we are confident that our business will continue to deliver positive results. Thank you. Now lets open up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: My main question was just on Europe. I was hoping you guys could dwell into sort of what is driving some of the pick up in activity over there. Is it really just the fact that we cut into capacity just too much last year or are you seeing sort of underlying signs of demand as well that are kind of layered on there?
Chip McClure: Patrick this is Chip, I would say it’s probably more the former. If you look back when they did the reduction obviously they reduced inventory significantly to some of the season inventory build but more recently are again we are kind of bifurcated between Northern Europe and Southern Europe. We are seeing some strengthening in Northern Europe and obviously we are filing some of the activities going in Southern Europe. So I think initially it was probably more the inventory build and then some pick up in the market. Then I think the third part in that really is when you look at exports and a lot of the European truck manufacturers have a strong presence primarily in South America. So I would say probably the third part of that is export where they have primarily focus in South America.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs:  And then just on the North America side, I don’t know if you commented on it at the very beginning of the call. Can you tell us what are you guys seeing in terms of freight activity? Obviously we had a very strong March and has that been sort of sustained into April as far as you can tell?
Chip McClure: Yes, we are seeing, I would call it kind of a marginal increase in that so yeah I would say marginally improving but still seeing some incremental increase that way.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Himanshu Patel from JPMorgan.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan:  First just on the aftermarket business it looks like revenues were up but sequentially there was not a lot of profit improvement. Were most of the add backs on temporary cost cuts concentrated at that unit?
Chip McClure: No, actually the temporary add backs were pretty much kind of across the board, when you look at the year-over-year comparison I think probably the big difference is there was a large slug of MRAP orders back year ago in this quarter which is often referred to this you got kind of different time that kind of peaks up and it did peak up last year this time which we are not seeing the same benefit of that at this time. But the other part of your question the temporary increases were essentially across boards through our merit.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: What about sequentially, Chip? The business saw some revenue grow sequentially as well but there wasn’t a whole lot of EBITDA growth sequentially?
Jay Craig: The sales both in aftermarket and the trailer operations in that segment were up slightly sequentially from Q1 to Q2.
Chip McClure: I would say on some of that Himanshu, some of that were actually as I kind of indicated when you look at sales in Europe I think that starting to come back in the aftermarket side. And again we are seeing at both because of the seasonality but also improvement here in North America.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: And then on LVS division Chip, can you give just give us a little bit more color since the last time you spoke on the conference call. I have the discussions with number of potential buyers advanced anymore, have the number of buyers either expanded or potentially being narrowed down. And then maybe one another question for Craig what the pension deficit for the entire company, how much of that is allocated to LVS?
Chip McClure:   Let me go inside of LVS and then let Jay kind of talk on the pension and the transaction is continuously indicated before and we are trying to target a transaction, be completed by the close of the calendar year, this year. Books are out, initial bridge are coming in as we speak. I think there is still a great deal of interest out there for either body systems as a whole or in several pieces. So there is a great deal of interest from another potential buyers out there and as I think we said in the last couple of calls, we really got to a point that the cost deteriorate is really the minimum. So we want to make sure that our work is at the proper accordance but with the objective of achieving the best possible outcome for our shareholders, customers and employees. So, we continue to move along and there continuous to be interest out there for us.
Jay Craig : And how much on the pension question, we don’t break out between what is in the truck, what’s allocated to the truck in the light vehicle operations but just to give some color, the majority of it would be associated with commercial vehicle. We do have some European plans that are directly applicable to the light vehicle operations. But the majority of the US application is associated with the truck operations.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Robert W Baird.
Keith Schicker- Robert W. Baird: It’s actually Keith Schicker on the line for David. I was wondering, I think last quarter when we talked about the sequential outlook we gave, we discussed pretax income as well as unreasonable to expect that in an environment of flat revenue in adjusted EBITDA. We can do flat pretax income again sequentially?
Jay Craig : I think that’s to be expected probably after pretax. The biggest change as I mentioned in reviewing the slide this just pretax items. So they are below the line items are not expected to repeat in the third quarter. So the after tax number will be then be down because of that. 
Keith Schicker- Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then can you just walk me through the rationale and the strategic basis for removing the production facility in China?
Chip McClure: Yeah, actually because one is, for me the capacity; two is, it’s a little further in country a little bit more so obviously it gives us a better access to a number of other but both current and potential customers and; three, it gives us good access for future tactical people both on the manufacturing side and the engineering side.
Keith Schicker- Robert W. Baird: Would you expect any temporary impact on financial results as you’re moving things, how does that going work from business perspective of your company, right now?
Chip McClure: I don’t anticipate anything significant on that. I mean because we’re going to do this in a measured approach, we got people and the good news there is, we got the infrastructure in place that they can be people can move fairly easy that way. So, I do not anticipate a significant impact that way.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc: Let’s say, going back to slide 11, Jay and I was hoping that you could and I apologize I got distracted at this point but can you talk a little bit about what items you do not anticipate occurring in the third quarter versus the second quarter?
Jay Craig: Sure. On chart 11, that would be the third and fourth line from the top. So, the reversal of the valuation allowances and the lines label is other $8 million and $12 million respectively if we do not expect to recur.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc: Now in terms of contribution margins, 20% to 25%, we go sequentially forward, I know that you basically said we think we got a 25% contribution margin but we have some of these costs. As we look forward, is your expectation that you are hoping to convert at that 20% to 25% regardless of the additional or any additional cost rolling into the income statement or is there some other cost that you anticipate kind of coming online?
Jay Craig: As I mentioned in the presentation, we think we’ve reached the full run rate on the temporary cost reductions. We should not see any incremental amount coming in, in the future quarters. Now if you recall we did have a place for holder back in the December conference for some additional incremental investments. So, we may see some of that in the future as we go forward but I don’t think that should have a significant impact.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc: And then finally commodities cost steel price is seeing some up tick here. What are your thoughts on the impact of commodities going forward? Do you see that’s being a significant headwind, do you see that is something it’s manageable, something you can pass on to your customers. What’s your outlook for commodity cost?
Jay Craig: We surely believe that’s manageable and if we do expect the rapid increases that are being seen in iron ore and scrap metal, it will have some impact on us but just a slight impact and that’s just related to the like effect in terms of us receiving those higher price goods and then passing along those higher prices through our contractual agreements with our end customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays Capital.
Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital: I want to turn to a more strategic topic. Can you give us maybe Chip a summary of the competitive position in some of the more attractive faster growing markets particularly China, India and South America. Both as it relates to the current axle competitors on the light commercial vehicle side entrance coming over from the light vehicle side American axle meant met some initiatives on its call and then just the general attitude of the OEMs towards in-sourcing versus outsourcing as they are looking at a rebalance and continued growth in some of these markets?
Chip Craig : Let me start in Brazil and we did recently just announced additional investment to support MAN down there in a plant Resende which to me is kind of fact to one of your earlier questions asked about the increase in Europe. I think it’s a great indication of this type between European OEMs and the markets in South America; we want three suppliers that are going to the new supplier part that they are setting up there. So as I look at that I think we are very well positioned and the important thing is in all three of these markets I will talk about Brazil and in China; we’ve been in these markets grow long period of time and I mean a matter of decades not just a couple of years.  So I think that does position us well and clearly between our wholly owned facility down in Brazil and our joint venture is down there. We are very well positioned and the great deal of that business is outsourced and we are major producer on that both on the axle side which is in our wholly owned facility and then suspensions and brakes which are in our joint ventures with the Randon group down there. So we are well positioned there and I think the best indication that’s the most recent announcement on what we are able to do support MAN and down in the plant Resende. If I go to China, our real strength there is in the off-highway side and if you look at that in off-highway we’ve had a very successful operations in Xuzhou with XCMG who is a very significant off-highway producer of equipment over there and that’s been a very successful joint venture and we have mentioned the fact that I think back one or two earnings calls ago we actually are making additional investment in China for additional capacity in the off-highway side because of the continued expansion into Western China. So we are in very good shape in off-highway and on the on-highway side it’s really much of it is very much in source right now. So kind of similar what we experienced number of years ago in Europe where there kind of go through that evaluation. I think we do envision that will change overtime but right now as I look in China on the on-highway side a lot of that still is in-sourced but we continue to work with a number of the OEMs. I’ll just give you one example, we have announced about a year ago Yutong Bus that we are taking over part of that within there. So on the premium side, we are already making inroads there but clearly when you just look at the pure volume it’s a big opportunity there. A lot of that is in house and we are working with them to demonstrate how it makes sense to outsource it. If I then move to India, in our plant in Mysore again our facility have been in since the mid-80s. Our joint venture partner there is Bharat Forge, it has been a very successful operation. And majority of the product is Ashok Leyland and Tata, the third major player there being Mahindra and lot of the on-highway business in India is already outsourced and we are major supplier there. So as I look at that I think depending on whether it’s on-highway or off-highway and which region we are I think we are very well positioned that way.  To your second question as far as the competitive landscape vis-à-vis light vehicle versus a commercial vehicle, again we take all competitors very seriously. But I think as I look at that just a fact that we’ve had a long-term position there to understand the markets and to understand customers that demonstrated the capability and demonstrate quite frankly our commitment to those markets I think positions well going forward.

Chip McClure: Thank you, Brett and good morning, everyone. Last year, we worked incredibly hard to position ArvinMeritor to emerge from the downturn a stronger company, supporting the global commercial vehicle and industrial markets. We are pleased to report that we were able to maintain our forward momentum throughout the first quarter of 2010. I do want to say how proud we are of the ArvinMeritor global team who is responsible for delivering the good news we are announcing today. It was through their dedicated efforts to deliver on our promises that we were able to achieve better-than-expected results including stronger EBITDA, breakeven earnings per share, and positive free cash flow this quarter. We believe our positive results are a direct outcome of the very aggressive business improvement initiatives we implemented last year including our laser focus on expense management and streamlining our business with the goal of driving profitable growth. While we recognize the challenges that continue to persist, we believe we are well positioned in our markets around the world to perform well going forward. Now, let's turn to slide three to review some of the highlights of our first quarter. Our total sales for the quarter were up approximately 16% quarter-over-quarter. We believe that this increase in sales is a strong indication that the worst is behind us. In the first quarter, EBITDA before special items was $56 million, up 40% quarter-over-quarter. We reported breakeven earnings per share from continuing operations before special items. This compares to a loss of $0.65 per share in the same period last year. In addition, we reported free cash flow that was significantly higher year-over-year and we converted our incremental revenue slightly in excess of 20%. We also continue to invest in growing our industrial segment and expanding our position in emerging markets by announcing significant investments in our off-highway business in China. In January, we were named Heavy Duty Remanufacturer of the Year for 2009 by the Automotive Parts Remanufacturers Association. We were recognized for our efforts to expand all-makes portfolio of remanufactured products, grow revenue, streamline production and distribution systems, and develop innovative processes. While we are committed to the sale of our body systems business, we are pleased with the financial results this team has been able to deliver, as well as the outstanding job they are doing in winning new business. Now, let's turn to slide four. The key takeaway on this slide is that we are improving our performance in lower sales, primarily in the areas of earnings per share and free cash flow. Sales were down slightly year-over-year as the commercial truck production remained stable in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, particularly in Europe. Nonetheless, we achieved breakeven earnings per share from continuing operations before special items. This compares to a loss of $0.65 in the same quarter in 2009 and a loss of $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Improved performance on lower sales is a true testament to the strategy of our core business. It also demonstrates that the actions we've been taking to reduce cost and change the way we run our business are paying off. Also, we significantly improved our year-over-year free cash flow performance, reporting a positive cash inflow of $2 million compared to a negative cash outflow of $386 million in the first quarter of 2009. This also represents the third consecutive quarter we reported positive free cash flow. Let's now turn to slide five. On this slide, you can see that we achieved quarter-over-quarter improvements in our sales and EBITDA results. Our total sales from continuing operations for the quarter were approximately $1.1 billion or 16% higher than our fourth quarter. However, we achieved a 40% sequential increase in EBITDA from continuing operations before special items as we delivered $56 million in the first quarter. This EBITDA performance is a direct result of the aggressive cost improvements that we maintained through previous restructuring, as well as plant operations and material performance. We are especially proud to deliver these results in what has been a challenging environment. Importantly, while our year-over-year sales were lower, we are pleased we are beginning to trend in the right direction. We saw a slight upturn in North American orders due to improvements in our market share, as well as a small amount of pre-buy activity in the fourth quarter of last year. Our light vehicle body systems business also reported stronger sales. In addition, with the support of government stimulus programs, the Chinese, Brazilian, and Indian markets performed well, demonstrating that they are on their way to a solid recovery. Let's now turn to slide six. As I said earlier, in this quarter we were able to convert on sales slightly in excess of 20% while maintaining structural cost improvements and reinstating full salary for our employees. We are benefitting from all the actions we've taken during the past year and therefore believe that we will continue to convert on increased revenue as commercial vehicle production rebounds globally. The actions we've taken to improve our material costs are taking hold throughout the company around the world and the labor and burden performance by our plant and manufacturing teams has been outstanding and we have a process in place that will help us continue to control our overhead and indirect material spend. Let's now turn to slide seven. I want to take just a few minutes to cover some of the progress we are making on our strategy to grow our business profitably. As you know, a big portion of our strategy is to expand our business into emerging markets with a primary focus on Brazil, India, and China where healthy long-term growth in commercial vehicles and aftermarket is expected. We are currently benefitting from the strong sales growth in these markets, which are primarily driven by their government stimulus programs supporting infrastructure spending. South America has been and will continue to be an important market for us. As you can see from the chart in this slide, we expect to see strong medium and heavy-duty truck production in 2010. The OEM order board is already showing 28% higher volumes over last year. To support this growth, we are continuing to make investments in this market to ensure we are competitive and we will be able to meet the increased demand for trucks and buses. We are investing in our manufacturing sites to improve productivity and increase capacity including the recent announcement to invest an additional $10 million in one of our plants in Brazil. We are also pleased that our customers recognize us as a strong player. A few months ago, we received the 2009 Best-of-the-Best Supplier Award from MAN, one of our key customers in South America. Let's take a look at India on slide eight. The GDP in India is expected to reach 7% to 8% this year and 2010 production for medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses is expected to be up by more than 80,000 units year-over-year. India is one of the fastest growing markets for our company. To continue to secure our future there, we are stepping up our investments in products and technology. We are introducing products that are specifically designed for the Indian market. Two weeks ago, we launched an all-new two-speed, high-efficiency drive axle at the Auto Expo in Delhi that suits the very terrain conditions in India and we are investing an additional $2 million in our new technical center in Bangalore to expand our test capabilities for axles and brakes. Let's turn to slide nine. China is a prime example and prime market for our expansion strategy due to the continued growth of the commercial vehicle and off-highway business in the region. The nearly $600 billion stimulus program by the Chinese government is helping to drive that growth. It's expected that commercial truck production will be up year-over-year by a 128% and bus and coach production will be up by 33%. Accordingly, we are targeting China as one of our largest growth opportunities and we are making considerable investments in our on and off-highway and aftermarket businesses. We recently established an aftermarket organization in China to take advantage of the growing need for support and service to off-highway and bus and coach customers. For example, we are supporting XCMG, one of the largest off-highway OEMs in China by setting up aftermarket service centers in the mining communities. We are also planning to make significant investments with our Chinese partner XCMG in our off-highway manufacturing and product capabilities to help ensure that we capture that business in one of the largest off-highway markets in the world. Let's turn to slide 10. 2009 was an exciting year for us in terms of product innovation and technology development. Throughout the downturn, when the most companies were reducing R&D investment, we allocated available resources to invest in engineering research and development to ensure that we have the right products and advanced technologies to meet our customers' needs. As I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter of 2010, we kept our promise to continue to drive innovation and develop new products. We are launching an all-new high-efficiency tandem axle in March at the Mid-America Truck Show and I hope many of you will be able to join us there to personally preview this new product. We are very excited about the recent announcement by the Department of Energy on the SuperTruck development funding program. ArvinMeritor is one of the key suppliers to provide advanced fuel efficiency and safety technologies for this vehicle. In early January, we demonstrated our advanced hybrid drivetrain and stability control safety technologies for Class A commercial trucks to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and members of his staff. Secretary LaHood was very interested in our heavy truck hybrid capabilities that will help reduce energy consumption, emissions, and greenhouse gases, as well as safety technologies that reduce accidents and save lives. Now, let's turn to slide 11. Our defense segment continues to be a strong business for us. We have a long history of being successful in developing and providing advanced technologies to our military customers and they have rewarded us with a number of contracts over the years. We continue to be excited about additional opportunities we see for the future in this arena. As you can see from this slide, we've been selected as a key supplier on BAE's Caiman demonstration vehicle for the U.S. government's MRAP program. The new Caiman is equipped with Meritor's High Mobility Independent Suspension. This new vehicle is intended to better address the military's needs in Afghanistan. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thanks Chip. Before I begin a detailed review of the charts, I'd like to mention that our financial statements now reflect the adoption of new accounting standards for the presentation of minority interest, as well as the treatment of convertible debt, which has resulted in restated historical results. Starting on slide 12, which compares our fiscal first quarter results from continuing operations to the guidance we had previously given you for the quarter, as well as the fiscal fourth quarter results. In nearly every category, we achieved or exceeded our previous guidance. EBITDA before special items increased 40% sequentially to $56 million on 16% of additional revenue. Free cash flow was a positive $2 million, a significant improvement from first quarter results in previous years and is a testament to our continued discipline in managing working capital performance. Free cash flow before factoring in restructuring was more negative than expected due to sequential sales increases requiring investments in working capital in all of our global markets. However, due to our continued focus on working capital management, this investment was able to be almost entirely offset by our sale of receivable programs in Europe. In addition, due to the cutoff of customer payments over the holiday period, certain customer payments were not received until after quarter-end. Overall, we are encouraged by the consistency of our ability to convert earnings to cash, driven by our team's continued focus on improving asset utilization. Slide 13 is our income statement from continuing operations before special items for the first quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was breakeven as compared to a $0.65 loss for the same period last year on 6% lower sales. This dramatic improvement in earnings performance is due entirely to the success of our cost-cutting efforts including the significant benefits of the light vehicle businesses we were able to accomplish in fiscal 2009. I'll walk through an analysis of how we are converting on incremental sales a little further on in the presentation. On a constant currency basis, first quarter sales were down $132 million year-over-year or 11%, primarily due to the strong European market that still existed in our fiscal first quarter last year. Earnings in our minority owned affiliates were up significantly year-over-year as benefits from cost improvements made in 2009 continued to be realized and our joint ventures in Brazil benefitted from the strong recovery seen in their local markets. So overall, very strong results with earnings from continuing operations excluding special items totaling $17 million before tax. Our effective tax rate may again require some additional explanation, which I will now go through on slide 14. Last quarter, we discussed the effects of the valuation allowances established against U.S. and selected Western European deferred tax assets in fiscal 2009. Remember, as noted on the first line of slide 14, we remain a taxpayer in the majority of countries such as Brazil, which are not subject to valuation allowances. However, we are currently unable to realize any tax benefit on losses in those jurisdictions, which are subject to valuation allowances. I remind you that we would expect any future income in jurisdictions with valuation allowances to be earned tax-free. Let's turn to slide 15, which shows fiscal first quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for our core business segments, Commercial Truck, Industrial, Aftermarket & Trailer, as well as the Light Vehicle segment. Commercial Truck, which consists primarily of our European, North and South American OE commercial vehicle businesses, delivered a solid improvement despite lower revenue this quarter as compared to the same period last year. Commercial Truck EBITDA margins improved largely as a result of the considerable cost in operational improvements we have achieved and maintained. The Industrial segment, consisting primarily of our former specialty businesses, specifically off-highway, military, construction, bus and coach, and fire and emergency, as well as all of our Asia-Pacific operations, delivered consistent results compared to the same quarter last year. The absence of last year's benefit from the MRAP program was more than offset by the growth in off-highway and other Asia-Pacific activities including a robust commercial truck market in India. Aftermarket & Trailer EBITDA was flat year-over-year as a 13% reduction in revenue was offset by structural cost improvements achieved in 2009. Light Vehicle Systems, consisting primarily of body systems earned $8 million of EBITDA in the first quarter. Revenues were 32% higher year-over-year on stronger European, Asia-Pacific and North American light vehicle volumes. And margins benefitted from the significant cost actions achieved in 2009. We continue to execute our strategy to preserve the value in this business including new program launches and continued support of our customers, which we are confident will allows us to achieve the best outcome for our shareholders as we work to divest the remainder of Light Vehicle Systems. As I mentioned earlier, total EBITDA was $56 million, up $40 million from last year with margins increasing to 4.9%. Slide 16 displays a sequential EBITDA margin block from the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. We are pleased with the progress we've made in continuing to expand margins from 4.1% last quarter to 4.9% this quarter. This keeps us on track towards our long-term goal of achieving 10% EBITDA margins at normal customer demand levels. As Chip mentioned, in the first quarter we benefited from increases in North American production, resulting from pre-buy activity, as well as market share gains. In addition, medium and heavy-duty truck production of Western Europe was up over 50% and production of medium and heavy-duty trucks in South America increased by more than 25% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to benefit from our performance plus productivity and other cost initiatives, improving margins by 100 basis points. As previously announced, we reinstated salary and variable pay programs, resulting in a decrease of 1.6 percentage points as noted on the temporary cost reduction side. LVS performed significantly better, converting on an increase of 20% in revenue, which improved our margins by 60 basis points. Let's turn to slide 17. We previously stated that we plan to convert at a rate of 20% to 25% on incremental revenues, net of the restoration of temporary cost reductions and additional engineering and market investments. This chart shows we did just that. Going forward, for some time, we would continue to expect to convert at similar rates. Slide 18 shows free cash flow for the quarter. Free cash flow was a positive $2 million, in line with our previous guidance and dramatically better than previous years. Although we saw an increase in absolute working capital as production volumes increased in the first quarter, we maintained relatively consistent working capital performance. Also, we received cash inflows from our off-balance sheet factoring programs as revenue increased in the European commercial truck market. Turning to slide 19, you will see that we significantly outperformed free cash flow performance compared to the first quarter of previous years. Our cash flows are much more stable quarter-to-quarter as we are achieving improved inventory turns and consistent receivable and payable performance. The first quarter result of a positive $2 million represents our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. On slide 20, you will see that our 2010 planning assumptions are unchanged. Capital expenditures are expected to remain in the range of $90 million to $110 million including $25 million to $30 million attributable to Light Vehicle Systems. Interest expense remains in the range of $95 million to $110 million. Income tax expense before special items remains in the range of $40 million to $60 million. Cash income taxes are expected to be in the range of $25 million to $50 million. Turning to slide 21, we expect our sales, EBITDA, income before taxes and free cash flow before factoring in restructuring to be flat in the second quarter compared to results achieved in the first quarter. Free cash flow is expected to be slightly negative in the second quarter as we plan to make our semi-annual bond interest payments. I'll now turn the call back over to Chip.
Chip McClure: Thanks, Jay. Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to just reiterate that we are encouraged by our continued progress. Our accomplishments in the first quarter underscore the strength of our core business and demonstrate that the initiatives we've implemented are working. We are committed to completing the transformation of our company into one that is focused on the commercial vehicle and industrial markets. We made significant progress in 2009 and we will maintain our efforts in the years ahead. As we execute our strategy and implement our operational initiatives, we remain committed to our rigorous cost management initiatives so we can continue to realize improved operating leverage. We will remain focused on our strategy to drive innovation by accelerating our development of new products and advanced fuel-efficient technologies, maintain our focus on sustainable profitable growth and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. As the global markets recover and we can leverage the strength of our worldwide operations, we are confident that we will deliver and grow our business. Thank you. Now, let's turn it over for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And standby for the first question. And our first question comes from the line of Himanshu Patel from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Himanshu Patel – J.P. Morgan: Hi, good morning guys.
Chip McClure: Good morning, Himanshu.
Himanshu Patel – J.P. Morgan: A couple of questions. On the temporary cost add-backs of $19 million for Q1, can you just help us think through for the next few quarters? Would there be any additional such add-backs that we should be thinking about?
Jay Craig: Well, I think as we – Himanshu, this is Jay. Good morning. I think as we guided in December, we expected – I think was $52 million annually of those add-backs. So certainly, we do expect additional add-backs as the quarters go on. It's still within that range. Remember that the $52 million that we disclosed in December was a number directed towards guidance for just our core operations and included in the amount for the quarter is also some of the add-backs of pay and variable compensation for the light vehicle operations as well.
Himanshu Patel – J.P. Morgan: And so the remaining $33 million or so, that should be spread over maybe throughout the next three quarters or so, Jay?
Jay Craig: It should, but again, the $52 million was just for the CVS operations. So that net difference of $33 million maybe a bit larger, because we do have some light vehicle restoration of pay cuts and variable compensation that we expect for the remainder of the year up until the point that we get to the disposal of that business.
Himanshu Patel – J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then can we talk a little bit about LVS? It looks like the business has turned a corner, back into the block at still relatively low volumes. Just any kind of updates on how easy it would be to potentially divest this business now? Could there still be exit costs associated with it that we should be thinking about or maybe now that it's not losing money maybe the sale is a little bit easier in terms of dollar cost involved for you guys?
Chip McClure: Well, Himanshu, let me start – this is Chip. Let me first of all start by saying, yes, there is no question that we have really focused on that and actually going back to the better part of the year to make sure we can improve the cost performance on that and I see – I think you are seeing that reflected in the first quarter results on that. I'll also tell you there is a significant level of interest in body systems business by a lot of global players. So that is still clearly out there that way. And we are still committed to that process of moving forward with that. So yes, I think it is. As we look at that – and I guess the third thing as we should also say, there is some volume increase we have seen in some areas. And fourthly, as I kind of indicated in my comment, is there are some new program wins that our body team has done, all of which I think adds to the overall enterprise value of the business. So as we look at, bottom line, a lot of interest out there from a lot of global players and clearly, our focus is to go through this process through 2010 to make sure we get the best outcome for our shareholders, customers, employees, but we do feel good about the process going forward.
Himanshu Patel – J.P. Morgan: And so is it your view that the sale could still happen sometime this fiscal year?
Chip McClure: That is our target at this point, to continue moving forward with that. Yes.
Himanshu Patel – J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. And then one last question. Just any updates on sort of balance sheet thoughts, whether it's in terms of an equity raise or a convert or whatever? Where are you guys thinking about capital structure in light of what's going on with end markets, any development since the Analyst Day on that?
Jay Craig: I think we are – our thinking is still very consistent with where we were at the Analyst Day, which is our near-term focus is working on the renewal of the revolving credit facility, which we know will involve looking at our 2012 bonds applications and our need to refinance at least a portion of those.
Himanshu Patel – J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Hi, good morning.
Chip McClure: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Can you just give us a little bit of an overview in terms of how you see the order book shaping up both in Europe and North America? I understand in North America there was a bit of a pre-buy and maybe a little bit softer in the interim, but Europe also – may also be getting better on the margin. Can you just give us your thoughts on those two regions?
Chip McClure: Sure. As you look at it, we are seeing it – I think in reverse order, we are seeing some incremental increase in Europe and obviously, I think that is from the very deep bottom that they were at this past summer. So we are seeing a sequential increase in Europe. Here in North America, as I look at that, really it's kind of our order board, if you will, is booked out through the end of this quarter and into early next quarter with a lot of the 2009 engines that are now being put into vehicles. So we do see that through this quarter and into the beginning of next quarter with some improving strength of orders out into the May-June time frame. And then looking longer term, we are starting to see some 2010-compliant truck build orders being placed, but still it's very early on that. So as we see it the next several months, we do see a strong order board for the engines that were built in 2009 and we, like others, continue to see what takes place in the second half of the year as it relates to 2010 compliant engines.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: And what are the trends in China? Obviously, there has been a little bit of trepidation about potential softening there on the back of monetary policy actions. Has that affected your businesses at all?
Chip McClure: We are still 24/7 there. If I look at our China business in particular, it is primarily off-highway and so as you look at the infrastructure build, which about half the stimulus funds are targeted for that, that continues very strong in that way. And as I kind of indicated in my comment, we have actually made some additional increment investment with our partner there to do that. So we actually see that, because of the businesses we are in, continuing very strong even currently and kind of going forward.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Great. And I guess last question. In terms of working capital, should we – is the way to think about it sort of modeling working capital sort of increase in line with what you see in this quarter as sales continue to ramp up. But then something that I guess would be fully offset with your factoring facilities, just a little – if you could give us a little bit more guidance on how to think of that?
Jay Craig: Sure. Yes – good morning, Patrick. This is Jay. Couple points to make note of there is, one, our working capital metrics are staying relatively constant. So I think you are going to look at changes in revenue and then the consistency of our working capital metrics with some improvement in inventory turns. But as far as the ability, if there was rapid increases in revenues, to offset that with off-balance sheet factoring, it depends on the mix of that revenue growth. If it's – if it predominantly comes from Europe where those programs exist for us, it would be offset by the off-balance sheet factoring programs. If it come – if the growth is more heavily weighted towards North America, that would have less of a benefit for us.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson for Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital: Good morning. A couple of questions. First, your sales and EPS and EBITDA, you are guiding flat sequentially, but it seems that you are looking at increased sequential production, at least on the commercial vehicle side. Is that right? I mean, what are – A, what are the production assumptions behind your second quarter guidance; and two, if it's – if production is going up, what's keeping EBITDA flat?
Jay Craig: I think on the production assumption side, we are not providing production assumptions into the – into our second fiscal quarter. We – part of it is also, Brian, that on the light vehicle side, which is included in our guidance. We are seeing some of the runoff of the European stimulus programs, particularly the one in Germany just ended and then France is scheduled to end shortly. And our light vehicle business body systems, the lion's share of its business is directed towards the European market. So we do expect some small decline there that maybe offset by some continued growth on the commercial vehicle side. But we are seeing – on the commercial vehicle side for example, we are expecting North American demand to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter.
Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital: Okay. And second, any update on your litigation over transmissions with Eaton Corporation?
Chip McClure: Well, as you know, just to kind of give you a background of that, that – the trail was bifurcated in two phases, the liability phase and the damages phase. And as you know, the courts did rule in our favor on the liability phase. So we are – and at this point, Eaton has stated kind of publicly they plan to appeal the decision. So at this point, we are kind of moving along with the court on that as they move towards the damages phase. But at this point, there is no other update than what we provided the last time and obviously, at the same time, we do recognize that Eaton has stated their public intention to appeal the process. So we are somewhat just in the process with the court right now.
Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital: Can they appeal it with before the damages – before the damages phase and is there a date for the damages phase?
Chip McClure: I don't know if there has been a date set at this point, Brian. And obviously, the rest of that kind of have to defer to the court and that's why we really deferred to the court as to the process for that. So no date has been set at this point.
Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc: Thank you very much. Chip, Jay.
Chip McClure: Good morning, Brett.
Jay Craig: Good morning.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc: Good morning. Commodity costs, any sense of what your expectations are for commodities in fiscal year upcoming?
Jay Craig: Brett, we are seeing just a slight increase in commodity costs, nothing that is overly concerning to us. But again, on our – remember, if you recall on our commercial vehicle business, we do have what we believe are very effective pass-through mechanisms that do have some lags associated with them, but had worked quite effectively as those costs have increased in the past. But right now, we are expecting fairly insignificant commodity cost increases.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc: Okay. And then as you ponder potential equity offering, what are some of the chief factors that you are thinking about? And then as far as timing is concerned, where is your – where are your thoughts in terms of timing? And I guess specifically, I think one of the key issues that you mentioned earlier before was refinancing some of your debt and so forth. But can you talk a little bit about some of the chief factors you are considering and the timing?
Jay Craig: Well, thanks for the easy question, Brett, on pondering. But the – I think as we look at our long-term goal of being to BB credit metric, we look at all of our planning assumptions within that timing horizon and try to ascertain if we will generate internally the liquidity required to meet those goals. And we take that input into consideration in looking at any capital market activities we are considering making in the future and look at that in its entirety. So that's kind of where we are in the process right now.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc: Okay. And as far as – I know that you had a goal of refinancing your – I think your revolver by this June, if I'm not mistaken. Where are we at in that process? Are you – have you begun discussions at this point in time or are you in the middle of discussions, are you finishing discussions or is this something – I mean, where are you at in that process?
Jay Craig: We are still feeling that we – you are correct in restating that our goal is by this summer of this year to hopefully have completed that process. And we are still feeling comfortable that that is an achievable goal at this time.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc: Okay, okay. Well, thank you very much, gentlemen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Selle from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Eric Selle – J.P. Morgan: Hey, good morning. I've been on and off the call because there is a lot of stuff going on. So I apologize if I'm repeating anything. But can you guys give us the cash cost that you guys anticipate to shutting or selling the remaining LVS business?
Jay Craig: I think we – again, we have put previously some disclosures in the 10-K that were written in the context of looking at the rest of the company. But we are – I would say we are encouraged with the recent performance, but we should recall that the body systems business, which is the bulk of the remaining light vehicle business, does reside a portion of it in Western Europe. So as we are looking at alternatives there, there could be some required restructuring cost to just contract some of that production capability there. But we are working to minimize any of those obligations and again feel encouraged by recent performance.
Eric Selle – J.P. Morgan: And then on that regard, is the cash restructuring – did you guys give any guidance for cash restructuring for this year?
Jay Craig: Yes, we have guidance on the cash – cash piece of the restructuring and I think it is $25 million we are expecting in cash restructuring. The amount incurred in the first quarter was $5 million.
Eric Selle – J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then Cummins came out and said the first half 2010 orders are down 80% versus the second half in '09. Is this in line with your outlook?
Chip McClure: Yes, this is Chip. And as I look at that, what they are really talking about, I believe, is 2010-built engines. As I indicated, we are still seeing a good order book kind of going forward for the next several months because it really is being built with 2009 engines. So ours is a little different that way. We do see some uncertainty till we get to the second half of the year as it relates to 2010 engines. But as you look at the next quarter or quarter-and-a-half for us, if you will, our third fiscal quarter, because of the inventory of 2009 engines, we do see a strong order book there, but then we – like I commented and kind of saying we then have to look at the second half of the year for the ramp-up in the 2010 engines. So it's just a little different where they are in the supply chain and they are kind of upfront with engine supply and we are more down towards the end of the finished trucks. So it's the difference in timing.
Eric Selle – J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. And then finally, just the amount outstanding on your AR securitization and factoring programs?
Jay Craig: Right now, I believe, what is – what's outstanding at the end of the quarter on the off-balance sheet line [ph] was $147 million as of the end of December. And that was an increase of $54 million from the previous quarter-end.
Eric Selle – J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thanks a lot for your time.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc: Good morning, gentlemen.
Chip McClure: Hi, Brett.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc: Just a quick question. LVS, cash flow, EBITDA is up – I think you said last quarter, cash flow in the LVS is kind of roughly breakeven. I'm wondering still breakeven up a little bit.
Jay Craig: I think it's a still around breakeven. I mean, it's consistent with the overall results for the company.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc: Okay. Very good. Thank you very much, gentlemen.
Jay Craig: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Derrick Wenger from Jefferies & Co. Please proceed.
Derrick Wenger – Jefferies & Co.: Yes, thank you. A four-part question. You had mentioned the cash restructuring charges. How about the accrual restructuring charges for fiscal year '09 to '10? Those were $2 million in the first quarter. Second question is the SG&A ticked up to about 7.4% in the first quarter. Is this a level that we can kind of use going forward, the increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues? And then there is two other follow-ups. I guess you have $61 million of letter of credits against this $666 million line, I just wanted to confirm that. And then what were revenues from continuing ops in the first quarter?
Jay Craig: Okay, I'll try to – just making a note of the questions here. First question on the accrual for restructuring, you are correct; we had $2 million in the first quarter. We have not disclosed guidance on that, but I think we – I would say we expect that the run rate on that maybe a bit higher as we go on in the year. The – as far as the percentage of SG&A, certainly the step-up to 7.4% from 6.7% in Q4 was entirely due to the temporary cost reductions that were reinstated in the first quarter, primarily the pay reinstatement and some variable compensation accruals. I don't think as a percentage, you should necessarily hold that constant in the future because some of that cost is fixed at this point in time going forward. As far as letters of credit, our letters of credit at 12/31 were actually $26 million against our line of credits – line of credit. And then I think your last question was, if I recall correctly, revenues from continuing operations.
Derrick Wenger – Jefferies & Co.: Yes.
Jay Craig: We – right now, that is $1.146 billion and recall that our light vehicle, the body business, is still included in continuing operations.
Derrick Wenger – Jefferies & Co.: Okay. And just a follow-up on that letter of credit. Isn't your line $666 million because I thought I saw on the release that you have $605 million available?
Jay Craig: The line is – the availability was $605 million and the – again, the letters of credit were $26 million.
Derrick Wenger – Jefferies & Co.: Okay. So total availability of your $666 million –
Jay Craig: I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question for a moment. The borrowings under the revolver were $35 million at the end of the year.
Derrick Wenger – Jefferies & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Jay Craig: You are welcome.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session for today's program. And I'd like to turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.
Chip McClure: Yes, this is Chip McClure again. I just want to thank everybody for their time, their questions, and their attention and support. And we look forward to talking to you in the near future. I wish you all a good day. Thank you very much.
Jay Craig: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Charles G. McClure, Jr.: As we reflect back on 2009, we'll always remember it as one of the most challenging years we've experienced in our history. The dramatic decline in volumes driven by a collapse in both the automotive and trucking industries, as well as in the credit markets, meant that we had to act quickly and readjust our business both financially and operationally. We made drastic changes to how we ran our business and we implemented rigorous cost cutting initiatives throughout the year.  The decisions we made were tough and sometimes very unpopular. But the steps we took were necessary and we're seeing them payoff. I'm proud of the many accomplishments we made during the year despite the challenges we faced. And I'm especially proud that even amidst of all the difficulties we never lost sight of our overarching strategy to transform the company with a focus on the global commercial vehicle and industrial markets.  We could not have done this, however, without the support of our global workforce. Our people made a lot of sacrifices throughout the year and it was because of their perseverance, commitment and dedication that we were able to deliver on our 2009 priorities while simultaneously managing the company through a global recession. We're now a leaner more efficient company and we're well positioned for growth.  Now, let's turn to slide three to review the financial highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2009. I'm going to review fourth quarter results with you and Jay will cover our 2009 full fiscal year in a few minutes. We're pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Our total sales for the quarter were $984 million, which is up approximately 4% from our third quarter, but down from $1.5 billion or 36% from the fourth quarter of last year.  Given the extraordinary circumstances of the past year, we're not surprised by these year-over-year sales results. We believe that the sales increase reflected in our fourth quarter, however, may indicate that we're beginning to see signs that the worst is over.  We're especially pleased with our EBITDA performance that we've been able to achieve throughout the year despite the deterioration of the global markets we serve. In the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $40 million up $12 million or 43% quarter-over-quarter. The EBITDA improvement is a direct result of the aggressive cost improvements we implemented through restructuring, planned operations and material performance.  We're also beginning to see a slight improvement in our pre-tax income and achieving a positive result this quarter of $2 million. We reported a net loss of $20 million or $0.28 per share from continuing operations before special items in the fourth quarter. This compares to the $26 million or $0.35 per share we earned in the same period last year. We're again especially proud of our cash flow performance. We continue to generate positive free cash flow quarter-over-quarter because of the outstanding job that our people have done to improve working capital by controlling inventory and reducing past due receivables.  For the second consecutive quarter, we reported positive free cash flow generating $22 million in the quarter compared to $73 million in the last quarter and $103 million from the same period last year. We're pleased with our continued ability to generate cash, which again results from the significant improvements we've made to our operations, as well as reducing our overall structural costs.  Let's now review some of our 2009 business highlights by turning to slide four. As I mentioned earlier, I'm very proud of how quickly our people adapted to the downturn in our global markets last year. It was through the aggressive cost cutting initiatives we implemented, as well as the tremendous performance we achieved in working capital, that we were able to successfully manage through this unprecedented challenging time.  Of course, we also benefited from the significant cost cutting measures we identified and implemented since we first launched our Performance Plus program in 2007. I'll cover these savings in more detail in a few minutes.  Even as our markets collapsed last year, we remain committed to continue to invest in our future by making investments in engineering, research and development, and the necessary capital expenditures to maintain our high quality standards. During the year, we began production of our state of the art facility in Monterrey, Mexico and we expanded our engineering and technical capabilities in India. We're also very encouraged by the number of new business wins we've been awarded from our commercial truck and specialty customers this year. These contracts are just another step in securing our long-term prosperity. I'll discuss some of these new contracts on the next slide.  We recently announced the completion of the sale of our light vehicle wheels business and that we've substantially completed the divestiture of the light vehicle chassis business. In light of the harsh economic realities we faced, we're please with our efforts to comply with our debt covenants and maintain adequate liquidity throughout the year.  In September, we announced that we entered into a new two-year U.S. receivable securitization agreement and in October we renewed our French factoring and Swedish securitization programs with Nordea Bank. We believe that these actions have put us in a position to be in compliance with our financial covenants through the remaining term of the facility. We're continuing to work hard to sustain our momentum and although the road ahead remains uncertain, we believe we put the right things in place to benefit from the improving conditions we're beginning to see in our global markets. Now let's turn to slide five. As I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with the significant new business wins in 2009. As we announced earlier this year, we signed a long-term supply contract for standard position on medium and heavy duty applications with Navistar. This new business significantly increases our market share with Navistar in North America.  In addition, we expanded our business with longstanding customers, such as Diamond Trucks North America. Earlier in the year we executed a multi-year agreement to supply them with axles, brakes and drivelines. Geographic growth and diversity is critical to our success. And in the fourth quarter we began production at our previously signed strategic supply agreement with [Utang Group] to supply drive chain components for busses and coaches in China.  Also, as part of this partnership, we and [Utang] will sell and distribute standard aftermarket service parts. This partnership provides us with the opportunity to expand our commercial vehicle aftermarket business in the Asia Pacific region.  We also expanded our aftermarket remanufacturing sales to new OEM customers and independent distributors this year through truck technique in Europe and Mascot in North America. This supports our strategy to increase our customer base and significantly grow our aftermarket business globally.  Our military business also continues to be a strong contributor. We began production of our Navistar MXT for the British Ministry of Defense last quarter. We've also commenced on delivering our advanced independent suspension systems to Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems in support of the military's technology, development and demonstration phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program. We believe our new business wins demonstrates our customers continued confidence in our products and our engineering and technology capability.  Let's turn to slide six. Throughout 2009 we were laser focused on expense management and streamlining our business with the goal of driving profitable growth. While keeping this focus we continued to invest in new products and advance technologies primarily in the areas of drive train efficiency and vehicle dynamics.  In 2009, we introduced the Meritor Dual-Mode Class 8 Hybrid demonstrator vehicle, which is a revolutionary technology development targeted specifically at line haul truck applications. We believe this technology will improve fuel efficiency by 15% or more. We developed an all new family of off highway single reduction planetary axles, as well as a new family of off highway brakes leveraging our core engineering capabilities.  We expanded Meritor's tactics high mobility independent suspension product line, which features best in class mobility and enhances a performance of military vehicles in extreme common environments. This product is available with active ride height controls and semi-active damping. We launched a Meritor MXL extended lube drive-line providing our customers with reduced maintenance costs and longer service interval.  We introduced our new platinum shield technology offering best in class brake corrosion resistance and we're currently testing our new Meritor Q Plus drum brake with fleet customers to meet new stopping distance regulations.  Last but not least, we're also moving toward our strategy to strengthen our electronics and controls capabilities. In support of this effort, we recently combined our commercial vehicle electronics and LVS Smart Systems advanced technology grooves. We'll now be able to better optimize our advance fuel efficiency and mobility engineering capabilities. Moving on to slide seven. Throughout the year we made substantial progress on our transformation. With limited resources and cash to invest, we decided to concentrate on our core business. Our strategy, plain and simple, is to have a keen focus on enhancing more attractive targeted growth opportunities with higher margins, and we believe the direction we're taking is right on track. As you can see from the charts on this page, we moved from a 69% light vehicle business in 2003 to a 25% light vehicle business today. As you know, we've accomplished a great deal of a divestiture of most of the LVS business and we're moving forward to become 100% focused on the commercial vehicle and industrial markets.  Since we first set out on this transformation in 2004, we've sold our light vehicle aftermarket, emissions technologies, and wheels businesses. In addition, we've essentially completed the process of divesting most of the light vehicle chassis business, which should help us improve our overall profitability and eliminate future cash burn that resulted from this organization.  Since we determined to exit chassis, we've completed a sale of our ownership interest stake in Gabriel De Venezuela, sold Gabriel Ride Control North America and we recently announced that we completed the sale of our stake in our Meritor's suspensions systems company joint venture.  The small remaining chassis businesses are operating near breakeven. These businesses primarily support the LVS suspension module assembly operations of the United States, as well certain European operations. U.S. module assembly operations are expected to continue through the term of existing supply contracts, which end in March 2010 and December 2011. At that time, the operations will cease, will be transitioned to other suppliers. We also have a small shock absorber operation in Europe and we're working on improving this business for an eventual exit.  At the same time that we've been focusing on divesting our light vehicle businesses, our core businesses have been undergoing their own transformation. As part of our ongoing Performance Plus enhancement initiative, CVS has continued to sharpen its focus on engineering and technology, product growth, and our aftermarket business. This team has continued to execute on its strategy to strengthen and invest in the growth of our most profitable businesses, such as off highway, military and aftermarket, as well as in the Asia Pacific region.  Let's now turn to slide eight. As I mentioned, we're extremely pleased with the progress we're making in our transformation. Of course our exit from the light vehicle business has been challenging in light of the weak credit markets and the overall global recession. As you can see from this chart, we hit significantly headwinds during 2009 experiencing collapse in all of our markets around the world.  To offset the declining markets we proactively took swift and decisive actions by implementing aggressive cost cutting initiatives. Working to our advantage was the fact that we'd already begun this process early in 2007 with our Performance Plus cost improvement initiatives. By being proactive and starting early preparing our company for risks, we cut $75 million out of our structural costs before we were hit by the drastic downturn in 2009. We also benefited from the additional actions we quickly implemented to adapt to the changing market conditions by implementing workforce reductions, reducing pay and benefits on a temporary basis, improving working capital, controlling inventory, reducing past due receivables and achieving record labor, burden and material performance despite lower vibes.  We're pleased to announce that we're planning to reinstate our people's pay now that we're seeing a slight upturn in our global markets and we've achieved our targeted cost reductions. We've streamlined our core commercial and industrial business by eliminating approximately $195 million of total costs for our fiscal year. What's important to note, however, is that we've taken about $136 million of our overall structural costs on run rate basis.  Turning to slide nine. Now that we divested most of light vehicle businesses and our transformation is solidly underway, we've revised our reporting segments. In place of our two previous operating segments, LVS and CVS, we'll now report through the following four segments within continuing operations, commercial truck, industrial, aftermarket and trailer, and light vehicle systems. We refer to the first three segments as our core business.  As you saw in our news release this morning, we're pleased to announce that these three segments will be led by Carsten Reinhardt who is also elected by our Board of Directors to the new position of ArvinMeritor's Chief Operating Officer. The board also elected two new executive officers. Tim Bowes, who was appointed Vice President and President of the company's Industrial group, and Joe Mejaly, Vice President and President of our Aftermarket & Trailer businesses.  You can read the description of each of these segments in the slide, as well as in our 10-K, which we expect to file later this week. But what's important to note is our company has a highly knowledgeable experienced and proven engineering and technical team and we're leveraging that expertise through all of our core business segments.  As we shift to this new reporting structure, I'd like to briefly outline some of high level strategic growth initiatives in each of these segments. Our key goal is to invest and focus on growing product segments in our core businesses that offer favorable margins and the highest returns.  In the commercial truck segment, our strategy is to grow this business by further expanding our global brake leadership position, investing in advance technologies that will improve fuel efficiency and vehicle safety, and strengthening our electronics and controls capabilities. We'll also be focusing on growing our commercial truck share in markets we serve, primarily expanding our customer base in regions outside of North America. In the industrial segment, we'll focus on successfully growing our global off highway, industrial and defense businesses by expanding our product portfolio and customer base, growing market share on Asia Pacific and investing in new engineering and technology capabilities in China and India. With the aftermarket and trailer segment we'll concentrate on growth by further expanding our product portfolio in our remanufacturing business, capturing additional opportunities in emerging markets primarily in the brick countries, and continuing to expand our global distribution network and systems infrastructure. For the light vehicle systems segment, our plans are to continue to evaluate alternatives and how best exit the remaining LVS businesses. At the same time we remain committed to making the necessary investments to support the need and requirements of our light vehicle customers. Now turning to slide ten, as you can see from this slide we have essentially completed all of the goals we set out to achieve in 2009. First, with the acceleration of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, as I pointed out earlier, we achieved a cost savings of $195 million in our core businesses which helped us offset some of the impact from the weak global economies. Second, we continue to make improvements to our overall operations which positioned us well for growth. We reduced our labor and burden, reduced inventory, and continued to focus on direct material optimization activities. Third, as I mentioned earlier, we made tremendous progress toward divesting our light vehicle business. After all of the LVS divestitures, we have reduced that business segment to 25% of the company's total sales. Fourth, we continue to grow in our high margin market segments, such as expanding our aftermarket portfolio for commercial vehicles, including adding remanufactured Allison Automatic Transmissions, and winning new military contracts with BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, and Navistar. And fifth, we continue to invest in engineering, research and development to ensure that we have the right products and advanced technologies to meet our customer's needs in the future.  Despite the downturn in 2009, we maintained similar levels of ER&D and CapEx spending when compared to 2008. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jay.
Jeffrey A. Craig : I'll start out today with a detailed recap of our fourth quarter results and then review our full year results. Slide 11 compares our fiscal fourth quarter results from continuing operations to the guidance we had previously given you for the quarter, as well as the recast fiscal third quarter results. As you can see in the far right column, compared to our previous outlook we performed by accomplishing stronger revenue, higher earnings, and positive free cash flow. EBITDA before special items increased 43% sequentially to $40 million or 4% of additional revenue. We delivered these results despite the fact that strong positive earnings associated with the wheels business are now reported in discontinued operations. Free cash flow was a positive $22 million, and if you exclude factoring and restructuring it would have been a positive $48 million. We are encouraged by our ability to convert earnings to cash without significant help from working capital this quarter. Slide 12 provides our income statement for continuing operations before special items. We lost $0.28 per share, which was in line with our most recent qualitative guidance. The special item adjustments are detailed in the appendix and include non-cash tax charges of $25 million resulting from one-time adjustments, as well as some restructuring expenses. On a constant currency basis, sales were down year-over-year by 31% due to the effects of the global downturn or markets in Europe, North and South America, and India. This is a stark comparison to the record volumes experienced in Europe and South America during 2008. Nevertheless, we achieved positive income before taxes in the fourth quarter. SG&A decreased by 34% year-over-year, which is relatively consistent with the percentage decrease of revenue as we realized significant savings from cost cutting actions implemented earlier in the year. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter equity and earnings of affiliates showed resilience, especially in Brazil. Our effective tax rate requires some additional explanation.  Slide 13 breaks out the significant items affecting our fourth quarter tax rate. You may recall that we previously recorded a substantial charge in our first fiscal quarter to establish valuation allowances against U.S. and selected Western European deferred tax assets. As a result, we are currently unable to realize any benefit on losses in those jurisdictions. However, we've remained a taxpayer in the majority of countries which are not subject to valuation allowances, such as Brazil. The good news is that we would expect any future income in jurisdictions with valuation allowances to be earned tax free. In addition, we had $6 million of year end adjustments which flowed through the fourth quarter results, the majority of which related to changes in tax contingencies. Slide 14 shows earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization by segment. As Chip mentioned earlier, we changed our reporting segments and will be referring to our commercial truck, industrial, aftermarket and trailer, and light vehicle system segments going forward. Commercial truck will consist primarily of our European, North and South American OE commercial vehicle businesses, was above EBITDA breakeven in the fourth quarter. This was largely due to the overall market decreases mentioned previously offset by the considerable cost and operational improvements we achieved during the year. The industrial segment, consisting primarily of our former specialty business specifically off highway, military, construction, bus and coach, and fire and emergency, as well as all of our Asia-Pacific operations, had 33% lower EBITDA compared to the same quarter last year. This resulted primarily from fiscal 2008 benefits of the M-Rap Program which declined as the year progressed.  In the near-term, military production will include supplying components for the family of medium tactical vehicles, as well as a number of smaller programs with our key military customers. Aftermarket and trailer EBITDA was down 50% year-over-year as a result of a 28% reduction of revenue, as well as the mix impact of reduced military spare parts orders. Light vehicle systems, consisting primarily of the body systems business as well as the remaining chassis businesses, was EBITDA breakeven in the fourth quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter that body systems has achieved breakeven results, quite an accomplishment by our leadership team in Europe given the August holiday shutdown periods. This gives us the confidence that the cost to carry the LVS business is manageable while we evaluate alternatives for the divestiture of body systems. This process could extend until the end of 2010 or beyond. We are evaluating various alternatives for the disposal of the body systems business, all of which appear to result in negative cash outflow. It has become clear to us that the costs related to some of these alternatives could be substantial. We continue to evaluate all of them and will be updating our risk factor in the 10-K to reflect this. Like all the previous difficult divestitures we have had, we will do our best to achieve the most economical and successful outcome for our shareholders, customers and employees. Total EBITDA was $40 million with margins of 4.1%. Slide 15 shows the income statement for the full year. Gross margin was down 46% reflecting operating leverage as sales decreased partially offset by cost savings in material, labor and burden. On a full year basis, we have reduced SG&A from $401 million last year to $282 million this year. Interest expense was $6 million higher primarily as a result of increased borrowings.  So on the bottom line we lost $1.32 per share before special items. These special items are detailed in the appendix and include asset impairments and the previously discussed significant non-cash tax charges taken primarily in the first quarter. Other special items included restructuring actions of $68 million after-tax, and LVS separation costs of $9 million after-tax. Slide 16 shows EBITDA and segment margins for the year. Total EBITDA was $116 million with margins of 2.8%. Recall that the unallocated corporate costs in 2008 related primarily to the planned separation of light vehicle systems. Slide 17 shows free cash flow for both the quarter and the full year. Free cash flow was $22 million for the fourth quarter, which exceeds our previous guidance. We are pleased to have delivered positive free cash flow for the entire second half of the year, especially in light of the continued pay down of the off balance sheet securitization and factoring balances as revenues in Europe decreased. We accomplished this primarily through rigorous management of working capital while continuing to make strategic capital and engineering investments to support our growth initiative and to position ourselves to benefit from global market recoveries. We continue to improve inventory management and in the fourth quarter achieved our highest level of inventory turns of the year, even at these reduced levels of revenue. In addition, we continued to reduce our past due receivables and have achieved what we believe are world-class levels of performance around 5.4% globally and 3.6% in North America. Congratulations to our manufacturing, sales, information systems and shared services teams for the significant accomplishments in these areas. On a full year basis, free cash flow before factoring and restructuring was a negative $101 million. Slide 18 plots total EBITDA margins from the fiscal third quarter to the fourth. Recall that we previously reported total EBITDA margin of 3.3% for the third quarter. If you take out the positive contribution associated with wheels, the adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 3% in line with our previous guidance. European production was lower in the fourth quarter due to the July shutdowns and the normal August holiday period which reduced fourth quarter EBITDA margin by 1%. North and South America each showed volume improvements and positively contributed to our margin this quarter. The effects of Performance Plus programs, as well as the other significant cost reductions taken this year, added 1.6% to our fourth quarter EBITDA margin and this more than offset the reductions seen in Europe. Let's turn to slide 19. Since the beginning of this calendar year we have steadily increased our liquidity position while simultaneously reducing our net debt, including the debt-like off balance sheet factoring and securitization programs. As of September 30, we achieved our highest quarter end level of liquidity for the fiscal year at more than $700 million. Liquidity for the fourth quarter consisted of approximately $95 million in cash and more than $600 million undrawn under our revolver. In addition to the liquidity shown in this chart, we have renewed the 364-day French factoring and Swedish off balance sheet securitization program with Nordea. Therefore, we continue to have unused commitments under our off balance sheet factoring and securitization programs in Europe subject to availability based on production levels going forward. Slide 20 describes our current pension and retiring medical status. Like all other U.S. industrial companies, our U.S. and global pension plans were under funded at our September 30 measurement date due to the market declines in corporate bond spreads, which determine our discount rate, as well as decreases in asset returns over the past year. We expect $13 million of additional pension expense in fiscal 2010. In order to improve our pension position, we are planning $47 million of global pension contributions for 2010. OPEB contributions in 2009 included a one-time retiring medical settlement of $28 million, which was paid in our first fiscal quarter. The ongoing contributions, however, are expected to remain flat at $47 million in 2010. Slide 21 contains some key planning assumptions for fiscal year 2010. Combined total capital expenditures for our core business and light vehicle systems are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $95 million to $110 million next year as approximately $10 million of additional non-cash expense is anticipated due to the required adoption of accounting changes relating to our convertible securities. It would not be useful for us to provide a tax rate estimate for next year due to the effects of valuation allowances on the mix of income. Therefore, we are providing expected income tax expense before special items ranging from $40 million to $60 million. We expect $25 million to $50 million of cash income taxes to be paid in 2010. On slide 22, we provide our outlook for the first quarter of 2010. While we do have good visibility regarding orders and production approximately four months out, the second half of the year remains somewhat unknown. In the near-term we continue to see considerable strength in North American orders due to what appears to be pre-buy activity, and the Chinese, Brazilian and Indian markets appear to be well on their way to a solid recovery. As a result we expect first quarter sales to be higher than fourth quarter. We are expecting strong conversion on this revenue. Therefore, EBITDA before special items is expected to exceed our fourth quarter results. We expect continued success in converting these earnings to cash and expect total free cash flow for the first quarter to be around breakeven. This includes favorability resulting from expected factoring balance increases in line with increased European productions. I will now turn the call back over to Chip.
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: On slide 23 you'll see the process we've defined and the specific initiatives to improve our ability to execute well through the cycle. During the past year and a half, we've strengthened our operations, supply chain and purchasing team with new leaders and new information systems. The result is a highly collaborative, cross-functional solution that begins and ends with the customer. The first step in the process is to improve our visibility. To do that, we're collaborating with our customers to increase our transparency into their volume and mix and expectations, while at the same time monitoring industry forecasts. We then use advanced IT systems to interpret forecast data and product mix predictions so we can optimize the information we provide to our suppliers.  We're also working more closely than ever with our supply base to ensure that they have the information they need and the resources available to manage both up and down cycles. Our supplier risk management process has been in effect for some time and has been very effective in helping us to avoid or minimize costs due to financial or material issues with certain suppliers. And across our manufacturing base we're constantly evaluating our footprint, driving our lean production system and focusing CapEx on core processes like gearing in actual housings that increase our flexibility and responsiveness. The objective of this process is to meet our customer's delivery expectations with zero interruptions while at the same time eliminating premium costs and maintaining our high quality standards. As we see markets in China, India and South America recovering and volumes in North America increasing due to a 2010 emission change, we're confident that the process we put in place will enable us to more efficiently execute through the cycles. In closing, on slide 24 I want to review our 2010 priorities. Looking ahead to 2010 we remain focused on many of the things that have helped us get to where we are today. We'll concentrate on rigorous cost management to realize improved operating leverage, continue our transformation to focus the company on global commercial vehicle and industrial markets, successfully execute the anticipated upturn as global markets recover, drive innovation by accelerating new products and advance fuel efficient technologies, maintain our focus on sustainable, profitable growth, and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. Now let's take some questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions.) Your first question comes from Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital.
Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital: Congratulations to Carsten on his big move. With your new segment structure a couple of things. One, how does it tie back to the aspirations you had for CVS margin in the low teens as we think about each of the segments now that we see very good profitability in industrial and challenge profitability in commercial?
Charles G. McClure:  I'll start and I'll kind of throw it over to Jay to get into kind of the details. But obviously as we move forward this is the continued transformation of the company to the commercial vehicle side. As we look at that right now as you look at the margins, I think it's safe to say on the commercial truck side a lot of that is in markets that have been down significantly for quite a long period of time, specifically the North American and European markets. And as we look at the other industrial and the aftermarket in trailers, part of it we kind of move forward to future EBITDA targets is to really make sure we've got the proper focus across those products. So as I look at it specifically in the commercial truck side, I think it's somewhat driven because of the volumes you're seeing in the European and North American markets.
Jeffrey A. Craig: I would just add to what Chip stated obviously the industrial and aftermarket trailer business we think are fairly well situated to reap our long-term EBITDA margin targets. But as you look at the commercial vehicle OE business, the North American market has been down here for almost three years, so there's difficult historical comparison. And as you recall, we have done some restructuring of the North American business, opened a new Mexican manufacturing facility, and if you look at our CapEx for this year and the previous year, invested significant capital into upgrading our plants, both in North America and Europe. And I would also just mention that we've previously stated that the European business was a struggle for us and even at peak volumes, although it was turning around.  We knew we had quite a bit of work to do behind the scenes to improve that business, we've continued to do that, most recently over the last 12 months moving the Performance Plus oversight office to our European headquarters, and aggressively focused on improving the margins in that business over the last year. So we know the target that we've set out externally and we're continuing to think to make very strong forward progress.
Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital:  So should we be thinking about commercial truck as a low teens business in an EBITDA cycle production environment in North America and Europe?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  I would say, Brian, we don't have clear line of sight to EBITDA margins quite that strong at this point. I think the one thing I would – our target was always driven around the three segments on a combined basis. And with companies like ours where there's a lot of leverage given from the industrial – from the commercial OE business into the industrial and aftermarket business, we tend to focus a lot on full channel profitability as well. Obviously, being strong in OE markets gives us the right to play. For example, in the aftermarket business both in North America and Europe and beginning in South America and China. So sometimes it's difficult to get all of the true cost accounting allocations on a full channel profitability basis.
Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital:  So can we think about this quarters European and North America truck build rates as the breakeven point for the new commercial truck on the segment? And if so, what's then the likely incremental margin either on a per unit or a percentage basis going forward?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  I think that's a fair assessment. We were on the positive side of – slightly positive side to breakeven this quarter. So I think that's a fair assessment that you've made.
Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital:  Just one final question, what is the submitted cash restructuring expense in your [inaudible] business, and how much of the potential cash issue around divesting it is that driving?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  I think if you're referring to the comments I made on the cost of the divestiture, is that what you're referring to, Brian?
Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital:  Yes.
Jeffrey A. Craig:  I think we're still dimensioning that and, as I mentioned, we'll have more information in our K. But we just wanted to communicate that although we have this business to breakeven and the cost to carry, so to say, for us as we evaluate and work through any disposition we think was very manageable, that we do see there'll be some cash outflow associated with this. And as you go through any modeling like this, certain scenarios we play out it could be significant. But we do feel we have the good option of time working for us right now a bit because we have reduced the cost to carry. If you recall, this business was significant negative EBITDA in the past and we've gotten it to breakeven and that has allowed us to be somewhat of a patient seller or a disposer of this business.
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: Brian, this is Chip, two other things to add to that. One, as Jay said if you look at the performance the last couple quarters I think we've been able to get it up to that breakeven level. And if you look historically some of the other businesses we've divested, such as our light vehicle aftermarket and chassis business, we do kind of look at these and really look at what's the best approach to take on a case-by-case basis to look at that kind of going forward that's for the best for our shareholders kind of going forward. So as we look at this as Jay has said, we have the time to do the proper analysis, we will do the proper analysis, I think hopefully history has demonstrated the fact that as we've done this with some of the past ones we certainly feel we've done the right decisions kind of going forward from the short list perspective.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Derrick Wenger – Jefferies and Company. 
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Company:  Three questions if I could. What is the total size of the bank facilities right now and with the letter credits and the availability?
Jeffrey A. Craig :  Well, the total size of the bank facilities, there are several. We have a revolving credit facility, which is $700 million. We obviously, as we stated previously, lost Lehman's commitment in that facility almost a year ago, which reduced that by $34 million so where at $666 million, and then we have the U.S. securitization facility, which is $125 million. But again, the availability to us of that facility varies by the amounts of receivables generated in the U.S. 
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Company:  Right so what are the LOCs against the $666 million facility, and what's the availability?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  We have LCs of $27 million at the end of the quarter and we have outstanding borrowings under the facility at the end of the quarter of $28 million.
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Company:  Is the balance completely available?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  It is available to us on every day of the year except for the four quarter end date when we have restrictions due to the covenant calculation. We cleared that by a very large margin this quarter, and in our 10-K will be as in the past disclosing the fee ratio of compliance.
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Company:  Okay so there's $611 million available?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  As of today we said today that's correct.
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Company:  But what about quarter end?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  Obviously, we have intra-quarter movements and the demands on borrowing in LC.
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Company:  What was available at quarter end or at year end?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  Again, we'll be disclosing that as a ratio in the 10-K.
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Company:  Okay and then restructuring cost that are known for the fiscal year '09, '10 coming and how are those kind of spread out?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  In 2010, we're still developing that so I don't – and a part of that is how our strategy on body systems plays out. In 2009, the total restructuring for the year, as far as in cash flow, was $53 million for the year. But again, in 2010 we're still developing that.
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Company:  Okay and I think you mentioned it, but why is the interest expense projected to rise here?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  It's because there was an accounting change – method of accounting change that had an impact on our convertible securities. And how you compute the imputed interest expense or implied interest expense embedded in those securities and that will increase our non-cash interest expense for 2010 by $10 million. So you'll start to see on future calls like this a reconciling item on our cash flow statement for the year we expect will be about $10 million.
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Company:  Okay and can we put that kind of pro rata over the four quarters?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  I think that would be a fair thing to do, although from a cash perspective remember our interest payments are made semi-annually on that [instance].
Derrick Wenger – Jeffries & Co.:  Right, but we could spread the $95 million to $110 million over the four quarters on accrual base?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  That's correct.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs:  I just wanted a little bit more clarity on just the tax implication. I understand we've all seen companies with really high tax when they're not [inaudible] and having to pay tax in other jurisdictions where they don't have the same kind of accounting for NOLs and that sort of stuff. But I guess it just seems like your tax bill was several hundred percent when you think about going from positive [inaudible] of 2 million to a net loss.  And it also seems that in your guidance you would be sort of expecting something like that too. If you get consensus pre-tax expectations of about [33 million] and your guidance for income tax expense is $40 million to $60 million, which would really imply that either the street is too low or that earnings are going to be negative despite general expectations that things are improving. And so I just wanted to A, sort of get a better sense of what's going on. Are there additional allotment evaluation actions that you're anticipating that are included here. And I guess am I thinking about it the right way in terms of the implications for earnings in 2010? 
Jeffrey A. Craig: Obviously the slide 13 we added, we knew this was a complicated subject for us to lower our expectation for people externally. It was very complicated. The attempt to add that chart was to provide the additional color that I think you're asking for. And if you look at slide 13, the income tax on entities that are not subject to evaluation allowance is at an effective rate of 32.4%, so I think pretty consistent with what people would expect on a statutory basis.  And then unfortunately we have valuation allowances for most of the countries we operate in Europe and the United States, so a large portion of our business where we have generated losses during this year. The good news with that is as those businesses return to profitability, which we do see sometime in the foreseeable future, we will be realizing those earnings tax free. But in the interim, I think we'll continue to provide a chart like this to help people interpret what our tax situation is. And really this quarter it was driven by many of the emerging markets are coming back very aggressively so we're strongly profitable in those markets where we do have to provide and pay income taxes really, as I said just a moment ago, very close to the statutory rates. And we're just now getting over breakeven in the U.S. market, and so it's probably a bit of time before we become a taxpayer which will be shielded by those NOLs. 
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: I guess the implications are there for that kind of a, I guess, diversification and profitability to sort of be sustained at least through the better part of next year just given the tax guidance.
Jeffrey A. Craig: That's correct. I think that's a fair assumption of what we try to do by providing the guidance was to help people understand what we expect in terms of dollars of tax, because we thought the effective rate was just relatively difficult to use in modeling.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Just a little bit on restructuring, I know you haven't really provided guidance on it for 2010, but I was looking for at least a little bit more help in how to frame it. It seems like when you look at some of the run rates you've provided, there may be some benefit to annualizing some of the actions you've done in the later part of the year, so that's good. But then you talked about putting some of the temporary cost cuts back in as things improve. So can you just help us get a better sense of how we should think about the cost opportunity here?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I think our hesitancy in giving numerical guidance like we did in the four other categories we did for the year relative to restructuring is we do think on the core business, so the three segments in CVS are restructuring, will be down for this year. But as we have spoken to, we're still assessing various alternatives for body, and as we further evaluate those there could be additional restructuring that we think is required in that business. So as we move on further in the year, we may be able to provide clarity around that. 
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs:
Jeffrey A. Craig: One of Chip's previous charts we addressed what costs we think cost reductions stick within the business and what may come added back in terms of restoration of salaries and hopefully performance that meets our internal plans of repaying incentive compensation. That was laid out in chart eight I think on the table on the lower left side. Included in those structural cost reductions would be the benefit from the restructuring actions that we've taken both this year and in previous years.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: But I guess I'm just still trying to get a better understanding. It looks like the run rate of course is higher than what you've done, so if you just did nothing you would still have some 40-odd million of a tailwind from structural cost reductions. But then, I guess asking it a different way, how much of the 48 million that you did in last year would come back in, would it be all? Could we be thinking about restructuring being sort of a net neutral next year or might it be less than that?
Jeffrey A. Craig: I think it's probably most dependent on volumes. I would say we feel internally comfortable with our plans that we've laid out internally in 2010. But if volumes come back as we're seeing in the first quarter, if that continues on into future quarters a lot of those temporary reductions could be lost as we're adding workers back into the hourly workforce. We're having to incur higher incentive comp accruals for our profit sharing plans. So I think it really is dependent on what we see in the volumes throughout the market.
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: If you remember back at the beginning of the year and obviously in response to the economic questions taking place, there were some temporary things we put in place as far as salary reductions, benefit reductions, and some other things that we did. As I kind of indicated in my comments, we'll look to restore some of those.  The structural cost reductions on that slide eight are that ones that, as we look at it, kind of sticky if you will and stay there. But some of the others, as Jay had said, is dependent on volume and some of the others, as we indicated early on in the year, were indeed temporary to make sure that we could work through this economic crisis. And as we kind of go forward into 2010, we look for kind of a reinstatement of those things. So it's really that top line would be the one that we would see that would kind of be maintained longer term.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Last real quick one, if I may. I didn't see it anywhere, forgive me if I missed it, but would the production volumes for European and then Class 8 that are underpinning your first quarter guidance?
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: First of all, as I look at the first quarter, I think if you look at the Class 8 orders that came out in October that were north of 20,000 units, I think we certainly see that there's going to be a bit of a pre-buy there that is taking place before the new emissions regulation. That's here in North America it's going to take place. And do envision that through the balance of this calendar quarter and perhaps even into early next year and it will kind of be readjustment that way. So that's what we're kind of seeing and it's kind of the underpinnings, if you will, for here in North America. And as Jay said, beyond four months it's still somewhat unclear here. We're really kind of looking at the second half of next year for that, again, depending on what happens in the economy here. In Europe, we are starting to see a slow gradual increase or rebound. There's no question it was a significant drop off and it'll take a while to come back.  So that one I would say is kind of a slow rebounding as we kind of indicated I think the bottom has been passed and just kind of a slow gradual increase. Nothing driving it like the technology here vis-à-vis the emissions regulation that occurs in 2010. So it's just kind of a slow gradual increase there is what we see in Europe. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Hoselston – Keybanc. 
Brett Hoselston – Keybanc Capital Markets:  LVS, sounds like the chassis are our remaining operations – excuse me, the remaining operations look like they breakeven at this point in time. Free cash flow positive, neutral at this point? 
Jeffrey A. Craig:  We have seen some positive benefits from the run off from working capital, but I would say barring that it's roughly neutral to slightly negative. 
Brett Hoselston – Keybanc Capital Markets:  What's left at this point in time? I mean it looks like annualized you've got about $1.2 billion in sales, obviously affected by production. And as you break that down, I know you did quickly earlier, but as you break that down into large chunks what's left at this point in time?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  It's really three components and I'm going to list them in the order of significance. It's our body system business that would be the vast majority of the business and they represent roughly 75% to 85% of the total business.  And then there is some remaining chassis businesses here in North America that we had an agreement with the OE that they provide parts for on a just-in-time basis. That we would run out those contracts to the end of the agreement, one of which ends in the spring of this year and one about 12 months after that. And then the last piece is a small shock absorber business in Europe. So those are the three components. 
Brett Hoselston – Keybanc Capital Markets: Where we're at, particularly the body business I would say your largest chunk, where are we at in the divesture process. Have we distributed books on it? Are there indications of interest? Where we at and kind of what are your expectations in terms of timeframe? Is this a fixed 12-month process or could it take longer? Your thoughts there. 
Charles G. McClure, Jr.:  Well first of all, Brett, it's very early in the process and there is a great deal of interest out there from a number of different parties on that. We're also in discussion with our customers on that to be very transparent on that. So, that is very early in that. We are evaluating all different options and being very open on that. From a timing perspective, as Jay kind of indicated in his comments, that I think the good news is we've gotten that to where its got minimal impact to the companies and we can take the time to make the right economic decisions.  So we're going to take the right steady approach on this going forward on that and really haven't set a defined time on it, we do expect it'll go through much of 2010 and perhaps even beyond that. But again as we look at that what we want to do is to make sure that we factor in the considerations from our customers end, our employees end, and obviously the shareholders end to make sure that we make the right decision going forward on that. 
Brett Hoselston – Keybanc Capital Markets: Jay, as you look at the EBITDA outlook for the company, it looks as though you're basically suggesting that its going to improve and, therefore, the covenant outlook should improve in a commensurate manner. Is that a fair assessment? Is there anything else in there that you see that might mix that up a little bit? 
Jeffrey A. Craig:  No, I think that's a very fair assessment and I think we believe that we should remain in compliance for the remainder of the life of that facility. 
Brett Hoselston – Keybanc Capital Markets:  Chip, I think we're fairly well aware that the North American market seems to be improving somewhat, a little bit of pre-buy possibly. But as you look out at the European market and particularly with your primary customer [revolver], what are you thoughts at this point in time? Do you feel like you're confidently at the bottom here and starting to see improvement? Do you still feel somewhat uncertain? What are your thoughts? 
Charles G. McClure, Jr.:  I think we're at the bottom and starting to come out. What can't be projected is how quickly we'll come out. There's no question it was significant drop in a very short period of time. I think the bottom has been found and it's kind of moving forward. We are seeing different signs that different economies in Europe are starting to pick up, albeit slowly. I know one of the other factors is there's still some stimulus package going on kind of country by country that are driving some of that.  We're also seeing some other things within the economy of different countries over there that are moving up, but I need to continue to emphasize, yes, bottom has been found. We probably passed bottom, but it will be kind of a slow ride up from here throughout Europe kind of going forward. 
Brett Hoselston – Keybanc Capital Markets:  Then finally, Jay, you've made some forecasts in terms of tax expense and cash taxes for 2010 and knowing the complexity of tax accounting, that's pretty bold. And so I'm wondering how confident are you in your income tax and cash income tax outlook? It seems as though, from my perspective and I'm not saying this to offend you, but there are so many moving parts with this tax accounting. I'm wondering do you think you have a high degree of confidence that those numbers are actually going to be correct or would you say that's just your best shot at this point in time? 
Jeffrey A. Craig:  I would say we're fairly confident or we would have not put them out as guidance. I mean like any guidance it can be adjusted in the future, but the cash and the accrual taxes are really being generated by some operations outside the U.S. in growth markets that have held very steady from probably about six months now.  So, and as we look out to those countries, we felt fairly confident to provide guidance within a range. I mean those ranges are still somewhat large, but we just thought people were having such great difficulty in determining what our future tax expense would be. We just thought it would be extremely helpful to kind of provide people what we see going forward. 
Operator:  At this time, I would like to hand the call back over to Mr. Brett Penzkofer for closing remarks. 
Brett Penzkofer:  I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and invite you to follow up on any further questions you may have with your communications or investor relations contact. Thank you. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2009 Cummins Incorporated earnings conference call. My name is [Jasmine] and I’ll be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Dean Cantrell, Director of Investor Relations. You may proceed. 
Dean Cantrell:  Thank you Jasmine. Welcome everyone to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins’ results for the third quarter of 2009. Participating with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Solso; our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom Linebarger; and our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference. This teleconference will include certain forward-looking information. Any forward-looking statement involves risk and uncertainty. The company’s future results may be affected by changes in general economic conditions and by the actions of customers and competitors. Actual outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed in any forward-looking statement. A more complete disclosure about forward-looking statements begins on Page 3 of our 2008 Form 10-K and it applies to this teleconference. During the course of this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today’s webcast presentation, is available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. With those formalities out of the way I’d like Tom to open with a few remarks.
Tom Linebarger: Good morning. I would like to start today by sharing some thoughts about our performance during the third quarter and then spend a few moments talking about our expectations for the first half of 2010. Given the economic challenges we continue to face in most of our markets, the company performed extremely well in the third quarter. As you know we began taking decisive actions late in 2008 to lower spending and to adjust our manufacturing capacity to meet lower demand for our products. Those efforts have resulted in improved profitability and cash generation, despite continued weak demand in many of our end markets. Sales rose only 4% from a very low base in the second quarter, but profitability improved significantly. Earnings before interest and tax, excluding restructuring and other charges, was 7% of sales. That compares to 4.8% of sales in the previous quarter and 3.9% of sales in the first quarter. Our cash position improved by $152 million in the quarter as a result of significantly improved working capital. Most of our end markets and channels have completed their inventory burn off and in some cases we have started to restock.  The engine and components businesses returned to profitability in the third quarter, led by increased demand in advance of the 2010 emissions changes in the U.S., recovery in China, India and Brazil and our focus on reducing costs throughout the year. Our distribution business continues to perform very well, improving segment EBIT from the second quarter despite a softening of sales.  As expected, our power generation sales declined as retail channels in the market continued to burn off inventory. Sales fell by $61 million from the second quarter and segment EBIT declined to 4.2% of sales in the quarter. In broad terms, the global economic situation has developed over the past few months much as we expected. Economic conditions remain very weak around much of the world, with some notable bright spots in key emerging markets. For example, the China and India markets have rebounded relatively quickly and have resumed our growth, mostly for domestic demand. The Brazil economy has begun a modest recovery and is expected to return to stronger growth in 2010.  Cummins sales are reflected of the economic trends around the world. Given our strong positions in India, China and Brazil we are seeing increased demand in these markets as they start to recover. As importantly, our sales have stabilized in places such as the U.S. and Europe. Although demand remains at very low levels, it has stopped falling, which has allowed us to plan better and operate more efficiently. Additionally, our share in key markets continues to grow as a result of our industry leading technology and strong partnerships. One example is the North American truck market where we have continued to meet challenging emissions regulations with products that use less fuel and provide drivers with excellent performance. In addition, we continue to strengthen our important partnership with PACCAR, an excellent company. PACCAR has a long history of leadership in the truck market, and our strong relationship with them has helped Cummins gain market share that has also improved PACCAR’s product offering and support network. Based on our improving sales and profit performance, we are adjusting our financial guidance for 2009 upward from what we shared last quarter. We now expect sales to be down slightly less than 30% from last year and EBIT to be approximately 6% of sales excluding restructuring and other charges. Despite the improvements we have seen in some of our markets, we still face considerable challenges over the next year. In particular we expect the first half of 2010 to be extremely difficult, especially in North America where the U.S. On Highway markets will be very weak as an emission cycle takes place in conjunction with the prolonged economic downturn.  Much of the recent growth and demand for engines and components in the U.S. is a result of OEM orders being placed in advance of the new EPA standards, as is typical in an emissions change year. We’re still working through our planning process for the next year and will provide more comprehensive guidance on our Q4 earnings call. But I can provide a few early thoughts on 2010. As we have said, we can expect continued weakness in the U.S. and European economies, but China, India and Brazil will be stronger. As a result of the weak economic situation we expect our revenues to be relatively flat next year in most markets with two exceptions. Domestic sales in China, India and Brazil will grow. Second, our shipments to North American On Highway markets will be lower next year due to the emissions standard change and the transition from old model trucks and engines to new model trucks and engines. What is more, first half shipments to the truck market will be significantly lower than those in the second half. We are currently projecting North American truck and bus shipments to drop 75% in the second half of 2009 to the first half of 2010. We do expect North America end user demand for trucks to start recovering late in 2010, with freight demand and the release of OEM vehicles. With regard to late cycle markets, while we are not expecting significant recovery for the next several quarters in power generation and marine markets, we are seeing positive trends in both mining and oil and gas markets. One last comment about power generation. We expect flat revenue in total for the year, but by geography we expect North America and Europe to be down and emerging markets to be up. We will continue to manage the business very conservatively in the coming quarters and do the things that have allowed us to be successful during the worst of the recessions. As a reminder, our current priorities include maintaining a realistic estimate of demand and then aligning our cost structure and manufacturing capacity with that demand; generating positive cash flow throughout the downturn; continuing to invest in the new products, business process and technology projects that are critical to our business in both the short and long run; and lastly demonstrating that we care about our customers more than anyone else, especially now when they need us most. The decisive actions we have taken in line with these priorities have allowed us to remain profitable and to generate significant cash during the worst recession in decades. We still have a lot of work ahead of us in 2010, but we have the people and the plans in place to position Cummins for significant profitable growth once we emerge from the recession. We are very excited about the company’s prospects for once the recovery begins in earnest, and Tim will share some of his vision for our future in a few moments. First though I’ll turn it over to Pat to provide more details about the third quarter.
Pat Ward:  Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. As Tom said we continue to face a challenging environment in all end markets as evidenced by the year-over-year decline of 31% in our revenues, though we are seeing signs of improvements in the emerging markets, as well as the On Highway market in North America, which is reflected in the 4% increase in consolidated revenues over the second quarter of 2009. Our EBIT margins dropped from 10.3% last year to 7% of sales for the quarter, excluding restructuring and other charges, with the severe drop in revenue being the key driver in this decrease. Compared with the second quarter of 2009, sales were 4% higher but EBIT excluding restructuring and other charges increased 53% to $177 million. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Sequentially gross margins improved from 18.4% in the second quarter to 19.9% in the third quarter as a result of higher volumes in our engine and component segments, the benefit of cost reduction actions and lower material costs. We remain very focused on managing selling, admin and research and development expenditures as evidenced by the $107 million reduction compared to a year ago. Compared to the second quarter, we did see an increase in the third quarter in part due to higher research and development costs and the impact of currency movements. Earnings per share, excluding restructuring and other charges, were $0.56 in the quarter. We have lowered our projected full year tax rate from 30% to 27%, which contributed $0.04 to EPS in the third quarter. We also recorded $22 million from restructuring and other charges in the quarter, which include severance costs associated with actions taken in our power generation and component segments as well as a fulfillment charge related to the cumulative effect of the actions taken to date. Here are some details of the performance and full year expectations for each of our four segments. For the Engine segment, year-over-year revenues were sharply down but we did see sequential improvement in demand driven by a combination of strengthening market share and an uptick in vehicle production in North America, a stabilization of the Mexican truck market following a pre-buy in early 2008, and signs of stabilization in the construction market at least in China and Brazil. The sequential improvement in EBIT to 4.2% of sales this quarter was a solid performance for the Engine segment and was driven by higher volumes, price realization, favorable material costs and lower managed expenses, much like we expected and discussed during our last quarter call. For the full year we now expect revenues for the segment to drop 30% and EBIT margins to finish between 2.5% and 3% of sales. In the Component segment, revenues were down 26% from a year ago but up 18% sequentially, driven by the truck market demand in North America and in Asia. Segment EBIT of 5.2% of sales was down from a year ago, affected by the steep volume decline but was a significant improvement from the loss in the second quarter. As we anticipated, this segment benefited from higher volumes and cost reduction actions. For the full year we now expect Components revenues to drop 30% year-over-year and EBIT to finish between 2% and 3% of sales. The Power Generation segment continued to be affected by the global slowdown in non-residential construction, the lack of financing for power plants and corrections in channel inventory. Sales declined 38% from a year ago and 10% from the second quarter. This further reduction in volumes and in unfavorable revenue mix were the main reasons for the drop in EBIT margins to 4.2% of sales this quarter. Revenues dropped sequentially in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as well as in North America and the South Pacific region, but were slightly up in the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China.  The Consumer segment recorded a small uptick for the second consecutive quarter, albeit from a relatively low base. Although we do not expect a significant recovery in Power Generation demand for the next several quarters, we do believe the third quarter was likely the low point for the segment as most of the inventory corrections in the channel are complete. Full year guidance for Power Generation revenues remains unchanged, from 30% to 35% compared to the prior year. However, EBIT was adjusted down to 7% of sales, which is at the lower end of the range of our previous guidance. Revenues for the Distribution segment were down 27% from a year ago and down 9% versus the second quarter. The sequential drop in revenues was mainly driven by further market softness and the late cycle markets of industrial engines and power generation, particularly in South Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Profitability improved both from prior year and prior quarter to 13% of sales, driven by a strong mix of mark-to-market revenues, better joint venture performance and favorable currency movements, more than offsetting the impact from lower sales volumes. For the full year we are maintaining our previous revenue guidance of down 15% to 20% for this segment, but are raising EBIT margin expectations to between 12.5% and 13% of sales in 2009. And the lost topic I would like to talk about is cash flow management performance. We generated more than $400 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter, and more than $700 million year-to-date. Our inventory reductions contributed $7 to $8 million to cash flow this quarter, in line with our projection of $50 to $100 million benefit for the second half of the year as we discussed in our last call. Most of the reduction was from the Power Generation and Distribution segments.  Although we still have improvement opportunities, we believe most of the excess inventory has now been worked out of the system. At the end of September we had a cash balance of just under $700 million, up from $426 million at the start of the year and our debt to capital ratio is now 15.2%.  We are expecting higher revenues in the fourth quarter which may require more working capital, but we remain on track to meet our objective of generating positive net cash flow for the company in 2009. We will continue to take a conservative approach in managing our balance sheet and use of cash. As Tom just said, we are planning for a very difficult environment for the company in the first half of next year and we want to make sure we have the resources to grow the business once the demand in our market starts to improve again. That being said, we are lifting the temporary suspension of our stock repurchase program that we have had in place during this year, but will use judgment to determine when we will reenter the market.  Before we take your questions, Tim would now like to say a few words.
Tim Solso: Thanks Pat. I would like to start by underscoring two of Tom’s main points. First, I am extremely proud of our performance in the third quarter and throughout all of 2009. In many ways we have performed better during the recession than during the days of our record profits.  That can be seen in our steadily improved profitability and cash management throughout the year under difficult circumstances.  Second, I also want to make it clear that we have not worked our way through the current economic downturn. As Tom pointed out, we expect next year, especially the first six months, to be even more challenging than this year. Having said that, however, I am very excited about the long range prospects for the company for many reasons. As you know we entered the recession in the best financial position in the company’s history as a result of five years of very strong performance.  As you may recall, our priorities during that period were to reduce debt, reward our shareholders and invest in the business. Our performance over that time, during which we generated more than $4 billion cash from operations, allowed us to do all of those things. By the end of last year we had reduced our debt to less than 20% of total capital. We raised our dividend three times for a total increase of 133% from 2006 to 2008, and split our stock twice during that period. We also bought back more than $600 million of our stock from 2005 through 2008. Even with the significant stock market correction late in 2008, our average annual return to shareholders from 2003 to 2008 was 23%, well above our peer group. And we also came into the recession with access to more than $1 billion in credit at good interest rates.  Our strong balance sheet, along with our swift actions in the early months of the recession, has helped us perform well during the worst recession in decades. Not only have we earned a solid profit throughout the year which has increased each quarter, we have continued to invest in our business.  We’re in the final stages of work on our 2010 product launches and I am confident they will play an important role as we work to leverage our technical advantage in the future. In fact, we are in the midst of the largest new product introduction in our history. We are introducing four new engine platforms, ranging in size from 2.8 to 13 liters, two of which began production in China this year. For our North America On Highway markets next year, we are introducing a new 11.9 liter engine along with key component products such as the XPI Fuel System, Variable Geometry Turbo Chargers and Exhaust After Treatment Systems. We have tested our 2010 heavy duty truck engines with approximately 50 customers and we’ve run the engines in all weather conditions and across all duty cycles.  By the time we go into production in January, 2010, our new heavy duty and mid range engines will have logged approximately 5 million miles. Our fuel tests have exceeded the company’s expectations and customers are telling us how much they like the improved fuel economy and performance on the new engine. Our testing has also confirmed that our heavy duty truck engine customers can expect up to 5% improvement over Cummins current industry leading fuel economy, while mid range engine customers can expect to see up to 3% improvement. Our technological leadership is just one of a number of long range trends working in favor, as we look beyond the current economic cycle.  In addition to the new emission requirements in the U.S. beginning next year, major Cummins markets around the world will be moving to at least Euro IV and Tier 4 emission standards by 2014 for both On and Off Highway applications. As emission requirements get more stringent, it creates a significant barrier to entry for the competition and our integrated OEM customers that have lower engine volumes. Therefore it also creates a considerable opportunity for Cummins in both Engine and Components businesses. Not only does Cummins stand to increase its Engine market share around the world, but we expect other engine manufacturers to increasingly turn to our Components group for critical technologies to help their engines meet emission regulations. As a result, we are very well positioned to sell more engines worldwide and to create more Cummins owned content per engine sold, whether they’re ours or a competitors or those of the integrated OEM customers. As we look across our businesses, we see significant opportunities in a number of other areas as well. Here are just a few examples. The expected global shortage of electricity, especially in developing regions such as the Middle East, India, Latin America and Africa will benefit our Power Generation business, which is poised to capture many of these opportunities. In many of these areas, a lack of investment in central utilities has made the electricity grid unreliable or inaccessible and we expect this to remain an issue for years to come. At the same time, we have seen that central utilities in these emerging markets have difficulty keeping up with the demand during strong economic times. This will create additional opportunities for Cummins during the recovery in both distributed generation and stand-by power.  Increased infrastructure spending as a result of government stimulus efforts around the world, especially in large markets such as China, India and Brazil, should increase demand for our products in both short and long term. Our positions in large growing markets, such as China, India and Brazil, will serve us well as they return to significant GDP growth in coming years. Nearly 45% of our engines are produced in the emerging markets, with China and India our second and third largest engine markets respectively. We have never been in a better position to take full advantage of the tremendous long term opportunities in front of us. We will focus on performance and execution during the remainder of this recession, especially in the first half of 2010. We will manage our costs, matching capacity to real demand, generate positive cash flow and invest in and introduce new products reliably. We are now happy to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Meredith Taylor - Barclays Capital.
Meredith Taylor - Barclays Capital:  How are you thinking about production planning heading into the fourth quarter? You know given your expectations for the soft first half of 2010, how are you thinking about ramping up capacity utilization in the fourth quarter to meet the demand for transitional stock of engines since your guidance suggests that 24% top line sequential growth. And then specifically I mean can you talk about how much you have to add back to the cost structure to do so and how we should think about what the implications would be for the first half of 2010?
Tom Linebarger: It’s an excellent question. Obviously we’ve been doing a lot of planning on exactly that plan. Because of the fact that we’ve had some time to think about how this is going to go, given the expected demand increase at the end of this year, we’ve been thinking about it all year. And we are managing that process in my opinion extremely well. The Engine business and Components businesses have both managed to add cost as flexibly as possible. So we have what we call rings to defend in each of our plants that allow us to add people back, add overtime, bring in temporary workers, have down days and on days which give us the ability to be up at very high levels of production in Q3 and Q4 and then down at varied levels of production in Q1 and Q2, with very little fixed cost addition. There’s no question that it’s difficult to manage and we’re trying to figure out how to minimize the fixed cost addition. But I think we’re doing an excellent job and I think we will not add fixed cost structure in any significant degree in Q3 and Q4. A little bit here and there, but not a significant amount anywhere. What we’re also trying to do though is make sure that our overhead levels, which is what Tim and I were talking about, making sure our overhead levels stay low even as we have more and more investments to make in new products and growth areas. We need to keep our overhead costs down so that as we carry through the first half of next year, our financial performance remains good. 
Meredith Taylor - Barclays Capital:  And then you know you certainly noted the first half headwinds in On Highway truck and bus and can you calibrate a little more specifically how you’re thinking about the second half of the year?
Tom Linebarger: Yes. Our view is that just by the nature of the transition, there’ll be improvements in the second half of the year. So even without significant improvements in freight, etc., there’ll be improvements because the OEMs will be launching new truck models. And as they launch them there’s just a transition period. So as they get launched, they get their engines in, there’ll be more new product in the market and of course as customers become more comfortable with the new trucks and new engines, that just drives increased demand. We also hope that there’s some improvement in freight and other drivers of demand. But as we said in our remarks we’re really not planning for that. We hope there is but we’re planning pretty conservatively that not much economic improvement in the U.S. in 2010. And so most of the increase in demand will just come from the transition that happens in every emissions hurdle year.
Meredith Taylor - Barclays Capital:  I guess I was just trying to get to more specific range in terms of how you’re looking at second half of the year versus first half of the year, since you were pretty specific around how much you think first half could be down.
Tom Linebarger: Right. And we will definitely provide that in our Q4 earnings call. So you can anticipate we’ll be able to give you much better view then of quarter by quarter performance, and I’m sorry we don’t have more details yet. But this is kind of our planning period. We’re going through all the markets and all the territories to make sure we have a good handle on numbers, both production and sales. So again by the Q4 earnings call we’ll have good detail for you on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from [David Russell] – I.S.I. Group. 
[David Russell] – I.S.I. Group: Regarding the announcement from the courts recently or the EPA about Navistar and the EPA may reconsider their ’09 guidance for the industry for the ‘010 emissions, you know basically an order of stay for the proceedings for about 60 days, can you take us through your thoughts on that and what the implications could be?
Tom Linebarger : Yes, David, as you guessed it’s not our case. We’re not experts in what’s intended by the parties but I can tell you what our take on it is. Essentially what Navistar’s seeking is a delay in the 2010 regulations and to quote our general counsel “they’re grasping at straws.” So they’re looking for ways to slow it down and us and the rest of the industry’s ready to go. And so they put a suit in as a way to do it. The EPA has us holding all the cards here. For one, the guidance document they’re talking about is not a regulation, it’s just a guidance document. So it has no effect, no legal effect one way or the other whether the guidance document’s in place or not in place or whatever. The way I interpret the stay is just that the EPA just wants more time to form its case. Its in the middle of doing all its work to get ready for 2010 among other things and so they’re just taking more time to finish the case. But it’s our view that the case has no merits and will not succeed in any way and that by the time the case is even heard, we’ll already be making engines and customers will be selling trucks.
Tim Solso: Let me add to that is that we’ve submitted all certification for all of our engines for 2010 and are waiting momentarily for those to be approved by both EPA and subsequently the CARB in California. And I would just again that you can look at the complications of the legal case, but the bottom line is it will have zero impact on Cummins.
[David Russell] – I.S.I. Group: The idea that truckers having something else to think about for buying trucks next year, obviously the issue Navistar feels how the truck maybe is handled when they’re non-compliant and with the urea tanks empty, how quickly a truck de-rates or however the EPA might want to address tightening those regulations. Your take, net net, no impact on how you’re going to approach ‘010 at this stage? And you don’t think the trucker has an incremental worry of what could change around its SCR trucks for ‘010?
Tom Linebarger: Right.
[David Russell] – I.S.I. Group:  Then real quick on the second half ’09, first half ‘010 truck engine volumes, you said down 75% if I remember that correctly. Obviously that’s just taking the implied fourth quarter engine revenue for heavy truck and then doing the math, I mean you’re basically saying like $138 million revenue each of the first two quarters in heavy truck which is obviously the lowest you’ve ever printed since the day it’s been coming out. What kind of market share are you assuming for yourself in not just the first half but even thinking through ‘010? And what kind of industry builds are you assuming in your base case?
Tom Linebarger: Well let me first talk about market share. As you guessed, the transition period’s going to be a difficult time to think about market share because there each of the truck manufacturers will be dealing with this transition period, whether they have engines they had before and engines they’re making in the new market. But our view is that Cummins market share will remain strong during 2010. We expect as international does not offer our engines over the course of 2010 that our market share will drop some, but our view is that you know it won’t drop very much because our feeling is that our customers will strengthen their truck market positions. So when we do the Q4 earnings call we’ll be able to give you a much better detailed view of how that market share will transition over the year. But our view is our market share will stay very, very strong during 2010. And I think you know this because you’ve been following us for a while, David, but from our point of view we feel great about our truck market share but we built the truck market business on assuming we could be at market share levels way down near 20% if we needed to and still be profitable. And really what we’re measuring the performance of our truck business on is what’s our profitability and what’s the quality and capability of our engines and how they serve customers. And we feel very good about that in 2010 and onward. But as you say the drop that we’re going to see in Q1 and Q2 is really putting us to the test. To the earlier question we got about how to flexibly cycle down in capacity and then ramp back up and obviously coming off a very high production level in Q4, so that’s the challenge we’re all talking about and it’s definitely the challenge we’re up to.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Tim, can you elaborate on the opportunities you see for your Components business on Tier 4 interim? Perhaps discuss some of the engine platforms where you’ve already reached supply agreements?
Tom Linebarger : Let me step in for Tim. The Off Highway Tier 4 side again presents significant opportunities for our Components business. Because Tier 4 is what’s driving now the Off Highway markets that have to do after treatment much more sophisticated air handling, both of which play to our strengths from a components point of view. So we not only have a components business that goes with Cummins engines but we also have components business with outside customers, partners of Cummins, on Off Highway engines in Tier 4.  There’s no question that if you look at kind of the order of things, we’ve been working most aggressively in the Components business on meeting On Highway 2010 customers first. But now our focus will quickly switch to figuring out how to meet Tier 4 needs as we finish launching 2010.
Tim Solso: I would just add or back up where you’ve head me talk about it before is that if you take the four Components businesses that we have and each of their sub-systems, when we integrate it with the Engine we tend to get an advantage as far as cleaner air as well as better fuel economy. And so we are now operating after probably four years where our components companies are working very close together with the same customer. So we’re offering that advantage and whether it’s Tier 4 or other emission requirements, those opportunities seem to be expanding, even in developing markets. I think the one company in our Components business that particularly has some opportunity is the emissions solutions business because all of these engines that meet requirements in the future are going to need exhaust after treatment devices. And they’re one of the best in the markets today.
Dean Cantrell: And Jerry, this is Dean, obviously we’re very excited about the opportunity that Tier 4 will present for the Component segment but it’s a little premature to start announcing which contracts we have. We obviously don’t want to get ahead of our customers. So I think you can anticipate that at the upcoming trade shows that you’ll see in the spring, you’ll see a lot more announcements from a number of the OEMs about what their line up is for Tier 4. And obviously we’ll be there to point out where our components are on their engines or our engines and their equipment.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs:  And Tom I’m wondering if you could give us an update on the timing of the Photon Cummins Production Plant. It looks like you incurred some start up costs this quarter. I’m wondering if you could step us through the timing of the ramp there. 
Tom Linebarger: Yes. We did hit our launch dates on the 3.8 and the 2.8 is also launching the first rating this quarter and the second rating will be next year. So we’re okay on the launch times but you’re right about the volumes. The volume ramp up is slower. What that reflects mostly is that in China the transition to Euro III and Euro IV emissions levels has gone slower than the market anticipated and what we anticipated when we put the joint venture together. But the engine’s working great. It’s on its cost target, it’s on its performance target. We’re engineering into the Photon vehicles and we’re also exploring with customers outside China to use the engine. So we feel great about where the engine is and the position. We feel disappointed with the ramp up in China as a result of the delay in the application of the emissions standards, but that will right itself. It just is going to take a longer time than we thought.
Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs: Lastly Tom can you talk about the drivers or your expectations on improved power gen margins in the fourth quarter versus third quarter on pretty similar sales volumes?
Tom Linebarger: Yes. Again as I mentioned, as the market has cycled down we’ve had to clear out the inventory in the channel and we’ve had uncertain new levels of demand. So we haven’t had our cost structure matched to the actual demand. And as you know power gen fell later. So a number of our cost reduction actions were done in the power generation in second and third quarters. As a matter of fact Pat talked about the restructuring charge in third quarter, a big chunk of that was related to power gen cost reduction. So they’re just later to the cycle in terms of taking the cost out related to lower manufacturing levels. They’ve now stabilized. Demand has stabilized. Inventory’s cleared out. And so what we have is just a much more stable environment for them to work from and a lower cost base now that we’ve taken the actions. So it’s the same kind of things we saw in the other businesses, it’s just two quarters later.
Pat Ward:  And just add some more technical to that, power gen did reduce their salaried workforce by 10% in the third quarter. So as Tom said the way to cycle business, engines and components are after us in the first half of the year and power gen after it [inaudible]. So I think that gives us confidence of the Q4 recovery in margins.
Operator: Your next question comes from Henry Kirn – UBS.
Henry Kirn - UBS: Wondering if you could chat a little bit about how currency may have impacted this quarter’s earnings. And then going forward what’s baked into your guidance?
Pat Ward: Let me take the first part of that. In the third quarter compared to the second quarter with the dollar weakening, it certainly helped our sales by about just under 2%. So of that 4% growth you see in quarter over quarter, a little less than half of that was sales. On the bottom line it imparted about $50 million. Those are fairly significant one other factor in that $50 million which is a fairly large number. If you recall back in Q2, we did report some negative losses on re-measurement and unrealized from [inaudible] actions. And that was about $9 million back in Q2. We had zero in Q3. So the real operating performance of the FX movement in the third quarter was much closer to $6 million net benefit on the bottom line than the $50 I just gave you. But it was somewhat helpful to pretty much all of the businesses, and particularly Engine business and the Distribution business, third quarter versus second quarter. I think we’d expect to see for the fourth quarter some continued benefit there, given the way the currencies are moving. It should not be as significant on the bottom line, fourth quarter versus third quarter though.
Henry Kirn – UBS:  And within the power gen segment, could you talk a little bit about the global competitive dynamics there and how pricing is holding up, maybe region by region or product type by product type? Whichever is more appropriate.
Tom Linebarger: I can talk a little bit about that. Clearly in the developed markets, in Europe and the U.S., sales have fallen significantly and as I said in my earlier remarks I expect sales to be down in 2010 in those regions versus 2009. On the other hand in the developing markets, China and India specifically, things dropped but they have already started back up and we expect them to recover and be stronger in 2010 versus 2009. So competitive dynamics are as you’ve guessed different by market. The thing that I’ve noticed about this downturn versus the previous power generation downturn though is the major competitors in the market are behaving more sensibly with regard to price. It doesn’t mean that there aren’t individual dealers who are discounting if they have inventory or something like that. But there was significant negative impacts on price in the last downturn, not so much of that now. The trend in prices reasonably good. Again as I say there are spots where prices are more competitive, but we did not lower price this year across the board and we are not expecting to and we’re not expecting to next year either. And there’s some here and there, but not a major trend downward. And that’s a big improvement over the last downturn.
Pat Ward: And just to add on to that, Henry, if you go back to the last guidance on between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2003, power gen were losing between 5% and 7% EBIT across that period. We think we’re at the trough of the power gen business and cycle just now and we’re down at 4% so about half of that improvement is because we’re being much more disciplined on pricing than what we were 6, 7 years ago as Tom just said.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research: Did you say the engine business would be down 40% for the year or 30%? I couldn’t exactly.
Pat Ward: 30%. Three-zero. Sorry.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research:  Can we talk a little bit about the components business in the first half of 2010. There’s a big drop in engine. You know when we talk about a 75% drop from second half ’09 to first half 2010. I mean is the components business facing the same kind of issue or is it somewhat less because of the new engines you’re [drawn] or give me some idea of how that will play out.
Tom Linebarger: Eli, first I just want to make sure that I clarify one thing. The $0.75 drop is on the On Highway North American truck markets. Not the engine business. You got that. Right? Right. Okay, and then with regard to how the components business is affected, so they will be affected in a volume way on their applications in North American truck and bus in a similar way. But remember that they will add content. So we do have new component things like SCR on the heavy duty truck engines for example, so the components business will have more content which will mute the effect. Secondly if you think about their mix of business, they also have a broader mix. Some of our components business for example filtration, it has a significant after market component. The turbo charger business has a broad mix of customers outside of North America. So you can expect a more muted effect on the components business than you would on the engine business, both because of content changes and because of a broader spread of demand.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research:  Is that enough to cut it in half or better than that? Or is that the magnitude you look at? Because it’s going to be a material number. I’m just trying to gauge.
Tom Linebarger: Well again because the number I gave was only the truck and bus number, and so you need to think about that as compared to the whole. I think the best way for you to kind of get to what you’re after is get your numbers after the Q4 call where we can go through market by market. I mean because I think to give you the answer that you need, I need to understand much more about all of the other markets that I don’t have yet figured out. So I think the point is it will be muted, exactly what percentage I think we just don’t know yet.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research:  I knew it was in the engine business, auto and RV business are you know that’s not exactly where the demand is, in the sector, even though RV I guess has picked up slightly. Do you have any feeling for what’s going on fourth quarter and how you would look at 2010 as we go into that part of that business?
Tom Linebarger: I just want to clarify your question, Eli. You’re asking what’s going to happen with RV business in Q4?
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research:  Yes, the RV and with the rest of light duty auto.
Tom Linebarger: Yes. So let me first talk about Chrysler and then we’ll add RV. In Chrysler as you know we only recently started back with Chrysler. They’ve opened up their truck plants and are ordering diesel engines again which we’re quite happy about. And so what they’re in kind of a recovery and re-stocking mode so we are seeing some increases in demand. They’re not reflecting big increases in end user demand yet. What they’re reflecting is them kind of getting back up and running again. So we expect our Q4 to be strong but I don’t think you know we’re not expecting to be back anywhere near levels we were before or anything like that. So we’re pleased to be back in business but I think we need to remain relatively conservative about how things are going to go forward from here.
Pat Ward: I think Q4 we would expect the business to be up about 50% over Q3 volumes.
Tim Solso: Yes, but that’s from an incredibly low base.  I want to go back to Chrysler for a minute, too, is that again reminding everyone that their share of the heavy duty pickup truck market remains about a third and we’re over 80% dieselization in that. So the product is doing as well as it was in the marketplace. And because you know they shut down plants so we shut down the engine plant here, the volumes have been very low this year coming back in the fourth quarter. But we would expect off of that low base to have the volumes increase about 50% next year.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research:  Can you talk about the distribution side in the fourth quarter and particularly for next year? And with the expanded components area and new product change, does that offer a ramp up opportunity in both revenue and profits for distribution as we look out?
Tom Linebarger: No. Not so much. I think the distribution business opportunities remain similar to what we’ve been getting which is that we are as a business increasing our scope, meaning we are going to more and more markets around the world as we support our customers. And as we add markets then we bring our full range of services to those markets. And second, we are consolidating and improving the performance of distribution dealers that we have and distributors that we have by making them bigger, adding capability and reducing costs. Those are still the two primary drivers of improvement year-over-year.  I think because we see the economic situation 2010 largely being not that good, I think we’re seeing distribution business opportunities with regard to big sales increases and that’s not so much so. But I think we’ll continue to improve performance in the distribution in the two ways that I mentioned.
Tim Solso: Remember the distributors sell whole engines into smaller OEMs like construction markets and that type of thing, and those markets aren’t coming back. As well as into selling generator sets in the power generation market. So to the degree that one of our distributors sees that as a significant portion of their business, it won’t be coming back. Not at least in 2010.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: A clarification point, assuming flat volumes specifically a question on this NAFTA truck stuff. If the truck share decreases in the second half of 2000 to modestly your emission content still goes up in Class 8 to medium duty so total Cummins revenue for that regional truck market likely goes up. Is that about right?
Tim Solso: So, I think the math you’re doing is, your question is if our share decreases but our content goes up, do they offset each other?
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC:  Yes. If it’s a modest share. I just want to clarify essentially.
Tim Solso: Yes. What I’d say is I couldn’t give you the answer for 2010 and the second half because there’s too many details to figure out and too many confounding effects. Like what happens to the truck share of our customers. You know what is the total volume one quarter versus next. So I can’t say. But the general point is still right. We don’t expect a significant share loss. There’ll be some. We do think we’re going to add more content and we do think that our customers that are using our engines are going to do better than the folks that aren’t using our engines. So those things are all true. Whether it exact offsets or something I think we just need to get more of the details before we’ll know that.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC:  And then the 75% sequential drop you discussed earlier, does that include medium duty or is that just Class 8?
Tim Solso: That does include medium duty also.
Tom Linebarger: It includes our medium duty truck in box as well as the Class 8. Does not include the LDA.
Tim Solso: Yes, not Chrysler.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC:  Now moving on to a bit of a bigger part of the business, power gen, the comment about Q3 being the low point due to the end of inventory de-stocking. Other than the regions can you talk about the trends you’re seeing in commercial products within power gen? Is that uniformly down or more mixed like some of the regional comments you made earlier, Tom?
Tom Linebarger: Yes. The comments I mentioned apply to commercial in the sense that we are seeing commercial generators hit business stronger. In China and India specifically we are seeing growth in demand there. And the second thing is that from a trough point of view we have seen a pick up in order rates this quarter for forward orders. So you know we’re not ready to count our chickens or anything but the point is the trough comment comes from the fact that we are seeing some offsetting improvement in China and India and we did see order rates pick up for Ford orders a little bit. Those are both good signs. As I also said though I don’t think it’s not going to be great. I mean we don’t think Q1 and Q2 are going to be terrific quarters for power gen. We think there’s still going to be a slow recovery because the U.S. and Europe are going to be down year-over-year.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC:  And if we look directly at the U.S., you know obviously we’re seeing the RV market come up from extremely low levels. And typically that tends to be your early cycle indicator in that power gen segment. What is your normal lag time between the improvement there and what you typically would see in the commercial products?
Tom Linebarger : When I was in power gen, Andy, we did some analysis on that. And the problem is that the lag time moved every cycle far enough that it was difficult to use as a predictor. The two things that affect it are non-res capital spending, so when non-res capital spending comes back then commercial products start to go. But as you know the relationship between GDP or other cycle markets and non-res construction spending isn’t stable. There is a lag but it’s not a stable lag. So we just don’t really know on that point. And the second thing is that the international segments confound it also. For example, India, here is it booming and non-res construction’s building trends are terrible in the U.S. but India’s going. So it’s just difficult to say. I understand what you’re asking and I wish I had a good lag set of quarters to give you but I just don’t.
Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC:  And then skipping down on the eliminations profit contribution, it’s been positive for the last couple of quarters. Is that eventually going to reverse and if so would it be as quick as Q4?
Pat Ward : It will eventually reverse, yes. As we stop to see the business grow again and build up inventory you will see what happened over the last two or three years repeat itself. I don’t think it’s going to happen to any significant extent in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chase Becker for Jamie Baker - Credit Suisse.
Chase Becker for Jamie Baker - Credit Suisse: I just had a quick question regarding the components. Specifically in the quarter did price have a positive impact? Or are we going to start seeing that more with some of the new contracts in 2010?
Tom Linebarger: The latter, Chase. It’ll be more in 2010. I think what we talked about with components in the last call was that we would see a good contribution coming from the volume uptick that they would see in some of their markets as well as the improvements and some of the restructuring actions and material cost projects that they were working on that we alluded to in the Q2 call, that they would really start to benefit their bottom line in the second half of ’09. And I think that’s clearly played out in their results here in the third quarter.
Chase Becker for Jamie Baker - Credit Suisse:  Then switching back to some of the commentary that you made on the mining and oil and gas side, I know that was down sequentially in the quarter but I think at the beginning of the call you had mentioned that you saw some positive trends and was just kind of wondering if you can get a little more granular on what you’re seeing in the market.
Tom Linebarger : We are forecasting higher shipments in Q1 for mining and for oil and gas. And it’s really just because we’re beginning to see some pick up in orders you know from OEMs who are ordering equipment. The drilling market not really. But in all the other elements of the oil and gas market, that we are seeing increased engine orders and same with [inaudible]. Coal of course has still been going consistently, but even the copper mining we’re starting to see some orders.  Now it’s not what we were at. It’s not returning to the original levels, but it is an improvement off the low levels we’re seeing now and we’re beginning to see that in Q1. I don’t think it’ll affect Q4 numbers very much but in Q1 we’ll see the improvement.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group: And just on that power gen, that last question, do you think you’re gaining share there? Or is that just the market getting better?
Tom Linebarger: Was that power gen you’re asking about or oil and gas?
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group:  Oil and gas and mining.
Tom Linebarger: You know I don’t have a good view on share gain, Joel. I don’t think there’s significant share gain [inaudible]. I think that’s market. You know over the long run I think we are definitely gaining share in both. I just think in this period though there’s not a significant share gain view on that.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group:  Do you think you can hold the margins that we saw in the third quarter for the full year of 2010 in the components and in the engine business? Because obviously we’re going to have whatever first half, second half, are going to be different volumes, but then we get price increases, more components in there, should be higher margins. Can you just try to balance that all together and help us frame it?
Pat Ward:  Yes, Joel, as Tom said we’re working through all that stuff just now. So it would be very premature for any of us to give you a 2010 outlook at this stage. We’ll give you that on the call at the end of January. And what is very clear and one should have figured out by now is that the first quarter in particular and through to the second quarter, when you talk about detrimental margins, they’re probably going to be higher than what we’ve normally seen, just because of the significant fall off that Tom described on the North American On Highway markets in particular. If you look at some of the results we’ve seen in the third quarter both in engines and in components, both those segments produced incremental margins over 30%, higher than average. So that illustrates what happens when volumes come back, but we’re going to see a significant fall off in the first half of the year. I’m expecting to figure out when the [inaudible] is gone, but it’s going to be a higher detrimental to margin than normal. Over the course of time it’ll come back and second half will be better. But we’ll give you a lot more technical than that in three months time.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group:  You sound a little more confident than your statements in the last year about holding onto a 35% market share in the On Highway engine business. Is that the right perception?
Tom Linebarger: Well let’s be clear, Joel. The 35% number that has been used in past calls was always a worse case scenario in terms of the Class 8 market share. 
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research Group:  Okay.
Tom Linebarger: I think, Joel, the way that we’re again we’re thinking about market share as follows is we’re saying to ourselves our business is built upon profitability at relatively low market share. We’re focused on the quality and performance of the product and on driving partnerships that lead to performance for our customers. You know there’s a whole bunch of variables playing out there. As you know there’s mix between 15 and 13 liter engines. There’s new engines being introduced. So there’s a whole bunch of water under the bridge to go. Our view is that if we continue to launch really good products, launch them well, support our customers, we will do very well. And some of the market share guessing I think misses the point really because it’s not just math. It’s actually how well you do with the products that you have. That’s really what drives it, not just math between what percentage of this and what percentage of that. So we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us with our partners to make sure that our market share stays good. So that’s what we’re really trying to do.
Dean Cantrell: That’s all the time we have for today. I appreciate everyone’s attendance on the call today and obviously Claudia, Mary and I will be available for your questions for us throughout the day. Thank you everyone.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the second quarter 2009 Cummins earnings conference call. My name is Fab and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator's instruction) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Dean Cantrell, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Dean Cantrell: Thank you, Fab. Welcome everyone to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the second quarter of 2009. Participating with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Solso; our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom Linebarger and our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference. This teleconference will include certain forward-looking information. Any forward-looking statement involves risk and uncertainty. The Company's future results may be affected by changes in general economic conditions and by the actions of customers and competitors. Actual outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed in any forward-looking statement. A more complete disclosure about forward-looking statements begins on page three of our 2008 Form 10-K and it applies to this teleconference. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation is available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. Before we review our second quarter performance and updated guidance for 2009, I would like Tim to say a few words.
T. M. (Tim) Solso: Good morning. Given the challenging economic conditions in which we are operating today, I was pleased with our performance in the second quarter. The actions we have been taking to keep the Company strong during the recession have made a difference which you can see in the improved profitability and cash flow from the first to second quarter. Tom Linebarger will provide more detail on our actions in the second quarter but I wanted to begin by highlighting a number of positives from the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, our EBIT performance has improved each of the last two quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2008, EBIT was 2.8% of sales. In the first quarter, it was 3.9% of sales and in the second quarter, in increased to 4.8% of sales. This improvement is the result of the aggressive action we have taken to control cost during the downturn. We generated nearly $240 million in cash during the quarter as the result of inventory reduction. Our cash position improved significantly during the quarter and we have not borrowed from our $1.1 billion credit revolver established last year. We increased market share in several markets including the North American heavy duty truck engine market where our year-to-date share is now above 46% in which you had 50% in May and our distribution business had an extremely strong quarter given the current economic situation. Looking to the second half of this year, our goals remain the same as they have been for the past several months. We will continue to focus on generating cash so we can invest in critical technologies in products for 2010 and beyond and we will keep a tight running cost and closely monitor manufacturing capacity to align with the real demand for our products. As I have said before, we remain confident that the Company is well positioned to take advantage of a number of long term market trends and will resume its growth once the recession end. We are performing far better in this recession versus past downturns, even though this is the worst economic climate since World War II and we continue to explore profitable growth opportunities so we can build on our fundamental strengths when our markets recover. Having said that, I want to remind everyone that the global economy remains weak. While we seen modest improvement in some markets such as China and India, we are continuing to manage the business under the assumption that we will not see a meaningful recovery in our markets until at least late 2010. Given our outlook on the economy and end markets for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining the sales and EBIT guidance for 2009 that we shared with you at the end of the first quarter. We expect sales to be slightly more than 30% lower than 2008 and EBIT of 5% of sales excluding restructuring charges. Finally, I would like to say a few words about our preparation for the 2010 product launch. We remain on track for the largest product launch in our history in 2010 and so far, our fuel test results have exceeded expectations. As a reminder, we are introducing four new engine platforms and several new components in the next 12 months. We have tested our 2010 heavy duty truck engines with approximately 50 major customers and just as we have in the last several years, we have run the engines in all weather conditions and across all duty cycles. We have tested the engine in minus 40 degree temperatures in Yellow Night, Canada and in the 120 heat of Death Valley, California and the results have shown great performance, solid reliability and improved fuel economy. By the beginning of the fourth quarter, we expect to receive EPA certifications on all our engines and by the time we go in the production in January 2010, our new heavy duty and mid range engines would have had approximately 5 million test miles. Just as we did in 2002 and in 2007, Cummins will live up to its commitment to produce the cleanest diesel engines in the world on time and with the reliability, fuel economy and performance our customers have come to expect. Now, Tom will share some additional details on the second quarter and why we think the Company continues to be well positioned for the future.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you, Tim. I would like to start by quickly echoing two of Tim's themes, our expectations for the economy and our markets for the rest of this year and through 2010 remain the same. We are seeing modest improvement in our business in China, India and Brazil in times with the recession is found out in each part of the world but it is far too early to say the global recovery is underway. We feel good about our position not only as it relates to our abilities to remain profitable and generate cash through the downturn, but also to our ability to emerge in recession stronger than ever. In terms of our major geographic markets, we have seen no improvement in North America and Europe with the latest economic forecast call for no real growth for the rest of this year. The situation is somewhat better in our key emerging market of China, India and Brazil. In China, domestic demand is relatively strong and improving while the export market remains very weak. Gross domestic product for the first half of the year is forecasted to be 7% while the second quarter growth accelerating to nearly 8%. We are seeing increased order rates in China in line with the strengthening economy. In India, the situation is similar with domestic demand expected to grow and exports to remain relatively weak. The Indian government has projected a 7% GDP growth for its current fiscal year which ends in March 2010 with a recovery expected in second half. From an end market perspective, the biggest change from the first quarter came in rapid volume decline in the late cycle market such as mining, oil and gas, and power generation. Our power generation sales for example were down 35% from a year ago and are now expected to be down 30% to 35% for the year. We began implementing cost reduction actions immediately as the downturn started and as Tim mentioned, our performance improved from the fourth quarter of 2008 as our cost reduction efforts began to take hold. For example, our selling, administrative and research expenses fell $19 million from the first quarter and are down $108 million from the same period in 2008. We also continued to reduce or reorganize manufacturing capacity in response to the volume declines. Our action since the fourth quarter of 2008 scale back the Company's manufacturing operations resulted in $13 million in reduced spending compared to the first quarter and $43 million since the second quarter of 2008. Our capital spending in the second quarter was $75 million, 32% lower than the same period in 2008 and for the first half of the year, we have spent a $939 million on capital projects with 31% less and during the six months of 2008. While we are working hard to lower our cost during the downturn, we are still finding ways to make the Company stronger for the long run. We are continuing to fund critical and time-sensitive projects since those linked to 2010 product launches and research and development on fuel economy improvement. Even with the reductions we have made, capital spending in 2009 will represent the third largest total in our history. We also launched the first of our four new engine platforms in June, the ISF 3.8 engine went into production, our Foton-Cummins joint venture in China, the next platform, the ISF 2.8 is expected to start production at the end of this year. We continued to provide world class service and support to our customers across all four business segments. We are investing in new ways to demonstrate that we care about our customers' success even in the toughest time. We have taken advantage of the volume slowdown to improve processes and synchronize flows through a number of plants and distribution centers so that when demand does return, we will be ready to ramp up as quickly as possible. We have moved swiftly, both within individual businesses and working across our business unit to solve inventory and supply chain problems. These efforts have led to a significant improvement in our inventory position. As you know, we have reduced our workforce significantly in the past several months. Our employees have responded to this challenge by working together more effectively than ever. The increase productivity we are seeing is one of the primary reasons we have responded to this recession more effectively than in previous downturns. Pat will talk about our business segments in a moment but I want to close with a few words on or relationship with Chrysler. As you know, Chrysler merged from bankruptcy protection in June. As part of its plan to contracts with the Dodge Ram Heavy Duty Pick Up Truck were assigned to the new Chrysler and while those associated with our light duty diesel program were not. Both of these results were as we expected. Production of the 6.7 liter turbo diesel engine for the Ram have resumed temporarily at our Columbus mid range engine plant to fulfill the remaining demand for 2009. We expect to return to work on a more permanent basis when Chrysler begins production of the 2010 model year trucks this fall. We were actively seeking additional customers for our light duty engine even as we continue to discuss a new arrangement with Chrysler. Although the recession has delayed our plans to begin light duty engine production in US, we remained convinced that this market has significant potential for Cummins. We have a lot of work ahead of us but I am confident that we have the plans and the people in place to manage through the global recession and emerge in even stronger company. Now I will turn it over to Pat who will provide more details about the second quarter.
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: Thank you, Tom. Cummins delivered the solid financial performance this quarter considering the challenging market conditions we continue to face. We remain on track to meet our 2009 guidance of achieving 5% EBIT margins before restructuring and generating positive cash flow. Second quarter sales were down 37%, a drop of almost $1.5 billion from a year ago, which contributed to a decrease in gross margins of $431 million. This was partially offset by spending reductions in selling, administration and research and development of $108 million. EBIT margins drop from 12.1% last year to 4.8% this quarter excluding the $7 million of restructuring charge. Compared to the first quarter, sales were slightly down. However, EBIT margins excluding restructuring charges included from 3.9% to 4.3% as a result of a cost reduction actions with stronger joint venture income in the emerging markets. Earnings per share were $0.30 this quarter excluding the restructuring charges. Let me provide more detail in the performance of each of our segments as well as our full year expectations. In order to make the comparisons more meaningful at some of our volumes, I will also highlight the sequential [vering's] analysis. Distribution revenues highlighted in slide seven were down 20% from a year ago with 9% of the drop due to currency but were up 12% versus the first quarter. Profitability remained strong at 11.9% of sales which is above the segments target profitability levels. For the year, we are maintaining our previous revenue guidance of down 15% to 20% of distribution and playing at the second half will be slightly up from the first half of the year in sales mainly due to seasonality. Given the year-to-date performance of the segment, we are increasing our EBIT margin expectations to 12% of sales in 2009. We are pleased with the performance of the distribution segment in this downturn which shows our diversification efforts that we are doing on. In the engine segment, revenues dropped 45% versus the same quarter a year ago driving segment profitability to nearly breakeven. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, revenues dropped to further 12% to almost $200 million due to the Chrysler shutdown and a short reduction in demand for high horse power engines. However, despite the lower revenues, segment profitability improved sequentially over the first quarter as a result of continued cost reduction and stronger joint venture earnings in the emerging markets. We are maintaining our previous full year guidance for revenues going 30% to 35% and EBIT margins between 1% to 1.5% of sales for the engine segment. You can find more details about our outlook for the engine markets on slide 11 of our presentation. We are forecasting not the classic heavy duty truck production of 98,000 units in 2009 and the market share for the year at 47% or 2% each points up from 2008. From medium duty truck, we expect our shipments to drop over 20% in Brazil, more than 30% in North America and close to 60% in Europe. We are forecasting revenues to be up 20% for bus due to stimulus packages especially in North America and in India and for industrial engines, revenues will be down more than 40% with all markets affected by the global slowdown and channel inventory collections. Our guidance implies a slight increase in revenues from the first half to the second half of the year for engines mainly due to the higher demand from truck and bus applications in North America and some stabilization and global construction markets following inventory collections. We also expect profitability to improve sequentially in the second half of the year from slightly higher volumes, stronger joint venture income in the emerging markets, more commodity cost as well as the impact of the restructuring actions we have taken over the past six months. For the component segment, revenues in the second quarter also declined significantly by 41% from a year ago and were 5% lower than the previous quarter. The short fall off in the demand cause profitability to drop to a negative 2% of sales which is well below the rate of 9% that we reported last year and was in the previous quarter results. For the full year, we are maintaining our previous guidance of revenue down 30% to 35% and EBIT in the range of 1% to 2% of sales. We expect to see a slight improvement in revenue from the first to the second half of the year mainly from North America and Chinese on highway demand. Profitability for the segment will improve sequentially in the second half of the year as a result of the higher volumes and cost reduction initiatives. And finally, our power generation segment was affected by the global reduction of commercial construction projects and channel inventory collections particularly in Europe and in the Middle East. Sales decline 35% this quarter versus a year ago and 7% from the first quarter which is normally our weakest quarter of the year. This short decline in sales resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.7% of sales in the quarter compared to the rate of 12.3% in the second quarter of 2008. For the full year, we are reducing the revenue guidance for the segment to a decline of 30% to 35% as the outlook for the second half of the year shows further softening. We are also reducing EBIT guidance to the range of 7% to 8% of sales for the full year as a result of the short lower volumes and the pricing pressure we discussed on our last call. For the total company in 2009 as Tim mentioned, we are maintaining our guidance of revenue staying slightly more than 30% and EBIT margins of 5% of sales excluding the restructuring charges. Now, moving to the cash flow statement, we were pleased with the cash management performance during the second quarter. We generated $238 million of cash from the reduction of inventory which contributed to a net inflow of cash for the quarter of $181 million. All four segments reduced inventory but more notably in the late cycle businesses or five horse per engines, power generation and distribution. As a result, we were able to fund operations from internal cash flow throughout the quarter without having to access our available credit facilities. The capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 15.9%. Cash management will continue to be a top priority for the Company. For the remainder of the year, we believe we have opportunities to reduce inventory further as we expect the late safer markets will continue to burn off inventory. We continue to prioritize our capital investments and still anticipates spending $300 million to $350 million this year including capital for flood related damage. In summary, we remain committed to generating positive cash flow in 2009 which will allow us to continue to invest in typical technologies and in profitable growth opportunities. We will now take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Meredith Taylor - Barclays Capital.
Meredith Taylor - Barclays Capital: I am hoping you can talk a little bit more about what you saw in the UK and the Middle East in the power gen business. If you could kind of talk about how that evolved over the course of the quarter on a month-to-month basis and then if you could give us a little bit more color on where you think that that channel is right now in the way of reducing inventory and how much there is still is to go?
T. M. (Tim) Solso: Okay, in Middle East and Europe; Middle East was the biggest one. There was quite a very large growth in power gen over the last several years there and the market was one where, there was quite a bit of stocking in the channel because you not only do they mark a lot of goes or a lot of growth but they wanted it on short lead of time. So, we added up significant stocking position in the Middle East and our business demand was just buying that for some time. Then over the course of the first and second quarter demand fell off, what we said in our remarks was that demand fell out significantly in the second quarter even over the first which is right and then our distribution channel began to react. We did some cancellations and reductions in the demand in the first quarter. We did quite a bit more in the second quarter as a result, our inventory positions in both places are down to much more normal levels. I will say to you though that still our view is we have more inventory in the channel than demand would suggest today and particularly in the Middle East but we will have that corrected within this quarter as our review, by the time we get done with this quarter, we will be at normal inventory levels is what we expect. But again, our view now is we are in much more, while there is a little bit left to go, we are in much more normalized position feeling much more comfortable for where we are. We took most of the productions in the second quarter that we needed to take.
Meredith Taylor - Barclays Capital: Can you talk a little bit about what kind of price action you saw in the inventory that you reduced? I mean, you did a great job in terms of working the inventory through the system.
T. M. (Tim) Solso: We did not actually do many price reductions on the inventory. As we said in the last call, we were forecasting price reductions of somewhere, on a net basis, somewhere around 1%. So we had some increases at the beginning of the year. Our expectation is we would lose some of those price increases over the course of the year and the net would maybe be 1% down. So, we are not taking significant price actions on a systematic basis. What we are seeing is in fact, in the market, if price is not being a big lever in most market, there are few places where dealers have extra inventory and they are taking some action on a deal-by-deal basis but so far, price is actually doing okay in the market as a general matter and we are being very, very conservative on price. It did not serve us that well to be aggressive on price in the last downturn. What we did is lower price and demand did not go up and our view is that is still likely to be the case here. So, really in terms of price, what you can think of is if there is an individual project that looks like lowering price a little bit would make a difference, we might but as a general matter, we are not lowering price.
Meredith Taylor - Barclays Capital: Okay and then just one last quick question and I will pass it along, can you just update us on where you are with respect to backlog in that business?
T. M. (Tim) Solso: Yes, backlog, we are at about a quarters with a backlog. We entered the year at something like nine months of backlog. I am talking about a commercial gen set business. They are not all ancillaries but commercial gen set business which is where backlog mostly exist. We entered the business with a year with about nine months. We are operating that with about three months and that kind of lead time, three months lead time is actually pretty typical when you are not sold out of units. That is not pretty average. So that is okay. The issue is what will demand do going forward. That is really the question ahead of us. I think backlog is in okay level now. We just need to make sure we continue to see sales flatten out as oppose to drop as you heard from Pat. One of our concerns is that sales will drop a little further in the second half.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chip Miller - JPMorgan.
Chip Miller - JPMorgan: It is Chip Miller for Anne at JPMorgan. Can you provide a little bit more color on some of the other later cycle market as well maybe even on just a relative basis comparing mining, oil and gas, add to power gen and then also any color there on how much backlog you have?
T. M. (Tim) Solso: Yes, in terms of in this quarter, Chip, we saw some continued deterioration in some of the late cycle market. Mining and oil and gas were two that we definitely saw sequential deterioration. As you saw in our outlook and in the presentation, we are still expecting very low level of demand coming from those late cycle markets for the rest of the year. Commercial marine is another one where we have seen especially from a year-over-year perspective, a very weak level of demand, the concerns around credit availability and just the fact that freight tonnage for marine purposes is at low levels as well as commodity prices. So, I think the cancellations that started to accelerate at the end of the first quarter we have clearly seen run through our high horse power engine facilities in the UK and the US and in India and utilization rates are at significantly lower levels than what we saw coming in to the year.
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: Chip this is Pat. What I would add to what Tim just said is that we would expect the mining markets now to be down around 40% for the full year and that second half could be half of what the first half earnings were. So, no sign of any improvement in mining for 2009. We will see what 2010 comes in the future. Likewise in oil and gas, we are looking at 30% drop from revenues in 2009 and most of that has already been recognized, most of the revenues already been picked in the first half of the year. So both oil and gas and in mining, second half is going to be tough on the first half.
Chip Miller - JPMorgan: If I could ask on the eliminations line, if I look at the operating profit, it looks like a positive $34 million usually at the negative. Can you just say what drove that?
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: Yes, we will be happy to assist you on that. As total inventory came down in the quarter with amount of inter company source inventory also came down quite significantly in the quarter and let me walk through a simple example that can illustrate this, Chip. So, when the engine business sales an engine of power generation, the engine business will record that margin at the time of sale. But in [32.15] business, power gen have not been sold at the engine of gen set to an end customer then from a consolidated perspective, it is still in my inventory and I have to back the margin that the engine business reported. When the power gen does come to sale the gen set including the engine, at that point, both power gen will recognize their margin and I can reverse the inter company margin that I had to eliminate in the previous quarter. So again, so one of the complicated, the basic thought was taking inventory down. We have taken inter company source inventory down and the margins that were tied up in the inter company inventory have also come down quite significantly in the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company: A quick follow up maybe to start with on that one, where are we in the process of inventory reduction? Should we expect that corporate eliminations line to be similar in the second half or do we get back to normal sort of in the fourth quarter maybe?
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: Mostly we do not get specific guidance on elimination. It is included in our 5% guidance and has always been, I think through the first half of the year with no reduced inventory borrowing $280 million and on the last call, Tom mentioned our goal for the year was to reduce inventory by over $200 million that is slightly been presently surprised just we go after that in the second quarter. We do anticipate as I said in my remarks further opportunity in the second half of the year to reduce inventory but it will not be, we should not expect another $200 million. From looking at our range, I would say range of between $50 million and $100 million in the second half of the year. So the end fact on the eliminations would be much more than what you see in the second quarter just passed.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company:
T. M. (Tim) Solso: No, it is not just the Middle East. It is a good question. The Middle East, we were talking about supply chain corrections and I was just talking about where there was a concentration, where we had to bring orders back, cancel orders and we had to get rid of inventory but in fact, power generation markets globally are down and so what has happened is since the beginning of the year, our expectations for the sales in the power generation market have decreased and we decreased them at some in the first quarter and then we decreased them more in the second quarter as we got better use of where we thought the market would be for the year. So, both the fact that we had to do some inventory and supply chain corrections which reduce sales and absorption since the second quarter happened but also our view of sales for the year also declined across all the market frankly.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company: Okay so it is broad based. That is great.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse - North America.
Analyst for Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse - North America: It is actually Jay for Jaime. Quick question, you guys done a very nice job on the distribution side. I know that you touched on the last quarter there is some mixed issues but specifically, is anything really driving that besides for the mix and some of the cost actions that you have had?
Tom Linebarger: Yes, the other thing that we have talked about the distribution business for the last couple of calls is that we have, if the business that we have been growing and expanding into over the last several years, so relatively new business were coming as an owner and as a result, we have been able to improve the performance and cost structure of the businesses as we have grown them. So we now have a larger distributor with more territory. They have better economy of scale and operations and we are as an owner, we are able to find best practices in each distribution location and then move them across. So, we are just been having better same store performance, if you want to think of it that way across the board as well as to make sure we can focus on good markets in various territories and we can bring whatever capability we need to bear in that territory to capture the market. So, I think just better performance in the business as we have grown and become more capable ourselves in addition to the things you mentioned have improved performance.
Analyst for Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse - North America: Okay, great and then a follow up, in terms of your expectation for the fourth quarter with heavy duty engines, what are you assuming for stock piling?
Tom Linebarger: Not to mean ward, but stock piling, you probably know it is not allowed but as a general matter but we do not exactly know how much our customers intend to use production versus what they need for transition to their new models in 2010. The fact is that given the volatility of the market that they are facing, I think it is tough balance for them as it stands. So, they are all trying to figure that out in sales. What we are responding to is orders. So, we are responding to orders from OEMs and trying to be as nimble as we can because markets as you know are very low. It is down a lot and we are trying to make sure that we are ready to capture whatever order comes our way in order to help our customers both serve current needs as well as transition of models into 2010 and there is a lot of transition too. They have not only the engine but many of them have new truck models that they are try and transition to and the systems are complicated. So, there is definitely transition work in there but each OEM that they manage, what they are going to do there and we are just trying to make sure we are there to support them.
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: But as far as pre-buy of the new engine goes or approximately for the regulation takes place, I do not think it is going to be at the same levels that we have seen in previous years. It does not appear to be that way and we have started to see these orders about this time so we do not expect to have the same kind of experiences that we have had where you maximize capacity in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Jerry Ravich] - Goldman Sachs.
[Jerry Ravich] - Goldman Sachs: Pat, can you please give us some more detail on the drivers of the 450 basis points sequential margin improvement you are targeting for components? What portion of that do you expect to come from a greater JV income versus cost initiatives that you mentioned and any other pieces?
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: Yes, most of that will be much coming from JV income. Most of the improvement and components from the first half to the second half is going to come through some recovery and volumes that we talked about earlier on and also from cost reductions and improvement operation efficiency and encouraged by the signs we were seeing towards end of the second quarter and very confident that in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, when we announce this result, you will see the evidence of that.
[Jerry Ravich] - Goldman Sachs: And Pat, what parts of the business is that? Is that the turbo charger piece or is that missions' control? Can you give us some more color on the cost reductions?
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: My expectations most of the businesses within the segment will continue as it have been doing to focus on taking cost down and that will be something about technology and some with mission solutions infiltration. Our fuel system business is more linked through the heavy duty demand in the engine segments so that is a little bit disconnected but certainly in fuel segments, you should expect to see, I would expect to see improvements and cost reductions significantly in the third and fourth quarter.
[Jerry Ravich] - Goldman Sachs: And Pat, what is your line expense in the quarter and what is your [40.40] assumed for the year?
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: I think one thing in the second quarter was 4.4%. The sale is somewhat to what it was in Q1 and I would not expect much change in that run rate through the rest of the year.
[Jerry Ravich] - Goldman Sachs: And Tom, based on the joint venture results, it looks like you are seeing some improved power gen demand in China. Can you talk about if you are seeing signs of order recovery in other parts of Asia in recent months, maybe June, July?
Tom Linebarger: Most of what we are seeing so far in China is actually automotive improvement in China. We are seeing a DC-DC joint venture starting to see some up tick in demand. I have already seen some up tick in demand which will be for trucks. We also see some, we have also bus demand and we are beginning to see signs of construction as well because there is the stimulus work in China started earlier and they have got more of the dollars out so there is actually stimulus stuff going that is driving again bus and construction. But automotive is the biggest single lever for us in China both because that is the market that is improving the quickest and that is where we have the largest piece of our business in China today.
[Jerry Ravich] - Goldman Sachs: And Tom what about for the power gen outlook for China, what are you seeing there? Have you seen orders started that come back?
Tom Linebarger: Not yet, I mean it is not that within for us far so there was less negative impact. There is not the same sign at least that we have seen that the power gen markets are recovering in a significant way in China though I would not be surprised to see them a couple of quarters later start to also see some recovery because essentially in China, we are just seeing the recovery starting and power gen will be a little later cycle like we have in the automobile orders. So, I would not be surprised to see it but we have not seen it yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities.
Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities: First question, I guess if we can go back to the power gen, are you seeing any inventory liquidation at this point from the rental companies?
Tom Linebarger: Andy, nothing that I can speak to. It is not a subject that is up to date, it should be on but I have not, there is nothing that I know about in that regard.
Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities: And then on the, it was better than expected, but on the heavy duty truck line, I am trying to understand the revenue performance in the quarter. Did you realize any pricing or improvement in part sales or gain in market share relative to what you had in the first quarter?
Tom Linebarger: No, not really.
Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay.
Tom Linebarger: Tell me more, tell me what numbers you are looking at that seem unusually good to you.
Andy Casey - Wells Fargo Securities: Well, if I tie it to what I assume in the breakdown of that, the North American unit production went down sequentially but your revenues stayed basically flat.
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: Yes, I think the one item that could cause some of that would be market share and market share at the end of May, we were close to 50% and I think in the June, we also got it closed to 50%. So, it is up definitely a couple of points from the first quarter but there will be no pricing and I have lengthened this with any thoughts mix change rather with regards to that sigma.
T. M. (Tim) Solso: I think probably Andy, there is probably maybe 500 units more Q2 to Q1 in North American heavy duty truck so I think it is more reflection of as we indicated that it is not pricing, it is market share penetration.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Rentschler - Wall Street Access.
Charlie Rentschler - Wall Street Access:  I got confused by the four new engine platforms that Tim said would be launched next year and then Tim, you went on to talk about heavy duty and I think then Tom pitched in 3.8 to 2.8 but I did not hear what the fourth engine was or maybe I was not paying attention.
T. M. (Tim) Solso: Yes, the 2.8 to 3.8 and 11.9 in the 13 liter.
Charlie Rentschler - Wall Street Access:  Okay, there we go and Tim, can you update us on your thoughts on Nova Starr's plan to launch heavy duty EGR engines next year?
T. M. (Tim) Solso: Yes, we still have a fundamental difference of opinion on which technology is the best. We have a long standing close relationship with Nova Starr and we continue to have that both with management levels as well as between our distributors and their dealers. We are about 85% of their bill right now and we continue to discuss future opportunities but the disagreement between SCR and EGR remains.  
Charlie Rentschler - Wall Street Access:  Okay and just as a final question, if you look at the world, how would you rank the best behaving markets? Would China and India at the top and then going on down are, what is your latest..?
T. M. (Tim) Solso: I would think that in terms of, as Tom said and I want to be really careful about this is that we are seeing a heartbeat in China and India, okay. It is not a full pledge recovery and we are also seeing some good activity in Brazil so when we talk to you 90 days from now, we will be able to say more about those markets but clearly in India, well in all three countries, the stimulus activities by their governments has been at least reasonably effective so far and we will see those markets, I think at least in our plans right now that would be followed by North America and Europe would be left.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: On the components business, do you think, do you expect to see a little bit of a ramp in the second half of 2009 and into early 2010 just from having higher content on the new emissions engines?
Tom Linebarger: Yes, but again mostly of course in 2010, not in 2009 but yes, in 2010, we will have higher content and that will help our revenue especially in the emission solutions business, both in some degree in turbo two. The question will be the volume and right now, we have not done our 2010 plan now but the expectation is that volumes will drop in the automotive, the heavy duty truck and mid range truck market after the first of the year, at least in the first half it will drop some and then our hope is to recover after that. We do not know for sure yet because as Tim says, the pre buy is unclear and not likely to be huge but that is the part we do not know is the overall volume but we do expect higher content on the engines that we shipped in 2010.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: And that is all margin accretive, all those mix pieces you have given us together?
Tom Linebarger: It is margin accretive, right. What you are asking is, are we selling those emissions bucks for more than cautious to make them, yes, we are. That is our intent. Is that what you are asking?
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: No, it is just you gave us like three different pieces. This will be stronger. This will be weaker and when you put all those together, do you think we will start to see more respect in the margins at that component.
Tom Linebarger: I understand your question better now, Joel. The answer is I do not know yet. I mean the answer is I have to put together my 2010 plan because the volume impact versus the price and cost impact is just not clear too. I got a better hand on the volume because the volume, all three will be relevant to whether it ends up being margin accretive or not in total. I just do not know the answer yet.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Okay.
Tom Linebarger: I mean long term, it definitely will be. The question is I think for first half of 2010 is what I do not know yet.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Okay and then in the engine business, I do not know if Andy was asking about this before but the market share is up only 2 points and it seems like your percentage point gain has been running a lot higher than that since that got out of the business. Is there some change going on there or is it just, I do not know, seasonality or something else?
T. M. (Tim) Solso: It was 2% over the second quarter over the first quarter. If you go back last year, the market share is up 5 points.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Okay, so it is still pretty consistent and you are still sticking with the 35% plus or minus as we round into 2010?
T. M. (Tim) Solso: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn - UBS.
Henry Kirn - UBS: I am wondering if you could talk a little about the health of the end user balance sheet across your business given that we are a little further now into the downturn.
Tom Linebarger: Yes, are you saying in a trucking company specifically or wider look, Henry?
Henry Kirn - UBS: Trucking companies but then also the power gen end-user stat as well.
Tom Linebarger: Yes, okay so let me start with trucking companies. Both Tim and I have visited a number of customers and they are definitely hurting. There is a closer range, you have got small trucking companies which are suffering quite badly and then you got bigger fleets who have more financial strength but all are having a really rough go and a lot of what Tim talked about with regard how big the pre buy is partially affected by confidence in our engine is why do they need to pre buy but a lot have also is that they just do not have money. I meaning buying is a really tough trade cycle now because people do not have much money to buy. So balance sheets are definitely, I mean it is a tough time buying capital equipments. It is difficult and that is why you are seeing such low truck purchasing activity and the other added part of it is used trucks markets week so they can trade all once away. So, for the truck companies, which is what they are trying to deal with both with their customers cannot trade out their old one and they do not have much money to buy new ones. I think that is probably straight forward point given where the economy is but their balance sheets are generally weak. In the power gen market, it is a very different dynamic that you are looking at because end users of power gen equipment are typically somebody building a building or constructing a sewage treatment plan. So, now there is really no general statements you can make. You are talking about serving really all sectors of the economy and it is really building markets. The question is who is building new buildings or upgrading new buildings or etc and that is why you see sectors that are tied in non risk construction so it is when people are active and that is why it is a late cycle fall and it is also going to be a late cycle recovery because it is tied to non risk spending mostly.
T. M. (Tim) Solso: And I would add that both in construction and in automotive truck, some of the dealers have gone under and there has been some consolidation there if you go to some of the consumer markets, both companies cannot get credit. They are basically out of production right now and I would say there are several there, also the marine dealers are hurting right now. Same thing with ERVs. We have seen some bankruptcies there. Again, the dealers had some issues so across the board, there are some fall out and I would say generally, credit is either not available or available on a very limited basis.
Tom Linebarger: Henry, you did not asked but just because it is related, you probably know that we are also working very closely with our supply base and particularly that part of the supply base is also supply the car industry and they are also financial health is a really important focus for us. We got a very in-depth effort on that. We have been working on that for more than a year now. We have people very closely focused on making sure our supply base, the critical part that remain healthy on a long standing basis but that is also concern of ours with regard to financial health.
Henry Kirn - UBS: That actually addressed my follow up. So, one other thing, globally as you look at your top competition, are there any opportunities from competitors who maybe catering a little bit?
Tom Linebarger: The answer is we are definitely on the look out for any such opportunities. Well, I think it is unhealthy and unwise to predict the failure of any competitor. I do think that we are of the view as we said during our remarks. We think we are well positioned. We think we are financially well positioned. We think we are managing really well and our opportunity here is to demonstrate that we care about our customers even when things are tough so that when things get better, we build customer loyalty and we are there to serve them in. We are going to do that irrespective of who is around to compete with us but we will be looking for opportunities as they arise.
T. M. (Tim) Solso: I would just add that you should not underestimate the fact that we are bringing out more product in 2010 and the various tiers and components associated with that more than we have ever done as a company and assuming we perform well in those launches and the products perform well, I think we will have a significant opportunity versus our competition and a significant opportunity for growth and we have kind of talked about that and we are now entering into getting very close to launching these products and Tom and the operating people are paying a lot of attention to that and the results that we are seeing from our prototypes are test and so forth are very positive right now so I think in looking at common clearly into 2010 and the 2011 are product launches and the amount that we are doing is a significant opportunity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Elias - Sterne, Agee & Leach. 
Ben Elias - Sterne, Agee & Leach: I have a question. Historically, you have given us great detail on the EBIT bridge and I have seen that and if I just compare what we saw in February and on the change in April especially with FX where FX went from being a headwind to tailwind and since then, we have seen the dollar weakened further. I was wondering what the sensitivity on that and if anything else has changed on that EBIT bridge especially the other thing was the prior material input cost that again swung on your saver so I was just wondering about that and also on the engine side for competitor who does not have an engine ready, how long is that transition period and people have mentioned a special agreement with a supplier. I was just wondering about your production rate and your contingency planning for additional manufacturing over the back half of the year.
Patrick (Pat) J. Ward: Well I will take the first part of the question and maybe Tom will jump in the second part. On the EBIT bridge year over year, it is not definite from what we talked about on the last couple of call. So, we are going to be doing first the four percentage points from 2008. Volume is clearly the largest driver of that. We are seeing negative joint venture income of seven tensile of point year over year which is consistent with what we said before and they will be offset by placing and cost reduction. So the bridge I talked about back in April is exactly the same bridge at the higher level that we are looking at today. If you got specific questions on Q2 to Q2, I am happy to follow up with actually year over year picture. With regards to foreign exchange, in the second quarter, it costs us about $150 million of revenue which was both 4% of total but had very little impact of the bottom line. So, FX is not really a major factor from profitability perspective quarter over quarter or year over year and then on material cost, the question you asked for material cost, it is moving around a little bit but I think the story remains the same that the first half of 2009 will be better. It has been better for the second half of 2008 but it is still higher in what the first half of 2008 was. Now, what you will expect to see for the Company, further improvement in the second half of 2009. So, we are seeing four consecutive quarters last year of a headwind on material cost than commodity cost and we are starting to see in the first two quarters of this year that coming back and we expect to do some more improvement in the second half of the year. I do not think we are going to get all the way back to where we started off at the beginning of 2008 but we have made significant progress in getting back towards that point.
Tom Linebarger: Ben, sorry, Pat talked is long. Could you just remind me what your question was again? Was it about transition?
Ben Elias - Sterne, Agee & Leach: Sure. I was just wondering about competitive coming out on engine, any other stuff and if that engine is delayed, what are the contingency plans if they require more engines, how long is that transition period and what does it do to production and manufacturing rates?
Tom Linebarger: First of all, with regard to their engine, we are not really pretty detailed what their plans on delays or on time mark. There is, as you said, some speculation about it but I think it is speculation. I do not and I certainly cannot comment on. They are the best to comment on that and with regard to transitions, if our customers are not ready with their engine or their truck, as I mentioned, each of them is going to manage that in their way. They need to be the ones who figure out which trucks are ready and which engines they are going to use and they place orders on us for engines that they need both in current production today and for their transition period and we will respond to orders as such and comply. There is one significant complication is that we will be providing engines for 2010 that are actually with FCR. So whoever we are showing engines to, w need to be able to integrate an FCR system into their truck. That is what we have been spending the last most of this year are making sure that works flawlessly and customers take good reliability and performance and that is what providing the fuel economy advantage for our customers in 2010. So that is one complication that every truck may go we will have to deal with which is they have the engineer FCR on and as you know in that case, they are not claimed. They will offer FCR in 2010 so that is just one thing to deal with. But I really think in terms of what their backup plans are, I am going to stop. You better ask them.
Operator: You have a follow up question from the line of Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company: I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things quickly. First of all, do you guys, are you seeing an order book building at all for your fourth quarter truck engine business in the US?
Tom Linebarger: The answer is order book, no. indications that people may want to increase orders in the fourth quarter somewhat begin with Tim's caveat there is not going to be a big pre buy that there will be some increase yet. The hands are forecast.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company: Okay so you still have, I am assuming, plenty of delivery slots for the fourth quarter available?
Tom Linebarger: That would be correct?
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company: And then just on this whole Nova Starr thing, I guess just to be clear here, is your understanding of the regulations that Nova Starr will not be able to purchase a meaningful number of your current 15 liter engine in the fourth quarter to tie them over in 2010?
Tom Linebarger: My understanding of the regulation is again just, as you guessed with any regulation is complicated and you have to read it but let me just say this simply. What the regulation provides for is that manufacturers still have a reasonable opportunity to transition between one year in the other. That is basically what is allowed for and that is what all these OEMs are responding to is reasonable transition. The reps I think is at a level of detail interpretation that really you ought to take a look to yourself and it would be this year and dumb of me to summarize in any way that I interpret it. But here is what I would say is that each of them has had a transition plan and that has been the case for every single emissions change that there has been 2007, 2002, etc and that is what everybody is doing and so if we go back to the previous question, I think the best way to figure out what Nova Starr's plan is in terms of transition is ask them because it is just not our, we are not in charge of figuring it out and we just cannot it out because they are pretty, they are managing it as they go. They are not all set in stone. They are all trying to figure out what to do given market conditions that are out there.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company: Fair enough, okay. I was just trying to make sure. I am sure you guys understand the rights better than I do so that is kind of what I was looking for.
Tom Linebarger: No, it is a fair question, Steve. It is just plot with difficulty within the regulations. You have to read it to…
T. M. (Tim) Solso: It is not precise as Tom is saying. There is ambiguity. There is, so people can use judgment.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company:
Tom Linebarger: I think what you should take away, Steve, is I think we have got some design related work and programs that we think we can get material cost improvements. I would not, when Pat was giving you the bridge earlier about component stability to deliver 400 or so basis points more in the second half, that has a lot to do obviously with the volume ticked up that we expect in the second half and some of those businesses and the other part being on commodity cost, not from beating up suppliers but really some really good work that we are doing to manage the material commodity cost content in our own product.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company: Okay and I guess, I was sorry, I was not clear about that. I was thinking more about 2010 as you sell components to other manufacturers. I assume you will have new agreements and new contracts with them and my understanding was that the pricing, the base pricing, would be a little more favorable in 2010 as you did that transition.
Tom Linebarger: Steve, you have that right. That is exactly we said last time that is right. So, we are definitely, we negotiated with 2010. We have more content as one of the previous callers asked and we have done this cost reduction that both Pat and Tim talked about. Those are all elements to how we drive towards our target profitability as volumes improve is that we have a good contract for the customers, good costs and then we begin to get volumes back. That is exactly what will take us to our target profitability levels. You are right. That is the significant element.
T. M. (Tim) Solso: Both ignition solutions and turbo chargers have moved towards long term agreements with the OEMs effective in 2010 and going beyond and that is where the pricing would come in.
Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company: And I guess the point is you are getting that pricing as those contracts are renewed, if there has not been pushed back or anything on that.
Tom Linebarger: Plenty of push back.
T. M. (Tim) Solso: But we are given the result, yes.
Dean Cantrell: I think that is all the time we have for questions today. I appreciate everyone's attendance and I look forward to talking with you again in the next quarter earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Charles G. McClure, Jr.: Before we turn to the presentation, I’d like to briefly comment on how tough the first quarter was for us. It was due in large part but not solely to the unprecedented drop in volumes in both our CVS and LVS market segments around the world. As a result of this precipitous volume decline, our first quarter financial performance was significantly impacted.  We’re literally experiencing a total transformation of our industry. And while we’re responding and adapting quickly to the market changes around us, we’re also focused on proactively managing costs through this global recession. With demand down dramatically, we’re taking extreme cost cutting measures to mitigate the impact of volumes declining faster than any of us anticipated.  The decisions we’re making are tough and some of the change we’ve made have affected our people, but the changes we’re making are necessary to help ensure we emerge an even stronger company once the markets return to more normal levels.  As we’ve been doing for some time, we remain focused on continuing to optimize our global manufacturing footprint to ensure we have the flexibility to adjust quickly to changes in production levels. We also are relentless in our efforts to improve our liquidity to ensure we weather the downturn, and we continue to put our energy behind the areas that provide high margin and high growth opportunity.  Now, let’s turn to slide three to review the highlights of our first quarter. We’re pleased to report that despite the challenging environment, we once again did what we said we’d do. Although the developments with LVS caused us to withdraw our first quarter guidance for the company, our CVS and Wheels business did meet the first quarter EBITDA and sales milestones we outlined in our Analyst Day in December.  As a total company, we achieved sales of $1.4 billion in our first quarter, which is down $293 million or 18% compared to the $1.7 billion we reported in the same period last year. Excluding the impact of lower exchange rates, our sales would have been down by 11%. Our commercial vehicle aftermarket and specialty businesses both posted sales gains in the first quarter, which shows the resiliency of their business model.  During the first quarter, we incurred a loss of $56 million or $0.77 per share from continuing operations before special items compared to the $6 million or $0.08 per share we earned in the same period last year. We attribute this loss primarily to the extraordinary industry conditions we’re facing and, again, particularly to the sharp decline of production volumes in both our light and commercial vehicle business segments.  On a GAAP basis, our first quarter net loss from continued operations was $991 million, including several non-cash charges totaling $944 million, $665 million of that relates to valuation reserves for certain deferred tax assets and $279 million relates to other asset impairments primarily for our Light Vehicle Systems business.  Cash outflow from operations net of capital expenditures in the first quarter was $386 million compared to an outflow of $305 million in the same period last year. Our free cash flow is, of course, affected by the lower earrings for the quarter but our cash flow is highly seasonal as well. Last year, for instance, our outflow of $305 million in the first quarter was our worst cash flow quarter for the year but we saw our cash flow improve for the remainder of the year.  Jay will further explain the reasons for a decrease in our cash flow, but I want to assure you that we’re aggressively implementing a number of cost reduction initiatives that we believe will have a positive impact on our cash flow in the second half of 2009.  In October, we announced that we were reducing our workforce by 7%, tightening discretionary spending by 30% and reducing our planned capital expenditures. In December, we decided to make additional cost reductions, such as a 10% salary cut for U.S. salaried executives and a 5% cut for the rest of the U.S. salaried and non-production hourly workforce. We also implemented similar actions in other parts of the world.  In addition, at the January 30th board of directors meeting, the board agreed to reduce their annual compensation by 10%. Obviously, it’s a full team commitment to ensure we weather this current economic storm. We extended shutdowns and reduced work weeks at a number of our plants around the world.  We also suspended merit increases in 2009 and placed a temporary hold on the U.S. 401K matching program. We expect these additional cost reduction actions to raise the 2009 total to an estimated $165 million for CVS and $82 million for LVS. And we’re also pursuing aggressive restructuring actions as part of the LVS separation strategy. I’ll discus this in more detail in a few minutes.  These actions are indicative of our continuing focus on preserving our cash and liquidity. As part of this effort, we’re also announcing today that our board of directors voted to suspend the company’s quarterly dividend. By suspending the dividend, we’ll save about $29 million annually. In this uncertain economic environment, the board believes it’s a prudent step to preserve cash. Of course, the board will continue to regularly review and consider the level of dividend payments to shareholders.  Now, let’s turn to slide four. We’ve been keenly focused on restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, as well as refocusing the company for a number of years. We anticipate a slowdown in the market and we’ve been working hard to stay ahead of the curve. As you know, in the middle of 2006 we successfully completed the sale of our Light Vehicle Aftermarket business.  While we had initially started to sell the business as a whole, we achieved greater value for our shareholders by selling it in pieces and that’s exactly the scenario we’re facing with the sale of LVS today. In late 2006 and into 2007, we announced our Performance Plus initiative. When we rolled out the details of the program in mid-2007, we targeted $75 million in annual savings for 2008 and we achieved those savings.  In 2007, we also completed the sale of our Emissions Technology Business for a total consideration of $310 million. In May of 2008, we continued the company’s refocusing strategy by announcing our intention to separate our LVS and CVS businesses. Toward the end of last year we announced additional austerity actions.  As outlined earlier, we’ve already announced a number of cost reduction initiatives, and today we’re announcing the elimination of the LVS divisional organization, which resulted in further salary workforce reductions. We’re also evaluating and studying all options for the LVS Detroit Technical Center, including a possible sale of facility. We will, however, continue to focus on operating and delivering products on time to our customers from the adjacent Detroit LVS production site.  We expect the aggressive actions we’re executing will help allow us to have the liquidity to see our way through the current economic crisis in 2009, as well as help us position ourselves for growth when the economy and markets rebound.  Let’s now turn to slide five. As I just said, we responded quickly to the downturn of our markets by putting tough cost cutting initiatives in place. Let’s walk through some of the cost savings we expect to see in 2009 from these actions.  First, we expect incremental savings of $75 million on an annualized run rate from the Performance Plus program in 2009 with approximately $50 million from CVS operations and $25 million from the LVS operations. Second, from the significant austerity actions we announced at the end of October, we expect to save this year about $56 million in labor costs and about $49 million in discretionary spending and other costs.  This is in addition to the $75 million we expect to save from the Performance Plus program. Third, as I outlined to you earlier, we made several additional cash friendly cost reductions in January of this year. We expect a savings from these actions to total approximately $67 million in 2009. We anticipate we’ll achieve a total savings from all of these cost reduction initiatives in 2009 of about $165 million from CVS and $82 million from LVS.  This is a total estimated savings from CVS and LVS of $335 million on an annual run-rate basis. All of these cost reductions aim to make sure that the company preserves cash and remains stable in what we see is a challenging market going forward, as well as position us for growth when the economy rebounds.  It’s also important to remember that we’ve been adjusting to market conditions for several years now an that we’d already begun to act in March of 2007 when the North American Class A truck market dropped by nearly 50%. We have a proven track record for being able to respond quickly and manage through a downturn in our industry. Now, let’s turn to slide six. As we announced in January, current economic conditions have not allowed us to sell the LVS business as a whole for a fair value at this time. Therefore, we changed our approach and decided to divest the Body and Chassis businesses separately. Meanwhile, we’re focused on improving the performance and making significant cost reductions to these businesses. We’re executing aggressive profit improvement initiatives, including implementing tough actions to resize and flatten the structure of both organizations.  As I said earlier, since January we’ve eliminated the LVS divisional organization resulting in the reduction of more than 100 salary positions, as well as implementing several other cost reduction initiatives. Of the $57 million we’ll save on an annual run rate basis, we’ll capture $32 million of that in our 2009 fiscal year.  We’re managing body systems to maximum cost efficiencies so when pursue of sale we can ensure we’re getting acceptable returns for our shareholders. We’re also executing a similar strategy for the Chassis Organization, including accelerating restructuring efforts, while we pursue multiple actions to divest this business on a timely basis. Let’s now turn to slide seven. We’re pleased to report that we’ve had additional wins in the military vehicle space since our Analyst Day in December. As you can see from this slide, our military customers continue to win new contracts and we’re able to benefit from the new business. Our specialty business, including these military platforms, continues to be a significant contributor to our company’s result.  In January alone Navistar Defense was awarded 1,300 medium support vehicles for the Canadian military and 600 WorkStar variants for U.S. forces in Iraq, many of which will be built in 2009. We continue to achieve our strategic objectives to grow our military business to an intense and dedicated focus on customer requirements, as well as providing unique technology for our drive train and suspension products.  We’re also continuing to increase our military business with BAE to supply the FMTV program and with Navistar Defense to supply parts for Medium Tactical Vehicles. We’ll see a number of exciting future opportunities, including a large program with MRAP All Terrain Vehicles with an award expected later this spring, and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle or JLTV.  We not only continue to grow profitably with our military wins, but our aftermarket business also enjoys the benefits from the growing demand from military vehicles parts and service in the field. We’re also continuing to gain new business opportunities in other segments of our specialty business.  Moving on to slide eight, let’s take a moment to address the vehicle production level’s we’re using to plan our internal operating and cost cutting initiatives in 2009. As you know with industry conditions changing rapidly by the day, it’s difficult to forecast industry volumes beyond a couple of months. Therefore, the production levels we’re showing you on this slide are not intended to represent our company’s forecast for productions for the year. So what we’re doing is managing the business to the levels you see on this chart.  As you look at the chart we provided, in North America you’ll see the Commercial Vehicle Class A production levels is about 140,000 units down 27% from last year, and production levels for light vehicles is about 9.2 million units representing a 33% decline compared to a year ago. Again, this is not our forecast, but it is what we’re assuming for the purposes of running our businesses.  In Europe, it’s a worse scenario for the commercial truck industry. Shown here are European medium and heavy truck production volumes dropping by 45% to about 305,000 units, and the total European light vehicle volume levels declining by 26% to 16.5 million units.  In South America, the 2009 medium and heavy truck production levels were managing the business to, are at about 115,000 units representing a year-over-year decline of 29%. The chart also shows the light vehicle production levels in South America 3.5 million units were down 12% compared to last year. We’re also seeing production levels declining in Asia as well.  As I pointed out to you earlier, we’re taking the necessary steps in executing tough actions to manage the company to these lower production levels. Given the deterioration of the market environment and the current global constraints on credit, we remain intensely focused on maintaining the liquidity necessary to operate our business. We expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants and our material borrowing arrangement for the remainder of the year and believe the actions we’re taking today will only help to better position the company when economics and volumes improve. Let’s turn to slide nine. Our priorities for 2009 include an acceleration of our restructuring and additional cost reduction initiatives. We’ve eliminated more than 1,500 permanent and contract workers. We’ll continue to improve our operations, tighten controls on discretionary spending as well as continue to execute our Performance Plus Wave II program. Given all of the challenges in today’s marketplace, we’ve renewed our focus on improving our operational performance and supply chain management as we drive down inventory in an effort to make our global capacity more flexible.  Three, we’ll execute the light vehicle Body and Chassis strategy. Four, we’ll continue to grow the high margin segments of our business such as Commercial Vehicle Aftermarket and specialty segments. We’ll continue to pursue opportunities in a rapidly expanding remanufacturing arena. As trucks on the road get older, opportunities open up for our parts and services in markets all around the world.  And finally, we’ll continue to invest in innovations technology primarily focused on developing and producing products for our customers that improve fuel efficiency and are reliable and durable. Even with fuel prices coming down, our customers are looking for fuel economy as an ongoing competitive advantage, so we continue to invest in technologies such as Hybrids for medium and heavy duty trucks.  We’ll soon be delivering a full Hybrid diesel electric drive train to Wal-Mart designed for Class A commercial trucks, a project we worked on with Navistar and Cummins. This vehicle combined with our drive train support will further Wal-Mart’s efforts to achieve its efficiency goals. We’re also rolling out some high tech products this year, such as a new lighter weight axle, which we’ll introduce to our heavy truck customers at the Mid-America Truck Show in March. Before I turn the call over to Jay, I’d like to wrap up with a few key points. We’ve shown that we’ve got what it takes to manage through some very tough challenges. Two thousand eight was one of the toughest environments we’ve seen in decades, yet we delivered in spite of the conditions. Two thousand nine looks even more challenging with market volumes falling further. However, we believe some markets could potentially rebound quicker than others. When the time comes, we’ll benefit from our strong customer and geographic diversity. We continue to plan for the worst and hope for the best.  We’ve shown that we’re flexible that we can adapt quickly and take aggressive actions to remove cost and restructure to address market conditions. In addition to cutting costs, we have a strong risk management process in place to mitigate risk exposure we might have with suppliers or customers. We’ll continue to grow the business by investing in the profitable growth segments and divesting other segments so we remain focused on driving profit, managing cash, and implementing business strategies.  We know what we have to do and we’ve been planning for the worst by taking proactive steps. CVS’s solid performance over the last year testifies to that. LVS did not do as well as we would have liked. Some factors such as volumes and inventory were outside our control. However, where we do have control, we’re making the necessary operational changes and moving forward.  As I said, we’re firmly committed to our long-term strategy of focusing on commercial vehicle on and off highway market segments for both original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket customers. We’re focused on executing the body systems and chassis strategy to divest these businesses but as we’ve said, we won’t make a sale unless we’re able to achieve the appropriate level of value for our shareholders.  There is a great deal of uncertainty in all the markets we participate in around the world and the length and depth of the downturn in theses markets is unknown, but challenging times can also yield opportunities. And this crisis has given us the chance to improve our fixed cost structure and make fundamental changes to the organization that should help us to sustain it through these current conditions and as importantly, position us well when the markets turn around.  This year we’re celebrating the company’s 100 year heritage. We’ve proven over those 100 years that we can meet the challenges of a tough industry environment and I expect to do the same going forward. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Jay. 
Jeffrey A. Craig:   Slide 10 is our income statement for continuing operation before special items. This reflects CVS plus all three businesses of LVS, Body, Chassis and Wheels. Gross margin was down 44% on an 18% sales decline. SG&A was up on an absolute basis from last year. I’ll talk more about that on the next slide. Earnings in our minority owned defoliates were down almost without exception and for all the same reasons that our internal profitability was down.  Interest expense was $22 million reflecting our strong cash position at the beginning of the quarter. Excluding special items, our continuing operations lost $45 million before tax. Normally you’d expect an income tax benefit to accompany that loss. However, we can no longer record a benefit in those jurisdictions where we’ve written off our differed tax assets. In other jurisdictions where we’re profitable, we continued to accrue income taxes.  I know that many of you try to model our taxes along with our other income statement items, let me just say I appreciate how difficult this is for you to forecast. As we reported earlier, our net loss from continuing operations was $56 million, compared to income of $6 million last year. On a per share basis, we lost $0.77 for the quarter compared to a profit of $0.08 last year. Let's turn to slide 11. The table on the left hand side explains the increase in SG&A compared to last year. The first item represents costs we've added into LVS to prepare to be a standalone company. We largely disassembled that added structure in January. The second item primarily refers to a one-time reversal in the first quarter of last year when we changed our vacation policy. We called that out to you at that time as a non-recurring benefit. The third line shows the reduction in recurring SG&A we were able to make in CVS and corporate through our Performance Plus Program in our Q1 salary reduction in force. You can also see the benefit from those actions when you compare SG&A from the first quarter to the prior quarter. It was down $6 million and you'll see further sequential declines as we get full quarter benefits going forward. The right hand side of this chart shows the headcount reductions we have already taken this fiscal year. We showed that CVS plant actions on our Analyst Day in December. We have updated them for actions taken since that time. At the time, we were also continuing to implement a reduction in salaried workforce, which eliminated about 7% of the salaried positions in CVS and corporate staffs and some in LVS, as well. Then, as Chip took you through, we eliminated another 100 salaried positions in LVS when we announced our decision to divest the Body and Chassis business separately. In total, 1,560 employees have been separated since the beginning of the fiscal year, including some temporary and agency employees. This number will grow as we complete our existing plans and scheduled reviews. Now let's turn to slide 12. CVS delivered EBITDA $52 million for the quarter. EBITDA margins of 5.4% were down 1.2 percentage points, while sales were down 11% compared to the first quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, CVS sales were down 3.5%. This demonstrates the importance of Chip's earlier statement that our CVS team knows how to navigate through a downturn in North America. They've been doing it for two years, and they're prepared to keep on doing it. Now the challenge is to apply that capability to the European market, which will continue to deteriorate during our fiscal second quarter. LVS revenue dropped by 29%, as light vehicle markets around the world moved down in unison. The reductions in vehicle sales were compounded by OEM inventory adjustments, and the result was a much harder downshift than LVS was able to prepare for. As a result, we've reported an EBITDA loss for LVS of $41 million, which is down $53 million from last year. The next two charts explain the year-over-year change in EBITDA margins for both CVS and LVS. Slide 13 displays the CVS margin decline from 6.6% last year to 5.5% this year, which is more than explained for by volume. Medium and heavy duty truck production in Western Europe was down by 30% from last year, which negatively impacted CVS's EBITDA margins by 180 basis points. Production was also down in Asia, particularly in India. We also saw declines in other truck and trailer markets around the world, which reduced our margins by about 60 basis points. These declines, however, were partly offset by meaningful sales increases in both aftermarket and our specialty businesses. In addition, we continue to benefit from Performance Plus initiatives, as well as from other aggressive cost reduction efforts, improving margins by 1.5 percentage points compared to last year. We'll continue to be relentless in our efforts to execute the cost reductions we covered with you today. I mentioned on slide 11 that SG&A had a difficult comp because of the one-time benefit of changing our vacation policy in the first quarter of last year. That amounted to a 90 basis point change. Other changes added 10 basis points resulting in an EBITDA margin of 5.4% for CVS. On slide 14, you can see that volume was by far the greatest issue for LVS, as well, reducing margins by almost 6 percentage points. Volume pressures are not going to abate soon, so it is critical that we counterattack in other areas to compensate. The actions we took in January will do more than just eliminate the standalone corporate structure that has been built at LVS. It will result in elimination of the entire divisional organization that existed before the standalone costs were added. Some of those positions will still be required within our Body and Chassis businesses, but many others will be eliminated. While we are implementing those changes, we are simultaneously reviewing costs in the units to find all possible efficiencies there, as well. Among other things, this will include increased focus on material cost reductions through our Performance Plus teams. You can see that Performance Plus cost reductions contributed 1.2 percentage points to the margins compared to last year with most of the savings coming from plant labor in [inaudible]. On a year-over-year basis, steel prices were considerably higher. Our team did a great job of recovering these added costs in the second half of 2008, but in many cases that was achieved with lump sum payments in the 2008 fiscal year. In addition, LVS margin comparison was hurt by the effects of weaker currencies in some of the markets in which we operate. On slide 15 I'll walk you through the large non-cash charges we took in the quarter. The first was a valuation allowance of $665 million against our deferred tax assets. This represents all the remaining DTAs in the United States, plus some in other jurisdictions, as well. We saw on the income statement slide how this affects book taxes in periods in which these locations have losses. When these operations turn around, there generally will be neither book nor cash taxes until the NOLs are depleted or re-established. In addition to the tax write-off, we’ve recorded asset impairments corresponding to all the goodwill of LVS and most of the fixed assets that were on the books of Body and Chassis. Again, none of these charges had a cash impact, which you will see on slide 16. This walk from earnings to free cash flow starts with the pre-tax loss from continuing operations, which includes the goodwill and other fixed asset impairments. The next line backs them out because there is no cash associated with them. A couple of lines down, you'll see the cash payment of two settlements that were reached last year. The first reflects payment of a settlement we reached with the United Steel Workers over retiree healthcare benefits. The second reflects payment of a settlement we reached with an LVS customer in Europe last year. Obviously, those are both non-recurring. Performance working capital, shown on the next line, was a use of $185 million cash for the quarter. The issues we had in last year's first quarter, with payables, catch-up and acceleration of terms to help some troubled suppliers, were not as big a concern this year. But we did have the same kind of seasonal impact, as well as receivable flag effect, as sales came down. I'll talk about those effects more on the next slide. Other cash flow includes interest and some cash taxes. In total, free cash flow was negative by $386 million for the quarter compared to a negative $305 million last year. Slide 17 puts the working capital outflow for the quarter into perspective with some of the dynamics that were working against us. First, you are familiar with our normal seasonal pattern in the top left box, which has outflows in the first quarter and inflows in the fourth. Second, we had an additional timing effect from falling sales. When sales fall quickly, as they did in the first quarter, our payables come down sooner than our accounts receivable. AR will catch up over time, resulting in a reduction in total working capital, depending on how you treat off balance sheets securitization.  The third effect is explained in the bottom left box. We normally turn our inventories faster than receivables or payables. You’d expect them to come down with sales, but that didn’t happen this quarter. Inventories rose slightly because the production cuts into the quarter were sudden and traumatic and we weren’t able to plan our inventory effectively. Our operations team has a strong focus on inventory management, and we’re confident we’ll see improvement in the balances soon. The bottom right box explains how factoring in securitization interact with working capital. In all the schedules we provide we treat off balance sheet securitization as a cash flow and a reduction in receivables. On that basis, some of the receivables that you’re expecting to come down are already gone, so you don’t get much of a working capital benefit as sales fall. However, you do see a sharp reduction in outstanding balances in the securitization programs, and that is exactly what we’re expecting next quarter. So to sum it up, we have seasonal patterns working against us this quarter. We’ll get help from receivables and inventory in upcoming quarters offset by the fact that much of the receivables benefit will show up in lower securitization balances.  I will finish with slide 18. We’ve taken a number of actions over the last quarter to strengthen our liquidity position. We’ve renewed our committed facilities for receivable securitization. We increased our ability to repay trade and redeploy cash where it is needed. We implemented what Chip likes to call cash friendly cost saving actions leading to items we can start benefiting from right away without a lot of up front investment.  These include reducing pay and benefits for some hourly and salary workers around the world, tightly controlling discretionary spending, and reducing or retiming capital expenditures. Lastly, we also announced this morning that our board has decided to suspend dividends, suspend our quarterly dividend for common stock.  The suspensions of the dividend and cost measures on this page were all difficult decisions. We know that our employees at every level, as well as our board members, have had to make some sacrifices. The shareholders have now been asked to make some sacrifices as well, which we certainly hope will be temporary. In addition to these measures, we have a $660 million credit line with simple financial covenants that we’re in full compliance with. That wraps up the prepared remarks.  We will now take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital. 
[Emmanuel] for Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital: This is Emmanuel for Brian. First a quick question on the commodities impacting LVS. I was wondering, you were saying that last year some of the recoveries were in lump sum? So does that mean that we should see maybe later this year some recoveries from the hit we’re seeing now?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  Yes. In fact, in LVS the recoveries were in a lump sum, which is different than what we experienced on the CVS side where we were able to affect those changes through indices mechanisms. We are obviously working this year to have some recovery, but with the rapid drop in commodity prices, we do expect those discussions with the customers to be more difficult this year. 
[Emmanuel] for Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital:  Then on the cost savings, you did a good job of laying out what you expect for the year. Would you be able to, I guess, quantify how much was in the first quarter and then maybe the pace of how the coming quarters would compare to what we’ve seen in this past quarter.
Jeffrey A. Craig:  As far as the cost savings in this quarter, the best way to dimension that is the impact we showed on SG&A sequentially, which I believe was $6 million sequentially from the fourth to the first quarter. The impact is not as traumatic that we experienced in the first quarter because many of the reductions were implemented at the end of that quarter.  So the reductions in workforce we had discussions with our impacted employees, for example, in October, and those employees left us during November, December and January. The salary reductions went into effect in January, along with the reduction in the 401K match. And obviously all the reductions we took in LVS in the month of January come in in the second quarter. So we do expect a much more traumatic reduction in cost in our second fiscal quarter.
[Emmanuel] for Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital:  Anything that you can quantify, like can you reconcile your table of cost reductions for 2009, I guess on slide 5 to what this actually means in terms of cost reduction we would see any given quarter for the remainder of the year?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  Obviously, we’re not providing guidance at this time but we do expect, other than directing you to refer to the annual run rate on the table and also the impact on 2009. We have quantified that and you should expect that those cost benefits increase relatively linearly throughout the year as we get more and more impact and they get added each month.
[Emmanuel] for Brian Johnson – Barclays Capital:  Just to be clear, the total annual run rate, the difference between that and the total ’09 cost reduction is actually just measuring it at the end of the year?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  That’s correct. It’s what will be captured in our fiscal year versus the 12 month run rate.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Murphy – Merrill Lynch. 
John Murphy – Merrill Lynch:  I just wanted to follow-up on the cost stage, how much of what you identified for 2009 do you expect to actually be cash and how much of it is just a P&L impact?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  We would expect the vast majority of those items to have a positive cash flow impact as well. Obviously, with some of the headcount reductions there’s some severance cost associated with them, but most of the actions we listed here will be direct one-for-one cash flow benefits.
Charles G. McClure, Jr. :  I think to give some specifics when you look at the 10% salary reduction, obviously that’s a direct impact to cash, whether for the senior executives or the board, so I think there is a balance between the two that way, John.
John Murphy – Merrill Lynch: Chip, now that you guys have kept LVS in-house, I would imagine your minimum cash needs to run these two combined businesses have probably increased. What do you think that the minimum cash level that you need is at this point?
Jeffrey A. Craig: Obviously, what we provided in the statements today and reiterated in our press release is, we believe we will not be in violation of any of our debt agreements based on our current forecast. We obviously provided some volumes that have disclosed we’re running the business to, but we have encompassed in all that consideration the cash we require to run the business, including the change in estimate that we will have these LVS businesses for a period of time.
John Murphy – Merrill Lynch:  But if we look at the final balance of just cash in the balance sheet of $158, is there any guidance you can give us? Is it around $100 million that are using revolver for inter quarter working capital swings. I’m just trying to understand the minimum level.
Jeffrey A. Craig :  We have not provided any guidance or information on that in the past and I don’t think we will today as well. But we have stated that we have had intra quarter borrowing on the revolver, so it’s not unusual for us to have those draw downs on the revolver.
John Murphy – Merrill Lynch: How much was bought on the A/R facilities at the end of the quarter?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  I will try and get that data for you as quickly as I can. We have had some decline on that. I know in the  U.S. the related receivables have come down and we expect to have a dramatic decline in Europe. So on the U.S. securitization balance, it looks like the draw downs are $93 million for the U.S. program in the quarter and then, as I said, in Europe we expect roughly $400 million of usage under the lines in Europe at the end of the quarter.
John Murphy – Merrill Lynch: And the new facilities, have they been, I mean what is the size of the new facilities that have been renewed?
Jeffrey A. Craig: The facility in North America, which is with SunTrust, is $175 million facility so you can see we're not in any way constrained by the size. It's just been the reduction of receivables as we’re seeing the volumes come down in North America.
John Murphy – Merrill Lynch: Lastly, Chip, on strategy here. As you're holding the LVS business longer than you would have liked, I mean is there any of change in course? Are there any other parts of the business, other than Wheels, that you might consider keeping in-house and being somewhat of a consolidator of it if possible?
Charles G. McClure, Jr.:  No. Let me first of all re-emphasize the fact that our strategy is to continue to separate the LVS and CVS portions of the business, and obviously what's going on out in the marketplace it's changed the tactics a bit. So no I do not see that changing. And, as I kind of indicated in my comments, this is a similar approach we had to do with the LVA a couple of years ago with our Light Vehicle Aftermarket business. So to answer your question, no, I do not see that changing. Obviously, what we did want to do in the decision we made earlier this year in January, was the fact that given the market conditions we felt it was better to go kind of this revised approach with the strategy still being the same to look at selling and divesting them separately. But we'll do it at the proper time and make sure we get the proper term for our shareholders. So no it's not changing at this point. The only thing that’s really just changed is the timeline given what's taking place out in the marketplace. 
John Murphy – Merrill Lynch: Jay, I think I may have cut you off on that EU securitization facility. What's the size of that, the new one, I'm sorry?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  It's $250 million Euros so it would be roughly $325 million. So I may have misspoken, I think the European outstandings were $300 million flat at the end of the quarter instead of $400 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Just on the walk slide, I'm sorry not the walk slide, the slide where you outlined your expectations for build rates. Could you give us a little bit of a better idea of what the variable margins are for some of these businesses clearly? I suppose one would expect that maybe North America might be a little bit lower at this point since you've had more time to restructure, but just wanted to sort of get your overall view on that?
Jeffrey A. Craig: We haven't really discussed variable margins in the past. I would say your one comment on North America, because we've had a longer period to work at cost reductions, is probably accurate.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: In other words, it's fair to assume that potentially the incremental impact of Europe might be above average whereas North America would be somewhat below just given the time frame you've had to work on it.
Jeffrey A. Craig: I would say at this point in time that's true because as I'm sure you're familiar with there is some lagging impact in Europe of the speed with which you can take labor costs out because of various notification periods and different country laws. So I would say temporarily that's true until our aggressive steps we're taking to reduce the cost structure there get through that lag time period.
Charles G. McClure, Jr. : Patrick, just to add to that too, obviously you're right as you indicated, North America has been down the better part of two years. When you look at Europe, they were at an all time record levels literally through the beginning of the summer actually of last year. So it's only been the last four or five months that they've actually seen the downtrend. So not only, as Jay indicated, a longer time to take the costs out in the European operations, but the much more dramatic drop off in much shorter period of time that we saw literally last fall I think do compound it and kind of support what Jay was saying.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: I guess on that can you maybe comment on how much variable headcount there is in Europe? Clearly as you guys have shifted from cash intensive restructurings to sort of cash friendly restructurings, which don't have as much severance in them. How would you sort of characterize your ability to get that variable margin down given some of the constraints you face?
Jeffrey A. Craig: The announcements we made at the end of October had encompassed in them the hourly reductions in Europe. I think as we stated then, the vast majority of those were contract laborers, which had limited severance requirements. Once we got through that wave, at this point in time we are at full-time employee adjusting, having to adjust full-time employment. And we are looking at and implementing some creative solutions to that around furloughs and other measures that are much more common in Europe, so that we can limit the cash outflows related to severance and separation agreements and be more creative to work within the European employment laws. And also take maximum advantage of the different government funding programs that are available in Europe to cushion the blow to the individual employees as they're unemployed for a day, two, three days a week.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Would you characterize this situation as being one where you're constrained though in terms of you've got a bunch of options, they're not typically the options you, in a normal cash situation that you would have exercised. Does that mean all things equal it's going to take longer to sort of bring that variable margin down in Europe or are you pretty confident that you --
Jeffrey A. Craig: I would say that there's some lag impact, which we have seen to be about three to four months that's longer than you typically see in the U.S. or Eastern or Central Europe. But I don't think the ultimate answer ends up being much different, it's just done differently, particularly a lot of these governments sponsor programs.  For example, in France we're seeing the laws being changed where they initially covered up to 300 hours of employees’ unemployment in terms of paying that through government benefits. They just recently doubled that to 600 hours. It's expected by industry they're going to increase it by another 300 hours to 900 hours, and you can think of that in our terms as almost three, six and nine months worth of unemployment benefits. So I wouldn't say it's the ultimate answer. It's a lot different than what we see in the United States. It's just how it gets executed. It takes a longer period of time and a little bit of lag time, but we get to about the same result.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Switching gears, just looking at your military and aftermarket businesses, clearly that's been a very good business for you. We've seen other sort of more machinery-oriented names also doing very well. Could you comment a little bit about the cadence of those contracts? You talked a bit about it there on your Analyst Day, but I'm curious to see sort of how long that tailwind, which I guess was worth 1.2% of margins, can be sustained. Is that something that we're going to continue to see as a positive throughout subsequent quarters or maybe are we kind of seeing it peak out and maybe stabilize here?
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: Patrick, what you're actually seeing is a bit of mix shift in some of that. When you look at it, and I think back at the Analyst Day we talked about the end MRAP product is probably winding down a bit as far as an OE product. But then there's a lot of aftermarket parts that we're starting to see flow through on that. I think the second thing is, when you at it, FMTV continues to be strong, and if I look at it longer term, you've got the JLTV that's out there also, which is actually more out on the 2012 to 2013 time frame. So as I look at it bringing it back to the current year, yes we do see that continuing for future quarters but a mix shift, if you will.  Probably less MRAP and more of what we call the MRAP Light or the ATV type program, FMTV and parts and service, and I will tell you that we are continuing to quote new programs and, as I’d indicated, the other part of that on the aftermarket side, we are seeing that increase the number of vehicles out there [inaudible] they are needing the replacement part and service. So we see a mix shift but do see both of those continuing strong going forward. 
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs:  And by continuing strong, meaning like a year-on-year positive in subsequent quarters.
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: In some cases the answer is yes.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs: I just mean taking together. Is there to more replacement in some of these other programs sufficient to kind of sustain the momentum I guess is the way I would ask it.
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: I would say as opposed to year-over-year, I would say I do see it sustaining the momentum going forward just within a mix within that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Monica Keeney – Morgan Stanley.
Monica Keeney – Morgan Stanley: I was just curious, I was looking at the Analyst Day slide when you did sensitivity analysis to different production levels, and there was like a high, medium and low scenario. I guess you’re at the low scenario, right? And it said you expect Q 2 through Q 4 free cash flow to be negative. Does that mean in each quarter? I just want to make sure to refresh and given what you’ve said now about production and then obviously this didn’t assume LVS.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Couple of things, Monica, one, we re-toured that guidance so I first want to start with that statement that we re-toured the guidance. As you just compare the charges numerically, you would say yes from that guidance we’re at the low column pretty much across the board in what we’re showing today, but we did withdraw that guidance. The other statement we’ve made today is that based on these production levels, we believe we have adequate liquidity to be in compliance with all debt conveyance.  So there’s a lot of different variables in there, one of them being free cash flow, how our working capital changes, lowering the fix cost breakeven level of the various business from all the actions where taking. But I think the overall statement that we felt confident in making today is that we expect to have adequate liquidity to be in compliance with all the debt conveyance. 
Monica Keeney – Morgan Stanley: So can you just give us a little bit more, sort of a little bit more directionally? I know that you’re not giving guidance, but working capital is just so hard to kind of predict how your working capital is going, even more than to a certain extent other suppliers not just the calendar I know but, how should be thinking about there are obviously major production cuts for this upcoming you’re Q2, should working capital be then a major source for this quarter?
Jeffrey A. Craig: Well a couple things we stated today that are probably a bit unusual for us. Certainly as volumes decline, as we stated today, we do expect that components of working capital will be favorable. But the issue that is somewhat unique to us is we have factor under customer sponsor programs a large portion of our European receivables, which is where the most rapid rate of decline is occurring in our revenue and, therefore, freeing up working capital.  So what you’ll see is that a lot of this working capital benefit will be offset by the reduction in these lines and, again, the other issues we said that we’re focusing on obviously is aggressively pushing back on CapEx.
Monica Keeney – Morgan Stanley: So it’s not going to be a source you think in second quarter? I’m just trying to summarize. I get what you’re saying on the components, but I’m just still not sure directionally what you’re trying to get to. Is it just too early to tell?
Jeffrey A. Craig:  Monica, I understand your struggle but I’m trying to walk the line where we’ve withdrawn guidance and not necessarily go out and provide guidance on specific components of our financial results. So, I fully understand your question try to dimension it. 
Monica Keeney – Morgan Stanley: Then my last question is, in terms of you’ve given a lot of the cost cutting that you’re going to be doing, which looks like it’s going to be very beneficial. Can you at least give us what you think the cash component will be for ’09? I mean other than I know series of different restructuring and cost savings actions.
Jeffrey A. Craig: I apologize, Monica. 
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: Monica, real quickly on part of that, as I indicated before, as part of the cash component and restructuring there are some of those and kind of my words before as far as a cash friendly cost reductions some of these have no cash impact on it.  Obviously, as you look at salary reductions and that kind of thing and there are others that we are focusing on that kind of going forward just to make sure that we can where we can is to minimize the amount of cash that we’re using that way.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Monica, I would add we do have some limited cash restructuring just related to the severance benefits for some of the reduction employees that we’re executing. But what we are pushing out is any large scale plant closures and significant restructuring charges during this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Himanshu Patel – JP Morgan. 
[Haruch Jodon] for Himanshu Patel – JP Morgan: Hi this is [Haruch Jodon] on behalf of Himanshu Patel. My first question is, could you actually provide a little bit of makeup within the profitability for individual business within the LVS business? Especially on the Wheel side, which I understand is a little bit more Latin America focused and volumes have declined there rapidly.
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: Let me start and I’ll let Jay kind of weigh in on the details a little bit. As you look at it your right, first of all on the Wheel side, the manufacturing foot print is very much South American focused, which I think has been one of the competitive advantages of it. It’s based in Mexico and Brazil so it has helped that way.  If I look at it within Brazil or South America, we have seen some decline there, although interestingly enough, and this is just more anecdotal, when you look at some of the things that government is doing as far as cash to try to get us some momentum on the automotive side and again, very anecdotal at this point, it appears to be helping a bit there in South America. But obviously when you look at the products that are shipped into North America they are dealing with the same brunt of the declines that we’re seeing here in North America with the domestic big three.
Jeffrey A. Craig: I would also reiterate there are different portions of our business that have some aftermarket component within LVS those are a little less sensitive to the OE volume downturns. But, again, we haven’t talked about individual profitability of business line. But our OE businesses are experiencing the most significant revenue decline.
[Haruch Jodon] for Himanshu Patel – JP Morgan: Then could provide us a little bit help on, if I were to understand like what would be a breakeven level of U.S. production the European production for you to return to a sort of a breakeven level on maybe an EBIT basis and when is it that we should expect that to happen? Just some ball park help on that.
Jeffrey A. Craig: Well it tends to be a bit of a moving target. Our breakeven level has been lowered significantly, for example, in the commercial vehicle North American truck operations because the length of the downturn we’ve taken so much fix cost out, our breakeven level is much, much lower than it was previously. And so in Europe obviously at today we are operating below our breakeven level, but, as I stated previously, we are implementing numerous plans to take out fixed cost and then again the breakeven level there we expect a decline as well. So I know that’s not a direct answer to your question, but it’s a bit of moving target for us right now. I think what we tried to show in these vehicle production scenarios was what we’re targeting the business at trying to reduce its fixed cost so that we can get our businesses to breakeven levels at these volumes. 
[Haruch Jodon] for Himanshu Patel – JP Morgan: Going back to slide five, the cost reduction run rates that you guys have provided, I may have missed this, but has the $165 million in CVS and $82 run rate in LVS have the actions been implemented and have those run rates been achieved?
Jeffrey A. Craig: They have been. In fact, what is roistered on this chart, for example, for the employee actions, we are only counting employees that have left, so to say, left the building. So these are actions that have been implemented and not just planned. We obviously have significant number of action that is still planned, but we have next quarter’s call we’ll be speaking to what the impacts of those were as well.  One component of that that may be a slight difference from that is on the Performance Plus line because of our history of disclosing what our targets were, on the P Plus line there is some numbers included in that $50 and $25 million for CVS and LVS respectively that do have some anticipated savings actions that will be implemented. But for all the other austerity actions, those are actions that have been implemented then executed. 
[Haruch Jodon] for Himanshu Patel – JP Morgan: Are these Performance Plus savings, these were in an environment when volumes were actually significantly better, do you think there could be some givebacks on these 50 and 25 as volumes fall off?
Jeffrey A. Craig: We had the same question and we spent quite a bit of time in the month of November and then continuing from there to make certain that we stress test our expected savings, particularly in the direct material cost savings areas, for volumes and we’re still confident in the numbers we have on this page. 
[Haruch Jodon] – JP Morgan: Just a couple of last ones, one the run rate hit in LVS in this quarter seemed particularly harsh. What should we expect for the remainder of the year? And lastly, do you guys anticipate any worsening in distressed supplier costs? What are you seeing there? 
Jeffrey A. Craig: Well, as far as the LVS performance, if I understand you’re first question it was should we expect the first quarter performance to be indicative of the rest of the year? A little bit, just to put it in context, again, we’re not providing guidance for the rest of the year, but certainly a lot of the lump sum, I’m sorry, a lot of the actions we took in January were directed specifically at LVS.  For example, just in the first three weeks of January 100 salaried employees left the organization and significant cuts were made in other costs. So, certainly, we’re trying to reduce the cost side of the LVS run rate. Then you’re second question was –
Charles G. McClure, Jr.: I’ll talk the second one on troubled suppliers and we actually do have a very robust program in place on the supplier side within our shared services activity that we put in place both here in the U.S. and in Europe. And quite frankly, as I indicated in my comments, we really do have both on the supplier side and the customer side, so I think we have a very robust program that we include as part of our enterprise risk management system we’ve had in place for a while now that we reviewed up to and including at the board level so that we do this.  And I think the real credit to Jay and his team and Carson and their team as far as we’ve got people from the purchasing manufacturing and engineering finance side of it to make sure that we get the kind of leading indicators if there’s a supplier distress issue, of which quite frankly we’ve had a couple of them. And we’ve been able to manage them very well to minimize any impact to us and as important, minimize any impact to our customers. 
Terry Huch: That’s all the time we have for questions today. I would like to thank everyone for joining and invite you to follow up with your investor relations or communications contact. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes your presentation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2008 Cummins Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Eric, I'll be your audio coordinator for today. Now at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn your presentation over to Dean Cantrell, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Dean A. Cantrell: Thank you, Eric. Welcome, everyone to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins's results for the fourth quarter of 2008. Participating with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Solso; our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and our Vice Chairman, Joe Loughrey. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference. This teleconference will include certain forward-looking information. Any forward-looking statement involves risk and uncertainty. The company's future results maybe affected by changes in general economic conditions and by the actions of customers and competitors. Actual outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed in any forward-looking statement. A more complete disclosure about our forward-looking statements begins on page three of our 2007 Form 10-K and it applies to this teleconference. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation is available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media. Before we review our fourth quarter performance and guidance for 2009, Tim would like to frame the quarter and our recent actions in the context of the current economic environment.
Tim Solso: Good morning. I'll begin on a positive note by saying that 2008 was our fifth straight year of record sales. Overall revenues for the company were $14.3 billion compared to $13 billion for 2007, or nearly a 10% growth in sales for the year. Earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT was $1.3 billion or 9% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 9.4% of sales for the previous year. Unfortunately, and as you are all aware, most of our gains in 2008 were made in the first three quarters of the year. Pat Ward will offer more specifics about the fourth quarter in a few moments, but here are the high level facts. Sales declined by 6% year-over-year and 11% from the third quarter. EBIT was 5% of sales excluding the severance charge relating the actions we announce in December. This was below our target of 10%. Sales declined year-over-year in the Engine and Component segments, but all four segments saw our sales weaken during the fourth quarter. We have moved quickly to respond to what has become the worst global recessions since World War 2. And we are prepared to take further significant action in 2009 if necessary. Our goal is to maintain a solid profit level through the downturn and to preserve our ability to grow profitably in the future. Still we expect 2009 to be extremely challenging, the recession almost certainly will last through the end of this year and we are assuming it could take until 2011 for the global economy to fully recover. We remain confident that our company is well positioned to achieve its long-term growth targets once our global markets improve. But for the short-term, our focus will be on reducing cost to earn a respectable level of profit through the downturn, managing the business to ensure that we are generating positive cash flow, and continuing to invest in critical technologies and products for 2010 and beyond. Tom Linebarger will provide further details on the actions we have taken to reduce cost. But I want to emphasize that we already have taken a number steps to cut discretionary spending, lower capital expenditures, and reduce our workforce to bring it inline with the expected demand for 2009. Our experienced management team has made the necessary tough decisions and we are committed to further action as needed. These actions and others such as aggressively moving to lower our working capital and suspending our stock repurchase program while maintaining a sustainable growing dividend will allow us to generate cash this year. Cash will be critical to our future growth. We must be in a position to continue investing in key products and technologies such as those related to meeting new emission standards in the United States and the launch of four new engine platforms in the United States and China. I'd like to remind everyone that we entered this recession in the best financial condition in the company's history. Five years of record sales and profits have allowed us to lower our debt to below 20% of capital and to build a sizable cash reserve. We also have access to $1 billion in liquidity as we look to invest in our future. So, while I do not think we have seen the worst of the current recession, I am also convinced that Cummins will emerge from this downturn, however long it lasts, an even stronger company. Our guidance for 2009 is that sales will be down approximately 20% from our record performance this past year and either will be 6.5% of sales. Now, Tom will provide you with additional details on some of the actions we took and why we think we are well positioned for the future.
Tom Linebarger: Thank you, Tim. As Tim said, when we began to see this rapid and steep decline in the fourth quarter, we started taking aggressive action to lower our costs; including the painful step of reducing our workforce around the world. Those actions have continued into 2009. We will continue to monitor demand for our products closely and adjust our capacity and the size of our workforce as necessary. With the actions we have announced so far, we will reduce our worldwide workforce by about 2800 people, or more than 6% by the end of March. Of the 2800 people, approximately 1500 will be salary professionals and the remainder will come from our hourly workforce. In addition, we have cut approximately 2500 contract and temporary jobs, eliminated merit raises for professional workers, and cut officer's salaries by 10% in 2009. Based on what we know today, we believe the reductions made to our professional staff would be appropriate for the demand we expect in 2009. It is likely, however, that we will need to take further actions at individual manufacturing locations to react to changing demand. We'll continue to use our rings of defense approach to react to these changes. In addition to the people actions, we have worked hard to lower our costs in other ways. For example; we have reduced our monthly travel expenses during the fourth quarter by half and cut a number of other discretionary expenses. Capital spending in the fourth quarter was approximately 48 million lower than our forecast in October. And our capital plan for 2009 calls for a 30% reduction in spending from 2008. We have closed three distributor branches in the United Kingdom and planned to close six more locations outside the U.S. in the first half of this year. In addition, as a result of weaker performance in the fourth quarter, our variable compensation expense for 2008 was approximately $44 million less than originally planned. As Tim said, we remain optimistic about the fundamental strength of our company and how market manages going forward. As a result, our basic strategy is not changing. Our long-term targets of 12% sales growth and 10% EBIT are still in place. We remain committed to investing in our key growth platforms in the downturn to ensure that we can meet our profitable growth targets through the cycle. For example; work is progressing on our four critical engine platforms and the related components to go with those despite the significant reduction in capital spending plan for the year. In addition, Cummins Technology leadership continues to position our company well for future growth. Market share gains for our Engines, Components and Power Generation equipment around the world are the clearest sign that our customers recognize the value that our technology brings to their products. New fuel efficiency standards offer Cummins another opportunity to leverage our technology leadership for business advantage. For example; our 2010 on highway engine will offer industry leading fuel economy, while our investment in new light duty diesel engine platforms in the U.S. and China would open new markets for clean diesel engines for the company. Our immediate challenge is to get through this global recession by producing a reasonable level of profit and generating sufficient cash to allow us to invest in the future. The actions we have taken so far, our plans for 2009, and our current financial strength position comes to emerge from this significant downturn, stronger than when we entered it and in terrific shape to resume the growth we have seen in recent years. Now Pat will provide more specifics about the quarter.
Pat Ward: Thank you, Tom. As we warned in December, global market conditions deteriorated rapidly in the fourth quarter, especially in the truck and construction businesses. Fourth quarter sales for our company was $3.3 billion or 6% below the same period of 2007 and 11% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. Despite the fourth quarter slow down, full year sales increased 10% which was slightly back of our guidance. Although we move quickly to adjust the company's fixed cost structure, we were unable to offset the impact of the volume decline in the quarter. Along with lower joint venture income, negative impact from currency movements and other one time charges, EBIT margins drop to 5% in the quarter and finished at 9.3% for the year. Both numbers excludes the $37 million restructuring charge related to workforce reduction actions initiated in the fourth quarter. Due to more favorable geographic mix of profits, our full year effective tax rate of 31% was more than our prior expectation of 32%. The full year adjustment along with the recognition of the research tax credit lowered the fourth quarter effective tax rate to 12%. Including the $37 million restructuring charge, which comes to $0.13 per share, net income was $89 million or $0.45 per share for the fourth quarter. To give you a clearer picture of what has happened during the quarter let me provide details for each of our operating segments. Our Distribution segment had another solid quarter. Revenues were up 19% and there was strength in all our regions as a result of sales in industrial high horsepower engines and Power Generation equipment. While our EBIT margin was negatively impacted by currency translation, they remained above their 11% target. In Power Generation, sales increased by 6% versus a year ago. Demand for commercial generates as an alternate primarily in China and Western Europe more than offset the decline in the U.S. consumer markets. Price realization remained ahead of increasing commodity costs. However, the impact of a less favorable mix of products sold and unfavorable currency movements pressured the EBIT margin downwards to 8.5% of sales in the quarter. We experienced a significant reduction in demand in the engine segment. The revenues dropped 10% versus the same quarter a year ago. Sales in all on-highway applications declined particularly in the pick-up truck and RV markets in North America and global medium duty truck markets. Sales to industrial applications were also down with the slump in construction markets offsetting stronger demand in agricultural and marine markets. Engine segment EBIT dropped to 1.3% of sales for the quarter as a result of the rapid decline in volume, higher material costs, unfavorable currency movements, and the drop in income from our joint ventures. The segment results were also impacted in the fourth quarter by a net charge $38 million related to unwanted (ph) liability, associated with the increasing cost of repairs to engine sold in prior periods. Hardest hit in the fourth quarter was the Component segment; revenues dropped 13% and EBIT declined by $45 million finishing just above breakeven. As we previously warned, the demand decline from the truck and construction equipment OEMs in North America, Europe, China, and India accelerated as the quarter progressed. In addition, the gain associated with the sale of our business in the fourth quarter of 2007 contributed to the lower EBIT year-over-year. The challenging market conditions we experienced in the fourth quarter will not improve in 2009, and we anticipate further deterioration in most of our end markets. For the Engine segment, we project 2009 revenues will fall close to 20% and EBIT will be around 4% of sales. Nearly every on-highway market will be smaller in 2009 as freight tonnage and credit availability will harbor on the purchasing decisions of end users. We project that North American heavy duty truck markets at 137,000 trucks, down almost 20% from 2008. But we forecast those shipments to drop less than the market due to share gains. Within the medium-duty truck market we expect the shipments to decline around 30% from softness in North America and sharp declines in Brazil and Europe. Demand for Dodge Ram pick-up trucks stabilized in the last few quarters, and we anticipate engine shipments to Chrysler will remain flat, while the recreational vehicle market will continue to deteriorate in 2009. Revenue from global industrial engine markets is expected to decline nearly 30%. In spite of infrastructure stimulus spending programs around the world, we believe demand from new construction equipment will be reduced by about 40% over 2008. Demand for mining, marine and agriculture is also forecasted to drop significantly in 2009. In our Component segment; we expect sales to decline about 25%, primarily due to weakness in truck and construction markets in North America, Europe, China and India. Because of the impact of the lower volumes, we are forecasting the segment to deliver EBIT margins in the range of 2.5 to 3% of sales. For Power Generation; we project sales to decline by 10% in 2009 with EBIT in the range of 9.5 to 10% of sales. In our global commercial Genset business, we are experiencing a slow down in order intakes. However, the very high-end markets of plain power served by our project in alternative businesses have not yet seen an increase in backlog cancellations. In the consumer market we anticipate further deterioration this year from an already weak position in 2008. In distribution, sales are expected to drop 10% and the segment profitability as a percent of sales is forecasted to remain flat with 2008 levels at 11%. About half of the segment sales are exposed to industrial engines and power generation, and we expect a decline in demand. However, we anticipate that aftermarket sales and service revenues will be flat to slightly down similar to past downturn cycles. Overall, for the company as Tim mentioned before, we expect sales to drop approximately 20% compared to 2008, and the EBIT margin to be 6.5% of revenues. The first quarter is anticipated to be our lowest quarter of the year. The 2009 guidance excludes restructuring charges related to additional workforce reductions and plant closing activities announced in January, which will be included in our first quarter results. We so project to generate positive cash flow in 2009. We are planning capital investment of about 3% of sales; a significantly reduction from last year. We will continue to invest in key projects related to emission compliance, fuel economy, and new platforms, which are critical for our future profitable growth. In addition we are taking a hard look at adjusting our working capital and have improvement plans in place that will benefit our cash flow in 2009. In light of the current economic conditions we have also suspended our stock repurchase program, but remain committed to maintaining our current dividend. We have worked hard to build a strong balance sheet and keep their levels low and that remains our goal in 2009. We will now take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). First question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse: Hi. Good morning.
Tim Solso: Good morning Jamie.
Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse: My first question relates to your guidance within the Power Gen segment with sales declined, I think, of about 10%. I am just wondering what's your visibility at this point, how far into 2009 do you have visibility? You also mentioned you weren't cancellations yet on the higher end wondering what your expectations are and sort of what you're seeing geographically? Because that to me along with the margin assumptions based on what I am hearing on the Power Gen seems a little optimistic. So, I am just wondering how you're thinking about that guidance for 2009 within Power Gen?
Tom Linebarger: Hi Jamie, this is Tom. In Power Gen, we have some orders that stretch out still a long way. As you know the order board was very long for a period of time. And it has come in, our newly times are much shorter than the old ones. But there are still orders out quite away. So as we have some visibility out for some orders through the year, but as you guess the books unfold like they were for the whole year. So it's more...
Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse: Is it through Q2 or is it...
Tom Linebarger: Right. It's more like 90 to 180 days now. And that's a broad statement across larger Gensets. It depends by as you said by region and size and all that kind of things, but as a broad matter, it's more like a quarter or two as opposed to a full year.
Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse: So I am assuming that -- would that imply that the first half of the year, maybe you are hoping for modest growth or backlog growth with more dramatic declines in the back half to get your downturn for the year? Is that the way I should be thinking about it, given what you're seeing now... given your visibility?
Tom Linebarger: I think we're seeing the year pretty flat across the area. It is a broad statement. I mean it doesn't mean there is not variation there, just up and down depending on place. But as a broad statement we are seeing at it as generally flat through the year. Although you might think it might get weaker in the second half in fact because the first quarter is normally a slower quarter for us there is some seasonality. It's kind of playing itself through to be roughly flat through the year. There is some negative currency movement year-over-year that is also affecting revenues up as a general matter, even quarters will be closer than what you said.
Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then can you comment specifically, I mean part of the strength that you are seeing was sort of in the emerging market, what are you seeing within Power Gen or what's your assumptions for 2009 for within the emerging markets within Power Gen?
Tom Linebarger: Yeah, emerging markets are still a significant part of our business. Where as you I think are suggesting, the emerging markets are not as strong as they were a year ago. The economic growth rates in both China and India for example are down. But still markets are reasonable. Both markets for power generation we saw some pickup in China actually in the fourth quarter power generation. So as a general matter both regions will remain strong in the fourth -- I mean in 2009 but not as strong as they have been in previous years.
Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse: So you are not assuming any material cancellations in your forecast?
Tom Linebarger: No. But there will be order board shifting. We do expect order boards shifting that's kind of how we are seeing but not major cancellations, no.
Dean Cantrell: Jamie this is Dean. Just to clarity on the comments that were made in the scripted remarks about not seeing cancellations at the very high end. Keep in mind that some of the markets in which our alternative business through that it serves was some very large alternators that go into independent power producers that's where we are specifically not seeing the cancellations yet. I think with a lot of the product that we supply through our commercial line of business we have been seeing some cancellations there. As Tom indicated it is not as full, the lead times have come in, and it is not like it was 90 days ago when we talked you. The comments were more specific to the very high end alternators that actually don't even often time marry up with some of our own engines.
Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then my last question also, on the engine side of the business, I sort of agree with you but I don't find your top line for cash too unreasonable on the engine side given some of the declines we have seen so far but it sort of implies to get to your operating margins, the 20% decremented margins for 2009 which again to me seems, can you just walk me through your assumptions I would have thought on the -- side, the decrementals would have been a lot worse than 20%?
Pat Ward: This is Pat, let me take that question and let me take it in two ways. Let me talk about the company across the wall and then answer your question on the engine business.
Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse: Sure.
Pat Ward: The -- for the company were going to go from 9.3% of sales 2008 to 6.5% in 2009 but the volume drop of 20% on the top line will cost us about 5% drop in EBIT. We expect probably close to another 1% drop from the combination of joint venture income and still some higher material cost year-over-year and not to the same extent we see in 2008 but it still will be higher. Offsetting that we expect to see benefits from pricing and from our cost reduction actions that we were taking in the fourth quarter and was taking through the first quarter and the combination of those two should bring back 3% of EBIT. So that's how you kind of get higher level from 9% EBIT going to 6.5. And if you think of the Engine business to your specific question, the cost reduction actions in particular, I think, will play a significant role in helping the Engine business, minimize the detrimental margins is going to see in 2009.
Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse: Already I have a couple of more questions but I'll get back in queue. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Please proceed.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Good morning.
Tim Solso: Good morning Eli.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Hi, just a clarification, the 20% decline in revenue is that including currency and what are the currency assumptions or is that excluding currency?
Pat Ward: That includes currency. So, the 20% is the number, the currency element of the 20% is a about 5%.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: 5%. So your volume is down 15 towards the currency effect is what you are saying?
Pat Ward: Yes.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: And warranty expense you guys hit with 38 million in the quarter. Do you have any idea what the warranty assumption is for 2009, is there any change in that assumption with your overall percentage?
Pat Ward: Yes. Warranty expense in 2008 including campaigns and change in estimates is 3.5% of sales. That was higher in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter was 3.8%. Again we don't get specific guidance on warranty for '09, but you shouldn't expect it to be much different from the full year number for 2008.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Either percentage or the full year number as an absolute total for this quarter?
Pat Ward: As a percentage.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: As a percentage. And if I hear correctly Tom said on the Power Generation you expect some business, you're bidding on some business sustaining throughout for the rest of the year to keep you at board relatively flat is 180 day window. So for the first half you have got some visibility that you expect in continuation of kind what levels of demand, is that the assumption?
Tom Linebarger: Yes.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Going on. And if you talked about the Engine business, I mean you gave us down 20% in North America in trucks and down 30% in the global market. Is there a bit of way a market share is in truck at this point, what do you expect to hold it, what is your forecast for international heavy truck typically in Europe. And you started indicating what's going on in Ag and construction, can you give us some sense or color what's going on those markets?
Tom Linebarger: I missed the first part of your question?
Tim Solso: Market share and trust down, we finished the year Eli, on the awards data came out just shy of 45% for the full year. So that's up from the 2007 levels that we are in kind of the upper 30s. And our expectations as we go out into 2008 or 2009 is that we would be in the 48% market share for the full year in 2009. So we'll obviously we'll run in the first six months of 2008 more like 43%. So there is about a 5% swing there in the first half of '09 before we would anniversary.
Tom Linebarger: You know the medium-duty I think we are at 33%. If you break it down we are assuming drop in North America between 5% and 15%, Brazil will be down 30%, and Europe will be down 40%. So that's where the total number adds up. And then the construction market, basically we see that down literally all over the world. We have been asked about the stimulus packages not only here in United States, but there's been two in India already in a 600 billion in China. And they will obviously help us in terms of infrastructure investments, transportation and so forth. But we think it's going to take some time so we'll probably see that more at the end of the year or in 2010. So we still see that construction and the Ag markets being down from where they have been.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Let me just one question. You talk about your 2010 engine fuel economy, how much better I mean that will charge out (ph) today with a big deal trying to make through their EVI is complicated in getting their economy. Then the SCR that everybody is going to, can you talk about what is going on in technology for 2010?
Tom Linebarger: Eli, I can comment on that. We do expect our 2010 engine to have a fuel economy improvement over our 2007 engine and we do expect it to have fuel economy advantages over the competition. And so in both cases, we are well advanced in those programs. As you know we made a significant switch to SCR in the middle of the year on heavy-duty, mid-range we are continuing the same strategy. We are well progressed with those programs, we are active in testing and we are seeing the results in fact slightly better than the results we have projected from our analysis in terms of fuel economy. So we still think we are going to offer customers an advantage over our '07 and over competition in 2010.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: And you have 5% to 10% in fuel economy, that is what the number seem to be at this point.
Tom Linebarger: 5 to 10% over what?
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: Over '07 engines?
Tom Linebarger: Eli, that's at the high-end. But...
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: The 5% is the number we are quoting (inaudible).
Tom Linebarger: Yeah, that's reasonable, yeah.
Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities: All right, thanks. I'll get back in queue.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn with UBS. Please proceed.
Henry Kirn - UBS: Good morning, guys.
Tim Solso: Good morning, Henry.
Henry Kirn - UBS: Could you talk a little about the age of the U.S. class fleet, and if the bill is down 20% in '09, when could this spur a replacement?
Tim Solso: Well, I think clearly Henry, we are now with the expectations that we have for 2009. We are looking at three years now that are below replacement demand. I don't have the numbers in front of me in terms of what the specific age of the fleet is. We clearly look to the pundits (ph) out there in the world that provide the research on what the age of the fleet is. But clearly, it is starting to say that there is essentially or virtually no pre-buy in 2009, and it's continuing to add the expectation that customers will come back into the market in 2010 and beyond to obviously try to address the ageing fleet and does start to build expectations for much sizable markets in 2010 and beyond?
Tom Linebarger: I just ... there is more uncertainty right now in all over the markets, but in particularly the truck markets. And, I think the way we're thinking about our business is that we're going to assume that this recession is deeper and longer than anything we've seen. And that we've already taken capacity down and we are going to manage costs and manufacturing capacity to demand. And, bet less on the fact that there is going to be a recovery at the end of this or in 2010. And we'll be prepared when the recovery is there to go ahead and meet the demand. But that's kind of what the management philosophy is now. And, I personally don't think anyone really knows for sure exactly when we're going to see a recovery or what that recovery is going to look like.
Henry Kirn - UBS: Okay. That makes sense. And could you talk a little about where your inventory stands or where inventories in the channel stand? How much you may have to under produce demand in the first half of the year to right size the global inventory channels?
Tom Linebarger: We don't have a lot of channel inventory issues to deal with anywhere really. As we've some... we kind of managed channel inventories on an ongoing basis. And so, we don't... we are not really planning any adjustments anywhere in the world. The place that the inventory that our distributors hold is mostly parts related to service parts and some generator sets. And in both cases, we're feeling like our inventory levels are reasonable.
Tim Solso: And the Chrysler dealer inventories have come down and we don't think there is going to be a need for another adjustment there. They were quite high six to eight months ago. But they've brought them down to I think about two or three months right now.
Tom Linebarger: And they definitely under produced in the fourth quarter relative to demand for that reason. Yeah.
Tim Solso: That's why we say we think our Chrysler volumes well down from 2007 and 2008 will remain flat for this year.
Tom Linebarger: Our truck customers also have been adjusting inventories down for sure. And they did a lot of that in the fourth quarter. I am not sure how much more that each of them are... each case is going be different, but they are definitely reducing inventories in the truck business too.
Henry Kirn - UBS: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Ann Duignan with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Ann Duignan - J.P. Morgan: Hi, it's Ann Duignan. Good morning, everybody.
Tim Solso: Good morning.
Tom Linebarger: Good morning.
Ann Duignan - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Can you just talk about your relationship with Navistar in 2010, and whether you would be supplying them any for 15 liter engines? And then, can you talk about Navistar today international represents somewhere between 35 to 40% of your heavy duty engine volumes. What do you expect to do in terms of restructuring or rightsizing the business if indeed Navistar disappears as a customer?
Tom Linebarger: Ann, this is Tom. Post 2010, our expectation is that we will still supply engines to Navistar not for U.S. truck use, not for 2010 admissions, but outside the U.S. In side the U.S., we don't expect to sell them 2010 engines at this stage. We'd love to change their mind but right now that's not the plan. And, with regard to adjusting, our view is that we that already in our expectations and are already building our capital plans and workforce planning around that. We don't think it's going to require any further adjustment and things we are already doing. And we think we are highly confident our heavy-duty business can be successful and profitable despite losing Navistar as a customer, we sure would like to win them back though, and we are working on it.
Ann Duignan - J.P. Morgan: Can you help me try and quantify the impact on revenues and potentially earnings for Navistar and Cummins in 2010, would it be loss of about 25,000 engines which is about 30% to 35% of our heavy-duty high end engine business is that correct?
Tom Linebarger: Yes 38%, I think your numbers are roughly right. I think probably you can do your own calculations there. The thing to watch out for is the calculations you are doing of course on the year before as opposed to current year. So I think we're -- our expectation is it depends a whole bunch on what year you are talking about, how much it will -- the actual volume we have. I think you have the numbers broadly right for last year. Our view is that we will be moving up in shared pack as we have been as steadily, moving up in share pack and after '09 we will essentially represent all their business. In freightliner all their outside purchase anyway and then freightliner will begin to move up a freightliner both of which we hope to largely offset losses at Navistar.
Ann Duignan - J.P. Morgan: So, the 25,000 units is going to be hard to offset that entire volume?
Tom Linebarger: Yeah, we're going to try to do that.
Ann Duignan - J.P. Morgan: Okay.
Tom Linebarger: Are there more questions.
Ann Duignan - J.P. Morgan: Well I'm just thinking that 25,000 units incrementally PACCAR and Freightliner probably not well and may be possible if the market is up significantly.
Tim Solso: I think what you can take away from this is what Tom has said is that we've anticipated this for a long time. We have flexible capacity so we can adjust our fixed cost. And we think our heavy-duty engine business for North American trucks in 2010 and beyond would be as profitable as it has been in the past I mean at the top end. So we are not planning on some large drop in profits as a result of that. We have a very profitable business, we have great relationships with our customers, we have got a super product that's coming out, and we have a good relationship with Navistar. So I think your question implies if there is a doom and gloom out there and we would not agree with that.
Ann Duignan - J.P. Morgan: Okay, sounds fair, I appreciate the response. Can I just circle back a little bit to your comments on the decline in the agriculture and mining and marine end markets? Can you just give a little bit more color on what you are seeing in those three sectors?
Tim Solso: From a mining perspective, obviously at the end of 2008 when some of the large mine sites started announcing some of their capital expenditure reductions, we did start to see that filter through then on the OEM order boards. We did start to see some cancellations, some of the large high horsepower engines upon our factories. I think it is clearly an expectation that it's going to be down this year. We're I think expecting it could be down as much as 30 to 40% for our mining business. There are obviously some spots where we're continuing to deliver to orders in the backlog. But that is an area that it's going to be down this year. From an agriculture perspective, as you know, where we participate most in the Ag segment is really in the 4-wheel drive tractors and the larger combines, so mostly with larger displacement engines, mid-range and heavy duty engines to go into those markets primarily in the Brazil kind of Eastern Europe and North American markets. And we are seeing some changes in the demand in those markets at this time. So we are expecting that to be a softer market in 2009. And the marine I believe was your third market which you're asking specifically on. Let me address it in both the recreational marines as well as in the commercial marine, two different stories going on there. Recreational marine which is part of our joint venture with Brunswick Cummins MerCruiser clearly has had a very difficult 2008 and we are not expecting any recovery in the recreational marine market. So recreational marine being pleasure yachts that use 15 liter engines or smaller. 2009 will be an additional difficult year for that market. The commercial marine market has got some pockets right now that are feeling the pinch from availability of credit. Where some shipyards are running out of credit availability to continue with the production of commercial marine vessels and so we are seeing some of those areas in the Asia Pacific Rim that are dealing with that. There are other areas where we are continuing to see good backlogs that are continuing... the customers are continuing or committed to building out some of those vessels, primarily those that have been supporting a lot of the oil and gas industry. So it's kind of a mix bag right now in the commercial marine market. But overall we are expecting that it will be down in 2009 as well.
Tom Linebarger: If you look at the consumer markets that we have, the recreational marine, RVs both the primary engine as well as the Gensets any of that, a lot of that's right now at 40 year lows and that's build into our forecast. And we are not counting on any recovery in 2009. Those markets are absolutely dead.
Ann Duignan - J.P. Morgan: Okay that's great color; I really do appreciate it. Thanks I'll get back in queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Joel Tiss with Buckingham Research, Please proceed.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Hey guys, how's it going?
Tim Solso: Okay.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: That's good, Can you just zero in on one thing that has sort of been danced around, PACCAR's delaying their engine plans I guess in 2010, but can you talk a little bit about your expectations from market share with them in 2010 over '09? Do you think it's going to go up or down?
Tom Linebarger: Yeah, I think it'll go up in 2010.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: And then may be decline after that, when they get fully ramped up?
Tom Linebarger: Yes.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Okay.
Tom Linebarger: If you are adding together the two platforms, that's what you are trying to do, figure out market share by in total. We expect overtime that we will be their sole 15 leader supplier, once they clear out backlog of core (ph) engines that they bought. And they will eventually introduce their own engine and those will be the two engines that they'll use.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Okay.
Tom Linebarger: What the market share of each of them is kind of depends on how they position the trucks and what customers are trying to get out of them.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Can you help us also on clarification around first half, second half, do you expect the first quarter for the overall company to still be profitable?
Pat Ward: Yes, the first quarter we do anticipate and we expect that to be profitable. If you are looking for guidance, we are not going to give you quarterly guidance for the full year. But certainly we would expect the second half to be better, than the first half.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Okay. And then last can you just help with free cash flow, maybe you are not going to give guidance on free cash flow, but can you just give relative to 2008 where you expect it to be?
Pat Ward: Yes, I think in 2008 we had our net overflow 2009 as you heard from the scripted remarks we are targeting positive inflow of cash. And I think two areas relative to 2008 that a different capital expenditure we are taking them from around $540 million to somewhere between 316 to $400 million. So there is a significant improvement there. And in 2009 we are targeting our businesses to reduce our working capital. And specifically an inventory and generate cash from working capital in '09, and '08 that was overflow.
Tom Linebarger: Also on the stock buyback I think we spend somewhere around $128 million in 2008 and as we said we have temporarily suspended the stock buyback and that's just a conservative way of looking that we want to make sure that we are conservative in managing our cash and once we see the market stabilizing and that we will be still committed to the buyback that we're going to be conservative at this point in time.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: That makes sense. And then, with all those moves, do you think the free cash flow could end up being higher than your earnings.
Pat Ward: I am not going to give guidance, not just now.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Okay. All right.
Tom Linebarger: Joel, we focused on really what we believe to be the key pieces of the free cash flow that you're trying to calculate. And I think on slide 15 of the presentation, as Pat indicated capital expenditures is one of those larger numbers. The global pension funding number is around there as well and as you can see much like we talked about at the Analyst Day back in November, are kind of going to be up in about the $30 million range from what they were in 2008. So, not as large an impact as maybe what you're expecting at other companies.
Joel Tiss - Buckingham Research: Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wachovia Capital. Please proceed.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Good morning, everyone.
Tim Solso: Hey, Andy. Good morning.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: I guess, Dean just a follow-up on that pension structure, just went through the sequential 494 million decline in shareholders equity from Q3, is that both currency and pension, or mostly pension?
Dean Cantrell: The pension was about 433 of that?
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Okay. Now, does that trans -- and maybe you just answered this with Joel, but, does that translate into a headwind for the P&L in '09?
Pat Ward: From the P&L in '09, we expect the pension expense to be marginally higher than '08. And we are looking just now, somewhere in the 10 to $15 million range of an increase in the P&L. From the cash perspective as you can see from the presentation, we're projecting it to be around $30 million higher from the cash contribution perspective.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Okay. Thanks, Pat.
Pat Ward: So no, not a headwind.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Okay, thanks. And, in '09 with the positive cash flow, are you looking to reduce debt or you're just keeping that for dry powder.
Pat Ward: We have no intention of reducing of debts in 2009.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Okay.
Tim Solso: Dry powder is a good explanation of it.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Sometimes I get lucky with it Tim. The pricing benefit that you talked about when you were going through the margin, puts and takes, is that mainly in the high horse power engine business components and distribution?
Pat Ward: Yeah, I think we can see pricing opportunity across most of our segments. Certainly, in higher horsepower element, high horsepower segment, there is an element there, but it should help the engine business with its margins. Pretty much across the board we see some opportunity for pricing; not to the same extent as I think that we generated in 2008.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Okay. So, within that Pat, it doesn't sound like you're expecting any discounting, is that an accurate assessment?
Pat Ward: Yes.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Okay. And the reason I asked Tim, some of your competitors seem to have better availability on the high horsepower engine applications than even the two quarter discussion that Tom had in the prime power piece of Power Gen?
Tom Linebarger: Yeah. Andy, we're careful about our availability here, because we... what we are coming off of is a long, where we had long lead times and very few open slots. And now, as one of the earlier callers asked, are the cancellations -- people are dropping there -- they are shifting on the order board. They are postponing projects or they are doing whatever, which is opening slots in order board. So, you might be able to drop in a week if somebody doesn't want one delays, you might be able to drop in a week. So, what I gave was average kind of order lead times. But in fact, today, given how much shift in there is, you might be able to get one or two high horsepower Gensets really quickly or engines. So, it is going to... and it's going to keep producing. I mean, at some point we'll use a 90 or 120 day lead time, because that's just a practical supply chain operating lead time. But, that doesn't mean that if you just wanted to get one, you might not be able to get one early or distributor might have one on their lot that they'll sell you. So, I think your real point there was will that eventually lead to discounting like it did sometime ago. And our intention is not. And I think the industry got some tough lessons in the last downturn about discounting. So, I think there is some good learned behavior. And the last thing that's different as you remember, in the last downturn, there was a whole bunch of telecoms that had bought a lot of equipment and basically put it back on the market as used equipment, which we don't see this time. So all those things... we hope moderate pricing behavior in the market but our own behavior is going to be not to pursue discounting as a strategy. And right now we just don't see a need to do it.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Okay. I am sure we'll all watch that. And lastly, just want to clarify something I saw in the trade press. On the light duty automotive some reports are suggesting a delay in the Dodge Ram 1500 diesel application to 2011. Is that consistent with what you've been told by the customer?
Tom Linebarger: Yes.
Andrew Casey - Wachovia Capital: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI group. Please proceed.
David Raso - ISI Group: Yes. Two questions, one on '09 and one with a bigger picture. For the JV income down 20% the guidance for '09, I know roughly 40 to 50% of that income is China and India JVs, can you give us a little breakdown between what you see in those JVs versus the distribution business for '09 and within the JV line items?
Tim Solso: Yes, I would kind of maybe get you thinking about the JV income in terms of two major buckets being the engine business and distribution. And yes, the guidance that we gave in terms of JV income being down, the majority of it is going to be in the Engine business. I think you will see some slight deterioration just as you would expect during this recessionary period in the distribution segment but in more or like the single digit, probably in their distributors' market. In the Engine business I think that's where you are going to see most of the drop in the JV income. And obviously these are some of the things that we've talked about in prior calls in terms of Dongfeng joint venture and the challenges with the truck market there, they are seeing in China where we make the volumes within the joint venture dropping 25 to 30% there and obviously affecting the level of income that that joint venture contributes. We are going to see the start up of the joint venture in Beijing with Photon where we are introducing two new light-duty diesel engines. We will obviously be incurring additional start-up expenses until those engines actually go into production here this summer. So that will be an additional negative to joint venture income. And then there is obviously the Indian truck market and our joint venture with Tata Motors there. Again expect it to be a difficult year for the truck sector in India. And we would expect to see a decline in volume in that joint venture as well. And between those three I think I parade majority of the decline that you would see in the engine business joint venture income.
David Raso - ISI Group: Okay. Thank you. And the big picture question. Obviously everybody can have their own thoughts about the progression the truck cycle in next couple of years. Obviously the company faces a lot of questions around, the market share and heavy truck going forward and so forth. I mean you are facing for a long time of course, it's not a new issue. But, clearly more of your competitors have their own -- your customers have their own engine. So, it's a legitimate concern? I mean, to keep your earnings power it is going to be can this component division really become a rigid profit contributor and I know the market obviously didn't work out the way you would have thought for '09 and even for that matter the end of '08. But 2.5% to 3% margin in '09, can you take us through a little more detail now that we have kind of seen how difficult '09 should on the revenue. Can you give some guidance on where you think these margins could be, even if I did give you component growth of double-digit in '10 and '11? I mean what are we missing here that we should think these margins can go to 5, 6, 7% anytime soon, let alone if this 9% EBIT margin target you have. That's going to be critical to the structural earnings power the company will make really next 3 to 5 years.
Tom Linebarger: David, just one backup point and then I'll get into your details of the question, but we definitely believe that the engine business plus the components business together is our strategy by which we think we can help our customers succeed. So we don't think it's an either question. Our view is that, really all of our customers make engines and they have for sometime. The question is which ones they make and our view is us being able to provide the engines that they need plus the components and sub-system technologies they need on their engines will be -- had been and will be a successful long term strategy. When it comes to margins on components, our view is that we definitely can see our way as revenues return to earning in the 7% to 9% range that we talked about. And we have been active in working on and restructuring the parts of the business that have been lower margin in the good years, in 2008. And we're making good progress on that and you saw some of that progress during Q2 and Q3. And I think the work that we're doing to restructuring the business will position them well for when growth returns. So we remain highly confident that we will hit our 9% EBIT target as growth returns and will move to 7 pretty quickly as business returns to normal levels. So for us that, we're confident that we can do it, it's not a difficult bridge to do. Right this is rough year for them and just as we were positioning ourselves for growth, volume dropped a lot and that really had a hard -- took a hard lat at margins on those component businesses but we expect as growth returns we will return with good margins.
David Raso - ISI Group: Well I guess I ask the different way, if you didn't... I understand why for the growth opportunities, if you hadn't added the incremental cost to the business thinking '09 was going to be a better year than it is going to end up being, how would you have thought of the '09 margins and I am just trying to think did you feel you are on your way to getting 5, 6, 7% in '09, if you just let the business run but understandably you are burdened with cost, and hope for eventual growth opportunity in '09, '10, '11. I am just trying to think through...?
Tom Linebarger: That hypothetical is hard for me to do but I can answer the other one which is, what was our '09 plan before the volumes dropped off, and yes we plan to be up in our 7% to 9% range.
Pat Ward: The other thing David is, you go back and look at the first three quarters of 2008. The components business across that period delivered about 7% of sales. So yes we absolutely believe it can have those type of target margins when the volumes do it all.
David Raso - ISI Group: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Tim Solso: Okay I think let's stop here on the questions. And I think we've got some closing remarks that we'd like to make.
Tim Solso: Yes. I would like to make a few comments just to give you a perspective on how we see the world and why we're doing what we are doing. This is the fifth recession that I have seen in my career and four of them, I was very senior, one running the Engine business, one as President, the one earlier in this decade as Chairman, and now this one. And this is very different than what we've seen and it's going to be deeper and longer and it's going to be more global. And so that's kind of our view of the world. And we are going to manage our business with that assumption and if we are wrong then we'll benefit sooner than what we are anticipating. The second thing is that the company is in very good shape right now in a sense of a very strong balance sheet. We've got great products that are coming out, our capacity is in place and so forth. So we are strong and I truly believe that no matter what happens in this recession that we're going to be able to manage it very successfully. Our strategy is simply that we are going to manage cost and manufacturing capacity to meet the demand and the volumes. And so when Tom talks about we're through a couple of people reductions we'll now look at demand on an ongoing basis at various plants. And we have the flexibility to make adjustments fairly quickly at those plants. The second thing on strategy is that we are going to manage for cash. We did this earlier in the decade, we've already reduced capital but not to a silly position. We're still investing in the future. Our discretionary spending is in control. We have work to do on our working capital, but as Pat said, we have plans in place. We've temporarily suspended the stock buyback. But we're going to maintain the dividend. And finally, in all of that, even in this time as Tom has said, we're going to invest with a very focused approach for growth in this future. We look at pay back periods, but it's not like we're going to stop planning. So, that's where we think we can come out of this. We think this is a really solid approach. It's one that we will continue to report to you on. But, I think the company is in good shape, we're going to manage this and we'll come out of it in even better shape.
Dean Cantrell: Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us today on the teleconference. And, I will be available in the office for additional questions after the call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a good day.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-07-29 08:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the ArvinMeritor third quarter fiscal year 2008 earnings conference. At this time to get a start, I am pleased to turn the floor over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Terry Huch. Please go ahead, sir.
Terry Huch: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to ArvinMeritor's third quarter 2008 earnings call. On the call today we have Chip McClure, our Chairman, CEO and President and Jay Craig, our CFO. The slides accompanying today's call are available at www.arvinmeritor.com and we will refer to the slides in our discussion this morning.

Chip McClure: Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin by saying how proud we are of our global team for the strong results they delivered this quarter. We believe our third quarter results tell a very clear story. Even though we are operating in one of the most challenging markets we have seen in years, we have been able to improve our earnings due to the aggressive actions we have implemented, including significantly reducing our cost, refocussing our business, improving the fundamentals of our operations, and driving a profitable growth strategy. With a strong global leadership team, and the right focus, we are well positioned to continue executing on our goals and successfully delivering a solid performance. Over the longer-term, we believe that our diversified customer mix, global footprint, and strong product portfolio will continue to help us manage through the short-term challenges in the industry. Before I discuss our third quarter highlights, I would like to take a moment to recognize Jim Donlon, who is becoming the ArvinInnovation CFO. Jim has been a tremendous asset to the ArvinMeritor team for over three years. We have achieved success in a difficult market, in large part, due to Jim's expertise and commitment. We wish him great things as CFO of ArvinInnovation. At the same time, we are delighted to have Jay Craig step in as our new CFO. He is ArvinMeritor's Controller for the last two years. Jay has been an integral part of our team. We are benefitting from his knowledge of our business and his experience in the automotive industry. He has been a great help in developing many of the strategies we currently have in place. Jay will be a strong contributor to our success going forward. Now let's turn to slides 3 and 4 which outline the highlights from the third quarter. First, we are pleased to announce that during the third quarter we earned $0.77 per share from continuing operations before special items, tripling what we earned in the same period last year. We achieved positive free cash flow of $59 million from operations net of capital expenditures for the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect to report our third consecutive quarter of positive cash flow despite the fact that our top line is growing at about 20% year-over-year. Our sales were $2 billion, up more than $340 million year-over-year due to stronger volumes, increased market share, and currencies outside of North America. Our light vehicle business was another key contributor to this growth. Although LVS sales were down slightly on a constant currency basis, this business was up in total because of its strong presence in markets outside of North America. We also saw sales improve in our commercial vehicle specialty business, including new awards for military products in the United States and off-highway products in China. We made meaningful progress toward completing the spin-off of our Light Vehicle Systems business which announced on May 6th. I will discuss the spin-off in more details a few moments. During the quarter, our LVS business group rolled out some exciting new technologies, including announcing a new electrically-driven chassis control system for light vehicles. LVS also expanded its engineering and technical capabilities by opening a new technical center in Brazil. We believe this business group continues to provide, that is poised for growth and success going forward. Our CVS business success will increase its margins before special items by 120 basis points, compared to the same period last year. This was held not only by the growth in our CVA and specialty segments and through our Performance Plus cost reduction initiatives, but also achieving higher CVS sales and profits in every region of the world, compared to the third quarter last year. We continue to see improvements in our CVS organization, which is benefitting from operational improvements as well as geographic and business diversity. We are keenly focused on the commercial vehicle business strategy to grow in areas that offer the best and most profitable opportunities, such as commercial vehicle after-market where we recently expanded our European presence by acquiring a leading remanufacturing company called Trucktechnic. Our strong liquidity position gives us the flexibility to invest in growth businesses, such as CDA and specialty, as well as invest in our global footprint and markets that are growing. We have recently won major awards for MRAP service parts that will have a positive impact on our financial results in 2009. In addition, one of our customers announced a very large multi-year order for other tactical vehicles that will help offset lower production of MRAP vehicles in future periods. Also, our CVS business is benefitting significantly from the booming markets in Brazil, China and India. For example, to keep up with the demand in China India, our plants Suzhou, China and Mysore, India are operating at full capacity. As a result, we are reviewing additional investments to support the strong growth in that region of the world. Looking at the quarter overall, it is clear that we are deriving benefits from our cost cutting initiatives and growth strategy, and we are gaining market share in key business segments. We are of course proud of these accomplishments, but we are not stopping there. We will continue to evaluate our business and our needs with the same rigor as we have in the past. Over the last year, we built tremendous momentum, and we are confident that with the improvement actions we have taken, we will continue to perform well going forward. On slide 5, you will see our outlook for 2008. As we said in our July 2nd news release, we are on track to come in at the top end of our guidance before special items of $1.40 to $1.60 for fiscal year 2008. Our Performance Plus net cost reductions of $75 million per year continue to be on track for 2008 and 2009. Although we reported strong sales in the third quarter, it was already reflected in our previous sales guidance of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion. We are also improving our cash flow guidance by $25 million to negative $50 million to $100 million for fiscal year 2008. Let's move to slide 6. We are pleased to announce that we made solid progress with our Performance Plus initiatives. In spite of rising material cost, we are on track to fully achieve our targeted goal of $75 million in cost savings in 2008. With the relentless focus on implementation late in the year, we are well positioned to see full year benefits carry into 2009. Although we are pleased with this performance, we remain focused on realizing our goal to achieve $150 million in savings by 2009, even in light of what we know is a very difficult material cost environment. With that challenge in mind, we are launching Performance Plus Wave 2. What this essentially means is that we have refreshed, reenergized, and we are rotating our Performance Plus teams. The initial Performance Plus teams are now integrated into our businesses and operations and are driving the processes throughout the organization. The Wave 2 teams will concentrate on generating new ideas and strategies, with a primary focus on our business in Europe. As we continue to experience industry challenges, these teams will respond by redoubling their efforts to significantly reduce costs and drive profitable growth initiatives. Since we embark on Performance Plus program, we have watched as these initiatives became part of our day-to-day performance objectives. We are especially pleased that the Performance Plus philosophy has become part of our ArvinMeritor's DNA and culture. Performance Plus Wave 2 gives the program a boost to move us to the next level. Let's turn to slide 7. Although some reports are showing concern about the slowing of the European heavy duty truck market, we see it as an opportunity to relieve high volume premium cost and to refocus capital expenditures on efficiency and flexibility initiatives. Although we do not expect to see the same robust pace of growth in 2008 for the remainder of 2008, and even after lowering our forecast, we still expect to see production volumes increase by 11% year-over-year. Even though we see European production volumes down by 3% in 2009, you will still be the second highest production year of all time. Now let's turn to slide 8. As I mentioned briefly, we continue to see strong growth in our commercial vehicle after-market business which you know has traditionally been very profitable for us. In the third quarter, CVA achieved record sales volumes, exceeding its previous record for the quarter in 2006. With a keen focus on growing this profitable business, we have not slowed our acquisition or our global market expansion strategy. As I mentioned earlier, we recently acquired Trucktechnic, a market leader in the remanufacturing and distribution of commercial vehicle disc brakes and air system components, based in Liege, Belgium. This acquisition broadens our geographic footprint, expands our product offering and deepens our existing European after-market portfolio. Trucktechnic has an established reputation for quality, reliability and outstanding service among its customer base in Western and Eastern Europe as well as Africa and South America. We are also pleased with the progress, we made on other initiatives to expand our business. We moved ahead quickly to integrate our North American operations with Mascot Truck Parts and the synergies, we are finding have exceeded our expectations. On March 27th, we announced a multimillion dollar supply agreement to provide remanufactured transmissions and axle carriers to Navistar Parts. We recently entered into a agreement with PACCAR's to support its Peterbilt and Kenworth dealer networks in Canada with the Mascot brand of remanufactured transmissions and axle carriers. The chart at the bottom of this slide outlines our CVA remanufacturing growth initiatives. With the need for environmentally friendly products and the need to reduce the carbon footprint remanufacturing is growing at a fast pace. To address this trend as you can see from this slide, in Europe this year we have strengthened our remanufacturing brake business and added drivelines to the product portfolio. In North America, we improved our remanufacturing capabilities by expanding into drivetrains and adding the trailer axle product line. Let's turn to slide 9. As part of our ongoing effort to promote products that enhance fuel economy we are constantly evaluating our technology and innovation strategy. We aim to position ourselves as the company that customers look to for lightweight and other product solutions and improve fuel economy and have a positive impact on the environment. As you can see from this slide, we have several technologies that help us achieve this strategy. With a focus on fuel savings, we are investing in several technologies that address this need such as hybrids for commercial trucks and the tire inflation system, which delivers higher fuel economy on heavy trucks by constantly maintaining proper tire pressure. We believe this product will reduce operating costs and increase profits for truck owners by as much as $1400 per year. Within the LVS business group, we are seeing strong demand for our smart systems product, which is an exciting area of strategic innovation. For example, our efforts to design lighter vehicles help insure that ArvinMeritor's product portfolio is ready for the shift towards improving fuel economy. As you can see on this slide, we have several examples of lightweight LVS products including the LFI Roof, which is in production now. This new roof system replaces base sheet metal with composite materials reducing vehicle weight by as much as 10 pounds. Currently, we are producing this roof system for the Opel Corsa. Let's now turn to slide 10. As you can see from this slide, LVS is on several of the most fuel and cost efficient vehicles in Europe. What is important here is that we are on the right platforms, especially in fuel savings as a top priority for consumers. It is also important to note that we are on some of the best selling vehicles in Europe such as the Audi Q7 and Ford Focus and we are aligned to customers, who are reporting strong earnings in the region. Let's turn to slide 11. Since announcing the spin-off of our light vehicle systems group on May 6th, we have made great progress. As you know, we filed the initial registration document or Form 10 for our innovation on May 28th and after review by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we filed an amendment with updated information on July 28th. LVS achieved internal financial targets for the third quarter and is on track to meet financial milestones required to complete the spin. As Jay will take you through a little bit LVS results would have been better than the third quarter of 2007, if you exclude the effects of some nonrecurring items and LVS is well positioned to achieve solid result even in a slowing economy because only 20% of its sales are with the Detroit 3 in North America. Going forward, LVS will continue to be a leading global supplier in the automotive industry. We are confident that the LVS business has a bright future. I want to conclude by making a few comments about the strength of the remaining commercial vehicle business. The commercial vehicle business will continue to be a market leader in drive-train components and systems for heavy and medium duty trucks, trailers, busses, off highway commercial vehicles and government heavy duty vehicles and for the commercial vehicle aftermarket. To-date our commercial vehicle team has made significant improvements to strengthen fundamentals and broaden our geographic footprint. They have helped make our operations increasingly lean in spite of the capacity challenges that we have experienced in Europe. As we discussed these actions are starting to show in our CVS margins. By continuous focus on improving operations, customer pricing and terms, we believe going forward that the CVS team will deliver even better margins especially given the tremendous progress they have made in developing core competencies in manufacturing. We will continue to grow our commercial vehicle business and deliver solid performance. We look forward to the next chapter in our nearly 100 year history as a commercial vehicle focused company. I would now like to turn the call over to Jay.
Jay Craig: Thank you, Chip. Our results for this quarter were good and I think they foreshadowed what lies ahead for ArvinMeritor in the next few chapters. Slide 12 shows our income statement for the quarter. Sales were up 21% for all the reasons, Chip mentioned. I will take you through the business unit margin explanations in a few minutes and you will see how the sales increases helped us convert at a higher rate. As a result, gross profit was up 42% from last year's third quarter and came in just short of 10% of revenue compared to 8.3% last year. SG&A was up significantly. A portion of the increase related to half balance sheet securitization. The costs associated with these sales, which were $6 million this quarter are recognized in SG&A, whereas the costs they replaced were an interest expense. This is one of the reasons our interest expense was down from last year. Another reason for the higher SG&A cost was our decision to increase marketing efforts for commercial vehicle aftermarket. Despite a challenging freight environment North America CVA had an all time sales record this quarter, which is a good indication that our marketing efforts are working. Lastly I will mention that our SG&A cost for the year ago period were lower due to compensation factors. It became clear during the third quarter last year that we would not meet all of our financial targets for the year. As a result, we reversed a portion of the annual variable compensation we had accrued for employees in the first half of the year. In spite of that, operating income was up 60% year-over-year to $72 million. For continuing operations before special items income before taxes was up 132%. Our after affiliate income, interest expense and taxes income was $56 million up 211% from the third quarter of last year. I will discuss the low income tax rate on the next slide. This brought our earnings per share for continuing operations before special items to $0.77 compared to $0.25 cents in the year ago quarter. Special items excluded from these results are shown on slide 30. They include a $4 million pretax charge for restructuring and a $6 million pretax charge for the transaction costs associated with our planned spin-off. We will continue to adjust for transaction costs in the future including some tax effects, we are expecting at the time of the spin-off, as we segregate and align the various legal entities for the two companies. Slide 13 addresses the question what changed in taxes for this period. As you can see on the slide, a very little has changed except that we now know in which quarter certain prior year tax questions have been resolved with the IRS. As you may recall, our tax rate in the first half of the year was abnormally high. We did not belabor this point because we knew it would be abnormally low in one of the quarters in the second half. It turns out that was the third quarter. If you looked at the quarter in isolation, we would say it included $0.17 per share of nonrecurring benefit for these items. However, relative to our guidance and our full year tax rate nothing has really changed. Our full year rate guidance has been 22% to 26% since the beginning of the year. Today, we are tightening the bottom end of the range from 22% to 23%. This rate is on our trend and is close to the normalized rate, we would expect in the medium term. Slide 14 shows the earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation by segment. CVS earned $101 million of EBITDA, an increase of 55% over last year that corresponded to 1.2 percentage point increase in margins. LVS earned $26 million of EBITDA that was down from last year primarily because of an additional accrual for the customer issue, we discussed in our first quarter report. We increased reserves for this item by $5 million in the quarter; although we do not have a final resolution the reserved amount represents, what we expect to end up paying. We project that the cash payment will be made in the first fiscal quarter of 2009. Net of this and a couple of other nonrecurring item shown on slide 28, the underlying business of LVS improved from both an EBITDA and cash flow perspective. Total EBITDA for ArvinMeritor was $121 million, up 42% from last year. As you can see on slide 15, EBITDA has been higher than the previous year in all three quarters of 2008 and we expect that the trend will continue in the fourth quarter as well. As a result 12 month EBITDA has been rising quickly and we expect it will be over $400 million by the end of the fiscal year. The continuing year-over-year progress reflects significant operational improvements and major benefits derived from our Performance Plus program in both divisions. The next slide shows how those and other factors have allowed us to expand our margins in our Commercial Vehicle Systems group compared to last year. First as Chip mentioned, CVS sales were up in every region of the world. In North America Class-8 production was up almost 20% compared to last year. Medium and heavy duty truck production in Europe was up about 30,000 units from last year and South America, Asia and specialty markets continue to be very strong for us. Trailers and medium duty trucks continue to be challenging in North America, but we posted a sales gain in the region nonetheless. Performance Plus cost reductions continue to be a very important part of our ongoing improvement and margins. Savings from these initiatives increase CVS margins by 1.3 percentage points compared to last year. The net impact of higher raw material prices in the quarter after considering related customer pricing was small. We have had a great deal of success in passing these costs on. We are executing our steel surcharge program as envisioned and we will continue to do so. Obviously we would like for this variance to be zero, but there are some unavoidable timing differences in some of our business lines and there are commodities other than steel that are not amenable to index surcharges. Higher SG&A costs reduced CVS margins by 1.5 percentage points for the reasons I discussed earlier. When you add it all up, CVS earned 7.4% this quarter compared to 6.2% in the same quarter last year. Slide 17, charts CVS EBITDA margins against Class-8 production in North America. I think it shows pretty clearly the way we have been able to disconnect CVS margin performance from the production in this one area. We are able to do this because of our strong presence in trucks in Europe, South America, and Asia as well as our aftermarket and specialty businesses. Our intense focus on continuing to grow our specialty and aftermarket will help keep our margin momentum going and even as we steer through some challenges in the truck markets. The left-hand side of this chart also shows that we did not really benefit from the unprecedented production levels of the 2006 pre-buy which was in full swing during the first two quarters shown on this chart. If production volumes continue to grow moderately in 2009 as we now expect, we will be able to ramp up more efficiently providing additional lift to margins. Now let me switch over to the Light Vehicle market. I mentioned earlier that LVS margins were up if you set aside some nonrecurring factors. Slide 18, shows that LVS EBITDA margins were 0.9 percentage point lower than the third quarter last year with the customer issue accounting for 0.8 of a point and the change in allocation methodology accounting for 0.6 point. Looking only at operational factors you can see that Performance Plus cost savings and volume growth outside North America more than offset the impact of higher raw material prices and weaker industry volumes in North America. Total worldwide volume and mix reduced margins by only 0.4 of a point, which underscores the benefits of not relying too much on the North America market. However, it also shows that we are in a lot of the right places outside North America. In the area of steel and other raw material costs LVS is also performing well in a tough market. The team stepped up, had some very difficult discussions and reached some very favorable outcomes. So in total, LVS EBITDA margins were 4% and would have been higher if not for the customer issue. Slide 19, shows our free cash flow for the quarter. The short story here is that the net income was converted to cash flow, which we think is a pretty good goal for future periods. Working capital was an outflow in the period, but was significantly less sold than last year whether you include or exclude changes in securitization. Our assets and liability were a source of cash which is a normal seasonal pattern based on timing differences between expenses and cash payments. For example accrued interest increased by $18 million in the quarter because we had a semiannual coupon payment in the fourth quarter. We also had significant accruals for the quarter in compensation, warranty and the LVS customer issue. Total free cash flow was 59 million. Slide 20, puts that in context for the full year. As you will recall we had a large cash outflow in our first quarter reflecting seasonal patterns, a one time catch-up in accounts payable and some further acceleration to help some suppliers avoid liquidity issues. We have been able to cash flow positive in the last two quarters and expect to be positive again in the fourth fiscal quarter. That will bring us into a full year guidance range, which we are raising today to an outflow of $50 million to $100 million. Slide 21 is just a quick reminder that we have very limited refinancing risk. Our revolving credit line is almost entirely available and does not mature until 2011. Our next significant term debt maturity is in 2012. The next slide shows our planning assumptions for the year. The GDP growth numbers at the top of the page are actually a little higher than the last time we showed this slide, reflecting a slightly stronger growth in the second calendar quarter. However, we have colored them yellow to reflect a high degree of volatility in the assumption. We updated US light vehicle industry sales in our press release on July 2nd to a range of 14.4 million units to 14.6 million units. We have also shaded that assumption yellow recognizing that it is more likely that future revisions will be downward than upward, but again any further reduction should impact primarily 2009 results and not have any significant impact on 2008. We were not ready to lower our light vehicle sales for Europe on July 2nd, but we have lowered them here from our previous estimate of 17.1 million units to a range of 16.6 million to 16.9 million. Again, our favorable platform mix in Europe should allow us to continue to outperform the industry. On the Commercial Vehicle side, we updated North American Class-8 and European medium and heavy-duty truck production on July 12. We did not provide an update or the outlook on Class-5 to 7 our trailers, but the lowered ranges you see here were built into our thinking for 2008 guidance. There is one more favorable change since last time, which is an increase in MRAP awards. We expect a few hundred more vehicles to be awarded this summer at which time all funded vehicles will have been awarded. Slide 23 shows our updated guidance for 2008. Chip already provided the highlights and you can see the details on this chart. Now I would like to spend just a moment providing some early indications on what we see for 2009. I will do this separately for CVS and LVS. We continue to expect this strong year for CVS as slide 24 shows. As one of our customers said last week even without a pre-buy Class-8 volumes in North America should at least be able to return to replacement demand levels. That would represent an increase of at least 20% compared to this year's severely depressed production. In Europe our forecasted range of 530,000 to 550,000 trucks next year represents production that would be flat to down 5% from this year. We have listed the net effect of our lower production in Europe at zero to slightly negative, but I would lien more towards the zero side if the reduction stays in this range. South American volumes can not get much higher than they are now. However, they still may provide some improvement because of the full year effect of the recent increases there. In Asia, we continue to see opportunities to grow our truck axle operations in India and our off highway business in China. For military vehicles, we are not projecting a significant drop off in our profitability. It will be challenging to replace all the contribution MRAP production this year, but our specialty team is working hard to do just that. A significant portion of the awarded vehicles we showed on slide 22 will be produced in our fiscal 2009. In addition, we have received some very nice awards for MRAP service parts and the other tactical vehicles will help us in 2009 as well. On the chart military is followed by pluses for off highway and CVA. Our profitable growth in those areas is longstanding and well documented. Next, Performance Plus will continue to improve our cost base in 2009 compared to 2008. The many actions we have implemented in the second half of the year will give us a lot of momentum and Wave 2 will help us keep the pipeline full of high value ideas to improve our profitability. Raw material costs provide a headwind, but I think we have proven that we have an effective strategy to minimize the impact on our income statement. In total, 2009 will be a very good year for CVS with a little help from the market it could be a great year. In the light vehicle industry environment maybe somewhat more challenging than the commercial vehicle industry in Europe and North America, but LVS still expects higher results than this year also. In the US, production and sales are expected to remain at this year's low levels. In Europe we currently expect a 5% decrease in light vehicle sales in 2009, which will be a negative for LVS. However, there is a lot of regional and segment variability in Europe and the mix of platforms and regions we sell to is an important mitigant. For South America LVS is anticipating for the same thing as CVS is hoping for, continuation of current high industry levels for all of 2009. In Asia LVS's growth plans are aggressive and well developed. The relationships with Cherry and Hyundai in the region will ramp up meaningfully over the next few quarters. Cost savings that have been accomplished through Performance Plus will help results also. As will future productivity programs that LVS is currently working on. We have talked about our plans to close facilities in high cost regions, such as our Roofs facility in Frankfurt, Germany and backfill them with production and more cost competitive zones. Some of those actions are underway right now which will help LVS in 2009. We also expect material, labor and burden savings to continue to outstrip customer price downs. LVS has been particularly effective in controlling plant operating costs and that momentum will carry forward into next year. Again, raw material costs will be a challenge, but the team has proven it knows how to deal with that issue. That is our last slide. If I could summarize the quarter I would say that the cost reductions and excellent business diversity are allowing us to restore this company to acceptable levels of profitability. Even while our end markets are very difficult, we are controlling our own destiny and we are poised to benefit when the skies start to clear up. At this point we would be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Gentlemen, thank you. (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Hi, good morning.
Chip McClure: Good morning Patrick.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Yes. I think you touched on it in slide 24, but can you give us a sense of what declines you would start to need in Europe before really you start to see margins start to compress there. It sounds like the capacity constraints have made; it is such that at least the first, the drop off in the first few units might actually be positive for margins. Would you just give us a little color as to what the sensitivity might be on that on the downside?
Chip McClure: Sure. That is a good question Patrick. As you know, a year ago we really struggled with some that, there was a lot of premium cost. So as we look at that even with what is factored in there right now. I think it will actually put it into more of a reasonable phase as far as trying to reduce the premium cost, and as we have indicated we have been putting additional capacity in place. So as we look at the volume productions that are actually in our plans and what Jay laid out for both the balance of this year and going forward into 2009. I think that clearly should help us, unless there is a significant drop off, and again you have got two different markets there, you have got Western Europe and you have got Eastern Europe. Western Europe, I think is where a lot of softness is being seen. We continue as do our customers see strong growth in the Eastern European part of it. So as we see it right now I think, as you indicated right up front that with the softness as we see it in Western Europe will actually help reduce premium cost both for the balance of this year and more importantly going into 2009.
Jay Craig: I think Patrick the only thing I would also add is that, to meet some of the additional capacity requirements that we are asked to by our customers we have not added additional facilities or significant additional headcount. So that if the volumes come in slightly lower than people anticipate it should not require a lot of significant restructuring costs.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. On the US side, can you just remind us what you estimate replacement demand is for North America?
Chip McClure: Well, we are looking at replacement demand in North America is probably in the 240,000 to 250,000 range for next fiscal year.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Finally, can you quantify the compensation portion of the expense that was in SG&A for this quarter and give us a sense, is that a one time issue or is that something that maybe extended into fourth quarter as well?
Jay Craig: I do not think we are prepared to give a specific quantification of it at this time. I would say it was one of the largest components in the year-over-year comparisons of SG&A. Just to give a little more color other than that, were in my remarks earlier. If you recall last year at this time the performance of the business was suffering, so we had a release of the expected incentive compensation payments. Obviously this year we are performing quite well, so those incentive compensation payments are expected to be made. So the comparative swing is quite large. In the fourth quarter we do not expect that to have as significant impact. It may have a slight impact. However, overall we expect SG&A to get back to more normal trends and be more consistent on a quarter-over-quarter period comparison.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks, that is helpful. Then last just on raw materials, it sounds like there was a gap between recoveries and gross costs for this quarter. Can you give us a sense as to what your expectations are for the year on that and if you see yourself offsetting, most of your gross costs through customer recoveries, or as I think you have said in the past or if there may be some, some probability that you might actually have to take a little bit of extra expense on that item?
Chip McClure: Let me try to show that Patrick, and then I will let Jay weigh in a little bit. Obviously as we indicated earlier we have been working with our customers to make sure there is a pass-through. I think as you look at the absolute size of it, given the huge headwinds that exist out there, I think it is a reflection of the fact that we have indeed been able to work with our customers to look at that pass-through going forward. As Jay indicated some of it is a timing issue you look at. Quite frankly some of it is non-steel related type of material costs that are not as easy to index that way. I think it is safe to say that as we look at the steel program we have been successful in working with our customers to do that. Then secondarily as we indicated is part of our Performance Plus Wave 2. First of all we demonstrated in the third quarter, we know how to do it, we are doing that together with our customers and obviously have an obligation from a cost reduction internally. However, as we indicated by kicking off Wave 2 Performance Plus we also recognize that these headwinds are going to continue. We recognize the need in addition to working with customers to pass-through the increases is define ways to offset the costs and so we are actually doing it on both sides.
Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Chip McClure: You are welcome.
Operator: Next we will hear from Eric Selle with JP Morgan.
Eric Selle - JPMorgan: Hello, can you hear me.
Chip McClure: Good morning.
Eric Selle - JPMorgan: Good morning. I was caught off guard. Going through your balance sheet what was your off balance sheet factorings total at the end of the quarter. I think it was around 482 at the end of the March quarter?
Jay Craig: Yes, it was $491 million at the end of this quarter.
Eric Selle - JPMorgan: Okay. So basically you are really seeing some of that net debt roll off because of working capital. As you look into the fourth quarter are we going to continue to see some of that working capital as a source or should that reverse?
Jay Craig: As far as the factoring programs themselves we see them remaining relatively consistent, although sometimes they fluctuate with the customer receivable balances as you would expect. Again, just to remind folks, the vast majority of those factoring programs are customer sponsored. So, they are related directly to primarily European customers that we have, but they do fluctuate with the receivable balances.
Eric Selle - JPMorgan: Then the on balance sheet working capital what trend should we look for in the fourth quarter on that?
Chip McClure: Working capital should improve in the Q4. Again Q3 is traditionally our strongest sales quarter and does require a fairly large investment in working capital. We are quite proud that that investment this year was significantly below what we invested last year, which was due in large part to our aggressive improvement in our receivable collection activities. However, we tend to see the fourth quarter come down as our sales volume comes down in that quarter.
Eric Selle - JPMorgan: Great, thanks a lot for your time.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will hear next from Brian Johnson at Lehman Brothers.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Yes, couple of questions. In the Performance Plus Wave 2 few questions. Is this evenly split between LVS and CVS in terms of the costs it is going after?
Jay Craig: Well, as a matter of fact what we have done is, as we have indicated in the past a lot of that was based on percent of sales it will be about one-third or two-thirds.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Yes. I mean split by sales, which seem to roughly if my calculation is right look like it was about $20 million of Performance Plus in CVS this quarter out of the 428.
Jay Craig:  You are directionally correct.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: In addition to the cost savings given the issues around working capital, are you doing anything operationally around working capital as part of this Wave?
Chip McClure: Oh, absolutely. When you look at it on the inventory side of it we are very much looking at that both Carsten Reinhardt and his team, and Phil Martens and his team are very much looking at that. We track that the same way we track the other parts of that. Thoroughly we are looking to do and we have talked about that in several previous calls an area that we have looked at within ArvinMeritor production systems within the area of lien manufacturing and that type of thing is obviously we continue to lien our plans. We see opportunities to reduce inventory and at the same time with our suppliers, we are looking at working with them to get different terms there. So, yes, we do see that within the operations.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Do you have a target for inventory days or overall cast cycle days for '09 that you could share?
Chip McClure: Actually I can not share here. Obviously as you look at it, it is different across the platform quite frankly between OE and aftermarkets. We have got different demand needs there. We have also got to factor in as part of what we are looking is our total inventory throughout the pipeline depending where things are sourced too. So, I just giving one number, obviously we are looking at it as year-over-year improvement. It really is different based on whether it is an aftermarket OE customer and where it is located in the world.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Do you have a gap like you did in Performance Plus the best-in-class that you would like to close?
Chip McClure: Yes. As we look at that we continue, as part of our continuous improvement culture because we want to continue to identify where the gaps are. Literally if you will facility by facility and then put action plans in place within those facilities to make sure we can close that gap.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: In terms of days gap, I mean, length of the magnitude?
Chip McClure: No. As I said before Brian, as I look at it, it is really is facility-by-facility and market-by-market.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Then on the off-highway ex the MRAP, when you look at your expectations going forward to next year are you looking really at the market or are you looking at your participation in those market share?
Jay Craig: As far as, off-highway.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Yes.
Jay Craig: Yes. As you look at Brian, as you know, we have had a very strong position off-highway in Asia Pacific. Our plant, Suzhou, China, I was just there a couple of week ago is literally going 24/7 and as I indicated in my comments, we need to look at how we can increase that capacity there. As you know, we just announced the fact that we are reentering the off-highway market here in North America, South America, Europe and Africa. So, as I look at that I continue to see strong market demand in the market we have been serving for the last number of years being China in particular and secondarily probably other parts of Asia Pacific, as they continue to build infrastructure. I think as importantly as we reenter these markets and I will tell you the response from our customers in these markets of the Americas, Europe and Africa have been very positive. I see that increase going forward as we continue to reenter these markets.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thanks.
Jay Craig: Okay. Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Our next question will come from Himanshu Patel with JP Morgan.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: Hi, can you hear me.
Chip McClure: Yes indeed. Good morning, Himanshu.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: Good mornin. Just a couple of questions, can you give us an update on the state of recovery discussions on raw materials with the OEM's particularly on the light vehicle side just directionally speaking have they gotten anymore constructive or is it as difficult as it was before.
Chip McClure: Well let me first of all say that when you look at any request for material price increases the discussions are difficult. I will tell you that as I look at that and as we indicated in our comments and as you look at the both the margin improvement and as importantly the small size of the material cost as a factor, I think sufficed to say that yes, we have been able to be successful both in the LVS and CVS side to do that. I think the difference this time from time stats is because it was such a rapid increase in the raw material cost that I do not think there is any question in anybody's mind that these material costs are real. So, although they are difficult discussions I would certainly say that it made the discussions easier. I am really talking both LVS and CVS and any questions specifically LVS, I will tell you really on both sides I think, because of the fact that it was recognized by everybody that the material costs starting with raw material are indeed real.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: Okay. Then we have heard some grumblings about from other suppliers about freight costs becoming a big issue particularly inbound freight costs. Well first of all was that a material issue for you this quarter and in particular I am wondering how that affects the profitability of your CVA business.
Jay Craig:  Himanshu, it was a fairly significant issue. We are tracking that at a very detailed level. As we look through our recoveries from customers, we are not solely focused just on steel; we are focused on all the commodity cost increases including the rising cost of transportation. So, but we are also through the Performance Plus initiative one of the particular individual initiatives was focused particularly at better freight management, which we have seen significant reductions overall in our freight cost even with the rising cost of fuel and the pass-through effect of that on our cost. Overall, we have seen a net-net dramatic improvement in freight cost.
Himanshu Patel - JPMorgan: Okay. I want to go back to an earlier question I think. I mean, clearly Europe is a very big portion of the LVS business and also material portion of CVS. I am just wondering your preliminary '09 outlook look relatively benign on Europe. I am just wondering what is developing your thoughts there, is it that, is it a simpler saying that the bottlenecks in Europe are material enough on the CVS side that if you had maybe a 5% volume decline you would be agonistic to that from a profit perspective or are you just saying that the incoming data is not that bad yet and therefore you are not willing to be so concerned on the European top line?
Chip McClure: Well, let me start and then I will let Jay weigh in. When you look at I think you touched on some of that in the CVS side as far as the bottlenecks, as the volumes more normalized that helps to reduce the premium cost for that. Secondly, as I indicated in my comments, when you look at the platforms along with LVS, they continue to be very strong sellers in the market. So, those are two positives. The third positive is the fact that we do continue to see the strength in Eastern Europe side. So, the real weakness I think everybody is focused on is in Western Europe. Quite frankly, we are seeing some of that too. So, it is when you look at it on balance the market, continue strong in Eastern Europe with weakness in various markets in Western Europe but then offset, as I would have indicated on the CVS side with bottlenecks and then on the LVS side with the platforms we are on.
Jay Craig: Add a couple of comments I think on the CVS side we are seeing fairly divergent set of opinions from the OE customers and what their expectations are next year for European volume. I think our course of action is we are planning for I would not say the worst, but for lower volumes and I think the best example I can give of that is the Performance Plus Wave 2 Program that Chip mentioned we are focusing heavily in Europe on the cost reduction side. So, it is a big part of Wave 2 just to hedge our best-to-bet, if the volumes end up softer.
Chip McClure: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Leiker at Robert W. Baird.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Good morning
Chip McClure: Good morning, David.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird:  Looking at first Craig on the SG&A line can you talk about interest and marketing cost as being two of the big drivers relative to what we saw in the first two quarters, can you quantify those at all?
Jay Craig: Sure. I think what I mentioned was the cost of factoring, which was included in SG&A or sale of receivables as compared that mix of borrowing as compared to traditional interest costs from debt. That impact gross for the quarter was approximately $6 million. The CVA marketing investment was approximately $3 to $4 million. Then there was a fairly large component related to this incentive compensation change year-over-year. So that was the dimensioning the various components.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Sequentially the compensation went to that large of an issue, right?
Jay Craig: I am sorry, could you…?
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Relative to first and second quarter, the comp is not that big of an issue, is it?
Jay Craig: No. It really impacted us this quarter and we expect the impact in the fourth quarter to be lower.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Then, these other two are the factoring, the marketing obviously continues. Is this a new level in terms of these factoring costs for you or is that something one-time going on there unusual?
Jay Craig: Again, the factoring tends to vary with receivables and as we see the reduction in working capital in the fourth quarter. I think we should expect to see that cost decline. As far as the mix between our bowings, between year-over-year comparisons I think you should expect that the factoring costs will be higher as a percentage of a mix compared to interest costs as we changed our bowing strategy. As far as sequentially quarter-over-quarter, we may see that go down slightly as our investment in working capital declines.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Over the course of your going through your slides, several times Chip you made comments that gaining share. Can you give us some thoughts in terms of where you are seeing the greatest share gains?
Chip McClure: Well, as I indicate some of that is in the off highway side. As I indicated first of all we have had a very strong position in Asia Pacific and that market continues to be strong and see growth there. As we re-enter off highway side, we see some of that there. That is going forwards into the future. As I look at it currently a lot of that is in the CVA side and I think we indicated in the last earnings call that when we look at both Europe and in South America on CVA, we see growth. If I look at it currently a lot of the market share opportunity we are seeing is in CVA both Europe and South America. If I then look on the LVS side, and I would refer you back to my slides that shows some of the platforms, obviously we blend, add successfully on some of the platforms I think have shown share gain within the LVS phase.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Okay, great. On the Performance Plus, you have done a great job here and on a run rate, you are ahead of what your targets are, is there a point in time that you raise that $150 million target for 09?
Jay Craig: Well, as we said at this point, we are recognizing that there is headwind with material cost side of that, so for us to do that right now what we have said is we are recognizing the reality that is going on in the marketplace. So at this point no, we are not prepared to raise that, but obviously as part of our commitment or if you will recommitment to those targets in '09, we want to put those things in place to make sure we are doing that, obviously we stayed with the focus on Europe. The other thing I should mention clearly is on these things we are very volume dependant, so depending what the volumes do will dictate our reflection there. 
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: The last thing here is in the commercial vehicle business, the contribution margin here looks pretty nice, it is obviously being held back somewhat by steel. Do you think your normal level there now with where you need to be or is there still some upset on the contribution margin?
Jay Craig: Well, obviously as we have said I think what we would like to do is look for more on the upside part of that. If you notice although we are showing North America up year-over-year, suffice it to say last year at this time for this quarter, the North American mark was pretty much bottomed out. So, as we look at the North American rebound into '09, we do expect that we will show margin improvement from there.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: I am understanding your raw material in Europe weakening a little bit that somewhere down the road you could hit a 10% margin in that business?
Jay Craig: Again, our long-term goal, as we stated previously can be mentioned in a couple different manners. One is to have a return on equity that would be top quartile and the way we look at that, that would require us to have EBITDA margins above 10%. So it would be 10% to 12%. So that is what we are focused on as the long-term goal. We are certainly very pleased with the progress and the trend, particularly given the external forces that we are faced with right now, but we are focused on a long-term goal of 10% to 12% EBITDA margin.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will go now to Brandon Ferro with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brandon Ferro - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning, everybody.
Chip McClure: Good morning, Brandon.
Brandon Ferro - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Can you give us a sense of what your largest non-steel commodity buys are, maybe which ones are more or less minimal to index pass-through and maybe a total dollar exposure?
Jay Craig: Certainly one of the largest ones would be fuel, which we talked about in transportation cost, and we are tracking that as well very closely and our discussions with customers include changes in that cost as well. Other ones would be aluminum and copper on the LVS side, but there are much smaller risks, but primarily it is deal. I mean, if we look at the largest single component of our products, that is the main area and it is the main component and is the main area of focus for us on the recovery discussion.
Chip McClure: I should mention Brandon, the second point. Some of those do have indexes in place and I think we talked earlier about the fact that on the fuel side, we are indeed having discussions with customers on that as we speak.
Brandon Ferro - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Also on Performance Plus, Wave 2, relative to the first Wave, can you remind us what the restructuring, non-restructuring is of that 75 million, meaning more or less cash spend on the second Wave versus the first?
Chip McClure: I think we expect it to be relatively consistent, although for this year our estimate of restructuring is lower than our initial estimate was. Certainly we will be looking closely as we come off the 2009 peak. We may have some capacity rationalization here in North America. We will be updating that as we get further into the Wave 2 program.
Brandon Ferro - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Concerning Western Europe, some of your CVS facilities, can you give us a sense of maybe where utilization levels might stand now and where you see that coming down to potentially as volumes come down?
Chip McClure: Well, first of all, as Jay had mentioned, even with some softening we are seeing in Western Europe, these are existing facilities we have. As we have mentioned in some previous earnings calls, within these existing facilities, the first thing we did was put in as part of our ArvinMeritor Production System additional lien activities which actually indicated significant improvement in throughput on the existing equipment. So that was phase 1. Phase 2 is we have in constant with our customers made some capital commitments to put additional capacity in place which is beginning to come on line in the second half of this year and those within existing facilities. So those two things are taking place right now. As Jay had indicated, even with the, you know, if there is softening for the second half of this year, which we do envision, which still shows the year-over-year increase, and with 3% softening next year year-over-year, we still feel that the capacity that we have either had in place and made more efficient or the additional capacity we put in place, we do look to that being fully utilized going forward.
Brandon Ferro - KeyBanc Capital Markets: We have reached the top of the hour so we are going to have to end the call now. I would like to thank everybody for their participation.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude ArvinMeritor's third quarter fiscal year 2008 Earnings Call. We thank you all for your participation today. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Second Quarter ArvinMeritor, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call Mr. Terry Huch, Director Investor Relations.
Terry Huch: Good morning everyone and welcome to the ArvinMeritor Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Call. On the call today we have Chip McClure our Chairman, CEO and President, Jim Donlon our CFO and Jay Craig our Controller. The slides accompanying today’s call are available at www.ArvinMeritor.com we will refer to the slides in our discussion this morning. The content of this conference call which we are recording is the property of ArvinMeritor, Inc. It is protected by US international copyright law and may not be rebroadcast without the express written consent of ArvinMeritor. We consider your continued participation to be your consent to our recording. Our discussion may contain forward looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Let me refer you to slide two for a more complete disclosure of the risks that could affect our results. To the extent we refer to any non-GAAP measures in our call, you will find the reconciliation to GAAP in the slides on our website. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Chip.
Chip McClure: Good morning everyone. Before I go through the second quarter highlights I’d like to express my appreciation for what our team has achieved. Despite a slower than expected truck market, volume declines in the North American light vehicle segment and near recession level economic performance in North America we delivered strong results this quarter. We are pleased to report that we improved our net income, EBITDA, our free cash flow, and our earnings per share. These improvements are direct results of a cost reduction and growth initiatives we’ve been implementing as part of our performance plus program which includes lean improvements in our global manufacturing operations. We’re confident that these actions have helped us build a strong foundation from which to build our future business and increase earnings potential. Now let’s turn to slide three. I’d like to take a few moments to review some of the highlights of our second quarter performance. We earned $0.37 per share from continuing operations before special items, up $0.20 compared to last year’s $0.17. We reported sales of $1.8 billion up 9% or $154 million compared to a year ago primarily due to foreign currency exchange rates. We achieved free cash flow of $134 million from operations net of capital expenditures for the second quarter. This compares to an outflow of $71 million in the same period of last year. Our cash flow has been and in the near term will continue to be affected by increased working capital requirements driven by higher sales volumes in Europe, Asia/Pacific, and South America. We believe, however that our strategic direction, diversified customer base, and global footprint should help us to weather some of these short term challenges. At the same time we will maintain our focus on five strategies and long term growth initiatives. We improved our CVS margins by 1.5 percentage points in this quarter compared to a year ago. This increase reflects improvements in pricing, higher sales in our specialty business, higher truck sales in Europe and South America and through cost reductions associated with our performance plus program. We’ve also made progress in the growth of our profitable Commercial Vehicle Aftermarket business.  In this quarter we’re proud of the new long term multi-million dollar supply agreement we received to provide remanufactured transmissions and axle carriers to Navistar Parts. These actions are part of our ongoing strategy to grow this profitable market segment. Global market expansion is also part of our Commercial Vehicle Aftermarket growth strategy. In Europe we’ve grown our year over year sales by nearly 20%. We expect to accelerate that growth while our expansion is essential in Eastern Europe while we are launching a new facility in Russia. Let’s turn to slide four. In our second quarter we entered into a multi-year agreement with Tata Consultancy Service in India to enhance our LVS engineering capabilities including product development and support for our Light Vehicle product lines in Asia/Pacific. We announced that we reentered the off-highway business in North America, South America, Europe and Africa. As we reenter this profitable and growing market segment we bring 100 year reputation for building high quality reliable products. We intend to be a leading player on this world stage. We’re currently well positioned in the off-highway business in Asia and are continuing to take advantage of the huge opportunities in that region. We’re benefiting from the booming off-highway business in China as that country continues to build roads and infrastructure. In China our off-highway sales are up approximately 63% year over year. Also in China our sales for the Bus and Coach segment have nearly doubled. We also continue to gain new business in the United States on the military side. Since January of this year we were awarded new supply contracts for nearly 2,200 MRAP vehicles. We have nearly 60% of all the MRAP vehicle businesses awarded to date. Our light vehicle business group has been awarded new business with an Asian manufacturer to supply more than two million window regulator motors. This next generation motor will be manufactured in ArvinMeritor’s facility located in Shanghai, China. We also recently announced two new door latch design program for the growing Chinese and Asian markets. The new Asian latch products are specifically customized for vehicle applications in that region. We’re continuing to restructure our global footprint. We’re in the process of constructing three new manufacturing facilities in the Asia/Pacific market where we already have a strong foothold to support the expected growth in that region. We recently started building two new plans in China and we’re launching a new manufacturing facility in Puna India to produce light vehicle body systems products. We’ve begun production on LVS doors facility in Salonta, Romania to supply components directly to Romanian OE customer Dacia as well as for export to Western European customers. Let’s move on to slide five to review our 2008 outlook. We’re pleased to reconfirm our guidance of $1.40 to $1.60 for fiscal year 2008 earnings per share before special items. Our Performance Plus cost reductions of $75 million per year are on track for 2008 and 2009. I’ll cover the progress we’re making with this important initiative in just a few minutes. We’ve raised our sales forecast to a range of $7.1 to $7.3 billion primarily due to currency exchange rates and continued growth outside the US. Although our cash flow performance in the first six months was negative $171 million we’re improving and expect to report cash flow for fiscal year 2008 of negative $75 to $125 million. This negative cash flow reflects increased investment in certain regions primarily to grow our business in emerging markets and to address overall capacity constraints impacting some of our CVS businesses. You’ve all seen the tremendous lineup in steel prices as well as increases in other commodity prices in the marketplace. This is a major concern for us and our entire global management team is working aggressively to mitigate the impact to our company. Our guidance completely comprehends the pricing environment that we’re in. That’s not to say that we are accepting every proposed price increase from our suppliers. We strongly resist increases that break our contracts and we fully intend to recover remaining increases from our customers. There are other risks on the horizon. Ongoing volatility in other commodities, and risks to both heavy truck and light vehicle production volumes. We believe our forecast is conservative enough to allow us to offset known risks. Let’s turn to slide six. As promised, we expect our Performance Plus program will achieve a savings of $75 million in the 2008 fiscal year even after the impact of steel price increases and down market in North America. Thirty Two million dollars worth of additional ideas were implemented in this quarter bringing the run rate of actions we’ve executed to $90 million per year. In this quarter we saved $18 million which is on track with our ramp up plan for the calendar year. We’re still on our December implementation path for gross savings which helps us offset some of the risks I talked about earlier. Now to slide seven. We can attribute a portion of our overall Commercial Vehicle margin improvements to a resolution of some capacity and through put issues that we faced our European Truck and Trailer businesses. We dramatically improved our productivity during the second half of 2007 and we’ve been able to continue this momentum over the last quarter. As you can see from this chart on the Truck side we’re able to achieve continued productivity improvements. On the Trailer side we also maintained strong productivity improvements compared to earlier in the year. We were impacted by material shortages in January but regained our momentum in February. Let’s take a look at slide eight. In addition to our Asia/Pacific strategy we’re experiencing strong growth in the South American market. Industry production of Commercial Trucks in South America was up 25% compared to last year. In the second quarter our company enjoyed a 39% growth rate for LVS and an astounding 108% growth rate for our CVS business group in that market. We’ve seen the South American Truck segment grow in the past five years from $120 million in ’03 to $750 million in ’08 with more than half of that growth coming from our wholly owned Truck operation. On a constant currency basis that’s a 200% increase in five years and this is with very good profit margins. We’re the leading supplier of wheels in the region through the Fumagalli brand and we have contracts to provide the majority of the drive axles to four of the top six heavy truck manufacturers. Again, we experienced strong profit margins in this market. Now I’d like to turn the call over to our Controller, Jay Craig. He’ll walk you through the results for the quarter and then Jim Donlon will review the outlook for the future.
Jay Craig: We’re going to start by review our income statement on slide nine. We had a good quarter, a 9% higher sales which Chip told you were due to stronger currency outside the US. We had a 61% increase in operating income. This reflects a good execution in our operations and mounting cost reductions. It also reflected improved business mix with strong growth in some of our best performing business units, particularly in our specialty products and in South America across all segments. SG&A was higher on an absolute basis but like our sales it was also inflated somewhat by currency exchange. As a percent of revenue it was about flat to last year at 6% but much better than two quarters ago when we were at 7%. Equity in Earnings of Affiliates has been a growing contributor to our bottom line over the last several years. We continue to see substantial profit growth in our unconsolidated subsidiaries outside the US.  Like our other Truck operations in North America our large unconsolidated JV in the US is suffering from the continuing down turn here which brought down our affiliate income compared to last year. Interest expense was $8 million lower than a year ago reflecting lower debt balances and lower average interest rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was 34% which is higher than our normalized rate at this point in the cycle largely because of a discrete tax item. We continue to expect some meaningfully positive discrete tax items in the second half of the fiscal year. Income from continuing operations before special items was $27 million more than double last year’s results. The only special item was a $3 million restructuring charge in LVS for footprint actions under our Performance Plus Program. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.37 for the quarter which keeps us solidly on the path to hit our guidance for the year. Slide 10 reviews our segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA for CVS was $84 million up $25 million or 42% from the second quarter of 2007. This is a strong performance especially when you consider that production volumes in North America Class 8 were down more than 30% on a year over year basis. EBITDA margins in CVS were up 1.5 percentage points from last year which I will explain in more detail on the next slide. LVS EBITDA was lower by $6 million which I will also review in detail. Total Corporate EBITDA was $104 million or 5.8% of sales.  On slide 11 you can see the factors that contributed to the margin improvement in CVS. As you know we’re in the middle of a down turn in the Class 5 through 8 truck market that we originally thought would end six months ago. It’s not over yet but conditions during this last quarter improved slightly. Class 8 production in the quarter was 14% higher than it had been in any of the preceding three quarters are our forecast calls for it to continue to build gradually from here. Compared to the second quarter of 2007 production volumes were down significantly which cost us about 1.8 percentage points of EBITDA margins but production volumes in other regions were up just as significantly which contributed 2.1 percentage points to the margin improvement. We have included quarterly truck production forecasts for North America and Europe in the appendix. For South America the growth Chip talked about translated to a 1.1 percentage point increase in margins for CVS globally. You can see that our operations there are big enough and profitable enough to make major contributions. Specialty volumes were also much higher. The two most significant growth areas for us were military vehicles in the US and off-highway equipment in China. I think a lot of people think of sales volumes as the biggest negative factor for our CVS operations right now but if you add up the first four rows on the chart it starts to look like the biggest positive factor. We are really looking forward to a time when the North American down turn ends and we have one more cylinder firing in the engine. On the next row we have shown the margin improvement attributable to Performance Plus and other cost reductions. These efforts have been very successful this year and we expect the benefits to continue to build in future quarters. We need them to continue to build in order to help us through some recovery lags as raw material prices continue to escalate. Jim will talk about this in some detail in a few minutes. On this slide we have shown the gross increases we’ve experienced in steel prices, energy costs, and other commodity prices compared to last year. Some of these are offset by pass through arrangements and other pricing included in the row labeled other. The key message is that we are already feeling some of the pressure of raw material economics and we expect this to become a more challenging headwind going forward. The last thing I’ll point out on this chart is that a year ago quarter benefited from emissions technology absorbing some of our corporate overhead. This year the remaining two business units have had to absorb the remaining portion of that, that we have not been able to eliminate. LVS margins were down year over year as I mentioned earlier. The next slide walks through LVS margins from last year. The key message here is that LVS is making some good progress in its face business but it is being masked by industry headwinds and non-recurring items. We included this slide in the appendix that shows what LVS EBITDA would look like without some of the major non-recurring items. On a comparable basis to last year EBITDA would be up meaningfully even in the disappointing volume environment. Slide 12 shows the lower industry production in North America reduced margins by 50 basis points in LVS. For us, very little of this reduction related to the American Axle strike because we have a minimal amount of content on the vehicles that have been affected. Other volume in mix included industry growth in South America and continuing share gains in Asia. We have announced a number of new business awards we have won in Asia that will start contributing to the bottom line at various times over the next two years. Performance Plus and other cost reduction efforts also have been extremely successful in LVS. This improved margins by 1.2 percentage points compared to last year. The LVS team has been particularly successful in both lean manufacturing and consolidating and staff functions. Although LVS doesn’t consume as much fuel as CVS you can see that it has also been hit by higher input costs. Contractual pass through mechanisms are not as robust for LVS so we have to fight for all the pricing offsets we can get. In addition to steel and energy LVS is also feeling pressure on aluminum and copper prices. Last quarter we told you about a legal and commercial dispute LVS was involved in with a customer. There has been no change in that situation over the last quarter but we did settle an ongoing dispute we had with a supplier. In that case the amount of settlement was about $2 million. Lastly the entire period benefited from ET absorption of central overhead as well as from one time price adjustments. I’d like to cover one more thing before I hand it off to Jim and that is the cash flow picture which is on slide 13. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $134 million compared to an outflow of $71 million last year. $82 million of that related to an increase in non-recourse sale of receivables which has been a key lever for us as our receivable base has grown especially in Europe. Even without the growth in securitization our cash flow was $52 million compared to a negative $88 million last year. As the press release mentioned this included the $28 million benefit from terminating certain interest rate swap arrangements but did not include the final working capital true up related to the sale of BG which also was $28 million. At this point I’d like to hand it over to Jim.
Jim Donlon: The second quarter was a very good one for ArvinMeritor. To keep that momentum going we’re going to have to overcome the serious headwinds in raw material prices that both Chip and Jay have referred to. Slide 14 shows a picture that I know you are very familiar with. Back at the beginning of 2004 the industry faced a two year period of higher steel prices. They didn’t continue on that pace forever but they settled into a range that was much higher than it had been in the past. ArvinMeritor and many of our peers were poorly prepared for increases of that magnitude. We had fixed price steel contracts which protected us for a time but we didn’t have adequate pass through mechanisms. We’re now in a period of even more rapid escalation. We don’t know how long this phase will continue but we know that the index is going higher than the March data point that you see referenced on this chart. Steel makers have since notified customers of their intent to implement a surcharge on top of existing contractual prices. That’s not something we’re going to take lying down. We have some hard discussions coming up with both the suppliers and the customers. We’ve worked hard to get this company to the point that it’s at today and we intend to continue to improve our situation. We will sit down with the steel suppliers and assert our contractual position. We’ll make counter proposals on both pricing and timing and we’ll explore other supply avenues that may be available to us. Then we’ll work with the customers where we do not currently have satisfactory arrangements. Even where we do have indexing arrangements we may need to address extraordinary surcharges we face. We also may need to address time lags between when we see price increases and when contractual indexing starts to reimburse us for them. The bottom line is that we cannot and we will not be the ones to bear the increases. One of our customers last week said that they have an obligation to pass these costs along to the end customer. We have that same obligation. None the less we will look to offset profit hits from remaining timing differences with incremental cost reductions. As Chip touched on earlier Performance Plus may be in a position to deliver some help in these cases.  The next slide, slide 15 provides more detail on our guidance for 2008. We’ve taken our sales guidance up by $200 million to a range of $7.1 to 7.3 billion. Stronger currencies and growth outside the US account for most of this change. We’ve also raised EBITDA guidance by $5 million largely reflecting the same favorable exchange. Our interest expense guidance has come down by $5 million because of lower debt balances and interest rates. Our guidance for pre-tax income is up by $10 million compared to our previous guidance. Unfortunately our tax rate is going to be a little higher than previously expected. We had told you to expect some favorable discrete tax items in the second half of the year and we still expect those to come home but it now appears that some of that benefit will be allocated to the discontinued operations. We’ve maintained our free cash flow guidance of negative $75 to $125 million, our strong performance this quarter means that we have another $50 to $100 million of positive cash flow to go to achieve that guidance level. We’re achieving success in accomplishing the goals of our Performance Plus restructuring with lower cash requirements.  We’ve already discussed many of the planning assumptions listed on slide 16 so I will just take a moment to hit the main points. External forecast for 2008 GDP growth in the US and Europe have come down fractionally since our last update on March 18th. The external source we typically use to forecast light vehicle industry sales has been holding steady but we’ve made our own assessment and concluded that they are likely to be lower in the US. As a result we’re dropping this indicator from 15.5 million to 15.2 million units for the calendar year. The Europe assumption continues to be at risk but signs have been mixed between the slow down in Western Europe and continued expansion in Central and Eastern Europe. We’re holding the forecast at 17.1 million units for now. We’re also holding our Class 8 truck production forecast for North America at 220,000 to 240,000 units but we acknowledge that the points in the lower half of the range look somewhat more probable than the points in the upper half. We’ll keep an eye on that over the upcoming next couple of months. In Europe medium and heavy duty truck production continues to be very strong. We raised our forecast last month and we’re raising it again now. With the strong order books the OEMs have the industry is more constrained by supply this year than by demand. Some of the constraints we thought might be imposed by other suppliers or the OEMs themselves have been mitigated. The best news of all is that our operating performance has improved to the point where a little more volume can be a good thing. We’ve talked about steel prices at length; obviously they deserve a bright red rating right now. We’ve also talked about incremental military vehicle business we were awarded in the quarter. Most of this production will take place in 2008 but any further awards will probably land into our 2009 fiscal year. Lastly, we’ve raised our forecast for light vehicle production in South America by more than 5%. Our outlook for Commercial Truck production in South America which is up 25% over the first six months has also improved. Now I’d like to turn it back to Chip for his summary.
Chip McClure: How let’s turn to slide 17. It’s clear that our number one priority for the remainder of 2008 and going to 2009 is to focus on addressing the steel issues as well as monitoring other highly volatile commodity markets. As I said earlier our customers and suppliers will have to be part of the solution. To summarize today’s call I’d like to emphasize the significance of our performance this quarter. Despite headwinds to the Truck and light vehicle North American volumes we clearly out performed the industry as well as many of our competitors. Proving that the aggressive steps we’ve taken including restructuring actions, lean manufacturing improvements, significant cost reductions, and profitable growth initiatives have had a positive impact on our bottom line. Again, that’s why I’m confident in reconfirming our guidance of $1.40 to $1.60 for our fiscal year. That’s why we’re able to significantly improve our CVS margins in this quarter even though the heavy truck market in North America is down more than 30%. That’s why when we strip away non-recurring items the underlying financial results for our LVS business segment also improved in the first half compared to the prior year despite lower light vehicle volumes in North America. Now let’s take some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Lehman Brothers.
Brian Johnson – Lehman Brothers: Turning back to page 11 and 12 can you give us a sense of how currency has influenced the LVS and CVS margin development? If you were to take another cut at it and just look at the currency impact taking Euro denominated EBITDA over into the US how much of the improvement is due to that?
Chip McClure: I’ll turn it over to Jay in a moment to give you the details but obviously as we look at the currency impact, Euro is a big one but as you know we’ve got a lot of business in Asia and South America we’re also seeing a different currency impact that way too. Let me turn it over to Jay to talk about it in more detail.
Jay Craig: We’ve isolated the impact of the currency for the quarter, the strengthening of the foreign currency for the quarter we estimated to be relatively insignificant between $5 and $7 million impact on our second fiscal quarter.
Brian Johnson – Lehman Brothers: On the EBITDA line?
Jay Craig:  On the EBITDA line.
Brian Johnson – Lehman Brothers: The second thing is also on CVS margins. This is the first quarter, last quarter you talked about the non-re-occurrence of production issues in OE. Does this mean, it may not have just been in the quarter before, but when you look at this and you look at the operational metrics in the factories are you comfortable now you can flex up and down cost efficiently in Europe?
Chip McClure: As you know we had a real focus on lean manufacturing so I feel much better about the performance of our plants on that side but as we also indicated there was capital investment we need to do that’s going to be really coming in the second half of the year. As we look at the first phase as far as lean improvements within the existing capacity primarily our plants and current suppliers, yes I feel comfortable with that. As we indicated a lot of the capital investment we’ll really start seeing that come online the second half of this year.
Brian Johnson – Lehman Brothers: Final question, can you quantify your steel buy in terms of tonnage or dollar volume and of that how much is contractually passed through versus negotiated?
Chip McClure: Obviously our steel, it’s hundreds of thousands of tons and both on the direct and the indirect side. As I indicated we’re going through that line item by line item with our suppliers and also our customers as to contractual obligations and what we look at with steel.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Carlson of Banc of America.
Doug Carlson - Banc of America: I guess on the CVS margins you gave us an update on slide 11 with the specialty production volume could you give me a little more color on that?
Chip McClure: As we look at that, as we mentioned probably the biggest ramp up in that has been on the military side with the MRAP vehicles and we mentioned in our comments and Jim’s slide that talked about that we continue to see that and since the first of the year there’s been 2,200 additional MRAP orders and we continue to have a strong position on that. As I look going forward into the future we’re really seeing some real opportunities in the off-highway business. We’ve had a very strong position in off-highway in China which is reflected in the current numbers. As I look at it going forward future growth opportunities in North America, Europe, South America and Africa.
Doug Carlson - Banc of America: The European OE production volume looks like it helped by 1% so it the capacity of right sizing or the improvement in your capacity there, how much are we finished with fixing that? Are we half way done, 75% done, it looks like there’s been a lot of improvement there?
Chip McClure: As we said, a lot of that has been done as far as the internal improvement in the existing capacity we have and I feel good about the progress there and we indicated before really do see additional CapEx that’s been invested in that capacity coming on as a result of that capital investment coming on the second half of the year.
Doug Carlson - Banc of America: Last question, on the working capital side and the cash flow side some of the vendors that had difficulty in the market a quarter or so ago that hurt the working capital it looks like that’s stopped. Right now is the list of vendors that you had that had issues is that calmed down or is that still a problem?
Jim Donlon: It has somewhat and also I think as we’ve mentioned previously we had formed a troubled supplier group here which has been addressing those suppliers very proactively and aggressively. As far as the constant on a quarter over quarter basis so we’ve tried to again remain supportive of our suppliers in that regard this quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Nesvold of Bear Stearns.
Peter Nesvold – Bear Stearns: As I look at the first two quarters of the year you’ve been able to upside expectations even as you’ve had to cut Class 8 forecast North America Trail or North America Light Duty Automotive as there’s been some, I don’t want to say cushion but there’s been upside to other parts of the model. As you progress through this year how much cushion would you say is left in the business plan so that if things like steel economics really do run away from us or if you have to cut that Class 8 outlook from 230 down to maybe 220 that there’s a more immediate hit to the EPS range of $1.40 to $1.60?
Chip McClure: There’s no question when you look at it that the headwinds we faced are really several with the steel and the continued uncertainty in the volume really both on a commercial vehicle and the light vehicle side here in North America. I think on the other side when we look at the model and I think it’s really starting to pay off for us as far as having a diversified product portfolio also a global footprint and then I think thirdly would be our Performance Plus results we’re starting to get in that.  When I look at those three items I think they’re really helping to offset that and as I said we’re starting to, last couple quarters we’ve seen that kind of performance and not ignoring the headwinds if we talked about feel that those having a diversified global product portfolio and the continued focus on Performance Plus. We’ve got the tools in place to address that going forward.
Peter Nesvold – Bear Stearns: As a follow up on the aftermarket it seems like historically that’s been a pretty good barometer of what’s going on in terms of freight volumes. It seemed like freight exited ’07 very strong but is taking a bit of a step back here in calendar first quarter. What’s your aftermarket business telling you, are you still seeing accelerating improvement there, has it leveled off, is it starting to decline from how we exited last year, seasonally adjusted?
Chip McClure: As a matter of fact, what I may do is have Jay talk about that in a little bit more detail because its part of the Performance Plus and he’s been working with that more closely. In a very general sense as you look at it there’s no question the last couple months there’s been some uncertainty as you look at the Class 8 orders and the tonnage but let me let Jay talk in details as it relates to the aftermarket business here in North America.
Jay Craig: I think what we’ve seen is really different by region in North America certainly with some of the softening and Truck, ton and miles. We have seen some of the volumes in our aftermarket business it be under pressure in North America but because of some of our product extensions and our new products entries and obviously our acquisition of Mascot we decided to believe that we are increasing our market share. It’s a different story in Europe and South America where our gross strategies are being executed and we continue to see double digit growth in both of those regions that are more than offsetting some of the pressures that we’re seeing in North America.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc Capital Markets: I know we keep talking about the steel issue, can you possibly give us a sense of, as you look at the Commercial Vehicle segment, as you look at the Light Vehicle segment, can you talk about the specific segments where you think that you have the most exposure to rising steel prices? Secondly where you have the most risk of not being able to recover those steel prices?
Chip McClure: What I may do on that one is turn it over to Jim to talk a little bit more on both as you refer to it the supply side and also the customer side in both markets the CVS and LVS side.
Jim Donlon: Generally on the CVS side we have put in place a better position for recovery with our customers and pass through with our customers so that segment of the business a better recovery pattern. On the LVS side it varies quite a bit by customer. Some of the customers have worked with us very closely and we have some good arrangements in place but unfortunately there are some that we have a lot of work to do on the LVS side to get to the recovery that is appropriate for this kind of a situation that we’re in right now. I would say a more difficult situation on the LVS side to working but we are committed and we will work our way through it. There is no way that these increases can find there way into ArvinMeritor’s results and so we’ve got a lot of work to do and we will but that is the segment that is the more difficult. Within LVS our wheels business is in a good cost position so when we talk to our customers there because of the good cost position of our wheels business we are able to work toward the full recovery on the wheels business. That leaves us with the chassis business which is also a very difficult area and that one we’ve got a lot of tough conversations coming up with a few customers that are not yet in the recovery category.
Brett Hoselton – KeyBanc Capital Markets: In the past you’ve talked about the possibility or your desire to pursue an OPEB or Goodyear style VIBA deal or something along those lines. Is that something that’s still of interest to you and is that something that’s still a possibility at some point in time in the future and if so when?
Jim Donlon: We have been working on that and from our side we would be interested in some arrangement like that. We’ve had some early discussions about that and because our situation, our financial position, our forward outlook, our amount that we have related to the VIBA are different from what the UAW has worked with up to now with other companies. Our discussions have been at a slower pace while they are continuing to evaluate from their side just where we fit on their priority list of wanting to get a project like this done. From our side we’re interested, the UAW is evaluating it from many different angles and at this point they’re busy trying to get the big ones done that they’ve worked on with the main big three. We’re a little bit farther down on the priority list right now. We’d like to work with them whenever it would come up. We cannot be sure that it will ever come to fruition but your question was where are we about that and we are excited and would like to do something.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris McCray of BlackRock.
Chris McCray – BlackRock: I wonder if you could give us some perspective on how much of your business in terms of pricing for raw materials is indexed today and what it might have looked like in that ’03, ’04 spike by comparison then I have a follow up related?
Chip McClure: If you go back to the ’03, ’04 time frame obviously we’ve learned a lot from that. I don’t know that we really break it out as to how much is or is not indexed. Clearly there’s been a lot more of that discussion on that. I think its save to say that as you look at the—from a customer perspective a clear recognition from the customer perspective that steel is a real issue. There’s a lot more discussion on that. As you look at that from the experience, if you will, back in the ’03, ‘04 time frame the fact that we’ve been able from a lessons learned perspective put that in place recovery clearly this time are much better so we feel better about that.  I think Jim has kind of laid that out as it looks to the difference between the CVS and LVS side. If I go back to the ’03, ’04 time frame it was probably less than 50% and today it’s in excess of 70%. As you look at that I think that its moving in the right direction but as Jim has indicated and we can’t ignore some of the dynamics that have taken place in the steel industry today that are causing some of these spikes literally in the very recent past that we need to address those. Even with the indexing that we have in place or contractual things we’ve had to have ongoing discussions with customers on a go forward basis that way.
Chris McCray – BlackRock: You mentioned some suppliers actually trying to push pricing even in contract business. Can you give me some perspective on this? In this industry historically have contracts held or are they only as good as the environment. I don’t have the perspective that you would have there. Can you fill that in a little bit?
Jim Donlon: Up to now for the most part contracts have been honored. There are mechanisms in the form of surcharges which has been added from time to time which created some variability based on mostly alloy prices and so forth that were adjusting. Those were understood and a part of the contractual arrangement. What is now troubling is a major steel company indicating that a new surcharge will be added even over and above all of the existing contractual arrangements.  That’s a troubling development that we’re having to deal with and at this point we don’t know for sure what the final outcome is going to be on that. It’s hitting right at this point in time and we’ll have to see how events unfold not only for us but for all of the big three for all of the other supply industry it’s going to reverberate through the whole industry.
Chip McClure: As we indicated in our comments we are still continuing to work both on the supply side and the customer side. Even with the ones we do have with contractual indexes there are still lags that we need to work on there. Obviously continue to work on all facets and all phases of it both on the customer side and the supplier side.
Jim Donlon: We consider these that we’re facing now to be of an extraordinary nature really kind of outside of any normal mechanisms that have been put in place up to this point in time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Steinmetz of Morgan Stanley.
Jonathan Steinmetz – Morgan Stanley: I want to push a little further on the steel issue here. I know you said you don’t want to see it in your own P&L but I think everybody in the whole food chain feels that way. I’m trying to understand within your guidance what sort of year on year margin hit do you have at this point from the steel hit and maybe if you could talk about what you could foresee on that as sort of a bull case scenario so to speak and a bear case scenario if things get really tough on that in terms of getting recovery?
Jim Donlon: In our guidance we had what I would call the normal up and down that we were seeing in the market for various surcharges and alloy changes and what have you. Throughout the year there’s been month to month up and downs and then the recovery of that going on to our customers with various indexing arrangements. That’s in the guidance. What has been contemplated for our current guidance that we’re giving you is that all of these extraordinary ones that are coming through at this point in time will pass through the food chain us being one of the elements of the food chain will pass through us to the customers and it will not affect our bottom line. We’ve got a lot of work to do to accomplish that but that’s what’s a part of our guidance.
Jonathan Steinmetz – Morgan Stanley: If we watch through and it’s difficult to get recovery then I guess it would be difficult for your guidance to hold?
Jim Donlon: Yes.
Jonathan Steinmetz – Morgan Stanley: Numerically it looks like in the first quarter this was about $17 million or so if I do the LVS and CVS margin hit right from steel and I guess you have other raw materials in there I don’t know how much those were. I’m still trying to understand you have to have some assumption within the guidance that you are giving as to what that margin hit looks like for the full year, if you are able to get these recoveries. I don’t know if you are able to share with us what that margin number would be.
Jim Donlon: What I would say to you is that that number that you calculated there is what has been there for the steel and the raw material and kind of like the gross increases as their coming at us and as Jay indicated in his comments down in the other line are our various recovery mechanisms that we have so that the net affect to us is not as severe as the number that you just calculated there. We’ve got the gross number and then a recovery so that the net is not as high as $17 million.  We are working to mitigate this going forward and we are committed to making sure that it does not affect our guidance that we’ve given you for the full year. We have, as Chip said on an earlier question some amount of cushion for us to work on just slightly so that we can achieve our full year guidance even as we face these headwinds.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Sarah Thompson of Lehman Brothers.
Sarah Thompson – Lehman Brothers: On your free cash flow of negative $75 to $125 what are you assuming your borrowing on your off balance sheet AR?
Chip McClure: We could barely hear you I think the question you’re asking is our assumption on the free cash flow for the balance of the year?
Sarah Thompson – Lehman Brothers: How much are you assuming is borrowed under the off balance sheet AR?
Chip McClure: As we look at it for the balance of the year we’re looking at the assumption is it will be flat.
Sarah Thompson – Lehman Brothers: One other question, on your EBITDA the number that you gave in the press release is slightly lower than what’s on the slides about $5 million. Is that just the difference for FX?
Chip McClure: I think that’s a fair assumption. That’s what Jim had mentioned in his comments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault of Goldman Sachs.
Pat Archambault – Goldman Sachs: On slide 11 on the European margin improvement can you give us a sense how much of that is due to the price renegotiations that you did with some of your customers there which kind of hit right away, and how much of that is due to improved efficiencies and through put the capacity additions. Based on that how much more could that go up in terms of a tail wind as you get more and more through put benefits in the remainder of the year?
Chip McClure: Actually when you look at it I think it’s safe to say it’s really a combination of the two as you kind of indicated. I don’t know that we break it out between the two that way. I think it’s fairly representative of what we look at on a go forward basis. As we indicated in Europe I think the next step is when you see the additional capacity coming in, in the second half of this year with the incremental investment that we’ve made going forward.  I think that will be the next step on that. I think what you’re seeing in there now is fairly reflective of what we’d envisioned going forward both between what we’ve been able to negotiate as far as Commercial terms with our customers and the productivity improvement within the plants.
Pat Archambault – Goldman Sachs: To be clear on that, there should be an incremental benefit from the capacity additions on top of this year?
Chip McClure: We talked about capacity addition what that will do right now the Commercial Vehicle markets in Europe continue to remain very strong because of the continued expansion in Central and Eastern Europe so the result is there is still some premium costs that result from that so with this capacity that puts in place I think you’ll see some elimination of that premium cost whether its from a freight over time etcetera in the future will be the improve we’ll see when that capacity comes online.
Pat Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Have those additions already been made?
Chip McClure: The investment has been made but some of these are long term investments so don’t anticipate to see the benefit of those investments until the second half of this year.
Jim Donlon: The new equipment for the most part is committed and purchased and on the way but not yet installed and operational at the factories.
Pat Archambault – Goldman Sachs: Finally, a longer term question. Can you update us a little bit on your thoughts on the SCR debate for the Class 8 regulations in 2010 how you guys see that playing out, how you see that impacting potentially the market shares of some of your large customers as you clearly now there’s a couple that have stated that they’re not going to use SCR at least for the time being and there’s a few that are. I just wanted to get your overall thoughts on how that landscape is shaping up?
Chip McClure: If you take a step back of that I really get to this whole question what we envision as you get into the ’09 and subsequent 2010 with the next emissions regulation. Within the SCR it’s really going to depend on the customers. As we look at it both from a cost perspective and new technology perspective and as you’ve indicated rightfully so that some of the producers of that equipment are able to do that with different technologies going forward. As we look at that I think that more recently there’s been indication that those emission targets can be hit with some producers with current technologies just being upgraded and obviously as we look at that I think that will change some of the dynamics as you look at the amount of pre-buy in 2009 and the subsequent drop off in 2010 I think what needs overlaid on that in addition the technology side is what’s happening in the economy right now because as Jay had indicated the softness in the Commercial Vehicle side has remained longer than had originally been anticipated because the economy. To answer your question I think that there’s going to be several different drivers that I think there’s still some question as to what the magnitude of the impact will be in 2010 but there’s no question as you look at the customer mix there are some customers out there that are early adopters of new technology those will still occur, those will still use the SCR. Some other ones will take a bit of a wait and see attitude and that’s kind of across the board with customers and obviously with the OEM.  We continue to watch that as do others and do tend to think as we’ve indicated that as you look out there we watch to see what the impact will be to that for a pre-buy in 2009 which was indicated may be muted a bit and then obviously what the drop off will be in 2010 going forward.

Chip McClure: Thank you Terry. And good morning everyone. Before we turn to the presentation, I want to take a minute to talk about the current environment and the conditions under which we are operating. As everyone knows, North American heavy duty Class 8 truck markets continue to be in the midst of a downturn. It’s a downturn we anticipated. However, conditions are being exacerbated by scheduling fluctuations by our customers. We are fully focused on managing the issues as prudently as we can and we are taking proactive measures to mitigate the impact from this after market. In times like these there are often issues that lie outside of our control and we are clearly feeling the effects of these. We are taking aggressive actions to manage the issues we can and focus on improving our operational and financial performance. As I will discuss in greater detail a bit later, while we are expecting some of the trends in the US to continue in to the second half of the year, we will move ahead with our global strategies and our Performance Plus program will help us offset any future impact. Now let's turn to slide 3, and review some of the highlights in the first quarter. As you read in this morning's news release, we earned $0.08 per share in the first quarter from continuing operation before special items. Our sales from continued operations were $1.7 billion, up $95 million year-over-year, despite a weekend history in a slowing US economy. We attribute this growth to a strong demand for our commercial vehicle and light vehicle products outside of the US, as well as currency exchange rates that favorably impacted our total revenue. As you know, we are focusing significant time and resources on our operation globally. These efforts, combined with our strengthened global management teams, will continue to help us buffer the weaknesses we are seeing in the US. Despite the Commercial Vehicle Class 8 volumes being down more than 50% in North America, we demonstrated stronger operating performance through a relentless focus on improving our manufacturing compatibilities, reducing material cost, and improving our pricing with many of our customers. The actions we have implemented, particularly in Europe, are gaining traction and driving improved EBITDA and margins. For example, the margins on our Commercial Vehicle business are moving in the right direction. CVS EBITDA margins increased to 6.6% from 6% a year ago. We are beginning to see the results of the aggressive and proven actions the CVS team has been executing, to the bottom line. We have also been successful in our strategy to grow the company in higher margin segments. We have three key opportunities in this area: First, to grow our commercial vehicle aftermarket business; second, to grow with Asian OEMs around the world; and third to grow our commercial vehicle specialty business. As we look to capitalize in these opportunities, we strengthened our CVA business this quarter by announcing the acquisition of Mascot Truck Parts, a major Canadian remanufacturer of transmissions, drive axle carriers, steering gears, and drivelines. This acquisition not only expands our customer base, logistic centers and distribution network across North America, but it also brings a strong brand name to our CVA portfolio of products. We have also been successful in our efforts to grow our CVA business globally. We are experiencing significant growth in Europe, increasing our year-over-year CVA sales by nearly 20%. And in the first quarter, our CVA business in South America was up 50%, compared to the first quarter of last year. As part of our commercial vehicle aftermarket growth strategy, we're announcing today that we will be expanding our presence in Eastern Europe by opening a CVA facility in Moscow this year. As I mentioned earlier, we are focused on our strategy to diversify our customer base, and grow our presence in Asia and with Asian OEMs. We continue to make progress in this area. Our Light Vehicle Systems business recently won new business awards with Hyundai, which I'll cover in more detail later on in the call. In addition to our strategic operations and growth initiative, we've taken a pro-active approach to managing our financial obligations. Over the last couple of years we have been focused on strengthening our balance sheet. We are addressing our pension and healthcare liabilities. We have retimed our debt terms, and have no significant maturities due until 2012. And we recently amended our company's senior secured credit facility, which offers us greater flexibility and access to increased liquidity. Most importantly, these actions strengthen our ability to withstand potential weaknesses in some of our global markets. Having sufficient liquidity and being ready for a wide variety of economic scenarios has been, and continues to be a high priority for this management team. Now let's turn to slide 4, to review our outlook for 2008: For the full year 2008, we anticipate earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.60 for special items. This guidance is unchanged from what we provided back on December 11 at our Analyst Day in New York. We are still on track to achieve the Performance Plus cost reductions we promised of $75 million this year. I'll cover this in more detail in a few minutes. To the continued strong growth on our LVS and CVS businesses, outside of the US and favorable foreign exchange moments, we have raised our global sales forecast to the range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. We benefited from strong heavy and medium duty truck and light vehicle volumes in Europe and South America, and we expect this trend to carry on in the near-term. As you can see, global growth has helped support ArvinMeritor, during a time when the industry in North America is facing significant challenges. Success in all markets around the world is also critical to our continued success as a company. With that in mind, we made a number of working capital investments to support our growth outside of North America. We also had to make additional investments to support the required growth of our suppliers. As a result, we have revised our full year 2008 cash flow guidance from slightly positive, to a negative $75 million to $125 million. Jim will cover this in more detail later on in the call. Now we turn to slide 5. In our last call, I covered some of the actions we have been taking to manage the heavy truck capacity issues we are experiencing in Europe. I am proud to report that the CVS team has stepped up to the challenge. The team has been unyielding in its efforts to turn the situation around and improve the financial performance from its operation. As I mentioned earlier, we are starting to see some traction from their hard work, and it is beginning to show in our CVS margins. We are extremely aggressive in our goal to improve our manufacturing capabilities around the world. Since manufacturing is one of our core competencies, it's critical that it would be become best-in-class. You can see by the positive movement in the green boxes on this slide that we have made tremendous progress on the actions we have been executing since December 11. While many challenges remain, we believe the steps we are taking will position us to manage the significant market changes in our industry. We have implemented new systems and processes to improve discipline across the organization. This action also helps enhance our ability to plan and forecast, thereby improving our readiness to manage capacity level. We have made significant progress with our aggressive efforts to drive lean manufacturing initiatives, part of what we call the ArvinMeritor Production System, through all of our plants. These efforts have already begun to improve productivity, drive higher efficiency, and improve our overall performance. As I mentioned earlier, we are investing the necessary capital in our operations. Our goal here is to support the growth, manage to higher capacity levels, and improve our capabilities outside of North America, as well as within North America, when the heavy truck market rebounds. We are also proud of the progress we have made to strengthen our global talent base. We are confident that we are now obtaining and developing the right people, resources and skill sets to deliver significant operational improvement and a solid return to our shareowners. We have experts focused on improving our operations, purchasing organization, supply chain management program, and manufacturing engineering capabilities. Our global ArvinMeritor team is trying to turn this ship around, and we are seeing the results of their efforts here at the bottom line. On slide 6, we highlighted the progress we are making in our Performance Plus initiatives. We have now completed our first fiscal quarter in year two of our Performance Plus transformations. Based on the actions we have implemented and the success we are seeing, we have greater confidence in our ability to achieve the $75 million in cost savings during this year, with the majority coming in the second half of 2008. This chart outlines how we're going to reach our goal. Performance Plus has aggressive internal targets of achieving $232 million in cost savings actions by the end of fiscal year 2008. By the end of the first quarter, the Performance Plus team has implemented actions that will save $58 million per year, going forward. In addition, in January we are scheduled to implement more than $20 million of additional annual savings represented by the white dot on this chart. Given the progress to-date in our current projections we believe that we can exceed the gross savings target of $115 million. This will allow us to compensate for known risks, customer pricing, and un-recovered raw material economy. Now let's turn to slide 7. I would like to take a moment to walk you through some of the highlights impacting our CVS margins in the first quarter of this year, versus the first quarter of last year. While our work isn't done we are pleased with the overall operating improvements we're seeing in our CVS business in Europe. The actions our CVS team implemented throughout the year contributed to improvement in EBITDA margins, achieving 6.6% in our first quarter, up from 6% from the same period last year. As you know, we are negatively impacted by the North American truck and trailer downturn. Class 8 alone was down about 50% in the quarter. This lowered our CVS margins by 3.5 percentage points. This was slightly offset by higher Class 5 - 8 production volumes in Europe, improving the CVS margins by 1.4 percentage points. We also made improvements to and resolved some of the supply and operational issues we were experiencing in Europe, and we are better managing the higher than anticipated capacity levels. These improvements increased our CVS EBITDA margins by 2.0 percentage points. As you can see on this slide the CVS margins also benefited from the Performance Plus and other cost savings initiatives we implemented throughout the year, including certain changes to several of our employee benefit policies. These initiatives increased EBITDA margins by 1.9 percentage points. Over time, we believe we will see continued margin improvements in our business, especially with the focus our team has on improving the operations, customer pricing, and terms. Based on our view of the industry, we believe the first half of the year is going to continue to be tough for the heavy truck market, especially in North America. We are forecasting an improving trend as we move forward into the rest of the year. Now, let's turn to slide 8, and walk through the EBITDA margins for our light vehicle business group, which has decreased from 3.1% in the first quarter of 2007 to 2.1 % in the first quarter of 2008. As many of you know, most of our LVS business is outside the US. This geographic diversity and customer mix will help us weather the storm in the North American market. Our LVS business benefited from strong performance in its global market. In the first quarter, sales in Europe were up 12% and up 35% in South America, compared to the first quarter of last year. This contributed 1.5 percentage points to its EBITDA margin. Performance Plus and other savings added 1.1 percentage points. These savings are primarily from improvement in material costs, remanufacturing initiatives and labor and burden improvements. Unfortunately, we needed to increase reserves associated with a legal and commercial issue with one of our customers, which reduced margins by 1.7 percentage points. LVS margins were negatively impacted by some other costs, such as restructuring. With the aggressive cost reduction and growth initiatives the LVS team is implementing, we believe we'll see improvements to the EBITDA margins by the end of the year. Let’s turn to slide 9. We're continuing to be successful on our strategy to grow in Asia and with Asian OEMs. We won three major awards from Hyundai in the last two months. Beginning in 2010, LVS will supply more than 4 million window regulator motors a year for several of Hyundai's future vehicles worldwide. And for the Hyundai Sonata, LVS recently won two new contracts, to supply an innovative plastic door module, which will replace the current steel version offering the customer a 25% rate reduction advantage and second, a next generation Hyundai global door latch. Both of these products will be manufactured in North America, with an expected annual volume of more than 700,000 units. Turning to slide 10, I'd like to take a minute to discuss how we are managing our business to best position the company to drive profitable and sustainable growth. We will continue to take aggressive actions to manage our expenses and invest in our core franchise. But I do not want anyone to underestimate that there are still issues affecting the business that lie outside of our control. We are focused on implementing strategies that will enable ArvinMeritor to come out of the downturn and a stronger position to grow. We have been preparing and are implementing several cost saving initiatives through our Performance Plus program. So, we will remain flexible and can make the necessary adjustments to our business as market conditions change. As part of our expense management program, we implemented a net higher increase, but we will continue to recruit talent for critical positions necessary to run our business. We put in place tighter control on discretionary spending. We are also accelerating the turnaround actions for challenged businesses, consolidating certain administrative and engineering functions to eliminate redundancies, reduce costs, continue to close and consolidate certain facilities, and consolidating our purchases efforts. We are negotiating towards new customer agreements that would allow us to share with our customers to more of the rising commodity costs we are seeing; working toward labor agreements to improve our competitiveness; delaying the timing and amount of annual manner of raises, based on the company's financial performance; and finally, addressing the structure of pensions and retiree healthcare. At the same time, we continue to invest prudently in the organic growth of our company. Over the past several months, we have announced four new plants in leading cost competitive countries including China, India, Romania and Mexico. We expanded our off-highway natural product offerings in China and India; growing South America to several significant businesses wins in Venezuela; launched and expanded technical and engineering centers in Asia; made capacity investments to support key customers in Europe; and invested in the growth of our Commercial Vehicle Aftermarket business. As you can see, we have a number of initiatives underway. We are also carefully monitoring what the economy is doing. We believe the actions we are taking, coupled with the experienced management team we have in place, will help us manage through the downturn. As everyone prepares for possible recession, we will continue to manage our business carefully. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Donlon: Thank you, Chip. Slide 11 shows our income statement for the first quarter before special items. For the first quarter, the only special item is restructuring. This quarter we recorded $10 million of expense for previously announced restructuring actions. You may also note that there were four non-recurring items in the quarter, which are shown on slide 18. But those amounts have been included in the result we are showing you today. As Chip said earlier, sales were up by $95 million. On a constant currency basis, sales were about flat, with lower sales in North America, offset by higher sales in Europe, Asia and South America. In the first quarter, 60% of our sales were outside of North America. When you look at gross margins, operating income or EBIT, conversion was better than the same quarter last year. As you saw in the margin walks that we took you through, the improvement in conversion was primarily due to Performance Plus cost reductions and smaller net reductions for non-recurring items than we experienced last year. SG&A cost were $92 million, last quarter SG&A was up about $40 million year-to-year, and we explained much of the increase related to Performance Plus cost that were offset in the cost of sales line, as well as cost to meet the exceptional demand we were seeing in Europe. We projected that SG&A in the upcoming quarters would be in the range of $95 million to $100 million, and trending down. Our cost came in a little lower than we had forecast, and about $20 million lower than the last quarter. But they are still up year-over-year, so we have some more work to do. On balance though, I would say that the extra effort we put in to Performance Plus, European operational improvements, and growth initiatives is paying off in tangibles ways. We just need to find ways to do it more efficiently, as we go forward. Equity and earnings of affiliates was $11 million, compared to $7 million last year. Chip has emphasized to you in the past the importance of JVs in our global strategy. The improvement this quarter was due primarily to strength of our JVs in South America. Our income before income taxes was up 47%, compared to last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was almost 60% due to non-recurring charges. We have not adjusted our results for the non-recurring items this quarter, except for restructuring. The high rate this quarter relates to the write-down of deferred tax assets for some jurisdictions that have lowered their tax rates. We had a similar item last quarter for a different jurisdiction. The high rate this quarter also reflects settlement of a tax matter dating back to before the merger of Arvin and Meritor. So, our income from continuing operations before special items was $6 million or $0.08 per share. Slide 12 is our segment EBITDA chart. We've already gone thorough the CVS and LVS margins in detail, so I'll just mention one item on this slide. Last year, we did not allocate the overhead cost that had previously been carried by the Emission Technologies group to the remaining segments. This year the remaining costs are fully absorbed in the margins of CVS and LVS. Barring those extra costs and in spite of the lingering downturn in North American volumes, CVS margins were up. LVS margins would have been up as well, if not for the reserve related to the legal and commercial issue. In total, I believe the profitability is on-track with our plan. Slide 13 shows that unfortunately cash flow is not on tract to the plan we had laid out, which is why we've lowered our guidance to our cash outflow for the year. When you look at slide 13, the issue becomes clear. Working capital is absorbing cash flow. I will dedicate the next slide to working capital. On this slide, I want to indicate that some of the performance working capital increases are addressed with off-balance sheet factoring and securitization. Because we have a mismatch between receivables and payables in Europe, we have increased our factoring efforts there, including some programs that are customer-sponsored. I would also indicate that the performance working capital and factoring charges over the last six months are just about balanced, and a net change of $20 million. We have talked in the past about a pending true-up of working capital from the Emissions Technologies transaction. That is not included in this quarter, but has subsequently been completed in January. You will see the positive effect of that true-up in our cash flow next quarter. Slide 14 talks about the increase in working capital we saw in the quarter. I want to say upfront, that the increase includes some conscious investments to support growth and it includes some areas, where we need to accelerate our efforts in order to earn the right to continue to invest. Our inventory on the balance sheet increased by $28 million during the quarter, but $11 million of that was due to the acquisition of Mascot. Accounts receivable on the balance sheet changed by only $10 million, but if you take out the effect of factoring and securitization, they were up by $104 million. This is largely explained by the regional sales mix with higher sales in Europe, where receivable terms are longer. Also, at the end of the calendar year, we had some customer issues that were resolved just after the beginning of the new quarter. Accounts payable decreased by $226 million. In the quarter, we paid some vendors more expeditiously than we had in the past, trying to balance our needs with theirs. In some cases we made early payments to support distressed vendors, because we found it was more cost-effective than the alternative. These factors were on top of normal seasonality in our payables. Our plants stopped receiving material around the middle of the month, but we keep paying bills from prior months. Slide 15 shows our financial guidance for the year, which we are maintaining at the $1.40 to $1.60 per share from continuing operations before special items. We have raised our sales forecast range by $150 million, compared to our last report. A portion of this is currency-related. Regrettably it doesn't translate into higher EBITDA, as our profitability is not evenly balanced among the regions. Despite our unusually high tax rate in the first quarter, we are holding the full year effective tax rate at a range of 20% to 24%, as we expect some compensating items in later quarters. At the bottom of this chart, we show our new cash flow guidance of negative $75 million to $125 million. At the midpoint, this is down more than $100 million from our pervious guidance. We have lowered it, due to higher sales outside of North America, and in recognition of our more precise vendor payment patterns going forward. Over the longer term, there are big gains to be achieved in working capital, as our performance criteria has a long way to go to accomplish top quartile, or best-in-class levels. In the near-term, however, our focus is towards the initiatives that Chip discussed earlier, and other operational metrics such as quality, delivery, and plant productivity. On slide 16, I would just like to briefly reiterate the planning assumptions that we have reviewed with you at the Auto Show conference in Dearborn. For GDP growth we tied at the consensus estimates. In this case the blue-chip consensus was published on January 10th, and we had calls for growth of 2.2% in the US and 1.9% in Western Europe. We know there are dissenting views on this, and we believe that there are some real risks to our business associated with weaker economic growth. But industry production forecasts have some insulating factors that may provide some support. In North America, the light vehicle OEMs have shown a propensity to sustain production levels through incentives, which has dampened variability over the last decade. Our sales forecast is already down more than a 0.5 million units from 2007. With slower growth or even a mild recession, sales may not have that much further to fall. On the heavy truck side there are some signs that conditions are firming. Freight tonnage as reported by ATA rose by 1.4% year-over-year in December, after rising 3.5% in November. The December reading was the highest since January of 2006. Recently other market participants have reiterated production forecasts in line with ours. Many of the fleets were sent out last year by finding that it is time to replace their oldest trucks, in order to keep operating costs down. Several of you may have seen December trailer orders released yesterday by ACT. They were very weak at 12,400. If orders do not accelerate soon, then we will revise our trailer forecast lower for the calendar year. And in Europe, our commercial truck OE customers believe that there was unmet demand in 2007 that could offset a mild decline in economic growth. Light vehicle production in Europe may be more of a risk, particularly considering that we have a higher share there. If the US economy slips into recession, we will also face the risk that commercial vehicle after market sales could decline. We are pleased to report that our global after market sales continued to grow last quarter, and we continue to do all we can to position our CVA business for further profitable growth. On balance, this page contains more risks than opportunities. We are making contingency plans in case these risks materialize. We are also creating some of our own opportunities through execution of Performance Plus, tighter controls of discretionary costs, and other strategies that Chip took you through. Now let's take some questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from the line of Jonathan Steinmetz with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks. Good morning everyone.
Jim Donlon: Good morning Jonathan.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Just a few follow-up questions here on the cash flow, specifically on the payables on slide 14. Could you go into a little bit more detail, you listed four factors here. Which was the largest in terms of the drain, and can you be a little bit more specific about some of these payments that distress suppliers cost you?
Jim Donlon:  Well, I would just mostly say that the biggest factor overall Jonathan, is more expeditious rate of dealing with our payables than was our previous practice. We've been working on some service centers and some collection of various activities from individual plants into better servicing center. And as we have done that, we find that we are paying at a more expeditious rate than we previously had before.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: And the reason you made that change and is that desirable?
Jim Donlon:  It's difficult from a cash flow standpoint, but it is appropriate for interaction with our suppliers and our vendors and over the term, we will get to a better cost situation for ArvinMeritor with the bringing together of our efforts from individual plants into service centers.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Do you get better [returns] in terms of pricing for doing that then?
Jim Donlon:  As we would reduce variability with the supply community overtime, that may be possible, but in the short term, that's not something that is an immediate driving factor.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And do you have any specific number on what the payments that the distressed suppliers cost you?
Jim Donlon: We won't say. It's a significant double-digit number, but we won't go into a specific numbers. It was significant.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Okay, two other quick questions. One, how much you gave a walk on the LVS side with the 0.5 from Europe and South America as a benefit, can you just comment on between those two reasons with South America especially important. And then secondly on LVS, you also talked about a legal or commercial dispute. Can you just clarify those about $10 million, what exactly was that?
Chip McClure:  Yeah, let me kind of walk through the second one first and I'll let Jim kind of go through these volume mix in a moment. But if I look at the customer dispute, it was actually one that, one of our customers back in 2006 decided to go forward with a field service campaign, which affected about 750,000 vehicles. They actually did file suit and we actually booked to reserve of about $11 million back in 2006. And again, as we move forward to look to solve these both on legal and commercial basis went ahead and booked an additional $9 million reserve, which takes it up to $20 million for this situation.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: And what was the part that related to or the type of component at least?
Chip McClure: I don't think we really give out the details on that Jonathan, but it was, as you can tell it was just on the light vehicle side.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Okay and on the South America?
Jim Donlon: On South America, what I would share with you is that volumes were up about 20% in South America and on Europe, things were up about 10%. So, we had a big pick up in both regions. Our business in Europe is, of course much more significant than in South America. So on balance, about evenly split with one being a higher percentage increase and the other one being on a larger base.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much.
Jim Donlon: Okay. Thank you, Jonathan.
Operator:  And our next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers:  Yes. Could you give us some color on aftermarket and its contribution to CVS in the quarter in terms of the revenue growth and in particular what kind of revenue did Mascot bring in?
Chip McClure:  Well, actually, I will start in reverse and then I can let Jim kind of give you a little bit more detail. Mascot really was an acquisition, we just completed in December. So, really it just very small, I mean, really very negligible if you look at the fiscal quarter obviously on a go forward basis we see that as a bolt-on acquisition. I think it is really going to help us in the remanufacturing as I kind of indicated. The remanufacturing is one of the corner stones on the commercial vehicle aftermarket. I do envision that will help to better position us not only in remanufacturing in general but as I indicated the Mascot name is a well recognized name in that arena. So I think it will help us as we look to continue to grow our commercial vehicle aftermarket business.
Jim Donlon: Okay overall for aftermarket, I would just comment that here in North America, the sales levels were about even with last year but what we are finding is some big opportunities as we go out to Europe and out into Asia and South America. So our growth profile is now on the world markets while the North American market held about steady.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: And of the 29% of segment revenue from the presentation pie chart that is specialty in aftermarket, what’s roughly the geographic split within that slice of the pie?
Chip McClure: That is mostly a North American piece of the pie. Most of our specialty business is here in North America and at this point most of our aftermarket business is North America where looking to grow both of them globally but at this point it's mostly a North American slice of pie.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Okay thanks.
Operator: And our next question will comes from the line Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital Market. Please proceed.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: Good morning gentlemen, how are you today?
Chip McClure: Very good. Yourself Brett?
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: I am doing great. I got to go back to Jonathans question here, because I am asking myself. Jim, you are one of sharpest CFOs I’ll just say in the automotive industry and obviously with that, I know you could go beyond but where is the return on investment capital for this decision or is that not one?
Jim Donlon: There will be one out overtime, Brett. I guess you are referring to the one of investing into working capital?
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: Yeah, you are excluding out payment terms and so on and so forth.
Jim Donlon: And what we are looking at is that, as we can work through and get into a better steady pattern with our suppliers and our vendors that can open the door for us out overtime for some new commercial arrangements with them. And so it's an investment that we're making now, that we believe will bring the return at a later point in time, and this is a particularly tough time where in the supply community where by working with our suppliers right now, it's particularly important for them, and it will bring us some good features for the future.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: Okay, so placing that into my universal translator, I'm hearing you say that you think you can win more business in the future by treating your suppliers better today.
Jim Donlon: More business, better terms, better arrangements with them, just an overall better supply-customer relationship that we'll -- if we address this at this point in time.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: Yeah. Is this a kind of one-time issue in the quarter, or are we going to see the same thing in the second and third quarter, or fourth quarter and obviously this is all embedded into your cash flow, if that is correct?
Jim Donlon: Yes. We are seeing the biggest effect right now, and what we believe is that as we go out through the year, as you could tell, we did not adjust the guidance by this amount. So, we believe that there can be some adjustments as we go out through the year. We will be continuing to pay in a more expeditious rate, but there is also some benefits that we can achieve out later in the year. I would also comment to you that, that there have been some developments of new suppliers that have gone on in Europe and in Asia and this will bring us better prices and better terms out overtime.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: Okay. The Performance Plus initiative Chip, I see your chart here that says, you are pretty much on target so on and so forth. What I'm wondering is, in my mind you have restructuring initiatives, stuff about your spending cash, and the non-restructuring stuff. I'm wondering can you give me a sense of, if you were to break this chart into restructuring and non-restructuring, would you be essentially on track on both of them, would you be a little bit ahead on one, a little bit behind than the other. How should I think about that?
Chip McClure: Well actually, if you remember, when I first rolled this out, there were six pillars of Performance Plus. And as I look at that the ones that are going to be the longer term one, will be the restructuring one. So, those I wouldn't expect as much of those to be in this year, some of that I think we've indicated don't even complete until 2010, 2011 and 2012. The ones that are more immediate ones would be in the area of overhead and would be in the material side of that. And that's clearly what's you are seeing a lot there and that's not to say that there are on several the restructuring ones, that we did announce, such as the Brussels one last year and more recently Frankfurt, Germany that are being rolled into there now. So, there is some of that in the restructuring side in this chart that we presented today, but obviously more that I would say as far as the more immediate payback would be in the area of overhead and direct material optimization material cost reductions.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: Okay. Remanufacturing, you’ve got a lousy reputation on the street. Why you guys are getting in to it?
Chip McClure:  Well, actually when you look at those that have been very successful at it. If you can manage it right and remanufacturing is a unique industry. And you got to understand, things like core inventories and that type of things. But those that actually do well at it are very successful at it. And I think what you're referring to is, there have been historically a lot of the multi-type shops and as we see this kind of consolidation in that, I think it was probably best demonstrated in the engine remanufacturing side for years. We've had very successful remanufacturing business in Plainfield, Indiana on the brakes and driveline remanufacturing. So, we've had good success at it. Those that we have focused on it, as I'd indicated in the engine side, we have been successful at it. It’s obviously some others that have had difficulties, but in our case, we've been successful at it with a facility in Plainfield, Indiana and do envision that as part of the cornerstone. For the growth in the Commercial Vehicle Aftermarket is the remanufacturing and we do see a lot of opportunity there. I will tell you, as you look at it primarily in the commercial vehicle, I should also mention, primarily in the commercial vehicle side. In the commercial vehicle side, the second, third and sometimes fourth owners, remanufacturing products become a very important pipeline of aftermarket parts for them. So, we see that both from our experience in our one facility and watching in the industry see it as a good opportunity.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: The legal and commercial had 1.7% reduction so on and so forth, the $9 million. Is that a one-time or do you think, I mean, do you think, you've got covered at this point in time?
Chip McClure:  Well, we feel that and obviously we are on discussion with our customer right now. We feel it is resolvable. So, I think, we've booked. We feel we have all the proper reserves at this point and feel that we can go forward and get this resolved, but I need to call that out.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: Okay. And one more and I'll let it go. European CVS, I mean, feel free to pass on this Chip. How do I as an outsider interpret, how much of a price increase you got from your customers in Europe?
Chip McClure: Well actually when you look at it, it’s difficult to segment that out. And let me just give you, as I indicated in previous discussions, it's really several different parts, one is going to be material cost. second is premium costs that we've indicated that we are doing to support that, and third is just in the base cost. So really beyond that, I really can't go into detail, but as I can tell you with a number of different customers, we continue to look at it in those categories, and referring in that way, part of which you also look at. There are a lot of different customers, not just truck customers for axles, but a lot of trailer customers and quite frankly, as I indicated in my comments, we're growing in the aftermarket side albeit still a small segment over there. So when you look at it in a broader sense you've got to look at not just the truck OEMs, the trailer OEMs, but also the aftermarket side. Now, obviously overlaid on that and I think Carsten back at our analyst day, indicated some of that. We've also got the operational improvements that we starting to see flow-through on the lean side. So in addition to it, it is not all pricing. Obviously our obligation is we've also get to make sure we are improving our costs and, as we indicated with some of the metrics that we use within our plants, and indicated at the analyst day, we are seeing better margins as result of our focus in the lean in the overall, all matter of production system.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Market: Thanks very much, gentleman.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of David Leiker with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Good morning.
Chip McClure: Good morning David.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: As we have this working capital item, what should we expect going forward on a normal level? Just kind of transition to something that we should expect next several years to be normal or is this temporary thing that gets some folks over the hump?
Jim Donlon: This is more of a temporary thing, we're getting over here, and now it will flow into a normal pattern as we go forward. As a matter of fact, I would say because of some of the difficulties of this quarter, this quarter might be even a little bit more than what we would see in the normal situation. So we've made some adjustments. Those will now stay with us, we'll go forward with them, and if anything some of the special items we did this quarter will work back in our favors as we go out through the rest of the year. So it's transitional.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Okay. I don't think I have heard you quantify the size of this order that you have from Hyundai across these various products, can you put a number on that?
Chip McClure: I don't think we do that except for the volumes looking at that, and really all I can do is give you the number of units looking at this point.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Okay, what was the number Jim at the end of the quarter that sold and factored receivables, the balance at the end of the quarter?
Jim Donlon: Just one second, I'm pulling that up here. It's the increase that we had during the quarter was about $1.15, but I don't have that level that brought in to, I'm getting that just one second. About 400.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: 400? That's great. And if we look at the Performance Plus, it seems as though, if you finish this $20 million in the actions here on an annualized run rate, you're pushing $80 million, you’ve got more than half of the year or less to go through that. Is there a timing issue that the actions going forward are going to be less than what we have seen here at the beginning or are you running ahead of a $75 million number for this year?
Chip McClure: No. I think it's safe to say it's probably a bit more than later, and obviously we laid that out in the chart. We're trying to giving you both our internal targets, what we've got the implementation plans from. What we refer to is idea generation all the way through implementation is $197 million, with near run rate of $115 million. So, clearly what we want to trying to do is to continue to give you visibility to that, and as you indicated, you're right David, four months into it, we feel good about the progress at this point, and obviously want to accept the external target of 75, as you can see from the chart, there is opportunity above that.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Right.
Chip McClure: But I also indicated, we need to also recognize that part of that needs to be there if you were to offset the uncertainties in the market and material economic pressures and price down to it. So, we're trying to factor all that in there. So yes, and I look at it as a gross numbers, your statement is correct. We're quite frankly on track, we feel good about the progress, but we can't ignore the items or issues that occur in our industry, such as material economics, price down detractors. So we are looking to do that, and clearly want to make sure we can meet or exceed that target.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: So, as we enter that, that you will need some other Performance Plus savings to offset these other items that you had traditionally kind of find of ways of growing the business to offset.
Chip McClure: Well the answer is yes. As you know, in this business both the LVS and CVS side, the expectations from our customers continue to be cost competitive on a global basis. And as we indicated when we have rolled this out, Performance Plus as a transformational program that we going through and as part of that, we do look for the Performance Plus to indeed help offset some of that.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: And the last thing here. Just curious have you done any sensitivity analysis on our guidance. You are going to a 2.2% GDP number for the year to get your number. That was off by 50 basis points. Then how much of an impact on EPS do you think that might have, that may help equal?
Jim Donlon:  We've showed at a prior point in time here; let me pull that up here. Some work that we did about the sensitivity and I'm believing, it was back at our Analyst Day, where we showed that if truck volumes came in down a bit, and there would be a $12 million impact, [Class 8] it came in at a 198,000 would be a $12 million impact, medium duty and trailer and aftermarket would be another $12 million impact. We also showed at that time various efforts that we had underway to try and be able to compensate, so that we could still hit within our range. So, I think, the answer is, we've done our sensitivities and they would show that we could have a downward slide of $25 million or thereabout and we have our eyeball set on something that we would try and do to try and compensate and still comeback in the range.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Great, thanks. We will go and take that out of your analyst, your slides from that day. But thank you very much.
Chip McClure:  Okay.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Douglas Carlson with Banc of America. Please proceed.
Douglas Carlson - Banc of America: Hey, guys, thanks. My first question is on the slide 7 your Class 5-8 production helped EBITDA by 1.4 percentage points. Can you interpret that the European businesses is capturing the volume and fix some of the capacity constraints there? And I guess, how far along are you on the improvement capacity there? there may be a problem?
Chip McClure:  Yeah. The answer is yes. I think, it does reflect it that way. If you could go back to slide 5 for a moment and then I will come back to answer in more detail. Slide 5 kind of indicates a lot of things we have been doing in Europe to address that. We kind of presented this at the December 11th Analyst Day and as you can tell at the lighter green, which shows the improvements kind of across the board that was seeing to address that.  If then go back to Slide 7, Yes, as you look at that , I think a lot of the issues, now I will tell you not all the issues. We will continue to still have some premium cost but far less premium cost and we have had historically last year. So I think we are bringing that down. The other thing that we had indicated back in December is that we are also making additional capacity investment in Europe. A lot of that doesn't come online towards second half with fiscal year-so.  So as you look at it from Slide 5, you can see the details we have done from as far as lean manufacturing etcetera. Coming to Slide 7, so yes we are seeing the improvement, although we’re still having some premium cost to make sure we support our customers. And then finally as we look at it the second half of this year a lot of the additional capacity that we began making investments on at the end of the year will start coming online to further address, to be able to support the customers in Europe.
Douglas Carlson - Banc of America: Did the cash flow look now that it's lower, have any impact on the capacity you are looking to do in the second half? You got enough cash with that?
Jim Donlon: Yes we do. We are of course scrutinizing our CapEx plans very carefully, but at this point our liquidity position is excellent, and we have the funds with which to invest if the projects are good payouts.
Chip McClure: And I should mention all these CapEx that I kind of indicated have already been factored into some of this as we look at the guidance is going forward.
Douglas Carlson - Banc of America: Okay and then there is a quick follow-up here on this Emissions Technology true-up which I guess will be a working capital item next quarter. I don’t think you gave size on that. Is that meaningful?
Jim Donlon: It's significant. It's on the order of -- it's just under $30 million.
Douglas Carlson - Banc of America: Okay. And finally you address this, I think in Detroit, there are some questions around an [Opec] deal, and you're looking at your various alternatives, one of them maybe in some type of VEBA. Is there any more discussion on that, any update there?
Chip McClure: I would just say we're continuing to work on that, we would like to accomplish something there, and we are establishing the baseline material from which we can go forward. It would be a good deal for ArvinMeritor and a good a deal for the counterparty UAW, so we're working toward accomplishing that when we can.
Douglas Carlson - Banc of America: Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: And we have time for one more question. Our last question will come from the line of Rob Hinchliffe with UBS. Please proceed.
Rob Hinchliffe - UBS: Thanks, good morning.
Chip McClure: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Hinchliffe - UBS: I have a few questions. In CVS this 3.5% negative margin impact from lower North American volume, I guess without that, implies margins would have been over 10%, so a couple of questions there. One, is there anything structurally different that will prevent you from recapturing that 3.5% in volumes return, and then also is that margin impact based on using the Mexican plant, the new Mexican plant that you are building, or is it based on the cost associated with your US plants, one of which is targeted for closure?
Chip McClure: Let me take on the first part, then I'll let Jim kind of address the second one, but as you look at the production volumes, actually the production volume decrease in North America really pertains to both truck and trailer, and as Jim had indicated, we continually follow both. I think as we had indicated that at the Analyst Meeting here at Dearborn a couple weeks ago, that Class 8 orders again had another month, and December it was above 20,000 units, so we are guardedly optimistic. But obviously, you've got to look at the timing on those orders of the Class 8 trucks when they occur. But we’d start to see a little bit of return there, and obviously on the other side we are watching very closely what happened to the trailer side on that. So as you look at that that minus 3.5 percentage points, that really is looking a production volume reductions in both the truck and trailer side.
Rob Hinchliffe - UBS: Did you break it Chip in the impact from each?
Chip McClure: We have not. No, it just on a geographic basis.
Rob Hinchliffe - UBS: Okay.
Jim Donlon: At overall I would just say that this has been based on our current operating pattern that does not include the Mexican plant at point, it's something that will come online and help us in 2009. But in this figure and in this calculation it is working from our current operations.
Rob Hinchliffe - UBS: Okay. And then, you mentioned on one of the slides about working with customers on commodity prices. Can you talk about the impact, what the incremental impact in '08 looks to be as a result of the higher commodity cost?
Jim Donlon: Rob it's kind of difficult, we have individual arrangements with each of our different customers about this, and I think it's probably better that I do not go into too much detail here. There maybe another time we could cover something, but at this point in time as we cover this with our individual customers it's a pretty sensitive topic.
Rob Hinchliffe - UBS: Okay and then one real quick housekeeping one. These items of non-recurring nature that are included in the results, the $1.40 to $1.60 includes the change in employee benefit policies and the legal issue and all that, right?
Jim Donlon: Yes, it does. 
Rob Hinchliffe - UBS: Okay. Thanks everybody.
Chip McClure: Okay, thank you Rob.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, It looks like we have time for one last question that is going to come from the line of Peter Nesvold. Please proceed.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: Thanks for first letting me in there at the end. Quick question also on slide 7, when I look at the North America OE production volume being at 3.5% headwind year-over-year, I mean, I guess I do have discussion I had sometimes when companies have declining cash flow and improving GAAP results, but I am really struck with the fact that your CVS EBITDA margins are 60 basis points higher year-over-year despite the 30% decline in Class 8 build. As to what I understand is the 3.5 percentage point headwind, as we progress through the year based ACTs numbers which are lower than yours, but even then based on ACT’s were growing by calendar third quarter. So is it fair to expect that as we exit calendar 2008, that 3.5 percentage point headwind is at least zero, if not slightly positive?
Jim Donlon: The only thing I commented on Peter, is that this was analysis that was done on the first quarter of this year compared to first quarter of last year. And last year the volume rack up was up to almost 90,000 for the Class 8. So I think as we go through this year I don't think with ACT we get back up to a 90,000 quarter. So I don't think we will recapture all of this 3.5 as we go through this year, but will get some part of it and then at some future point if volumes were to be at 90,000 again then we'd have a good shot at that 3.5.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: But I've seen over the last year I mean at 90,000 units you normally make a lot of money on the incremental volume.
Jim Donlon: That is good memory. We did have a lot of costs for what we've called high volume penalties, and Carsten and his team have been working for nearly a year now on the preparation towards being able to handle the next upturn without all those high volume penalties. One item that will help of course is the New Mexico plant, but we think for the future we can recover better than what we had the last time around.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: Okay then last quick question on this slide and I am done. If I look at the European improvement and I look at slide 7 versus slide 5, it looks like a lot of the European improvement by the time we exited the quarter was in place, a little bit to go still, but most of those were in place at the end of the quarter. I am curious how much of it actually impacted the quarterly result itself. So how much momentum do you have going in to fiscal second quarter, might I see even more improvement in fiscal second quarter in Europe versus what you show here in slide 7.
Jim Donlon: I would say that we picked up some of it during the quarter. And therefore the run-rate by the end of the quarter would be an improvement and we would expect that we would get that for the full amount of the second quarter. There is still some significant amount of expediting costs that were going on to try and keep up with the production, and as Chip pointed out the capacity actions don't really come on until later in the year. So I would say  So I would say something slightly better than our first quarter for the second quarter because of the actions that occurred during the quarter, but the big pick up, the big rest of it doesn't come until till late into the second half of the year.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: Thanks again for the time.
Jim Donlon: Peter, thank you, and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

I would now like to hand the conference over to yourspeaker, Terry Huch. Please go ahead.
Terry Huch: Thank you, Amy. Good morning everyone and welcome to theArvinMeritor fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2007 earnings call. On thecall today we have Chip McClure, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer andPresident, and Jim Donlon, our Chief Financial Officer.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chip.
Chip McClure: Thank you, Terry and good morning everyone. Thank you forjoining us today. First, I'll cover some of the highlights for the yearoutlined in slides three through eight and then I’ll turn the call over to Jimwho will review the details of our financial performance. As you read in this morning's earnings announcement forfiscal year 2007 we earned $0.53 per share from continuing operations beforespecial items. Despite the solid progress we are making in implementing ourstrategic initiatives we haven't delivered the financial results that we know acompany like ours is capable of achieving. We recognize issues facing ArvinMeritor and we are workinghard to address them. We are in the process of implementing aggressive actionthat will help us to turn the challenges we are facing into opportunities forthe future. The actions we are taking have just started to hit ourbottom line and I believe that we will begin to see more improvement by the endof our fiscal year. We however remain focused on putting capacity in place,improving our profitability and delivering the returns you expect from us goingforward. In the short-term, our results have been negatively impactedby continuing soft truck market in North America, as well as, a truck marketthat's been going through the roof in Europe. As we've told you on the last couple of earnings calls thecapacity issue in Europe primarily driven by the growth in Eastern Europe,stress our supply chain and increase our costs due to sourcing issues, premiumfreight and over time. We are taking actions by making the necessary capacityinvestments in our equipment and facilities, qualifying new suppliers inEastern Europe and Asia, and aggressively implementing lean manufacturingprograms that will improve the efficiency and robustness of our systems andplans. We also need to address some of the commercial issues we hadwith many of our customers. We are pleased that our customers recognize the impactin steel and premium costs are having on us and we are willing to work with usto help find solutions and address these issues. In the long-term we believe that we are not only -- we willnot only benefit from the capacity actions I just described but will continueto benefit from all of the other accomplishments we’ve made during the year. These include the substantial amount of new business webooked this year including our new joint venture with Chery Motors one of thefastest growing OEMs in China, which is expected to ramp up to $150 million ofbusiness for us by 2010 and our higher sales volume in our specialty vehiclesegment. Our CVS specialty group continues to win business for theMine Resistant Ambush Protected defense program or MRAP, where we supplycomponents for the majority of the units. We expect this area to continue togrow as new awards are announced. While winning new business in key focus areas we are at thesame time refocusing our company and dedicating our resources to our corecapabilities. We therefore continue to divest non-core assets. In the thirdquarter we sold our emission technology business group and in the fourthquarter we sold our European aftermarket exhaust and filters operations. Throughout 2007, we've continued to rationalize and writesize our company by aggressively implementing several restructuring actions andimproving our manufacturing footprint around the world. We saw improvements to our LVS business margins compared toprior years, finishing 2007 with an EBITDA margin of 4%, compared to 3.1% in2006. As our industry becomes more global joint ventures are becoming veryimportant element of our business strategy. We'll continue to grow and improve our profitability byentering into additional joint ventures and other cooperative arrangementsgoing forward. We improved our technical capabilities by investing in andexpanding our global technical presence. We announced plans to open a new technical center inShanghai, China and doubled the number of engineers we have in our technicalcenter in Bangalore, India. We successfully launched our performance plusinitiative, which we introduced to you at this time last year. We've been working hard and I have identified 100s of ideason how to grow profitably and significantly reduce costs. These ideas have beendriven down into the operations and are now in the process of being executed. We are tracking our progress and as promised, we are ontrack to generate $75 million in cost savings in 2008 and $150 million in costsavings in 2009. And we cut our pension underfunding by more than half. Turning to slide four, you can see from this chart we’recontinuing to make progress on our strategy to diversify and grow our customerbase with non-traditional customers. We have strategically positioned our lightvehicle business with minimal exposure to the North American domestic OEMs. Our total global light vehicle business with General Motors,Ford and Chrysler has gone down from 13% in 2006 to 9% or on a value-addedbasis 6% in 2007. Now let's -- turn to slide five, our outlook for our fiscalyear 2008 earnings per share before special items is in the range of $1.40 to$1.60, which is unchanged from the guidance we provided to you on October 3rd.While no one can predict what the economy will look like next year, we’llcontinue to carefully monitor the fluctuations in the marketplace and make anynecessary adjustments to our business as appropriate. As many of you might already know the Americas CommercialTransportation or ACT, revised the range for its North American truck forecastfor 2008 and 2009. Although we have some concerns about the pace of recovery wemight experience our outlook for the North American truck market remainsunchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect Class 8 truck volumes to reach about220,000 units in our 2008 fiscal year, however we will be monitoring thesituation closely. Jim will take you through the planning assumptions that ourforecast is based on later on this call. We are also working hard on generating cash going forwardand we expect that with the aggressive actions we are taking, we will generatepositive free cash flow in 2008. Part of the improvement will come from asignificant belt type tighten actions we've taken on our SG&A cost for thefirst half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, in 2008 we will be seeing resultsfrom our performance plus initiatives. It has been one of the most positivecultural transformations in the history of our company. The principles ofperformance plus have been integrated into the entire organization and havebecome imbedded in the way we run our operations. We believe that executing these kinds of initiatives willsupport our efforts to become a top quartile financial performer in the comingyears. We will also be seeing a gradual improvement in our European operationsas we gain momentum from our supply chain management and operationalimprovement efforts. We will begin to benefit from a significant restructuringactions, we've been implementing. We are on track with closing andconsolidating several of our facilities and eliminating up to 2800 positions inNorth America and Europe. This restructuring plan will save our company about $130 to$140 million a year by 2012. And we are improving our terms with key customers,suppliers and with our employees through a cooperative initiatives which forexample will help us this year by reducing our cost of material such as steal.We successfully worked with our plant employees to win new business awards andimprove the competitiveness of our facilities. Now let's turn to slide six, as you know satisfying customerdemand for heavy trucks in Europe has been one of the biggest challenges ourcompany has had to deal with over the last year. We believe with the actions weare taking we will start to see gradual improvement to our financialperformance in the seconds half of '08 and into 2009. We are executing aggressive lean manufacturing initiativesin plants requiring extra attention and bothering our lean efforts in all otherglobal facilities. We are strengthening our relationships with existingsuppliers and joint venture suppliers in leading cost competitive countries andqualifying and obtaining new suppliers in Eastern Europe and Asia to help uslower our total cost. We are leveraging our internal and external capacity inNorth America; working closely with our customers to optimize productionschedules, beginning to make the necessary capital investments to insure we canbetter manage with the higher capacity and improve our capabilities. And we arecontinuing to develop our talent base and fill leadership positions with theexpertise and skills needed to move our company forward. Let's turn to slide seven, in an ongoing effort to aligncapacity with industry conditions we are efficiently utilize assets and improveour manufacturing footprint, we continue to consolidate, downsize, close orcell assets. As you can see on this slide we've announced six of the 13plants we said we would close or consolidate as part of our restructuringefforts. These facilities represent both our CVS and LVS businesses and now inEurope and North America. Turning to slide eight, before I turn the call over to Jimlet me talk to you about some of the positive thing we are doing to grow ourbusiness. We are announcing today that we are expanding our business intoRomaine, we'll be building a new plant there to produce door systems for thegrowing number of OEMs we are supplying in both eastern and western Europe. This plant also will support the new business we recentlyreceived from Dacia a leading automotive manufacturer in that country. Lastweek, we announced a major new LVS global contract to supply $4 million windowregulators motors annually to Hyundai. We announced last week that we arebuilding a new CVS axle and brake plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This 400,000 square feet facility will not only support ourefforts to reduce cost but it will help us to have the flexibility to meet thehigher volumes we are anticipating in North America in 2009. In this lastquarter a new venture with TRW was announced to distribute Ride Control Partsto the after market industry in Europe. This partnership combines the strength of ArvinMeritorengineering and manufacturer competencies and the Gabriel brand name with TRWextensive sales and distribution network. And finally, we recently received a new business award frominternational to supply commercial vehicle components for an additional 1000MRAP units. This continues to be a growing business for us. Now, I would like to turn the call over to, Jim.
Jim Donlon: Thank you, Chip. I'm going to start with some of the incomestatement for the third quarter on slide nine and then I'll talk about the fullyear results. The fourth quarter came in pretty close to the revised guidancethat we provided on October 3rd. We said then that our results in the US would be adverselyaffected by the slower economy and that our results in Europe would suffer fromsupply and operational issues related to the continuing high volumes there. On the revenue line those factors largely offset each otherresulting in sales that were about equal to the year ago quarter. Gross marginfor the quarter declined by $9 million from there fourth quarter of 2006 to$118 million. SG&A was $40 million higher than last year and I will talkabout that in detail on the next chart. Equity and earnings of affiliates continues to grow.Interest expense was $22 million for the quarter, $6 million lower than lastyear. Income taxes were a benefit of $5 million for the quarter. And incomefrom continuing operations before special items was a loss of $4 millioncompared to income of $29 million last year. This resulted in a loss of $0.06per share. Slide ten explains the increase in SG&A in the fourthquarter. Initially the magnitude of the increase maybe a surprise but much ofit reflects the income statement binning of items that should be familiar toyou. The first category is performance plus costs. We've indicated all alongthat our expected performance plus costs savings to pay for the cost of theprogram in 2007. And they did, most of the savings have come through the costof sales line whereas the program costs hit the SG&A line. The consultingand staffing cost to get the program going were $12 million in the quarter. Theconsulting engagement and payments are essentially complete, so this amountwill not recur into the future. In addition, we've made some investments in shared servicesthat will help us reduce administrative costs in the future. Up front costsinclude software requirements and relocation of employees. We've alsoaccelerated the implementation of our lean manufacturing initiatives. This isdriving higher efficiency, which reduces our cost of sales. So in total about $18 million of the increase in SG&Awas for performance plus investments that bear fruit in other places in theincome statement or overtime as the initiatives mature. Another similar item is the SG&A cost we incurred to supportcontinuing high customer orders in Europe. In our last presentation, we talkedabout the impact this was having on our CVS profitability. In order to limit the exposure to these items, we've had todeploy a lot of resources into the manufacturing and supply chain managementefforts. That has required travel over time and outside help, which arereflected in the $10 million increases in SG&A. Another area of investment in SG&A for futureimprovements and profitability is the launch of some of the initiatives in theAsia region. This includes the Shanghai technical center and the initialwork on deploying -- on developing our relationship with Chery Motors. At the same time, we've experienced SG&A increases forrestructuring support efforts that are not appropriate to be included inrestructuring charges. Higher receivable factors costs, which are partialoffset to the decrease in interest expense and unfavorable changes in exchangerates. For the next few quarters, we would see SG&A in therange of $95 million to $100 million trending down as special task forces canbe scaled back. In our industry group of truck and automotive parts supplythe top quartile firms achieve SG&A costs of less than 6% of sales. And weplan to regain that objective very soon in 2008. Returns -- slide 11 returns to the full income statement butthis time for the whole 2007 fiscal year. I won't walk through it all but letme hit some highlights. Even though we are in the midst of a major downturn incommercial truck volumes in North America and even considering the 2006revenues benefited from record commercial truck volumes, our sales were stillhigher this year than last. Stronger currencies outside the US more than accounted forthe increase, raising sales by $220 million. But even in the absence ofcurrency movements, strong sales in Europe, South America and Asia were nearlyenough to offset the weakness in North America. For the year, income before income taxes was $56 million.Taxes for the full year were $3 million or 5%. This includes the unfavorableimpact of a German tax law change on deferred tax assets. We had indicated on October 3rd that this would have aone-time impact on our results, which is true. However, we chose not to reportit as a special item because it was one of only a number of tax law changesthat affected us this year. At the bottom line, we earned $38 million from continuingoperations before special items in 2007 which equates to $0.53 per share: Slide 12 shows earnings before interest, taxes, depreciationand amortization for our business segments before special items. Our LightVehicle Systems division was able to increase its EBITDA by 30% compared tolast year on flat sales. The improvement resulted from material savings and other costsavings as well as benefits from prior year restructuring actions. LVS EBITDAmargins increased by 0.9 percentage points during the year. This is goodprogress but we have a long way to go before we will be satisfied. EBITDA for our commercial vehicle systems division was down29% from $328 million to $232 million. As we've discussed with you many times,the deterioration was due to unfavorable geographic and vehicle mix and tooperational and supply issues in Europe. EBITDA margins for CVS were 5.5% for the year. This businessis capable of converting at stronger levels, which we think our results in 2008will demonstrate. Slide 13 shows our cash flow for the quarter and the year.Free cash flow was positive by $178 million for the quarter, more than explainedby working capital improvements. Pension and retiree healthcare funding net ofexpense were a small source of cash for the quarter but a use of $71 millionfor the year because of contributions to our pension plans. In our reporting for this quarter, we've adopted FAS 158,which brings the underfunded position of our pension plans on to the balancesheet. Net of other pension changes, this resulted in a $230 million reductionin our book equity. Reflected in our cash balance but not on the free cash flowslide are proceeds from two of the three emission affiliates that have notclosed by the end of the third quarter. We are hopeful that the remainingaffiliate transaction will close this quarter. Slide 14 provides an update to the restructuring plans wedetailed for you on May 1st. At that time, we projected restructuring expensefor 2007 of $65 million with a cash portion of $50 million. We booked changes that were slightly greater than the plandue to an additional action to rationalize White-Collar headcount in ourEuropean roofs operation. However, cash spending was slightly lower than we hadestimated. We estimate that the annual run rate benefits of the actionswe've already implemented are million. I also would like to reiterate on thisslide that restructuring is a subset of the broader Performance Plus profitimprovement plan. Restructuring charges arise primarily from employeeseverance and asset impairments related to plant closures and staff reductions.In addition to these items, Performance Plus cost savings also include nonlabor overhead reductions, material cost reductions and lean manufacturingsavings. We are on track to the $75 million commitment for 2008. Wehave implemented the majority of the actions needed to achieve this goal buthaven't seen all the full benefits of these actions for two reasons. First,we've had only a partial year benefit in 2007 and, second, savings in the 2007period were used to offset the cost of launching and staffing the initiative in2007. We have implementation plans for remaining ideas, some ofwhich will benefit 2008 by the remaining amount need to do achieve the $75million mark. These cost savings are an important part of our plan for improvedresults in 2008. Slide 15 shows our financial guidance for the year, which asChip mentioned amounts to $1.40 to $1.60 per share from continuing operationsbefore special items. We are planning for sales $300 million to $500 million,higher in 2008 compared to 2007. I'll review the economic and industry assumptions thatunderlie this forecast in a moment. We expect to generate EBITDA of $385million to 405 million in 2008. After interest expense of about $95 million to$105 million, and taxes in the range of 20% to 24%, our income from continuingoperations will be $104 to $118 million. Chip told that you we expect to generate positive free cashflow in 2008. If you take the EBITDA forecast on this slide and subtract theinterest expense of $95 to $105, subtract the taxes of 35, Capital expendituresof $150 to $170, and restructuring cash of about $100, you would get to anumber right around zero. From there, the networking capital improvements should pushus into positive territory. Forecasting the direction of the economy and thenew vehicle markets is harder than normal right now. So we thought it would behelpful to provide more detail on the planning assumptions that we are using. Slide 16 shows a number of those metrics. In most cases,what we assumed is pretty close to the middle of what the third party expertsare saying. In the US, the last consensus survey of the economists called forGDP growth of 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007 and then gradual improvementthroughout 2008 for an average of 2.4% in 2008. We recognize that there are risks to this assumption and weare planning for various scenarios that could be weaker. If the consensusdeteriorates significantly, we'll revise our guidance accordingly. For Light Vehicle sales, our forecast of $16 million unitsin the US and $17 million in western Europe are consistent with those providedby third party sources. For Class 8 truck production in the US we areforecasting 235,000 to 255,000 units in the calendar year 2008. This is lowerthan the current consensus of that appears but at the high-end of the revisedrange provided by ACT. However the Class 8 production unfolds by quarter is alsoimportant and I'll show you a slide on that in just a moment. Our forecast forClass 5 through 7-truck production is about equal to 2007 fiscal year at 180,000units. This is on the same basis as the history we provide in our10-K. Unlike the ACT numbers we excludes specialty from Class 5 through7-trucks. Our forecast for medium and heavy truck production in Europe is upabout 10% from 2007 calendar year. The next three slides provide a deeper diveinto the truck volumes in North America. Slide 17 shows that that we continue to operate in a weakfreight environment. We did see a small seasonal up-tick in September. But wecontinue to expect freight levels to be below trends for sometime to come. Slide 18 shows the Class 8 truck orders provided by ACT. Thereport for October was better than expected, which is encouraging. It was thefirst month since October of last year in which orders have touched the 20,000levels. We expect orders to continue to be choppy over the comingmonths. But we expect to see a gradually improving trend. That graduallyimproving trend is reflected on our quarterly production forecast shown onslide 19. We are calling for North American Class 8 production of45,000 units in the current quarter, which is up about 1,000 units from theproduction last quarter. From here we build up to normal levels by the middleof the year with the first signs of the pre-buy coming toward the end of 2008. Our fiscal year forecast is 210,000 to 230,000 units. Ourforecast is neither the highest nor the lowest out there right now. Itrepresents the way we expect the industry to unfold but we certainly recognizethat there are risks against it. Until we get better visibility in the direction of theeconomy and the trucking industry. We are not inclined to revise it. Wecontinue to expect pre-buy levels in 2009 but the forecasted levels of 310,000for our fiscal year is about 40,000 units lower than what we saw in 2006. ACTis forecasting 329,000 for the 2009 calendar year. Slide 20 shows our quarterly forecast for medium and heavytruck production in Europe. The first thing you'll notice is much morepronounced seasonality corresponding to the vacation shutdowns in the thirdcalendar quarter. The other thing you should notice is that we expectproduction in Europe to continue to grow at double-digit levels over at leastthe next two fiscal years. As we mentioned on October 3rd, we are makingsignificant capacity investments to be able to meet customer requirementsprofitably throughout this period and beyond. With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for somefinal points.
Chip McClure: Thank you, Jim. Now let's turn to slide 21. In summary ArvinMeritoris aggressively implementing the right actions to ensure they are going forwardthe company will be better positioned to deliver value and provide solidreturns to our shareholders. I'm confident that we have the right business plan and weare building the right team to drive our company’s future success. First we have a winning business strategy includingcontinuing to refocus our business by dedicating our resources to businessesthat are core to our operations and offer the most attractive returns. To that end we divested our RollCoater, light vehicleaftermarket and emissions technology businesses. We are strengthening ourproduct portfolio and our global presence in a market that offer the highestgrowth opportunities. Our strategy is based on growing with a purpose and thatpurpose is to increase our profits and return value to our shareholders. We arealso aggressively executing initiatives that will better position of company tocapitalize in the upcoming rebound in the North American truck market. As wellas benefit from the robust truck market in Europe. We made strides in improving our global supply chain and wehave been making the necessary and much needed investments in our operations sowe can successfully manage higher demand and capacity levels in both of thesemarkets. We have implemented a strategic process that regularlyreviews and analyzes our product and business portfolio to achieve ourprofitable growth objectives. We are aligning with the right customers.Establishing better pricing disciplines and improving our platform mix. Second, we have been proactive in our efforts to driveperformance improvement initiatives throughout the organization and the actionswe’ve taken are paying off. As I mentioned earlier, our Performance Plus program hasbecome part of our culture and has helped us to change the way we operate anddrive the improvements we need to reduce costs and increase our profits. We are also aggressively growing and expanding our presencein the Asia Pacific region. We put a number of manufacturing and engineeringfacilities as well as a strong management team in place and we establishedstrong joint ventures with Asian companies and with Asian OEMs. Because of this, I believe we'll become one of the most wellpositioned suppliers in our peer group to take advantage of the tremendous costsavings opportunities and the rapid growth in that region of the world. We've rolled out our lean manufacturing initiative we calledArvinMeritor Production System at our plant sites around the world. The CarstenReinhardt, Philip Martens and Rakesh Sachdev has been strengthening themanufacturing purchasing and Logistics Teams by utilizing their existing talentand bringing onboard additional leaders, who have the expertise and necessaryskills to help us drive a continuous improving culture. We will soon begin tosee the results of their collaborative efforts and we're counting on them toimprove our operating performance. Third, our company has strong policies to ensure thefinancial interests of ArvinMeritor's key executives are aligned with itsshareowners. Management's compensation has tied to the financial performance ofthe company. Short-term incentive compensation is measured by EBITDA and cashflow. And long-term incentive compensation is measured by returnon invested capital and the total return to our shareholders relative to ourpeer group. Our leadership team has strong executive ownership guidelines thatmust be in here too and our board is composed of nine out of ten independentdirectors. Fourth, we continue to focus our attention on maintaining astrong balance sheet. We've reduced our net debt by more than $700 million overlast three years and we have no significant maturities due until 2012. We've also made a lot of progress on reducing our pensionobligations. We've reduced the underfunding of pension plans from $659 millionto $180 million in the last couple of years. We've also made strides in decreasing our healthcare costs.We are beginning to see an improvement in our results from the retiringinitiatives and the employee customer driven healthcare plans we put in placelast year. And going forward we see a potential opportunity to furtheraddress some of our retiring healthcare costs by establishing as we've trustsimilar to the recent agreements you've heard so much about in our industry. These are just some of the reasons why ArvinMeritorcontinues to be a good investment choice. Once we get through this office inthe North America truck market, which we estimate will couldn't in the nextcouple of quarters, we will begin the benefit from rebound in the market. Truck volumes in Europe will continue to be strong andrepresent an opportunity for us, especially now that we are making the necessaryinvests in our operations and are better positioned for growth in our industryin the second half of 2008 and into 2009. And we will also continue to seesignificant growth in Asia. By the second half of 2008, every primary market for trucksis expected to be experiencing year-over-year gains at the same time. Our lightvehicle business is also well position to increase its earning power goingforward. LVS has improved its cost base through restructuring initiatives aswell as improving its global supply base and operating processes and LVS ispoised to capitalize on growth opportunities in emerging markets and byaligning with market leading OEMs. Throughout 2008, profit improvements from our costproduction and growth action will ramp up to a very meaningful level. And wecontinue to have the financial flexibility we need to execute these plans. Now, let's take some questions. Operator? And we canreintroduce to the Q&A session.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from PeterNesvold of Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: Good morning guys.
Chip McClure: Good morning, Peter.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: I have maybe a little about Europe. You know we've hearingtightness from multiple suppliers in OEMs, just trying to keep pace withdemands. Was there anything that you're able to do late in the year that mightwould show some kind of near-term benefit for instance one -- tier onesupplier, I know you didn't take any downtime frame since in August to catch upto the OEM customer. Anything like that you were able to do?
Chip McClure:  Yes. Absolutely. Peter, this is Chip, yes, we did the samething, the August shut down we worked throughout that and that obviously helpedwith a bit of a buffer there. I think the second thing is when you look at what Carstenand his teams have done in Europe. I've mentioned a little bit with theArvinMeritor Production System we are starting to see some of the benefits ofthe lean manufacturing there. So I think that was a second thing that we've been able toshow improvement essentially in all our facilities there. The third thing is wealso as I indicated have started developing new suppliers. Now obviously with the rapid increase in the volumerequirements there was some premium cost to bring this capacity on line andalso get the parts to our plant. So those were kind of three, if you -- well,short-term things that I think we will already start seeing the results from. And obviously, I think the most important thing is from alonger-term perspective is we actually spent a lot as far as investment infuture capacity and we are putting that in place as we speak.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: Working down a -- working through a shutdown, an OEMshutdown makes a lot of sense, I can understand that that could be an immediatebenefit, it requalifying suppliers, I mean, that seems like that could takesometime. How, you know, changeable is that, don't you have to do durabletesting and get requalified by your OEM customer?
Chip McClure: No. You are absolutely right. You’ve to do that and makesure you have got the right quality in place, so that doesn't come on quicklybut even with some of our existing suppliers and I think the other thing, is wework very closely with our customers because again, as you look at it, I thinkour customers too the significant ramp up with the opening of Eastern Europemore I think caught them by surprise too. So as we went through the balance of the year we were ableto work much closer with them, as far as, schedules also to make sure that wecould -- if you would level it out of schedule a bit, so the suppliers weactually looked at, at least initially the once that were already certifiedsuppliers. But as we look going forward since we’ve indicated in thelast couple of calls we do continue to see significant growth increase bothnext year and the year beyond that we are putting things in place to qualifythese new suppliers. So those become more than the medium-term solutions. Butit's more of the existing suppliers that we are doing it with.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: And I didn’t see anything -- forgive me if I overlooked,expectations for segment EBITDA margins in '08. I mean, where do you seecommercial vehicle trending versus LVS, LVS has been a pleasant surprise thatit's starting to trend up here or continuing to trend up?
Chip McClure: Yes. Obviously, if you look at that in a general sense Ithink the improvement in LVS has resulted in some of the restructuring thattook place in the past and obviously with CVS as the volumes come back on as weare able to get capacity in place in Europe and then with what we expect theincrease in volume here in North America, we do anticipate some increase going forwardreally into the second half of the year.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: And then last question, when I look at what you've gonethrough in the last couple of quarters whether it's environment, etceteraexecution to some degree. You've had tightness in Europe, you've had a realdifficult North America Class 8 market, which is hopefully starts to reverse 12months out and you are going through some restructuring. I mean Chip, are you willing at this point to call fourthquarter here an EPS bottom with positive profitability going forward and itsounds like the cash flow versus a big cash flow drain this year at least isbreak even next year?
Chip McClure: Obviously, as I look at this we do see improvement goingforward from this fourth quarter and I think we are doing if you will brick bybrick both on the LVS side and CVS side, as far as internal -- as far as, thecost reduction improvements. I think also as you look at additional volume coming on andthen clearly the third part being with the market improving that way. Soclearly do see improvement as we go throughout 2008.
Peter Nesvold - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thank you. I'll jump back in queue.
Chip McClure: Thanks, Peter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Johnson of LehmanBrothers. Please go ahead.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Two questions, what are you doing any progress on balancingthe operational characteristic of the CVS business, so you don't need a GoldyLocks operational environment to make money, you can make money on the down andas well as, the overall in particularly in Europe, when do we see the benefitof these plants closures?
Chip McClure: Brian it is Chip again. And yes, one of the things that weare looking to do as part of our ArvinMeritor production system in addition tothe lean implementation is to first right size our manufacturing footprint butthen make our manufacturing footprint more flexible so that as we look atdifferent volume increases in different markets. And you know, we've got to go flexible and we are actuallydoing some of that now if you will to help support production in Europe withsome of the capacity in other parts of the world. As I look at it going forward and as we do put thisadditional capacity in place we want to make sure that one it's flexible enoughto be able support capacity requirements in any market in the world. But the second thing and as from a production point of view,I think the other thing from a product point of view is where appropriate andagain, we have to be sensitive to customer requirements and market demands incertain, the product requirements in certain geographic markets is to providethat flexibility so that it's, markets go through peaks and troughs and theother markets are going the other way we have the capacity in place to be ableto do that on more of a global basis. So we are doing that, we are seeing a little bit of that nowand we envision more of that in the future.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Second question is, could you give more color on LVSin particular why the EBITDA margins went down despite being of course normalseasonality but despite being a decent revenue upturn?
Chip McClure: Well, I think a lot of it you just hit right on Brian isreally the seasonality that way. What I really look at, if I look at the fullyear trends it's clearly heading in the right direction. As you know --indicated in our comments we still see more opportunity that going forward. SoI would really say that a lot of it was just based on the seasonality at thispoint.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Okay. But still versus last quarter last year it's down 170basis points same quarter '06, is that business mix, is that something going onin apertures?
Chip McClure: Actually I would say that some of it was, as we look at someof the improvements we are making in some of our businesses within the SG&Aarena Jim had talked about restructuring and those kind of things. Some of theshort-term actually we are doing for the long-term investment opportunity --return opportunities.
Brian Johnson - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thanks.
Chip McClure: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jairam Nathan of Banc ofAmerica. Please go ahead.
Jairam Nathan - Banc of America: Thanks. Can you give us an update on your backlog, I thinkyou said $1.2 billion ’07 to ’09 at December of last year, can you update us tothat and also you mentioned, can you tell us how much of that hit '07?
Chip McClure: I would just say that, we are not giving out various backlogwe have a series of business wins that we've achieved, but we have not beentracking backlog numbers. At one point in time, I believe that we may havecommented that there was at that time maybe two at that time, but that's notsomething that we provide regular guidance on.
Jairam Nathan - Banc of America: Okay. And my next question is on the trailer business. Itlooks like you have a production estimate of 305,000 units in 2008, that kindof comes to like 25,000 a month and it looks like you are running much lowerthan that currently. So are you expecting like a big improvement there nextyear?
Chip McClure: Yes, we are. When you look at it normally trailers andtrucks tends to go counter cyclical in some of this and the regionalexpectation, as we know there was a buy head in 2006 for trucks and probablyless trailers being bought that way. And obviously, it's kind of gone flat this year. So ourexpectation is, yes it will be going up this next year because there reallyhasn't been that investment therefore for last couple of years.
Jairam Nathan - Banc of America: Okay. And on the Performance Plus plan, is the kind of, canyou -- is there focus more on commercial vehicles. Or is it just kind of, howshould we think about that within segments?
Chip McClure: No, Jai it's cross the board. When you look at it, as wetalked in the past performance plus the six pillars with three pillars of costreduction and as an example a part o that on the manufacturing side as far asArvinMeritor production system, we are putting the lean process in all ourplants. I've been a plants recently in China and in Europe and herein United States and I can tell you that in all the facilities whether it'sLVS, CVS or it's here in North America, Europe or Asia Pacific we are puttingthe same processes in place that way. On the material optimization side or DMO is refer to it theactions are being done both in the LVS and CVS side to address that and thenobviously the overhead being that way. So the only one, I think is unique to one business unit orthe other is the sixth pillar if you will of Performance Plus which on therevenue side is commercial vehicle after market which obviously is specific toCVS but the others are across the board.
Jairam Nathan - Banc of America: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Murphy of Merrill Lynch.Please go ahead.
John Murphy - Merrill Lynch: Good morning, guys.
Chip McClure: Good morning, John.
John Murphy - Merrill Lynch: In your position having a high class problem of too muchvolume and if we think about your forecast for North America in 2008, you knowin 210 and 230 sounds like it's probably it might be, I mean a little bitoptimistic. I'm just wondering as we deviate from that forecast on thedown side and potentially maybe even optimistically on the upside. How do youthink your capacity right now in North America is set up to handle that? I meanclearly, you are looking at lean capacity going forward. But how far long areyou in that flexibility in North America specifically?
Chip McClure: Yes. Well, first of all when I look at it, if I go back toone of the slide Jim had quarter-to-quarter, if you look at the first couple ofquarters I think we are very much in line with everybody else as far as what'shappening in the next couple of quarters. I think the real question, which Ithink is part of what you are getting to is where it is for Q3 and Q4. And as we've kind of indicated there's still a lot ofuncertainty there and I think we are, kind of right in the middle that way. Asyou look at the capacity things and we indicated that one of the investments wejust announced was in Monterrey, Mexico, which is adding to make sure that weare prepared again within our manufacturing footprint here in North America forthe rebound that we do expect in the latter part of next year and into 2009. So if you look at it short term the next couple of quarters,I think we are very much inline with everybody else that's out there on that. Ithink there's some question to ask, what's going to happen in Q3 and Q4 and Ishould mention that we internally continue to develop downsize scenarios to beprepared for any eventuality that may come out. And then in the meantime looking beyond that for the reboundthat is expected the capacity is being put in place and I think the bestindication of that is what we just announced in Monterrey, Mexico.
John Murphy - Merrill Lynch: But, Jim you're comfortable with the first quarter at 45,000units and you feel like you can handle 50% more than that with that capacitywithout running into premium freight and overtime at this point?
Chip McClure: I am confident with what's taking place in the firstquarter, yes.
John Murphy - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And if we think about the Cadence of the $75 billionin cost saves in 2008, what is the Cadence of that? Is it back-end loaded or isit evenly smooth through the year?
Chip McClure: It's smooth all the way through the year and as Jim I thinkindicated in his comment Cadence it's already been implemented but it'sthroughout the year.
John Murphy - Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you very much.
Chip McClure: Okay. Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Steinmetz from MorganStanley. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Right. Thanks, good morning everyone.
Chip McClure: Good morning, Jonathan.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: A couple questions, first, from a macro perspective on thecommercial vehicle side in North America are you seeing any increase in sort ofthe price reduction that your customers are asking for versus where we were acouple of years ago with the strong volumes? And this is an industry that has not been as notoriouslytough for those as the light vehicle side. Just wondering as a customer comesunder pressure have you any give -- give any of that back?
Chip McClure: We have not seen any difference and what we have seen inyears past and I think the other thing is from our end and again part of theother I have seen a Performance Plus thing is, as we look at our product lineprofitability, I think we are much more databased on that. So, no, I am notseeing a change in that and I think we have the data now to have the discussionwith our customers.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Okay. At this point.
Chip McClure: Okay. North America and in Europe.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Okay. I just want quick housekeeping. Jim, do you have theD&A by segment? I just want to try and get to an EBIT number by segment?
Jim Donlon: We have that, maybe after the call, maybe Terry or I couldgive you a follow-up.
Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley: Okay. I'd appreciate that. Thank you. That's all for today.
Jim Donlon: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Hoselton of KeyBanc.Please go ahead.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Good morning, gentlemen.
Chip McClure: Good morning Brett.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Let's see. I know that the program that you're running, thePerformance Plus program that you're running has a number of different steps. Iguess, I would call it, an idea generation, implementation, those types ofthings. I guess what I'm wondering is can you provide some sense of how you'reprogressing in each of those steps in terms of what you originally anticipatedversus what you are seeing, you are able to achieve at this point in time?
Chip McClure:  Yes. Brett, this is Chip. You're right. I mean, you look atthat we do have the different levels, we track that and we have a very rigorousprocess as part of our PMO or program management office to track that and as wehad indicated there has been hundreds, well more than 1,000 ideas that havebeen generated and we are now into the stages, now taking it forward to theexecution part of that into the business units. So as we look at that we will continue to generate ideas. Wehave groups that do that but the more important thing is implementing them andgetting them translated to the bottom line. If you look at the various entitiesas I said before we have three pillars of cost reductions, one is material, oneis manufacturing and one is overhead. If I look at in that order, manufacturing, I think Jim hadkind of walked you through some of the manufacturing restructuring that we havedone within that and the plant closures and that obviously is probably thelongest term one just because as you know to write size your manufacturingfootprint and to restructuring plants takes time and we are showing savingsfrom now up to 2012 on that. The ones that are within manufacturing will show moreimmediate results, which as I had indicated would envision even in Europe withthe leaning manufacturing side, I think that there is, we are already beginningto see some results on that on the lean side. So on the manufacturing side, lean, we are already startedto see improvement, the manufacturing restructuring again is probably thelonger term one. On the materials side as we've indicated, that is in process.A number of the items have already been implemented but that will continuethroughout this year and into next year and overhead kind of the same way.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And I apologize, I'm out of the office here so I am going toask you question that I guess I should know the answer to. But we providedguidance of $1.40 to $1.60 I think it was about a month ago or so, what wereyour Class 8 heavy truck production expectations in your fiscal year '08 atthat time?
Chip McClure: We were on the range, Brett, of -- what we said at that timewas an earlier estimate was going to be adjusted downward and what we werelooking toward was the $2.35 to $2.55 for the calendar year. But for our fiscalyear that represents as I said earlier, about $220 or thereabouts.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets: So you only made, I guess, what would be considered -- itsounds like your Class 8 truck production forecast versus where you were amonth ago is basically in line with your expectations?
Chip McClure: Yes. We are roughly in that same ballpark of where we wereon October 3rd.
Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you so much, gentlemen.
Chip McClure: Okay. Thanks Brett.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Frank Jarman of Goldman Sachs.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs: Thanks guys. Just a couple of follow-up questions on thefree cash flow. You know pension and medical contributions net of expense wasnegative $71 million this year. For FY08 what should I think about that shakingout towards?
Chip McClure:  Because we are in much better position now on our pensions,we are now looking for a lower amount for 2008 and we would actually bethinking of it equal to or maybe even slightly lower than what the expenselevel would be for 2008.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then in terms of the EBITDA guidance that you guysgave, the $385 to $405, does that include a certain amount from equity andearnings of affiliates?
Chip McClure: Yes, it does.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. How much, should I just sort of straight line what youdid in FY07 of about $34 million?
Chip McClure: I would say plus or minus a little bit. We have several ofthe affiliates that are doing well and I actually think that there will beactually a little bit more income from the affiliates as we go towards nextyear, but I don't say that it would be a huge change. Also we have to take out the minority interest for ones thatare on a different line. So we have to kind of take both into account at thesame time.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs:  Got it. Then…
Chip McClure: But they are all doing quite well.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs:  Yes. And then I guess just one other question on the freecash flow. You talked about our working capital should be a positive. You knowif I include that pension and medical and even if it's maybe a little bit of alower contribution and also this equity and earnings of affiliates, it lookslike working capitals going to have to be pretty positive to get you guys backto sort of free cash flow positive. Is that, means numbers, it looks like it's going to be atleast $100 million positive, is that a number that you're comfortable with?
Chip McClure: From our perspective we are not looking at it to be thathigh a level. We are expecting some increases, some improvements as youconstantly work on working capital. But we are not up at the range of roughly$100. But we do expect some positive improvements. I would say maybe on theorder of one-third or half of that.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs:  Okay. And then just last question I had is. It's on theincome statement. Yes, you guys did a good job of giving us a walk on theSG&A special items from a year ago to 4Q this year. On the income statement, I noticed you called out $14million of other items, which are product disruptions, supplierreorganizations, environmental remediation, severance and other, is there anyway you could just give me a little bit more color there in terms of flushingout that $14 million number?
Chip McClure: I'm not sure I'm tracking with you on the 14. So I don'twant to respond to something I'm not quite sure of here.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. It's in the total EBITDA before special items, $49million reconciliation to the income from continuing operations of $23 million-- negative $23 million. Yes, this other with the footnote.
Chip McClure: We are looking for that page.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs: Towards the end of the press release.
Chip McClure: Yes. Okay. I think I know which one you're referring to. It'sabout on the order of half of that is various tax stuff and on the order ofhalf of it was supplier bankruptcy stuff.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And what was on the first half. I'm sorry. Imisunderstood you.
Chip McClure: You're asking about the $14 on the page there?
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs: Yes.
Chip McClure: Okay. That includes product disruption, supplierreorganizations, environmental remediation, severance and other and I'm sayingthat included in that is about, half of that had to do with supplierreorganizations and disruptions caused by that supplier reorganization and theother half of it came from the other items there.
Frank Jarman - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.
Chip McClure: All right. Thank you for everyone's questions. We've reachedthe top of the hour and we welcome your calls to follow-up. And this is the endof the call. You can disconnect at this time. Thank you.
