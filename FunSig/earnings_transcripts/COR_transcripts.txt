===== 2025 Q2  (2025-05-07 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining the Cencora Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. My name is Lucy, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury to begin. Please go ahead.
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2025 second quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Bob Mauch, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com. We've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will discuss forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income, and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q. Cencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be broadcast without the expressed permission of the company. You will have the opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Mauch: Thank you, Bennett. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining Cencora's fiscal 2025 second quarter earnings call. To begin, I want to thank our global Cencora team members. It is due to their purpose-driven execution that I have the privilege of reporting our second quarter performance. In our second quarter, Cencora delivered strong results with revenue growth of 10% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16%. We are, once again, raising our guidance for the fiscal year to reflect our first-half results and expectations for continued execution in the second half. Rooted in our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, enabled by active learning and powered by the collective strength of our enterprise, Cencora is building on our position as a leading end-to-end healthcare solutions provider. We continue to expand our capabilities in key markets, supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access. Today, I will highlight three areas advancing our business to power growth. First, we are creating value by leveraging our expertise and insights to enhance patient care. Second, we are successfully deepening our customer partnerships by actively learning and anticipating their needs. And third, we are strengthening our global leadership in specialty medications by deepening our offering across geographies and customer channels. I'll begin with how we are creating value by leveraging our leading expertise and insights from our end-to-end solutions to support our customers, partners and patients. Cencora is uniquely and intentionally positioned to support pharmaceutical commercialization and access across the healthcare ecosystem; from leading pharmaceutical and biopharma innovators to healthcare providers. The breadth and scale of our services give us access to extensive data that our teams transform into actionable insights, enabling increased efficiency and innovation. There are two examples I'd like to mention that demonstrate our progress to engage with industry stakeholders and strengthen our partnerships. First is how we're working to support the resiliency in the independent pharmacy space to ensure patient access to care. Through our advanced analytics capabilities and leading Good Neighbor Pharmacy network of independent pharmacies, we've been able to provide pharmacies with heightened visibility into their communities, allowing them to identify new business opportunities, address populations that may experience gaps in care, and tailor their service offering to specific patient populations. Our work has also highlighted that an estimated 30 million people in the United States live in pharmacy deserts, threatening access to medication, vaccines, screenings and other services necessary for healthy communities. By leveraging these insights, we are better able to advocate on behalf of our customers to ensure community providers remain vital sites of care. The second example is using dispensing insights from our relationships with providers to inform biopharma partners on key product trends. One recent initiative provided actionable insights into the treatment of bladder cancer, where Cencora combined clinical and market research to show how community oncologists were implementing new treatment paradigms. We are expanding the areas in which we offer these data insights, providing valuable services to our partners as they navigate the ever-changing healthcare landscape. Next, we are deepening our strategic relationship with customers and partners by taking an active approach to learning from them. Through Cencora's industry-leading portfolio, we've built a premier customer base end-to-end throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain dedicated to driving positive pharmaceutical outcomes. Executing on our strategic priority of leading with market leaders, we are committed to deeply understanding our customer strategies and, in turn, anticipating their needs and enhancing our capabilities. Just this past week, teams from across Cencora were actively engaged at a number of industry events, ranging from community pharmacies and oncology practices to the largest chain drug stores as well as biopharma companies, allowing our team members to return to our offices equipped with insights to share with colleagues. I'm proud of our significant presence at these prominent industry events where the scope of Cencora's capabilities and expansive partnerships were on full display. At a leading conference focused on specialty pharma, our team members spent time actively learning from partners across the healthcare landscape while also providing thought leadership through their participation on panels addressing policy and healthcare access. We were also highly engaged in the largest gathering of chained pharmacies, working to deepen our partnerships. In Washington, D.C., a group of our leaders joined community pharmacists from across the country for meetings with legislators to bring attention to the critical role pharmacists play in their local communities as trusted providers of care. The teams attended over 100 meetings with legislators. Additionally, we gathered with our community oncology partners, where the focus was on the continuous evolution of care and need for empowered advocates to ensure the best patient outcomes in the community setting. By engaging in these forums, we develop a deeper understanding of our partners' needs and gain valuable perspective to allow us to better serve them and their patients. And finally, we are strengthening our global leadership in specialty medications by deepening our offering across customer channels. Executing our strategic imperative of expanding leadership in specialty, our internationally scaled 3PL service is differentiated as we serve pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly seeking partners that can support products across multiple geographies. We've integrated our U.S. and European 3PL businesses, creating an internationally unified network. By doing this, we offer manufacturers deep local expertise along with multinational reach for their products, driving successful launches and positioning Cencora as the partner of choice. We are increasing our capabilities in key markets in Europe, enhancing our pharmaceutical logistics offering, which will power our leadership in specialty across the continent. We're also strengthening our leadership in specialty in the United States by deepening our offerings across provider channels. One example is our approach with health systems, paving the way for us to build upon our critical role in distribution and offering an ecosystem of services health systems increasingly require as the use of specialty medications rise. Our teams have developed solutions to address the needs of health systems large and small. Our solutions, designed in partnership with leading health systems, support comprehensive patient-centric care. By investing in end-to-end solutions across sites of care, we strengthen our capabilities to support providers, manufacturers and patients. In closing and before I hand it over to Jim, the financial strength we are reporting today is powered by the size and organic growth of our U.S. segment, resulting from many years of strategic investments, strong execution and leading partnerships. In our international segment, we are navigating a period of market softness for some of our businesses. However, we are confident we are well-positioned and expect to capture opportunities as demand rebounds. I hope each of you take away from my prepared remarks today that while we are performing well, there is no complacency at Cencora. While we execute driving performance in the short term, we are laser-focused on building end-to-end capabilities and partnerships that will enable continued growth over the long term. Strategically deploying capital, investing in talent, digital capabilities and enterprise productivity. I want to end with another thank you to the Cencora team members who guided by our purpose, drive a differentiated customer experience, actively learn and apply insights to drive innovation and deliver value for all of our stakeholders. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for an in-depth review of our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2025 guidance. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Thanks, Bob. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, before I turn to my prepared remarks, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. In our second fiscal quarter, Cencora delivered strong financial performance as our teams capitalized on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. We benefited from our positioning and continued investment in attractive growing areas of the market like specialty, driving adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16%. To reflect our strong U.S. Healthcare Solutions earnings performance to date and expectations for continued growth in the second half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS. Before reviewing the revised guidance details, I'll first turn to a review of our consolidated second quarter results, starting with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $75.5 billion, up 10%, primarily driven by revenue growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment as we continue to benefit from volume growth, including continued growth in GLP-1 products. Excluding sales of GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 8%. Turning now to gross profit. Consolidated gross profit was $2.9 billion, up 15% due to growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.86%, an increase of 16 basis points, primarily driven by the gross profit contribution from our acquisition of Retina Consultants of America. Moving now to operating expenses. In the quarter, consolidated operating expenses were $1.7 billion, up 15%, driven primarily by the RCA acquisition. Excluding RCA, operating expense growth was modest as we continue to focus on identifying and implementing productivity initiatives while also investing in our business and operations to support our customers' growth. Consolidated operating income was $1.2 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the prior-year quarter due to excellent performance in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which I will discuss in more detail in the segment-level results. Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the second quarter. Net interest expense was $104 million, an increase of $40 million versus the prior-year quarter. This increase primarily reflects the interest expense associated with the $3.3 billion in recently issued senior notes and a term-loan to finance a portion of the RCA acquisition on top of our intra-period short-term borrowings associated with typical seasonal factors, minus the repayment of senior notes that matured in March, which we have not yet refinanced. Turning now to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 20.8%. Given our year-to-date effective income tax rate, we would expect our full-year tax rate to be slightly below 21%. Finally, our diluted share count was 195.1 million shares, a 3% decrease compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by approximately $1.0 billion in opportunistic share repurchases over the past year, including $50 million in February in concurrence with Walgreens Boots Alliance's sale of shares. As we look to the balance of the fiscal year, we do not anticipate further share repurchases as we focus on deleveraging following the RCA acquisition. Regarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we ended March with $2 billion of cash and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow slightly below $200 million as a result of strong adjusted free cash flow in our second quarter. We continue to expect full-year adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now, I'll turn to our segment results for the second quarter. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, revenue was $68.3 billion, up 11%, as we continue to see strong utilization trends, including growth in GLP-1s and growth in sales of specialty products to specialty physician practices and health systems, where we are particularly benefiting from our strategy of partnering with market leaders. In the quarter, sales of GLP-1 products increased $2.2 billion or 36% year-over-year. While this is clearly a significant year-over-year increase, I will note that this represents a 10% sequential decline in GLP-1 sales from the first quarter. Excluding sales of GLP-1 products, U.S. segment revenue growth would have been 9% for the quarter. Separately, I will note that, as previously contemplated, there is no significant increase in U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue resulting from the acquisition of RCA, as sales from our specialty physician services business to RCA are now being eliminated in consolidation. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 23% to $1.0 billion, driven by growth across our Human and Animal Health distribution businesses and the contribution from RCA, offset by a smaller-than-expected COVID vaccine headwind. In the quarter, we saw particularly strong performance in specialty as utilization across health systems and specialty physician practices was robust, and we benefited from the continued uptake of biosimilars in these customer channels. As it relates to COVID, in the quarter, we saw higher-than-expected sales of COVID-19 vaccines that resulted in our COVID-related headwind being approximately half the size we indicated on our first quarter earnings call. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions' revenue was $7.2 billion, up approximately 1% on an as-reported basis and up 6% on a constant-currency basis due to our growth at our European distribution business. International Healthcare Solutions' operating income was $159 million, down 17% on an as-reported basis and down 14% on a constant-currency basis. The decline was driven by continued softness for our global specialty logistics business as clinical trial activity remains subdued, and we had a difficult comparison for our European distribution business due to manufacturers' price adjustments in a developing market country in the prior year, which we called out on our second quarter earnings call last year. Excluding the impact of the manufacturers' price adjustments, we saw solid operational performance within our European distribution business, particularly in 3PL. That completes the review of our segment-level results. I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2025 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance for certain metrics on a GAAP basis, so the following information is provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, except with respect to revenue and share count. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant-currency basis. I will start with adjusted diluted EPS guidance and then provide detail on the income statement items contributing to the increase. We are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2025 EPS guidance and now expect EPS to be in the range of $15.70 to $15.95, up from our previous range of $15.30 to $15.60 and representing growth of 14% to 16%. The updated guidance reflects our strong second quarter operating income performance in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and a lower expected contribution from the International Healthcare Solutions segment. Additionally, in connection with consolidating the operating results of RCA, we made the accounting determination that the approximately 15% of equity that is owned by RCA physicians and management represents a contingent liability to Cencora as opposed to a non-controlling interest. Cencora will be consolidating the entirety of RCA with no non-controlling interest elimination at the net income and EPS level. Our prior guidance assumed a non-controlling interest reduction in EPS. Therefore, this determination will result in a higher-than-expected EPS contribution from RCA for the fiscal year, but has no impact on our operating income results or operating income guidance. We are pleased with the integration progress we are making with the RCA team and are excited about the opportunities we have to drive positive patient outcomes by leveraging our collective strengths. Now, moving to revenue. Our consolidated revenue guidance is unchanged, and we expect growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%. At the segment level, we are updating our International Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth outlook and now expect as-reported revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4%, down from our previous range of 4% to 5%. On a constant-currency basis, we now expect International Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 8%, down from the previous range of 7% to 9%. While we are leaving our revenue guidance unchanged at both the consolidated and U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment level, we anticipate our growth will be at the bottom end of the respective ranges. In the second half of the year, we will see revenue growth impacted by a couple of factors, including beginning to lap tougher GLP-1 growth comparisons in the second half when the market saw product supply constraints subside in the prior year, and declining sales of high-priced mail-order products, which now have biosimilar competition in PBM formularies. These dynamics contribute to the lower revenue growth expected in the second half of the year, but are positive for our profit margins. Moving to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 13.5% to 15.5%, up from our previous guidance of 11.5% to 13.5%. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 17.5% to 19.5%, up from our prior range of 14.5% to 16.5%. The updated guidance reflects our strong business performance to date and continued good pharmaceutical utilization. Turning now to International Healthcare Solutions segment. On an as-reported basis, we now expect operating income to be down 4% to down 1% versus our prior expectations for operating income to be flat. The updated guidance range reflects the continued demand softness in the clinical trial and outsourced pharma services markets, impacting our full year expectations for our higher-margin businesses in this segment, offset in part by the positive impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. On a constant-currency basis, we now expect segment operating income to be down 3% to flat. Moving to share count, we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 195 million to 195.5 million based on our current share count. That concludes our updated full-year guidance assumptions. In closing, the Cencora team has delivered another strong quarter of financial performance as our team members worked collaboratively with our customers and partners to drive a differentiated experience through their expertise and solutions-oriented approach. Our team members and our strategic partnerships are foundational to our success. Our continued investment in the team's development, our focus on enhancing capabilities and emphasis on productivity will further enhance our ability to drive value for all our stakeholders. Now, I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe I just wanted to dig into the strength in the AOI of the U.S. Healthcare business. Given that strength that we saw in the quarter, how do you kind of see that playing out for the rest of the year? And then, if we talk about some of the drivers on a longer-term basis, how do we see the sort of continuation of those over the longer period? Thanks.
Bob Mauch: Hi, Elizabeth. Thanks for the question. This is Bob. I'll take that one. I think, where you got in your question in terms of the drivers are how I'll answer because, when you think about Cencora, I think there are three things to think about when you're looking at kind of long-term performance, and we do believe our strong performance will continue. One is how well we're positioned in the growing parts of the pharmaceutical market. So, obviously, we talk a lot about how well we're positioned in the specialty market. That is where most of the innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is happening. And we're very well positioned there with the biopharma manufacturers and we certainly expect our position to continue and the innovation to continue. The second piece is how well we're positioned with providers. And we spend a lot of time, again, talking about our strength in the independent community specialty practices, which is excellent and we expect that to continue. But we're also very well positioned across the continuum of sites of care, from the largest pharmacies to the smallest community pharmacies to specialty pharmacy. I highlighted health systems today in the prepared remarks. So, we look at the market growth in terms of product innovation in specialty, we're well positioned there. When you think about the provider base, we're very well positioned there. And the third and important piece is just the excellent purpose-driven team members that we have here at Cencora who are spending a lot of time thinking about not just how do we execute in the short term, but how are we going to continue to innovate, build services and build partnerships for the long term. And also, referencing back to my prepared remarks, made a specific point of the amount of time that Cencora leaders are spending out with industry stakeholders, whether that's in Washington, D.C. or our provider customers once again, and the intention there is to make sure that we're listening carefully, we're learning, we bring that back to the organization that allows us to be meeting the needs and exceeding the needs of those provider customers. So, I think when you think about the market growth, how well we're positioned and then the -- honestly the growth mindset that we have at Cencora and our commitment to actively learning and continue to innovate, it's what gives us the belief that the performance will continue over the long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Cherny: Thanks for taking the question. And again, congrats on another strong beat and raise. Maybe, Bob, to parse through Elizabeth's question a little bit more and particularly dive in more on specialty, Cencora has a long history of being a market leader on all things specialty-oriented. As you think about the contributors of specialty to growth, how much can you unpack in terms of what you see as market growth versus share gains versus additional value-add services and add-ons you've able to build out? You're very much -- we'd agree with the fact that you're in the right place on a go-forward basis relative to the market is growing, but curious as the market continues to grow in various different pacing, where you see the best opportunities for outperformance beyond that?
Jim Cleary: Yeah, so thanks a lot for the question, Michael. I'll take a shot at it. And so, we saw terrific results, really extraordinary results in the first half in our U.S. business. In fact, if we kind of look at our Q2 beat, really all of the U.S. Q2 beat versus our internal expectations is due to organic growth from our core U.S. distribution business. And of course, we've talked about some time that that's driven by utilization trends, it's driven by broad-based performance, and in particular, it's driven by sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems. And so, I would say, as we look at specialty, it's really been -- it's been broad-based performance and it's been very good results both with regard to physician practices and health systems. And then, of course, our recent acquisition of RCA and our investment in 2023 of OneOncology, we look at that as really the natural evolution of our specialty business, because, of course, we're very strong in distribution, we're very strong in wraparound services like GPO. And so, we view the MSO space as adding additional value-added services to the same customer base that we've had terrific success with for quite some time. And so, thanks a lot for the question, and I think Bob has something he'd like to add.
Bob Mauch: Yeah. Thanks, Jim. And Michael, I would just add our commitment to continuing to invest in the strengths that we have. You've seen over a period of time, we're investing in services. The MSO expansion is a good example of that. And we're going to continue to make those investments as we move forward to make sure that we're positioned well to support the biopharma manufacturers as well as the providers. So, we think that intention to do that, the commitment that we have to do that, will allow us to continue to perform well.
Operator: Our next question is from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to focus on D.C. and the thoughts around tariffs. It's believed that the Trump administration will come out with something in the next week or so. Can you just remind us on each side of your business? My understanding would be on the branded side, kind of similar to what we saw on the flip side with insulin. When prices go down, your economics kind of stay the same. Is there any variability if we were to think that prices go up? And then, there's been a lot of questions on the generic side, if we think back to when there was generic price inflation, and again, a tariff could add some kind of inflationary component to this. How do we think about each of those components and how it impacts your business and how you're thinking about it for your customer?
Jim Cleary: Yeah, sure. I'll take a stab at that. Lisa, thanks a lot for the question. And of course, we continue to monitor the evolutions around tariffs in the pharmaceutical market. We have teams in place that are analyzing the impact of tariffs on our business and very importantly on the supply chain. And to answer your question, what I'll say is, as it relates to our business, we have not called out any material impacts as a result of tariffs. As a reminder, we're pharmaceutical-centric, and the manufacturers are the importer of record for pharmaceuticals. Now, to get to part of your question, our main focus is ensuring patients have access to life-saving medications and we're supporting our upstream and downstream partners as they navigate the uncertainty. And additionally, we'll continue to advocate on behalf of our customers to ensure that they receive adequate reimbursement for the valuable healthcare services that they provide. But just to reiterate, as it relates to our business, we haven't called out any material impacts as a result of tariffs. Thank you for the question.
Operator: Next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. George, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yeah, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And I've kind of got a two-parter. Number one, James, if you could kind of quickly walk through the RCA impact on gross margin expansion in the quarter, I think that would be helpful, because there's some moving pieces there relating to the way the equity stub -- the non-owned equity stub is being treated and the eliminations from the sales into the practices. And then, my second part would be just kind of the growth where you guys have set yourselves up in specialty is amazing. I was just hoping you might give us any quantitative color on how much of the U.S. drug business is now like the Part B business versus the Part D business and maybe kind of the growth characteristics you're seeing in each of those. Kind of trying to think of the business and kind of the two big segments from a distribution perspective. Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Okay. I'll take the first half of that, and that is on RCA. You asked initially about gross profit. And yeah, as we look at our consolidated results, RCA does add meaningfully to gross profit margin and operating margin. And one reason why is that, it is a higher-margin business than our core distribution business. And then, of course, the other reason why is that, now that it is a subsidiary of Cencora, we eliminate the sales from our specialty physician services business to RCA so that we don't double-count those sales. And so, as a result of that, it adds meaningfully to our gross profit margin and our operating margin. And then, I think the second part of the business kind of got to the accounting. And so, let me just kind of address that for you also. Our prior guidance when we talked in February incorporated 100% of the operating income for RCA and contemplated a reduction in EPS due to an expected non-controlling interest reduction. But as I said in my prepared remarks, after closing and consolidating the RCA business, we made the accounting determination that the approximately 15% of equity that's owned by RCA physicians and management represents a contingent liability to Cencora as opposed to a non-controlling interest. The results of that is that there is a higher-than-expected EPS contribution for the fiscal year, but it has no impact on our operating income results or guidance. And so, just to give you a little bit more detail there, for EPS, the approximately $0.14 of the increase in EPS guidance is a result of the RCA accounting determination. And then, the rest is from our core U.S. distribution business. And so, if you look at our increase in EPS guidance, the significant majority of the increase in EPS guidance comes from our core U.S. distribution business, which more than offsets a decrease in guidance for international. And just one final thing is that the $0.14 increase in EPS from the RCA accounting determination may be higher than some of you are initially modeling. And the reason for that is that the 85% of operating income covers all of the interest expense. So, the incremental 15% of operating income falls right to pre-tax income. So, I think that fully answers your question. And one other thing I will add is that as it relates to the guidance update, I know kind of everything from the standpoint of revenue, GP, and OI for RCA is the same as previously guided.
Operator: The next question comes from...
Jim Cleary: Thank you for the question.
Operator: ...Charles Rhyee of TD Cowen. Charles, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the quarter, guys. I actually want to ask about international real quickly here. Obviously, the guidance has taken down a little bit here. And just wanted to maybe dive a little bit into more about the comments about softness in the specialty logistics business. You mentioned that trial activity is subdued. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing here? Obviously, there's a lot going on in the pharma market, particularly with potential tariffs and a lot of things that the administration is undertaking here currently. Maybe you can give us a sense for what you're hearing from clients from pharma companies in terms of sort of what they're seeing currently and how they're approaching sort of business development here and clinical trial starts in particular. And when you're saying it's subdued, does that mean you're just seeing a lot of delays? Maybe you could just kind of give us a little bit more details on that, that'd be great. Thank you.
Jim Cleary: Yeah, thanks a lot for the question. So, as we and other players in the market have been calling out, clinical trial activity has been subdued, which has been pressuring some of our businesses in the International Healthcare Solutions segment, particularly demand for global specialty logistics and earlier-stage pharma consulting projects. And the rebound has been slower than we would have expected, resulting in segment performance for our global specialty logistics business to be below the expectations we outlined in February. And we really haven't seen demand begin to ramp materially for our consulting business. And so, as a result of the performance to date and to incorporate a wider range of recovery paths for demand in global specialty logistics, we reduced our International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income guidance. But I will say that our end-to-end service offering is resonating with manufacturers, and we feel confident in our ability to capitalize on a rebound in demand when it occurs given our unique positioning in the market.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Eric, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Appreciate the detail on RCA. I'd like to ask a question kind of about the MSO operations more broadly. I know that each of them looks quite different and the share of income can be quite different, but can you help us with your view of the profit stream? And we've talked a lot about the opportunity. When we think about how much of that opportunity is tied to drug versus medical or government versus commercial, can you provide a general framework for that, both to think about the opportunity and the risk of some of what is occurring in the market?
Bob Mauch: Eric, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. I would begin with, we're excited and confident about the income streams within the MSO space. As you said, they're different, and the services that an MSO -- what oncology would provide to an oncology practice are similar and different than RCA would provide to a retina specialist. But when you put that together, we believe it's a really good fit for our expansion of services in both of those spaces. So, as we discussed and as you know well, Eric, the strength that we have in both distribution and the GPO was there, and by adding the MSO services, we're able to build on our capabilities in supporting those physicians. One thing that to reinforce is something else that we're excited about in terms of a future growth proposition is the clinical trial services that are provided now at RCA, and that will -- we believe we can expand into OneOncology. And that's another example of how we'll be well-positioned with both the biopharma partners as well as the providers.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Mizuho Securities. Steven, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on these results. I had a question that was kind of similar to Charles just on the International Solutions and your comments about the clinical trial activity remaining subdued. Really, the only kind of follow-up questions there were just, I can't recall at the top of my head just how fragmented versus how concentrated your customer base is in that business. So, were there maybe just some customers where activity on clinical trials was subdued or was it definitely widespread phenomenon across the majority of your book? And then, is there any chance you're able to put a number just on the approximate percent decline in clinical trial activity you're seeing across your book? I mean, we're talking single-digit decline, double-digit? Just want to get just some rough sense for that. Thanks.
Bob Mauch: Yeah, thanks for the question. It's market-based. So, what we're seeing are the very same things that you're seeing across the market from other players. So, our customer base is broad, and as we're seeing, there has been a decline in clinical trial starts over the past few years that we all in the space are eagerly awaiting a bit of a rebound there. And within our specialty logistics business, it's part of our end-to-end service. So, when we are talking to biopharma companies about commercialization and them bringing services to market, we're talking to them about lots of different services from consulting to 3PL services to the specialty logistics services that we're talking about here. So, we wouldn't call it anything different than what is being observed across the market. I think there was a peak in trial activity during the COVID pandemic that has been reduced. And so, we're all -- we're working through that. But as Jim said earlier, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're well-positioned with our services, with our partners and customers and expect to be a partner of choice as that market rebounds.
Operator: The next question comes from Allen Lutz of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Allen Lutz: Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the really strong results here. Bob, you called out really good growth in the specialty provider channel. Can you talk a little bit about growth in your different verticals there? Was there any standout as we think about growth in oncology versus retina? Are there any other specific areas to call out? And then, as you think about the utilization rate from 2024 into the first quarter of 2025, was there any deceleration, any acceleration either at the top level or within any of the specific verticals you operate in? Thanks.
Bob Mauch: Yeah, thanks for the question, Allen. So, we don't break out the specific commercial components of the business. But I will say, and Jim mentioned this earlier, the performance is broad-based. So, we often talk about the community specialty space for very good reason, but I made a specific point in prepared remarks to talk about the health system space and others, because we're well-positioned for specialty growth across all sites of care. So -- and we're seeing them all grow. So, it's something that we're, again, happy to be well-positioned there. We're working hard to make sure that we're adding value to our biopharma partners as well as the providers, but wouldn't comment specifically on any differences in growth across those segments. I would go back to the reason that we're often focused on specialty physicians and oncology as the oncology space continues to be the area of largest growth and largest opportunity.
Jim Cleary: Bob, and just the only thing I'll add, and this goes, of course, back to our results in our press release and in my prepared remarks is, I mean, we did have -- just have had very strong performance in the first half and we're just so pleased to be able to increase our operating income guidance for the year by 3 percentage points at the bottom end of the range and the top end of the range in the U.S., 17.5% growth to 19.5% growth. And really driven by the things you were asking about, utilization and our broad-based strength in specialty.
Operator: The next question comes from Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Daniel, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter here. I had a similar question to Allen's, but maybe I'll ask it in a bit of a different way. Health systems seem to be getting a lot more airtime this quarter than in previous quarters. So, I'm just curious why that is. Are you seeing anything particularly strong in health systems this quarter on the provider side? And as we think about the investments that you need to make to support health systems, is there anything that you would call out as kind of a near-term investment in that channel? Thank you.
Bob Mauch: Thanks for the question. From my perspective, the reason that we're focusing a bit on health systems here is for the simple reason that we want the investor base to understand how well-positioned we are for specialty growth across sites of care. And again for very good reason, we focus on the community practices and we're making investments there, but we're also working very closely with our health systems customers and other customers to make sure that we have capabilities and a solution set that help them continue to capture the specialty growth that is happening within their site of care. So, no, it's not anything in particular, it's not anything that's changed, but it is something that we're trying to explain which is the broad-based positioning that we have for specialty growth. And again, that's what gives us confidence in the continuing growth that we will have.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Kevin, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick first one, which is, just trying to understand the math on the EPS guide increase. So, $0.14 came from HCA. And can you just -- or RCA, excuse me. And can you remind us when you said that there was a better than -- sort of the loss of COVID was half, what was the expectation like, what did that actually mean in terms of EPS? And I apologize, I couldn't find it in my notes. And then, the actual -- the real question is, of the remaining sort of upside to guidance, I know you keep saying better specialty and, like, are you actually getting better economics anywhere through the portfolio than you had been before? Is it a reflection of your fixed cost and the fact that you've kept your operating expenses ex-RCA flat? I'm just trying to understand -- or is it simply mix? I'm just trying to understand where the upside is coming from. If it's specific to, "hey, you know what, we're actually generating better economics on similar drugs," or if it's, "our cost base is lower and utilization is higher and we're able to run that through," or "our overall mix is better such that the margin is better?"
Jim Cleary: Okay, great. Thank you for the question. Let me try to address those things. And you're asking about what's impacting the increase in guidance. And of course, our increase in EPS guidance was $0.40 at the bottom end of the range and $0.35 at the top end of the range. You asked about COVID, and the COVID headwind in the most recent quarter was about half of what we had previously expected. And we had expected a headwind in the $30 million range and it was a headwind more like in the $15 million range. And so, about half of our expectation. And then, you asked a number of questions with regard to things that are benefiting us, and I would say, mix is one of the things that I see us benefiting from is -- we see just the specialty part of our business growing faster and that's really benefiting us from a mix standpoint. We see biosimilar growth and that's benefiting us from a mix standpoint. And so, one of the things that you see in our guidance is -- and there are a couple different reasons for it, one of which we called out earlier on the call, but is that we see operating income growth that's exceeding revenue growth, and some of those mixed things and higher-margin businesses are benefiting us there. So, we are, of course, very pleased with the increase in guidance that we've put out today. And so, thank you very much for asking about it.
Operator: The last question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Erin, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. I understand you don't have future share buybacks in the guide, and the focus on -- is on deleveraging near-term, but just as you think about the rationale behind RCA and other potential MSO-type deals, I guess, will the RCA deal help to explain your future focus from an M&A standpoint as we think about your learning so far there? And then, a second part of my question, maybe this is somewhat related to Kevin's too, but like in terms of the economics, is there any sort of change from a GLP-1 perspective? I mean, you mentioned the dynamic into the second half, which should be just more of a revenue dynamic from my understanding, but any sort of potential in terms of improved economics or like presumably oral solids could be more favorable for you as well, but how are you thinking about that segment too? Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Yeah. And so, let me start off with both of those things, MSOs and capital deployment, and GLP-1s. We've been very pleased with our entrance into MSOs, both with regard to the investment in OneOncology and the acquisition of RCA. And as you know, we own 35% of OneOncology, but there is a put/call structure with our partners there, which makes it likely that from a capital deployment standpoint, we would own all of that business at some point in time, which speaks to a good deal of our capital deployment over the next few years. And of course, we've been, as I said, very pleased with our experiences thus far. And then, on GLP-1s, there's really no change from an economic standpoint. It's clearly been a driver of our revenue. And as we've indicated in the past, it is profitable for us. They are profitable for us, but they are minimally profitable for us. And I think that addresses your questions, Erin. Thank you.
Operator: We currently have no further questions. So, I will hand back to Bob Mauch, CEO, for closing remarks.
Bob Mauch: Thank you very much. Thanks all for joining the call today. We're very proud of the strong performance and guidance raise that we've been able to announce today. And you can count us -- count on us to continue focusing on building on our strengths, learning and leading for market leaders, driving efficiency through productivity, investing in our talent, data capabilities, and all of that will further differentiate Cencora to biopharma partners and providers. Thank you very much all.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2025 Q1  (2025-02-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome everyone to the Cencora Q1 fiscal year 2025 earnings call. My name is Becky and I’ll be your Operator today. During the presentation, you can register a question by pressing star followed by one on your keypad. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two. Should you have any issues, please press star followed by zero for Operator support. I will now hand over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Bennett Murphy to begin. Please go ahead.
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora’s fiscal 2025 first quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Bob Mauch, President and CEO, and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today’s call, we’ll be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today’s press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com. We’ve also posted a slide presentation to accompany today’s press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including but not limited to EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today’s press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. Cencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without express permission of the company. You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today’s remarks by management. We ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Mauch: Thank you Bennett. Hi everyone, and thank you for joining Cencora’s fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I want to thank the 40,000-plus global Cencora team members. It’s because of their purpose-driven approach, expertise and dedication to meeting the needs of customers and patients worldwide that Jim and I have the pleasure of reporting strong Q1 results and updated guidance today. Cencora delivered a strong start to our fiscal year with revenue growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. We are also excited to share that due to the strength and execution in our U.S. business, we are raising guidance for the fiscal year. We benefit from our position as a leading healthcare solutions provider with a pharmaceutical-centric strategy and a purpose driven culture which enables us to capitalize on positive industry trends and innovation. Today, I will emphasize three areas of progress in executing our strategy and driving performance in the quarter: first, advancing our leadership in specialty, where we took important steps forward; second, driving efficiency and productivity to advance technology and expert teams across the enterprise; and third, executing with a customer-centric mindset as we continue to collaborate and innovate with our customers throughout the supply chain. I’ll begin with advancing our leadership in specialty. Our leadership supporting specialty providers is a key differentiator and growth driver for Cencora, and we have evolved our service offerings over time. Over decades, we’ve deepened our relationships with our specialty provider customers with the expansion of specialty GPOs and other capabilities. The logical next step is through managed service organizations. This is in line with our long term commitment to support community providers, an extension of that work. After expending significant time understanding the MSO business through our investment in OneOncology, we announced the acquisition of RCA - Retina Consultants of America, and we are incredibly happy to have completed that acquisition on January 2. RCA is a leading retina MSO differentiated by its leadership team, clinical excellence, premier physician partner practices, and positioning at the forefront of retina innovation through its clinical research capabilities. This acquisition, like our investment in OneOncology, fits squarely into our strategy and growth by expanding our leadership in specialty in a high growth pharmaceutical-centric segment, building on our services for our customers and positioning us well in a medical specialty that has seen significant innovation. While it’s early days, we’re excited about what we believe our combined organizations will accomplish together. Next is driving efficiency and productivity through advanced technology and expert teams. We are focused on continuously enhancing our capabilities and increasing efficiency through advanced technology and collaboration across our global teams. Across the organization, we are working to streamline operations, optimize business processes, and unlock enterprise-wide value. In the quarter, we worked throughout our business to upgrade system to safeguard the resiliency of our infrastructure and ensure we maintain best-in-class standards. This allows us to streamline our operations for enhanced customer satisfaction. All of this aligned with our digital transformation strategy focuses on enhancing customer experience and accelerating decision making as we leverage global talent and capabilities to enhance efficiency, scalability and innovation, all while meeting the needs of our partners both now and in the future. Finally, executing with a customer-centric mindset and innovating with our customers. At Cencora, we lead with market leaders. Our portfolio of customers is second to none, driving innovation through drug development, elevating patient care and access through their patient-first approaches. Cencora team members with world-class expertise are working in cross-functional teams, collaborating with customers to meet their evolving needs. In the quarter, we were able to displace solutions created as a result of working closely with our customers at our inaugural product showcase. Our product showcase enabled us to demonstrate advanced solutions in areas like inventory planning and management, specialty GPO, as well as cell therapy and gene therapy solutions. Another example is our enterprise leadership team just returned from the United Kingdom, visiting elements of our international operations, spending time on the ground with our leaders, and engaging with several top biopharma customers. Our global footprint and expertise set us apart and gives us the unique ability to combine local expertise with global infrastructure, best meeting the needs of biopharma companies. We are focusing on building on our strengths and value proposition to pharma with our services like market access, regulatory, pharmaco-vigilance, and our unparalleled 3PL and specialty logistics networks. This differentiated approach is strategically important to our biopharma customer relationships over the long term and it’s how we capitalize on growth of specialty products in the European market, which has a different structure than in the U.S. but is similar in that our foundation of pharmaceutical distribution and portfolio of services enables us to support pharmaceutical innovation while growing our higher growth, higher margin services. In closing and before I hand it over to Jim, Cencora’s performance is powered by an amazing global workforce who are advancing our leadership in specialty, driving efficiency and productivity through advanced technology and expert teams, and executing with a customer-centric mindset as we continue to collaborate and innovate with our customers. Looking ahead, we will maintain focus, executing against our strategy and amplifying the areas that are fundamental to our success, driving increased value for all our stakeholders. Thank you once again to all Cencora team members, and with that, I’ll turn the call over to Jim for an in-depth review of our first quarter results and our updated fiscal 2025 guidance.
James Cleary: Thanks Bob. Good morning and good afternoon everyone. As a reminder before I turn to my prepared remarks, unless otherwise stated, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. Cencora delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as our U.S. healthcare solutions segment outperformed expectations due to strong prescription utilization trends, and we capitalized on the growth of our industry, the continued momentum of our business, and the expertise of our teams. As Bob mentioned, adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to $3.73 in the first quarter, and for the second time in fiscal 2025, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year. I’ll now turn to a review of our consolidated first quarter results, starting with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $81.5 billion, up 13% primarily due to strong revenue growth in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment as we continued to benefit from overall market and volume growth, including increased sales of GLP-1 products. Excluding sales of GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 9%. Turning now to gross profit, consolidated gross profit was $2.5 billion, up 6% with growth in both the U.S. and international healthcare solution segments. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.11%, a decrease of 20 basis points driven by the continued increase in sales of low margin GLP-1 products combined with lower sales of commercial COVID-19 vaccines and a lack of sales of exclusive COVID-19 therapies, all of which negatively impacted our gross profit margin versus the prior year quarter. Moving now to operating expenses, in the quarter consolidated operating expenses were $1.6 billion, up approximately 6% due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses to support revenue growth. Consolidated operating income was $949 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to 10% growth in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment, which I will discuss in more detail in the segment-level results. Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the first quarter, net interest expense was $28 million, down 31% due to higher interest income resulting from higher average investment cash balances and interest rates, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. Turning now to income taxes, our effective income tax rate was 20% compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. Finally, our diluted share count was 195.2 million shares, a 3% decline compared to the prior year first quarter driven by approximately $1.5 billion of opportunistic share repurchases during the period of February through October of 2024. As a reminder, as it relates to capital allocation, in the near term we will prioritize deleveraging given the recent RCA acquisition. Regarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we used $2.7 billion of cash in our operations during the quarter, resulting in negative adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion due to the timing of flows at the end of the calendar year. We continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I’ll turn to our segment results for the first quarter. U.S. healthcare solution segment revenue was $74 billion, up 14% as we continued to see broad-based strong utilization trends including continued volume growth in GLP-1s and growth in sales to specialty physician practice and health systems. In the quarter, sales of GLP-1 products were up $3.2 billion, representing a 53% increase year-over-year. Excluding sales of GLP-1 products, U.S. segment revenue growth would have been 10% for the quarter. U.S. healthcare solution segment operating income increased 10% to $767 million, driven by growth at our human health distribution businesses, including specialty products, and across commercial segments including animal health, more than offsetting the significant headwind from lower sales of COVID-19 vaccines and lack of sales of exclusive COVID-19 therapies in the current year quarter. To provide a little more detail on the headwinds, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 the contribution from COVID-19 vaccines was about half that of the prior year quarter, and we expect a similar sized operating income headwind in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, meaning no significant expected contribution from COVID vaccines in our second quarter of fiscal 2025; and as it relates to exclusive therapies, as a reminder, the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was the final quarter of contribution from exclusive COVID-19 therapies which contributed $0.06 to our first quarter of fiscal 2024. I will now turn to our international healthcare solutions segment. In the quarter, international healthcare solutions revenue was $7.5 billion, up approximately 6% on an as-reported basis and up almost 9% on a constant currency basis, due to increased sales at our European distribution business. International healthcare solutions operating income was $182 million, down 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant currency basis. In the quarter, lower operating income at our global specialty logistics business was partially offset by better results at our European distribution business. Our global specialty logistics business had a strong quarter in the prior year period, and this quarter was more challenging as clinical trial activity remained subdued. The business remains focused on its pipeline and targeted in its regional prioritization of new volume growth. We expect to see business performance improve later in fiscal 2025 as demand for our premium service capabilities increases from its current levels. That completes the review of our segment level results. I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2025 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance for certain metrics on a GAAP basis, so the following information is provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis except with respect to revenue. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. I will start with adjusted diluted EPS guidance and then provide detail on the income statement items contributing to the increase. On January 2, we announced the closing of the RCA acquisition and raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to the range of $15.15 to $15.45 to reflect the nine-month contribution from RCA in addition to continued momentum in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment. Today, we are pleased to again raise our full-year diluted EPS guidance to a range of $15.25 to $15.55, a $0.10 increase to both the top and bottom end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to better reflect the strength and momentum exhibited by the U.S. healthcare solutions segment. Now moving to revenue, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%, up from the previous expectations of 7% to 9%. The updated guidance range primarily reflects an increase in our U.S. healthcare solutions segment revenue growth, where we now expect growth of 9% to 11%, up from our previous expectation of 7% to 9% growth due primarily to continued strong organic revenue growth and to a lesser extent RCA, which was already a distribution customer. In the international healthcare solutions segment, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5%, down from the previous range of 7% to 9% to reflect updated foreign currency translation rates. On a constant currency basis, international healthcare solutions segment revenue guidance remains unchanged at 7% to 9% growth. Moving to operating income, we expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 11.5% to 13.5%, up from our previous guidance of 5% to 6.5%. In the U.S. healthcare solutions segment, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 14.5% to 16.5%, up from our prior range of 5% to 6.5%. Once again, segment-level guidance reflects expected contributions from our acquisition of RCA and continued strong broad-based growth in the segment, more than offsetting previously discussed COVID-related headwinds. Turning now to the international healthcare solutions segment, on an as-reported basis, we now expect operating income growth to be flat year-over-year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies and lowering the top end of our expectations for the segment. On a constant currency basis, we now expect segment operating income growth to be approximately 5%, narrowed from the previous range of 5% to 6.5% as a result of the slower start for the international segment in the first half of fiscal year 2025. Moving to interest expense, we now expect interest expense to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million, up from our previous range of $150 million to $170 million due to the financing of our acquisition of RCA offset in part by lower net interest expense associated with foreign subsidiaries. From a quarterly cadence perspective, we would expect interest expense to step up meaningfully in the second quarter, similar to the prior year quarter given typical seasonality and cash use as well. Finally, we expect that our full year average share count will be under 196 million shares in fiscal 2025, given where our share count sits today. That concludes our updated full-year guidance assumptions. As it relates to quarterly cadence, I would point out that we expect the second quarter to be the lowest growth quarter in fiscal 2025 with adjusted diluted EPS growth in the mid single digits. This is driven by a few factors. First, as I mentioned earlier, the second quarter is expected to have the highest net interest expense for the fiscal year due to typical seasonality of cash use in addition to the financing costs associated with the RCA acquisition. Second, in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment, we have the COVID-19 vaccine headwind in the second quarter which I referenced earlier, and as it relates to RCA, accretion is expected to ramp over the course of the fiscal year. Finally, the slower start for the international segment in the first half of the fiscal year and the income translation impact from the strength of the U.S. dollar. In closing, Cencora has achieved another strong quarter, demonstrating the efforts of our purpose-driven team members as we continued to execute on our purpose of creating healthier futures. Their dedication and drive to the advancement of our enterprise has a proven track record of success, which we see continuing in fiscal 2025 and creating value for all our customers, partners and stakeholders in the quarters to come. Now I will turn the call over to the Operator to open the line for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Michael Cherny from Leerink Partners. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Michael Cherny: Good morning, and congrats on another great quarter and guidance. Maybe just Bob, given this is your second quarter as CEO, I’ll start on a strategic question and I’ll save some of the other modeling ones for down the road. But as you think now about your specialty business as a whole, it clearly is a driver of some of the outperformance. As you think about the mix of market growth versus your assets, especially off the back of the OneOncology investment and now RCA, where do you think the company is best positioned to outgrow the market on specialty? How much within the guidance do you think is market oriented growth, and where do you think going forward the different dynamics of your specialty growth versus your peers’ could lie in terms of continuing to drive these potential sources of upside?
Robert Mauch: Hi Michael, thank you very much for the question, and also hello to everyone on the call - thank you for joining today. It’s a terrific question, and I’ll just start with the strategy, where we are, and begin with a pharmaceutical centered strategy. We’re going to stay focused on the pharmaceutical sector, and as you know and as we all know, the innovation is significant there. Secondly is we continue to build on our portfolio of services to be sure that we’re well positioned, both inside the United States and outside the United States, to make sure that we are able to support manufacturers and providers as that specialty product growth continues over the long term. Lastly, it really begins with having the best customer portfolio in the business, and we think that’s really where we’re differentiated. We spend a lot of time talking about our customer portfolio, not just in specialty but broadly, and believe that’s a big driver of growth. If you’re with the market-leading providers with the market-leading manufacturers, then that’s going to position us well for growth. Kind of pulling back more specifically in the expansion of services, we’ve spent decades building a suite of services that support community providers from GPO to analytics, and many other services that we provide. We’re confident that the MSO services are the right logical next step for our strategy. It’s important to providers and it’s also very much in line with where we’ve positioned ourselves over a long period of time. I’d just reinforce the fact that we have not only just in the specialty space but across our portfolio invested in services that support community providers, and this is another example of that in part of the market where we expect to continue to lead. Again Michael, thank you very much for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a numbers question. When I look at the strong revenue, especially within the U.S. segment, of roughly 14% in the quarter, the updated guidance is for 9% to 11%, I understand previously 7% to 9%; but can you help with the elements going forward, you know, are we seeing deceleration in some area, is it around GLP-1s, any of the store closings for Walgreens, or just the natural Cencora conservatism? If you can just help us to understand the cadence of that and what you’re seeing as far as potential deceleration in revenue in the quarters going forward.
James Cleary: Lisa, thanks a lot for the question. That’s an excellent question, and of course we had terrific revenue growth in the first quarter, and you’re asking about the U.S. 14% revenue growth, 10% revenue growth ex-GLP-1s. As you noted, in the U.S. we increased our revenue growth guidance by two percentage points at the bottom end and the top end of the range, and our guidance is 9% to 11% revenue growth for the fiscal year, but as you noted, that’s lower than the revenue growth during the first quarter, and of course we increased our adjusted operating income guidance in the U.S. by a lot more than we increased our revenue growth guidance. I would say there are a few call-outs for those sorts of things. One is our assumption in our guidance on GLP-1s is that growth is higher in the first quarter than in the balance of the fiscal year, and we’ll see if that assumption is correct. Of course, we had fantastic growth on GLP-1s in the first quarter - it was 53% growth, and we assume that that growth in Q1, it’s higher than it is in the balance of the year. I think the key call-out here is that that particular assumption has a big impact on revenue growth, but it has a minimal impact on OI. We’ve always indicated that GLP-1s are profitable for us, but minimally profitable for us, so really the revenue growth assumption there doesn’t have much impact on OI growth. Then a second thing is our assumption that we see Humira conversion to biosimilar, and again that’s a revenue driver but it has a minor impact on operating income. As we’ve always said, the main channel there is the lower margin mail order channel, so again this adds a meaningful impact to revenue growth rates but a minor impact to operating income growth rates. Then probably a third thing I would call out is the acquisition of RCA, which we feel great about. It has a meaningful pick-up for us in operating income, but it’s not a large revenue pick-up from RCA. Again, it’s a meaningful pick-up in operating income but not a large pick-up on the revenue side, and compared to the balance of Cencora, RCA is a higher margin but lower revenue business, and they’d already been a distribution customer. Then one kind of detailed thing I’d call out there is we don’t double-count the product revenue. We eliminate the sale of products from our specialty business to RCA so that we don’t count the--double-count the revenue with regard to RCA. Overall, I’d say we feel really good about our guidance, but revenue guidance, the increase is not nearly as high as it is for operating income, but due to the things that I called out, which really don’t impact our strong operating income growth. Thank you for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys, thanks so much for the question, and congrats on a really nice quarter. I had a question on the World Courier business and the pharma services, and sort of how you’re thinking about that over the course of FY25. Could you just maybe go into a little bit more detail about what happened to World Courier in the quarter and how to think about that, versus the rest of the year? Then broadly, where do you think we are in the pharma services demand cycle? It seems like we haven’t gotten too many additional pharma cuts in the last month or two, so are we getting through the cycle? I’d be curious to hear your thoughts on where we are in that.
James Cleary: Great. I will start out with the answer, and of course when you’re asking about World Courier, in our prepared remarks, that’s our global specialty logistics business. It had a more challenging quarter, and to get to your question, it was a result of clinical trial activity remaining somewhat subdued. I will call out that this is a very good business that’s had strong performance for the last 10 years, I’m going to say, but in the near term, it’s been challenging due to the pullback in the market. We do expect in this business to see performance improve later in fiscal year ’25 as demand for our premium service picks up. We were with the management team of this business last week, and they’re very focused on the pipeline and they’re very focused on the regions where we want to accelerate growth. I would say--you know, you kind of asked the question more generally about manufacture commercialization services, and I would just say that the market is somewhat subdued, as I commented on our global specialty logistics business, Elizabeth. I see Bob wants to add something.
Robert Mauch: Yes, thanks Jim. Elizabeth, thank you very much for the question. I think, just to take a step back strategically, and Jim certainly handled the part of your question related to the overall pharma services market, but I do want to just reinforce how important our global footprint is to the future growth of Cencora. It really is a differentiated component of our business. We hear loud and clear from customers how important not only the specialty logistics services from World Courier are, but also our consulting services that you mentioned as well as 3PL services. When we think about the future of specialty growth, these are services that are required and valued by the pharmaceutical manufacturers, and as you think about specialty launches in Europe in particular, the suite of services that we have built are very well positioned to support manufacturers in that process. We hear continually that our approach to having a very local approach--or very local expertise in the markets we serve, as well as a global infrastructure to support that, is valued and is an important contribution to efficiency as we think about that market. We’re bullish on the strategy over the long term. We believe the market will continue to improve and we’re very well positioned to participate in that improvement.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick question in relation to Walgreens. I think no one was really surprised by this last month, but when they more officially disclosed in their earnings call that they’re in active discussions with you guys in relation to the current contract, I’m just curious - I know you’re probably limited in what you can say on this topic, but just open ended, is there any update or additional comments that you have on this topic from your side, given their disclosures last month? Also just to confirm, your guidance presumably reflects any potential changes in that contract, at least as it pertains to your fiscal ’25? Just want to confirm that one way or the other as well. Thanks.
Robert Mauch: Yes, thanks Steven. I’ll start and then hand it over to Jim for the guidance portion. You know, I hope you’re hearing loud and clear through our prepared remarks and other answers that partnering closely with our customers to unlock value to innovate is a core part of what we do, and you should certainly expect that we’re doing that with Walgreens on a continuous basis. We’re very engaged with them. We’re looking for opportunities to create value, win-win value as we go forward. We’re obviously a very important--they’re a very important customer, a strategic customer over the long term not just in the U.S. but in the U.K., as well as our sourcing relationship with WBAD, so very high priority for us. But again, as we would with all of our most important customers, our teams are engaged. We’re bringing the best experts that we can, world-class experts in terms of trying to innovate together and create new value.
James Cleary: Then just to quickly answer the last part of your question, yes, the guidance that we announced today includes our assumptions on all aspects of our business, Walgreens and every other aspect of our business, Steven. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Bob, you mentioned that you studied the MSO business with OneOncology in real time, and I’d be interested in your perspectives on the challenges we’ve seen in practice management 20 years ago and physician enablement more recently, and what’s key to motivating and growing practices. Then Jim, on the financial mechanics of RCA, I want to make sure we understand how much of a retention element is paid out, and we’re seeing the accretion in U.S. healthcare but I assume that’s flowing through minority interest.
Robert Mauch: Thanks for the question, Eric. Yes, we’re spending a lot of time learning. You’ll remember in our investment in OneOncology, we did that with TPG, we’re very happy with that decision and it helps us continue to learn. But there are a few things that I would take away, that are, I think connected to your question. One is that the physician leadership of these MSOs is very important, and that’s not in the absence of other managers and other leaders, but keeping the entire physician base engaged and motivated, we’re confident that strong physician leadership is important. Second is the real beauty of the MSO model isn’t its intent, it’s value creation, so it could be through new services like clinical trial support, which RCA is particularly good at; it can be through analytics and other solutions that help the physicians practice better or more efficiently within their--you know, for their patients, and really trying to drive the best possible outcomes. I think third is a long term pathway for physicians who are coming into the model, so there certainly are these practices that can have long tenured physicians in them, and also it’s very important that we’re able to attract either smaller practices or new physicians into the MSO, and I’ll say that both OneOncology and RCA are particularly good at that, attracting the smaller practices as well as physicians right out of fellowship.
James Cleary: Yes, and then I’ll answer the last part of your question, Eric. As you know, we acquired RCA on January 2 at the beginning of our Q2, and our updated guidance reflects RCA, and of course it’s a big reason for our increase in our operating income growth rate in the U.S. You’ll see that all presented and the details of that when we begin reporting quarters with them in our results, starting in Q2. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Grosslight from Citi. The line is now open, please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a strong quarter here. I’ll stick with the MSO topic. I’m sure you saw this, but one of your competitors made an acquisition in the ophthalmology focused MSO space. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment within the MSO space, specifically ophthalmology and retina, both from competition from MSO assets as you seek to acquire those, and for the physician, the affiliated physicians as you try to attract more of those to your MSOs. Thanks.
Robert Mauch: Thanks Daniel. I can only speak to where we’re focused, and we are very confident in that, in Retina Consultants of America we have the leading retina MSO, and not just leading in terms of size but leading in terms of their management team, leading in terms of their clinical excellence, the prominence of the practices that are within that, and as I mentioned in the previous question, also a robust clinical research network. Those are the reasons that we’re confident that, in that case, we’ll be able to continue to attract physicians and practices to that platform. The very same things are true with OneOncology - we believe we have the leading platform, it’s the right model, they’re successfully growing, and again it’s because of the model that they’ve built and the services that they’re providing that they continue to add practices. Look - we’ve talked a lot about why this is the right strategy for Cencora, so it’s not surprising to us that we would see others in our space executing in a similar manner; but again, we’re really happy and confident in the partners that we’ve chosen, and we’ll continue to execute upon that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. I was hoping you might be willing to give us an update on what the guidance revision for the U.S. business would have been on an organic basis - just trying to compare that on an apples-to-apples basis. Similarly when we think about the accretion from RCA that you’re going to get in this fiscal year, it sounds like it’s not quite as simple as just taking the 35% and scaling it based on the nine months, so maybe just give us a better sense of kind of the ramping in the second quarter and when we’re going to get closer to that full rate. Thank you.
James Cleary: Yes, great questions. The first one was on guidance, and let me just say we don’t specifically break it out the way that you asked; but with regard to our U.S. segment, it obviously had a very strong first quarter and we see quite good momentum in the U.S. segment. Of course, it’s not just due to RCA, it’s due to utilization trends, it’s due to very broad-based performance in specialty but in other businesses also, you know, overcoming the COVID headwind that we talked about. I guess specifically what I’ll say is that we’ve talked twice about updating our guidance and improving our guidance because of strength in the U.S. segment, so you know, it’s quite safe to say that it’s above--the performance that we’re seeing there ex-RCA is above the 5% to 6.5% range, above that range that we initially did in our guidance. The second question you had was regarding RCA accretion, and as we’ve stated, we expect $0.35 of accretion during the first 12 months of ownership, and nine months of that is of course in fiscal year ’25, and I referred to the fact that we do expect it to ramp up over the course of fiscal year ’25. Really, the reason for that ramp-up over the course of the year is just growth in the business and then also execution of business and strategic initiatives at RCA.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about, going back to sort of the specialty business and related to RCA, if I’m not mistaken, I think you guys are the largest distributor for Regeneron on Eylea, and Amgen just launched--I think they announced last quarter the launch of their version, Pavblu into the market. I think there’s another one supposed to be coming, maybe this summer. Just curious - those scripts are kind of hard to track through sources like [indiscernible]. Just wanted to understand how that launch is going for you, and what kind of opportunity do you see biosimilar Eylea being and how does your ownership of RCA perhaps allow you to--does that allow you to drive better adoption of biosimilars? I guess that’s a more general question across all your MSO practices. Thanks.
Robert Mauch: Hi Charles, thanks for the question. I’ll start with--you know, we’ve had a long history of partnering with retina physicians over decades, so we do understand the space very well. Two, we have studied the pipelines pretty extensively or very extensively in terms of new innovation, as well as biosimilars, and we’re confident that that will be a health process, so we’ll have continuous new innovation, we’ll also have biosimilars that come to the market, and that’s a healthy market. That will be good for patients, it will be good for the MSO, and good for Cencora. I think lastly, what we’ve seen over--you know, both in oncology and coming in retina is that biosimilar adoption is good. It’s in the Part B space. Our experience has been it’s faster than you see in the Part D space, and we expect that will continue. But I think the most important part of this is just a healthy market, continuous innovation as well as appropriate biosimilars coming to the market, and then physicians will obviously make the best clinical decision for the patients that they’re caring for.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Allen Lutz: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. As we kind of look back to 2024, utilization was really strong in U.S. healthcare. I think we’ve seen that broadly across the different distributors, and some of that I think was due to just this post-COVID re-acceleration of scripts as patients are going back to the physician. There were a few things you called out - GLP-1s and then Humira. If we back those things out, how should we think about new script growth more broadly in 2025 versus 2024? Is what’s embedded in the current guidance a normalization of utilization? Is there anything that you’re seeing from the benefit design changes that were put forth on January 1? Just curious if there’s anything embedded within the guide outside of the things you called out, that’s a little bit different in 2025 versus 2024. Thanks.
James Cleary: Yes, that’s a great question, and as we commented throughout fiscal year ’24, we saw strong utilization trends. As we called out during this first quarter, we also saw strong utilization trends. I would just say as we look at the balance of fiscal year ’25, this is why we have a range. Probably the key driver in our range, and our range is of course two full percentage points for both consolidated and the U.S. top line growth, and probably by far the biggest driver of that range is various assumptions on utilization trends for the balance of the year. But I just want to say overall that we view our--both our company performance in leading with market leaders and the strength of our market as quite good and quite resilient, which is one thing that gives us a high degree of confidence in our guidance for fiscal year ’25. Thank you for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
George Hill: Good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. I’m going to come back to the MSO businesses for a second. Jim, you talked about the clinical trial component, but what I was going to ask is could you rank order the value drivers that allow, whether it’s Cencora or RCA or OneOncology, to add value to its physician partners in these practices. We know GPO was a piece, clinical trials is a piece, rev cycle is a piece. Just if you could kind of rank out the three or four main drivers of value creation, I think that’d be very helpful for investors.
Robert Mauch: Hey George, it’s Bob. I’ll take this. I don’t think we can rank them necessarily. Within the different physician practices, within the different specialties, I think there’s a different mix of things that are valuable to those physicians, and those are going to be the value drivers. Probably the second point of that is it’s continually changing, right, so it’s a very dynamic marketplace. The needs of physicians are always changing, and that’s one of the great things about having the robust suite of MSO services, is you have the infrastructure then to make sure that we’re doing our best to keep up with and stay a step ahead of what they need, kind of that same approach that we’ve been emphasizing, which is working really closely with our customers to bring solutions and innovation to the market. Again, we do that across all of our business, but the MSO platform gives us an opportunity, obviously even a step closer to the provider to do that on a continuous basis, which will be our intent.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. I think you mentioned specialty strength was broad-based, but any key therapeutic categories to call out there; and if I can ask a two-parter here, I’m switching species but I’m just curious what you’re seeing in animal health. There seems to be just a lot of commotion in this space and competition at both the manufacturer and the distributer level to some extent, and just bigger picture, it’s been roughly 10 years since the NWI deal closed, and how would you characterize how you see NWI sitting in the enterprise now, your commitment to the business, does it detract at all from some of the broader efforts and long term vision across specialty or your MSO strategy, and just curious on your bigger picture thoughts there. Thanks.
James Cleary: Yes, thank you for those questions. First of all, your question was on specialty, and our specialty business has always--the biggest driver has always been the oncology part of the business. Obviously a very strong part of that for Cencora is in Part B and our sales to specialty physician practices and health systems, so that’s really kind of been the key driver of the business. Then the second piece has been in the ophthalmology space, and in particular the retina space, so that’s exactly why you’ve seen our significant capital deployment into MSOs, first in oncology and then in the retina market, which as Bob commented on is really kind of a natural evolution and next step of our highly successful specialty business. Then thank you for your question on animal health. Our animal health business had a very good quarter. You’ll see in our Q that will be published later today, the animal health business had 7% top line growth. The growth was--while we don’t break it out, the growth was actually good in the quarter in both the companion animal market, which is about two-thirds of our business, and the production animal market, which is about a third of our business. Both had very nice growth quarters, and not only was it good top line growth but good bottom line growth in the business also. Part of that is probably the market, but I think we’re probably continuing to incrementally gain some market share there. Also, I’d just say we feel very good about the animal health business and feel that the management team there is doing a particularly good job, so thank you for the questions, Erin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is now open.
Kevin Caliendo: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Does your fiscal ’25 guidance embed any incremental customer loss beyond FCS? I know you detailed that back in November - that was the first part. Just specifically on the Paxlovid or the COVID headwind, was it better or worse than expectations in fiscal 1Q?
Robert Mauch: Can you say--we missed the last part of your question. Can you repeat that?
Kevin Caliendo: Oh, I’m sorry. Sure. Just on the COVID headwind, was it better or worse than expectations in fiscal 1Q versus what you originally thought, when you originally guided?
James Cleary: Yes, so the first was, I think, our guidance, does it expect any customer losses other than the one that you mentioned, and I would say generally, the answer is yes. It assumes some customer losses and gains, but really there is none other than the one you called out that’s a meaningful amount of profit or loss, that would be worth calling out, and so we don’t call it out. Then the second question had to do with COVID and with regard to exclusive COVID therapies, which I think what you’re asking about is it was a $0.06 headwind during the first quarter, but the first quarter of fiscal year ’24 was the last quarter that we had exclusive COVID therapy contribution, so it’s not a headwind for the balance of the year. With regard to COVID vaccines, we really called this out in our prepared remarks that in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the contribution from COVID-19 vaccines was about half that of the prior year quarter, and we expect a similar sized operating income headwind in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, meaning no significant expected contribution from COVID vaccines in our second quarter fiscal 2025. The strong guidance raise and increase that we did this quarter is in spite of that COVID vaccine headwind. Thank you for the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. I didn’t think World Courier could get this much attention on a call, but I do have some World Courier questions. First, I wouldn’t disagree that there are some market challenges - subdued clinical trial activity, that all makes sense for the softness you cited. You also do cell and gene therapy and other specialty shipments unrelated to clinical trials, so I’m wondering how those are faring. Part B, what is the basis for saying clinical trial activity will pick up later this year, and Part C on World Courier, any additional commentary on competition in the market? We’ve seen some noise from UPS Healthcare and others. I just want to make sure the weakness in World Courier is more temporary and end market-related, as opposed to something going on, on the competitive front. Thanks very much.
James Cleary: Yes, let me start out here. First of all, we feel very good about the opportunities in the cell and gene therapy market, and it’s a result of our World Courier strength, Eric, and then the strength in our other commercialization services businesses. As we look at the long term, we feel great about that market opportunity and we feel very good about how well positioned we are to be the leader in the market, but I would say that it’s not of a size yet that it has a material contribution to the bottom line. Second, you asked why do we think that there is opportunity to see improvement in global specialty logistics later in the fiscal year. In meeting with the teams and looking at market data and looking at the pipeline, our teams are really heavily focused on the pipeline, which we feel has the opportunity to pay off later in the fiscal year, given both the market and given the work that our teams are doing. Then the third part of the question was on competition, and yes, that market--you know, it certainly is a competitive market. We have a premium service and have been a market leader for many years and are very focused on the market, but we will acknowledge that it certainly is a competitive market, where we have been and plan to continue to be a market leader.
Robert Mauch: Yes, and Eric, I would only add--and again, this is thematic today, but being a premium provider indicates that we’re continually innovating within that space, so the things that we’ve talked about in terms of temperature monitoring and tracking of products throughout the supply chain, a very specialized supply chain for these products is something that we’ll continue to do. That’s just an example, but while there is competition, we intend to continue to innovate to make sure that we’re ahead of the pack.
Operator: Thank you. We currently have no further questions, so I’ll hand back to Bob for closing remarks.
Robert Mauch: Great, thank you Becky. Again, I want to thank everyone for joining today. I also want to thank again our Cencora team members. This performance is due to your purpose-driven approach, your expertise and your dedication to meeting the needs of our customers and patients worldwide. I know you will continue to advance our leadership in specialty, drive efficiency and productivity, and execute with a customer-centric mindset. Thanks everyone.
Operator: This concludes today’s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-11-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's Cencora Q4 Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Drew, and I'll be the operator today. During today's call, there will be a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand over to our first speaker, Bennett Murphy. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Bob Mauch, President and CEO; and Laz Krikorian, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com. We have also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including but not limited to, EPS, operating income, and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. Cencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Mauch: Thank you, Bennett. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining Cencora's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started today, I'd like to let everyone know that our CFO, Jim Cleary, has been under the weather for the past few days, after successfully and impressively completing the New York City Marathon. Jim is unable to join the call today, but he was part of preparing today's remarks, which will be presented by our Chief Accounting Officer, Laz Krikorian. We wish Jim a speedy recovery and I know he is looking forward to engaging with everyone in the coming weeks. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you today for the first time since assuming the role of President and CEO of this incredible company to discuss the strong results our global enterprises delivered this year, including growing our adjusted earnings by 15%. I'm honored to take the helm of a purpose-driven, growth-oriented business with an unparalleled portfolio of customers ranging from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers across continents. I'm focused on continuing to execute our strategy while amplifying the things within our culture that have made us successful. In fiscal 2024, Cencora continued to benefit from the strength of our customer relationships, the capabilities of our business, our international footprint, and the collective expertise of our team members. This year, we made important progress by investing in our core distribution infrastructure, deepening strategic partnerships, leveraging data and analytics, and continuing to build on our strength in specialty. Specialty has been a key differentiator for Cencora for decades and specialty pharmaceuticals are now everywhere across our business, an important part of almost every customer relationship. As we engage with customers, they are focused on specialty products and how Cencora can help them. This is true for physicians, health systems, specialty pharmacies, and now also for community pharmacy as patients are accessing GLP-1s locally. While GLP-1s represent economic challenges in the pharmaceutical supply chain, they are an important innovation and pharmacists handling these products are helping to drive positive outcomes for patients, particularly those with comorbidities, which is an important proof point for the industry. Pharmaceutical innovation continues to advance patient care and Cencora has the capabilities and resources to enable us to partner with our leading customers upstream and downstream. In fiscal 2023, we talked about how our investment in OneOncology was a natural evolution of our leadership in specialty. As the addition of a management services organization or MSO in the oncology space expanded the solutions we provide an important community provider customer base. This morning, I'm excited to talk about our agreement to acquire Retina Consultants of America or RCA, a clear leader in the Retina MSO space, which broadens our community provider relationships in a high-growth segment. In addition to being a proven established MSO, RCA has differentiated clinical research capabilities that we believe will build on Cencora's value proposition to pharma, supporting innovative new therapies and furthering our ability to contribute to better outcomes for patients. This acquisition fits squarely in Cencora's pharmaceutical-centric strategy and furthers our ability to execute on our strategic imperatives of leading with market leaders, investing in innovation, contributing to prescription outcomes, and expanding on our leadership in specialty. We've developed deep relationships with RCA's leadership over the years as we've served their practices. Their clinical excellence and focus on pharmaceutical innovation align closely with Cencora's purpose and strategy. Community providers face an increasingly complex operating environment. By aligning with Cencora, a partner that supports the voice and leadership of physicians, they are better able to navigate changes, advance their growth, and focus on providing patient care. Cencora's global distribution infrastructure is the backbone of our business. We continue to invest in our distribution centers to support the logistics needs presented by pharmaceutical innovation and focus on utilizing technology to create actionable data and insights for our partners. In the US, we've made investments in our distribution infrastructure to support the increasing amount of temperature control volume we handle and to increase the level of granularity on traceability and product-specific movement. Through our data-driven approach, we're focused on creating actionable insights that allow manufacturers to strengthen their processes, increase efficiencies, and comply with the latest industry regulatory standards. This is an example of Cencora's forward-thinking mindset and ability to not only adapt to industry changes, but capitalize on and expand the role we play. Healthcare is dynamic, which creates opportunities for us to leverage our growing strengths and expertise to advance clinical and business objectives of our customers. By aligning ourselves with the right strategic partners and prioritizing key markets, we're able to grow with our customers and develop innovative solutions. Listening and responding to customers is table stakes. We will actively learn, understanding deeply the strategies of our partners, allowing us to anticipate their needs, both opportunities and challenges they are facing now and into the future. As an example, for our health systems customers, we have enhanced the services we provide to help accelerate pharmacy solutions by developing a unified portfolio to optimize operations, improve financial performance, and expand care. One example of our enhancements is the increased support we now offer during the procurement process. These enhanced services leverage advanced analytics to provide customer transparency, opportunities to drive product and cost efficiency, and evaluate and mitigate risk, all to enhance the customer experience. Internationally, we've been strategically investing in the distribution center network of our European wholesale and 3PL businesses to increase the level of automation and enhance our capabilities to improve business continuity. Outside of distribution, our global specialty logistics business continues to navigate a challenging market, operating efficiently, while we continue to invest in solutions to support clinical innovation across geographies. And unfortunately, as you saw in the earnings release this morning, we took a goodwill impairment on our PharmaLex business. The business growth is not keeping up with our original expectations as the outsourced pharma services market faces broader demand challenges. PharmaLex remains a key long-term strategic asset and our ability to differentiate our commercialization solutions with our pharma and biotech partners, and we are confident in our ability to grow the business. As the market rebounds, we are positioned as a partner of choice to enhance new product development and commercialization through a compelling suite of services from clinical trial support to regulatory, scientific affairs and pharmacovigilance, specialty logistics, market access, as well as our 3PL and distribution reach across continents. I'm confident in Cencora's ability to drive success across our enterprise because of the strength of our talent. I want to take a moment to thank the global Cencora team members who drive our business objectives, capture opportunities with our partners and customers through their close collaboration, and perform their work with a purpose-driven mindset. I'm honored to be working alongside and learning from each of our team members whose expertise and excellence in their work drive us forward. Our most important investment is in our people and I've seen how diverse teams with differing perspectives create the best results. So as we think about fiscal 2025 and the future of Cencora, we will prioritize building on our strong team to continue our track record of impressive performance. Our enterprise leadership team's responsibility is to equip our team members with resources to perform best-in-class work and I'm committed to supporting them. Having been in this role for a little over a month now, I'm continuously asked what's next for Cencora. Cencora is an incredible purpose-driven company guided by a differentiated strategy, culture and a portfolio of solutions across geographies, which has allowed us to build strategic customer partnerships and consistently deliver strong results. Thinking about fiscal 2025 and beyond, we will continue to lead with a customer-centric approach, take on an enterprise-powered mindset and focus on innovation, which will ensure our differentiated value proposition remains intact and accelerates our position as a leader in healthcare. On the talent side, we have strong leadership and we've taken steps to evolve the leadership team to help deliver on this focus, adding new external hires, including a new Chief Data and Information Officer, as well as a new Head of Strategy and Corporate Development. We've also elevated existing commercial leaders to ensure that we continue to bring the voice of the customer to the table. In closing, Cencora has an incredible foundation built on the strength of our strategy. We're well positioned in key services and solutions with our core and pharmaceutical distribution and complementary services for our upstream and downstream customers. Our global operations allow us to integrate our solutions across the markets we serve to create differentiated capabilities. I'm inspired by our team members' pride in their work and deep dedication to our purpose. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Laz for an in-depth review of fourth quarter and full year fiscal '24 results as well as fiscal 2025 guidance. Laz?
Laz Krikorian: Thanks, Bob. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. It's an honor and a privilege to fill in today as Jim continues to recover. We all know Jim, so we all know he is listening to the call right now and I will try my best to do him proud. Before I turn to a review of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year results, as a reminder, my remarks will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. Throughout fiscal 2024, Cencora has demonstrated our ability to capitalize on the opportunities presented to us by our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, long-lasting customer relationships and robust solutions. And the fourth quarter was a continuation of our momentum as we finished the year strong. Driven by the strength of our business and execution of our team members, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $3.34 in the fourth quarter, representing a 17% increase compared to the prior year quarter and full fiscal year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $13.76, a 15% increase compared to the prior fiscal year. Turning now to an in-depth review of our fourth quarter results compared to the prior year quarter. Consolidated revenue was $79.1 billion, up 15%, driven by growth in both reportable segments as the US Healthcare Solutions segment continued to see strong script utilization and the International Healthcare Solutions segment benefited from growth at our European and Canadian businesses. Now moving to gross profit. Consolidated gross profit was $2.5 billion, up 7% due to gross profit growth in the US Healthcare Solutions segment. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.1%, a decrease of 24 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to higher growth in our US Healthcare Solutions segment, which has lower gross profit margin than our International Healthcare Solutions segment. Additionally, our US Healthcare Solutions gross profit margin experienced continued pressure from increased sales of low-margin GLP-1 products and a lack of sales in the current year quarter of exclusive COVID-19 therapies, which had higher gross profit margins. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.6 billion, up 7% as a result of higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses in the quarter to support our revenue growth. Turning now to operating income. Consolidated operating income was $851 million, up 6% compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in operating income was driven by strong growth in the US Healthcare Solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in the International Healthcare Solutions segment, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing the segment-level results. Moving now to our net interest expense for the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was $21 million, a decrease of 66%, driven by strong free cash flow, enabling an increase in interest income as a result of higher investment rates and investment cash balances in the quarter and a decrease in interest expense due to lower foreign subsidiary borrowings and the September 2023 divestiture of our less than wholly-owned subsidiary in Egypt. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.3% compared to 21.6% in the prior year quarter, bringing our full year 2024 effective tax rate down to 20.8%. Finally, our diluted share count was 198.1 million shares, a 3% decrease compared to the prior year fourth quarter, driven by approximately $500 million of opportunistic share repurchases in the quarter, including a $250 million share repurchase from Walgreens Boots Alliance in August as they sold all of their remaining unencumbered shares. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now, I will review our segment results for the fourth quarter, beginning with the US Healthcare Solutions segment. The US Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $71.7 billion, up 16% versus the prior year, reflecting strong prescription utilization trends, including sales of GLP-1 products, increased sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems, and growth in sales to our largest customers, all of which was partially offset by the January 1 manufacturer price reductions in certain product classes. In the quarter, sales of GLP-1 products were up $3.1 billion, representing a 55% increase compared to the prior year quarter and a sequential increase of 14% from the June quarter. Excluding sales of GLP-1 products, fourth quarter revenue growth would have been approximately 10%. US Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased by 10% to $697 million, driven by increased volumes across our distribution businesses stemming from strong utilization trends. In the quarter, we continued to see strong demand for specialty products from physician practices and health systems, outpacing overall prescription market growth. Moving to the International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions' revenue was $7.4 billion, an increase of almost 6% on an as reported basis, an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis. International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income was $154 million, a 9% decrease on an as reported basis and an 8% decline on a constant currency basis due to higher information and technology expenses at our European distribution business and lower operating income in our Canadian business, all of which was partially offset by positive operating income results at our global specialty logistics business. As Bob mentioned and as noted in our press release, our GAAP operating income results for the fourth quarter include a $418 million goodwill impairment relating to PharmaLex as a result of the business not keeping up with our original expectations as the industry experiences broader pressures due to lower demand from pharma and biotech for outsourced services. PharmaLex remains a strategic asset for Cencora and we expect the business to continue to be a key component of our commercialization services value proposition for our upstream partners. Please note that this one-time item only impacts GAAP results and is excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted results for the quarter. That concludes my discussion of our fiscal fourth quarter financials. Now, I will turn to our full year fiscal 2024 results compared to the prior year, beginning with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $294 billion, up 12%, driven by growth of 13% in the US Healthcare Solutions segment and 4% growth in the International Healthcare Solutions segment. Consolidated operating income was $3.6 billion, an increase of 11% due to growth in both the US Healthcare Solutions segment and the International Healthcare Solutions segment. From a segment perspective, US Healthcare Solutions had operating income growth of 13%, driven by increases in sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems, increased sales to our largest customers and commercial COVID-19 vaccines. As a reminder, commercial COVID-19 vaccines drove the higher year-over-year operating income growth in the first half of fiscal 2024. International Healthcare Solutions had operating income growth of 3% on an as-reported basis, driven by increases at our Canadian business, our global specialty Logistics business and our less than wholly-owned Brazil full-line distribution business, partially offset by foreign currency pressure and higher information technology operating expenses in our European distribution business. On a constant currency basis, the segment delivered 9% operating income growth. Rounding out the discussion of our full year fiscal 2024 results, we generated $3.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow and ended the year with cash balance of $3.1 billion, as we experienced better-than-expected quarter-end receipts. In fiscal 2024, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, including $1.5 billion in opportunistic share repurchases. This morning, we announced our 20th consecutive annual dividend increase as our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase to our quarterly dividend. This is 3% higher than our previous annual dividend increases of 5% and aligns with our long-term guidance of 8% to 12% adjusted diluted EPS growth. This completes the review of our full fiscal year results. Turning now to discuss our fiscal 2025 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. So the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. We have also provided a detailed overview of guidance metrics on Slides 11 and 12 of our earnings presentation. First, I will start with adjusted diluted EPS and then provide greater detail on the components of our earnings growth and financial expectations for the fiscal year. In fiscal 2025, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $14.80 to $15.10, representing growth of 8% to 10% at or above our preliminary implied guidance provided in early September due to opportunistic share repurchases in September and October and continued momentum in the business. As stated in our press release this morning, our fiscal 2025 guidance does not include the impact of the RCA acquisition, which will be incorporated into our expectations following the transaction close. As a reminder, in fiscal 2025, we continue to expect year-over-year headwinds from COVID products, including a headwind from commercial COVID vaccines in the first half of fiscal 2025, a $0.06 headwind from exclusive COVID therapies in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and the potential June 2025 loss of an oncology customer due to its previously announced pending acquisition. All of these factors remain largely unchanged from our preliminary guidance expectations and are offset by our momentum and business initiatives. Moving to revenue, we expect consolidated and segment growth rates to be in the range of 7% to 9%, reflecting continued growth across both segments. Turning to operating income, we expect consolidated and segment operating income growth rates to be in the range of 5% to 6.5%. At the segment level, we expect US Healthcare Solutions segment operating income to benefit from continued pharmaceutical utilization trends, growth in key markets and internal efficiencies more than offsetting COVID related headwinds and a potential loss of an oncology customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the International Solutions segment, operating income is expected to benefit due to growth from its key businesses and a lower information technology expense growth rate. Now moving to interest expense. We expect our interest expense to be between $150 million and $170 million based on our standalone operating expectations, which do not include the potential impact from financing of the RCA acquisition. Turning to income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 21% for fiscal 2025. Moving now to share count, we expect that our full year average share count will be approximately 196 million shares in fiscal 2025, reflecting the impact of our significant share repurchase activity over the last 12 months, including over $600 million in repurchases since mid-September. Regarding our capital expenditure expectations, in fiscal 2025, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million, a modest increase in comparison to fiscal 2024 as we continue to invest in our business to support growth and to increase the strength of our infrastructure. As it relates to free cash flow, we expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion due primarily to timing and mix. We continue to generate strong free cash flow to support our growing dividend and continue to execute our capital allocation priorities to contribute to growth of our business. This morning's announcement of RCA is an example of that as it clearly fits our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, builds on our MSO solutions and hits on Cencora's strategic imperatives, which are key to our past and future success. As was stated in this morning's releases, the fiscal 2025 guidance we are presenting this morning does not currently include the impact of the RCA acquisition, which will be incorporated into expectations following the transaction close. We plan to fund the transaction through a combination of debt and cash on hand. Given the recent use of cash to opportunistically repurchase shares and the use of cash in our second quarter due to the seasonality of our business, we are currently expecting to fund approximately 20% of the acquisition price from cash on hand. Upon closing, the acquisition is expected to be approximately $0.35 accretive, net of estimated financing costs for its first 12 months. Cencora is committed to maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating and will prioritize deleveraging in the years following the transaction close. In closing, the fourth quarter captured a strong year at Cencora. I am proud of our purpose-driven team members, the strength and diversity of our talent and our continued execution to deliver on our strategic imperatives to advance our position at the center of healthcare. We are well positioned for continued growth in fiscal 2025 and investing to ensure we are preparing for continued success in the future. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning, Bob, congratulations. I talked to -- I listened to you talk a little bit about your strategy. You talked about the incredible foundation built on the strategy, the strength of the strategy of the company. Obviously, we're waking up today, we have a new President going into 2025. Maybe just spend a couple of minutes talking about how you think about maybe the first year as CEO of the company, anything changing from your perspective now that we do have a new President and it looks like it will be a Congress that will most likely be Republican. So any changes there would be kind of my question and really just trying to understand how you're thinking about that. And then just secondly, I really just want to understand if we're seeing any changes from the volume changes in IRA. So, you talked about strong results in the quarter around volumes, and just curious if you guys are seeing anything from that perspective.
Bob Mauch: Hey, Lisa, thank you very much for the question and the kind words. Yeah, I'll start with, just the first 30 days or so in this new role have been absolutely amazing. I want to start with a -- just a sincere thank you to the Cencora Board of Directors for having the trust in me to take on this role. And as you mentioned and as I mentioned in our prepared remarks is, we are an incredibly strong enterprise and company. And what we're going to do is continue to execute. And you see in our results through 2024, the execution of both our operational strength, as well as our strategic execution, and that leads to the announcement of RCA today. So, as I've talked about and I want to be clear here today is our strategy does not need to change and we will continue to execute upon that. We're well positioned and we think our focus areas are the right ones. However, that doesn't mean, status quo or complacency and there's a lot of work to do. It's a dynamic market. And so, we are doing things in terms of amplifying strengths that we've already had. And I mentioned, we're working on our talent all the time in the enterprise leadership team, we've elevated our commercial leaders to make sure that we have the voice of the customer at the table all the time. We've added new leaders in our technical and IT area, as well as strategy and M&A. And we'll continue to work on enhancing our talent as we continue to execute. I think as it relates to policy in general, I think we have a long history of working through multiple administrations and Congresses and different views on healthcare and pharma. And as we always said, and I feel very confident about this now is we'll be at the table, we'll be working with anyone who's in charge of health policy in the United States and on a global basis, and we'll make sure that we're there to be a supportive partner and that whatever comes our way will be manageable and will help our customers, pharma customers and provider customers navigate through that. Thank you for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny from Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Cherny: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. And, Bob, echoing Lisa's comments, welcome to your new role. I know you're obviously a long-timer here, but congrats on the transition. Maybe if I could just dive in, I guess, two-part question come together. First of all, I know you highlighted a number of the headwinds you have this year from a year-over-year basis as you think about the COVID comp. Is the loss of the customer contemplated specifically in guidance, whether they leave or not? Just trying to get to the baseline growth, which definitely seems stronger than the 5% to 6.5% on underlying basis. And along those lines, when thinking about specialty in particular, given your market leadership there, how do you think about the moving pieces across the market with regards to specialty inclusive of expectations for biosimilars, the impact we're seeing from changing benefit design with IRA? Curious how that all factors into your expectations across the US Healthcare segments relative to the specialty contribution. Thanks so much.
Bennett Murphy: Sure, Michael. Thanks. This is Bennett, and I'll take that. So as we look at 2025, we're expecting that the US Healthcare Solutions segment operating income will continue to benefit from the pharmaceutical utilization trends that we've seen growth in key markets, including specialty as you call out, which helps to give us a really strong base moving into 2025 or 2024. And more than offsetting COVID-related headwind, as Lazarus talked about, including the potential loss of an oncology customer, which is factored into our 2025 expectations. What I would say, and you didn't necessarily specifically ask it, but I would say is that, we were guiding without that headwind from vaccines. The top-end of our US Healthcare Solutions operating income guidance range would be 8%. So as I said, I'll say that again, just to be clear, without the headwind from commercial COVID vaccines, the top-end of our US Healthcare Solutions segment operating income range would be 8% instead of that 6.5%. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please proceed.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. And, Bob, congrats again on your first quarter as official -- officially. And maybe could you talk a little bit more about RCA and sort of how you think about sort of your MSO capabilities more strongly? It's obviously an area that you've been investing in and maybe gets a little bit less like air time than some of your other businesses. So maybe talk about that and what is their leverageable from other strategy you -- strategies you currently have and sort of capabilities, that would be a little bit helpful to hear more about that. Thank you.
Bob Mauch: Yeah. Thanks, Elizabeth. Thank you for the warm welcome and happy to discuss such an important part of our strategy going forward. So yeah, we're very interested in the MSO space. And the reason is at least two-fold, but I'll give you two. One is, it's clearly in line with our support and interested in being in the forefront of the specialty pharma market, right? So where those products, the innovation of those products are coming to market, we expect to be helpful and involved across our entire business. So across the entire portfolio of customers and geographies. When you bring it to the specialty physicians, the MSOs are really in line with what we have done at Cencora over decades. So if you think about how we operate, we have in many cases built capabilities to support community providers. And MSOs are an excellent way to support community [physicians] (ph). We do it in other segments, and I'll use Good Neighbor Pharmacy as an example. It's not an MSO, but it certainly is a large suite of services that supports a community provider. So it's right in line with our strategy in terms of specialty focus, but it's also something that's very consistent with what we've done over a long period of time in terms of investing in solutions that support those community providers. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it's not getting easier for community providers and specialty providers at all. So the need for a large at-scale support system through the MSO and through Cencora's ownership of the MSOs, we think, is the best chance of making sure that, that very cost effective site of care is there for patients when they need it.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Yeah, good morning, guys, and Bob, welcome to the call. I'm going to get kind of way out, like, look a little further out thinking about the acquisition today and your guys' presence in oncology. And Bob, as you kind of look forward to like the impact of the IRA changes and the impact it could have on Part B drug costs and the profitability of practices that dispense a lot of drugs. I guess, is it too early to think about that because there's still the opportunity for legislative change or kind of how are you guys thinking about how you support those practices given the headwinds that could come from IRA? And again, I recognize I'm talking about something that's two years away, maybe two years plus, but kind of would love any preliminary thoughts on that.
Bob Mauch: Yeah, George, thanks. Thanks for the welcome and thank you for the excellent question. So I would say it's not too early to think about that. So we have been thinking about IRA and modeling a wide range of scenarios of impact for IRA in Part B. And I'll jump to the end of that as we feel that in -- across all those scenarios, that is something that will be manageable for the providers and therefore manageable for Cencora. Again, as you say, we don't really know what the impact will be in Part B and Part D, we're seeing that impact is really in reimbursement and not in list price. So it remains to be seen, but we do think about it. We have a team -- teams of people who are always focused on these things. And as we look forward, not only with the RCA acquisition, but also our relationship with OneOncology and other customers that this is something that through innovation in the long run that this will be something that's not necessarily negative for the practices.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Again, congrats to Bob. And I want to get a bit more specific on the specialty trend. I think we're hearing from payers that they're seeing a 3Q uptick and some of it is attributed to Part D. We also heard about commercial and seeing in specialty pharmacy. My question is, are you seeing an uptick in Q3 versus first half where you're serving specialty pharmacies, we tend to think of that as lower margin specialty. And then you called out strength in specialty distribution, a higher margin piece with providers and health systems. You've called that out in Q1 and Q2. Is there an acceleration you saw in 3Q or is that simply continuation of the trend?
Bennett Murphy: No, I would say, and once again, this is Bennett and of course, I appreciate using calendar quarters in your question, but I'll refer to fiscal quarters in my answer in that the fourth quarter we saw similar trends as we saw throughout fiscal '24, and honestly for the past several years. So we've had the specialty market, particularly for physicians and health systems, has been a key component of a -- key driver of our growth for a while. It's a really important segment. It's a part of the market where we play a really important role and add a lot of value. But no, we are not representing this as a deviation. It's a continuation of the good trends that we've seen for a while. Thank you, Eric.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Grosslight from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Daniel, your line is now open. Please go ahead. We're getting no audio from Daniel. So, I'll move on to the next question from Stephanie Davis from Barclays. Please proceed.
Stephanie Davis: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. And Bob, official congratulations on taking the seat. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the RCA transaction as it's a sizable move into other ologies outside of kind of your core onc focus. So with that in mind, can you walk us through your specialty roadmap, any other verticals to watch or any opportunities on the checklist such as RCA's clinical trial strength that you're hoping to kind of shore up? Thank you.
Bob Mauch: Hi, Stephanie, thank you for the question and for the congratulations. Yeah. So when we look at specialty expansion beyond oncology, we're looking for a couple of things. We're looking for continued growth and innovation in that market and also the Part B components that are there that we can support. So the obvious one for Cencora is oncology, and that's where we've been for a very long time. And I'll also note we've been a leader in Retina for a very long time. But I'll come back to that. But then you saw that we added urology as part of OneOncology. So we do have a view and a strategic approach to where we would look at other specialties that that would fit. And certainly, Retina is one. And again, we have a long history, a leading role in the retina specialty distribution space. We have a real belief in the continued growth and innovation in that market. RCA is best-in-class. They are world-class clinicians, world-class researchers. And we feel really good about the decision to expand our investment in Retina.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks for taking my question. And, Bob, again, congrats. I want to take this a little bit further on the RCA stuff because there's been a lot of oncology deals done recently. It feels like there isn't maybe as much opportunity there. You are already a leader in retina, as you said. Is this a stepping stone? Is ophthalmology going to be the next sort of roll-up for you? Like, how big is the opportunity here relative to what was the opportunity in oncology? And is there anything to maybe read through in terms of expectations around biosimilars in this space or any other, like, is there analysis done where you're looking at the growth of the market or the drug opportunity in that market evolving favorably for you is also a reason to get into this?
Bob Mauch: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin, for the excellent question. Yeah, when it -- as it relates to RCA, what we've said in the prepared remarks, and I'll just repeat now, is RCA is the market leader here. So we're investing in a platform in Retina that we expect to continue to grow. They will grow by adding additional physicians and they will grow. Through the second part of your question, is we do have a strong thesis on the strength of the pharmaceutical pipeline in Retina and that includes biosimilars coming to market, but also, new innovation that will be coming that will help improve patient outcomes. And again, this is where the clinical excellence of RCA is really important and also the clinical research capabilities that they have because RCA is not only treating the end patient at a very large scale, but they're also a very key player in making sure that the clinical trials are done and that the patients have access to those trials and therefore getting those newer products to market.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. Well, I had a bunch of RCA questions too, but I'll try to make those brief. Just quickly on ophthalmology, specialty products or maybe the category overall, you're half of one of the leading manufacturers' distribution volume. Is that a similar share across the entire market? Are you half of the specialty market in ophthalmology?
Bennett Murphy: Yeah. So as Bob said, we are a leader in that space and that we've the part of the market that we've been in for a long time and we feel really good about not only our position and the fact that we have really know RCA quite well because they've been a customer for some time. And as Bob said, they're a leader in the space. And just to repeat, it's a market that while I know that there's been a lot of focus on oncology, but for Cencora, retina and ophthalmology have been a key driver of growth along the way as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Thanks. Could you speak a little bit to World Courier? Just give an update on fundamental demand trends across that business and customer base. And then, yeah, going back to sort of a little bit of an RCA question or related is on how do you balance investments in terms of an MSO type of investment versus a more direct relationship with like biopharma and life sciences partners -- partnerships? I know it's all kind of intertwined but curious kind of how you think about that. And then just one quick one on just customer relationships. Just your guidance for the year, you addressed COVID and FCS, but, you recently renewed your Express Scripts Cigna contract. How would you characterize the relationship there and any sort of changes in as well as your relationship with Walgreens? Thanks.
Bennett Murphy: Sure. So you rattled off a couple there and I'm going to try and make sure that we hit them all. I'll start with the Express Scripts one. No change there. A continuation of a good relationship with them. World Courier, that market continues to have some softness stemming from clinical trial development. But that being said, still it's a good growing business and you saw that in the quarter. I'll stop and push -- hand it over to Bob to talk a little bit about the Walgreens relationship.
Bob Mauch: Yeah, happy to. And, Erin, I'll probably touch on the broader kind of biopharma focus there for a second here because it leads on to the World Courier. I'll emphasize the point that Bennett made. World Courier is a terrific business, a leading business, and it leads in clinical trial logistics. So to the extent that, clinical trial volumes continue to be down, even though they're beginning to grow, they're still down significantly from a peak in 2021. We feel great about the business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're very well positioned as that market comes back both in World Courier and PharmaLex. Walgreens is a critically important strategic partner to us. We've had a long productive history together, which continues and we -- as we've said for a long time and continues now, we spend a lot of time with the Walgreens team. I would say continuously. And during that time, we're talking about what are things that we can do together to drive our businesses forward, how can we create more efficiency, what are new programs that we can develop together that are helpful to both companies. So we're very engaged in that. We're committed to making sure that for Walgreens and for all of our customers, one of the things that I tried to be intentional about saying is that, our intention is to really understand the strategies of our customers and then align the resources of Cencora to support those strategies. And so that's true for Walgreens and our other customers as well.
Bennett Murphy: And [indiscernible] you did write off a bunch there. So I want to go back to one you asked about this versus biopharma services. I think if you go back and look at our past disclosures and past discussions on the strategy and our strategic focus, we've always talked about looking for ways to build on our strength in specialty and to add to our services and solutions for manufacturers. And that was clearly exemplified by our OneOncology investment and also our acquisition of PharmaLex, which remains a key long-term asset for the business. And I would say that RCA really hits on both of those and that certainly it helps build on our leadership in specialty, but it also helps build on our value proposition to pharma, given the clinical research work that they do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please proceed.
Allen Lutz: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. There was a really nice revenue acceleration quarter-over-quarter. And Bennett, you mentioned that it didn't seem like that was coming from specialty accelerating. So I guess the assumption that we have here is that that's mostly driven by GLP-1s. But is there anything outside of that piece that's worth calling out around that sequential acceleration of top line growth in the US Healthcare business? Thanks.
Laz Krikorian: Yeah. Hi, Allen. This is Laz Krikorian. So we definitely talked about GLP-1s. We continue to see strong growth in the GLP-1 class as sales of those products in the quarter increased 55% year-over-year and 14% on a sequential basis. With respect to specialty products and distribution, we continue to see strong growth rates there as well, and they certainly were continuing to drive our top line growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of an RCA question, but maybe more broadly about the MSO strategy. Obviously, Senator Warren had written a letter kind of expressing some concerns about distributors owning group practices or owning these MSOs. Can you talk about sort of your thoughts on that and your response? And then secondly, maybe what is the real benefit to owning the MSOs for you beyond just at the distribution? Is it really just a services business that you want to provide for physicians? Maybe just expand on sort of that aspect of it. Thank you.
Bob Mauch: Yeah, thanks. This is Bob. I'll take that. Good questions. First of all, I'll start with we have utmost respect for the process that any governmental agency will go through to look at this and any senators who want to weigh in, we're happy to participate and be helpful there. As always, that's our orientation to these. To your question specifically, though is, we view the MSO model as a way to really support community providers. And as I said earlier, that's core to what we've done over decades. The community providers are generally a cost-effective -- a more cost-effective side of care. They're also in many cases more accessible to patients. So we believe our ownership and participation in the MSO space at the end of the day enhances patient access, enhances cost effectiveness of healthcare, and allows Cencora to continue to support these very important providers.
Operator: That concludes our Q&A session for today. I'll now hand back over to Bob Mauch for closing remarks. Thank you.
Bob Mauch: Thank you very much. Thanks all for the excellent questions and for the kind welcome. Again, I'm honored to be in this position. It's an incredibly strong company with an amazing culture, an incredible portfolio of customers, services, and geographies. We're very well positioned and we're going to continue to execute both operationally and strategically. So thank you all very much for your time.
Operator: Thank you all for your participation on today's call. That concludes the call. You may now disconnect your line.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-07-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Cencora Q3 Earnings Call. My name is Jaquita. I will be your moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted on the presentation portion of the call with the opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Bennett, please go ahead.
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2024 third quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Bob Mauch, Executive Vice President and COO. On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com. We've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including but not limited to EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q. Cencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As I prepared for this, my 53rd and last earnings call as Cencora's CEO, I look back at my prepared remarks from my first ever earnings call as CEO. On that call 13 years ago, I highlighted that it was the first time the company had eclipsed the $20 billion revenue mark for a quarter and the company reported $0.66 in diluted earnings per share. Fast forward to today and Cencora is proudly reporting quarterly revenue of over $74 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.34, representing year-over-year growth of 11% and 14%, respectively. Further, we are pleased to be raising our full year outlook as Cencora continues to execute well against our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. The healthcare landscape continues to rapidly evolve and our strategic position as a global leader in healthcare, coupled with agility and expertise of our teams, places us at the forefront of innovation. We continue to leverage our commercial strength to capitalize on the opportunities presented by positive pharmaceutical trends and innovation to drive increased value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Cencora's differentiated footprint and robust suite of services makes us a partner of choice, providing integrated solutions to support pharmaceutical commercialization and access. Our teams collaborate cross functionally, creating a seamless process to efficiently bring new products to market. We remain differentiated in the market by our comprehensive approach, which leverages expertise developed from our position at the center of healthcare and our deep collaboration. As an example, Cencora is serving as an integrated launch partner to a biopharma company launching their products outside the US. Cencora is supporting both market access and efficient distribution to ensure providers and ultimately the patients have reliable access to the novel therapy. Partnerships like this exemplify how our holistic pharmaceutical solutions are providing value to our pharma partners and serve as a testament to how our diverse capabilities allow us to capture opportunity to drive innovation and access throughout the industry. Many of these innovations are increasingly complex, which creates challenges to access and opportunities for Cencora to differentiate ourselves as a partner. This quarter, we continued our ThinkLive trade show series by hosting a two-day Cell and Gene Therapy Conference where leaders across the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industry came together to share a range of perspective on the developments and challenges throughout the developing market. By hosting events like this, we foster collaborative relationships and effective strategies that enable the launch of groundbreaking therapies and reduce barriers to patient access. On the provider side, just last week, we also hosted our Annual ThoughtSpot pharmacy trade show and conference in collaboration with our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network of independent customers. Our ThoughtSpot Conference provides thousands of community pharmacists with the opportunity to connect with peers, attend educational sessions on the latest development and technologies and celebrate the positive impact community pharmacies have as trusted healthcare providers. We truly believe that by bringing our customers together, we help advance the healthcare landscape and promote a deeper collaboration across our teams. Independent pharmacies play a vital role in promoting access to healthcare in their local communities and we are proud that Good Neighbor Pharmacy ranked number one in customer satisfaction among chain drugstore pharmacies in J.D. Power's U.S. Pharmacy Study for the eighth consecutive year in a row. The Good Neighbor Pharmacy network is clearly made up of leaders providing differentiated services for patients across the country. Forging deep strategic partnerships with market-leading customers is a strategic imperative and key differentiator for Cencora. Through these relationships, we better understand the challenges our customers are facing, which allows us to strengthen our services and solutions, driving mutual value and growing better together. As we work to enhance our customer experience, one area of particular focus has been evolving how we leverage innovative technology and analytics to enhance our efficiency and effectiveness. This is important for continuing to improve our day-to-day operations and also finding new and creative ways to analyze and grow their business with actionable data Cencora can harness. These strategic relationships with customers also allow us to capture areas of opportunity in rapidly advancing sectors of the market. I am particularly proud of our specialty distribution and services offering. For close to three decades, we have been a leader and innovator in this space. Importantly, we continue to make forward-thinking investments that position us to capitalize on addressing the complexities these products pose in handling and distribution, and connect us with downstream providers where we are positioned to equip practices with offerings that advance the strength of their business. As specialty continues to grow across all therapeutic areas, we are able to expand and develop the partnerships we have with customers, furthering our leading market position. Our leadership in specialty remains a key tenant of our long-term growth and strategy. We make forward-thinking investments in our infrastructure and emerging technologies to position Cencora as the best partner to address our customers' current and future needs. The value we create throughout the supply chain and for our shareholders is driven by our global team members and their commitment to our purpose. Our team members execute at the impressive level they do because of our purpose-driven culture, which promotes differing perspectives and points of view. In June, we celebrated our team members that identify as a part of the LGBTQ+ community by hosting a global pride celebration and events throughout the month. In recognition of our commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive workplace for all our team members, we are also proud to have been recognized as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by Disability:IN for a second consecutive year. Our leaders are dedicated to fostering a working community and culture that celebrates and embraces our team members as the authentic self, which includes providing a safe and inclusive working environment for all as our talents' engagement and commitment to our purpose drives our business resiliency and long-term strategic growth. Cencora continues to efficiently adapt to industry changes, operate and draw on our business synergies and execute across the geographies we serve, which results in our continued growth and resiliency. Our team members' diligence and passion for our purpose is inspiring and is fundamental to our success. With that, I will now hand the call over to Bob, our incoming CEO effective October 1. Bob?
Bob Mauch: Thank you, Steve. As I continue to prepare to transition to CEO in October, I'm focused on speaking to and learning from our team members and our customers. In my conversations with customers, I reinforce the value of Cencora's strategy, leadership and expertise, and how we are investing and innovating to be the partner that they need now and into the future. In working closely with leaders in healthcare across every channel, prioritizing customer-centric solutions, maintaining a learning mindset and embracing our enterprise-powered capabilities, we differentiate ourselves as partners, grow together and anticipate advancements throughout healthcare. Our team members are motivated by the important work we do, the collective strength of our business and the collaboration we enjoy across our company. The culture and pride our team members have in their work drive our purpose as we create healthier futures, and our success is a direct reflection of our team's pursuit of operational excellence. We champion the diverse perspectives and backgrounds that our team members bring to the table, which enables us to take a thoughtful and creative approach to addressing industry challenges, enhancing the value we provide to customers, partners, shareholders, and the broader healthcare industry. Looking forward, we will continue to execute against our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, driving efficiency through the supply chain, and supporting the growth of innovative products through our higher-growth, higher-margin services. In closing, I'm incredibly honored to have the opportunity to succeed Steve as Cencora's next CEO. Cencora's position in healthcare is a direct result of Steve's vision and next-minded approach in growing and advancing the depth and breadth of our services. And I want to take a moment to congratulate Steve on his incredible tenure and the mark he made on this company as well as our industry. Under Steve's leadership, Cencora has delivered tremendous growth and demonstrated our crucial role to stakeholders. Steve has led the company through major strategic decisions that position Cencora for long-term value creation, including customer partnerships with leading healthcare organizations, expanding our geographic footprint, and the various services and solutions we provide, as well as successfully navigating significant national and global challenges, all while remaining committed to our purpose and supporting our team members. Thank you, Steve, for your service to Cencora and your unwavering commitment. I'm working closely with Steve to ensure a seamless transition, and I look forward to his continued leadership, partnership and guidance as he transitions to the role of Executive Chair. It's a privilege to work alongside Cencora's inspiring and passionate team members. And I look forward to building on our momentum as we are optimistic and excited about the future of Cencora and intend to keep up the track record of execution and performance. I will now turn the call over to Jim for a review of our fiscal 2024 third quarter financial performance. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Thanks, Bob. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn to a review of our consolidated third quarter results, as a reminder, my remarks will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results, unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. Cencora delivered another strong performance in the third quarter as we continued to benefit from positive utilization trends, our leadership in specialty and the strong free cash flow generation of our business. As Steve mentioned, adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to $3.34 as we benefited from strong results in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, lower net interest expense and a lower share count due in part to approximately $550 million in opportunistic share repurchases in the quarter, as we continue to thoughtfully deploy capital and return value to shareholders. Beginning with our consolidated revenue, in the quarter, we had $74.2 billion in revenue, up 11%, with continued growth in our distribution businesses, including increased sales of GLP-1 products, increased sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems, and growth in sales to some of our largest customers. Our strong revenue growth was offset in part by the January 1 manufacturer price reductions in certain product classes. Sales of GLP-1 products in the quarter increased by $2.1 billion, or 38%, compared to prior year and increased 30% sequentially from the March quarter, when there was a notable slowdown in growth due to supply constraints, which have clearly now subsided. Excluding GLP-1s, consolidated revenue growth would have been approximately 8%. Turning now to gross profit. Consolidated gross profit was $2.4 billion, up 6% compared to the prior-year quarter. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.19%, a decrease of 14 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter, as a reacceleration of low-margin GLP-1 product sales negatively impacts our gross profit margin. Moving now to operating expenses. In the quarter, consolidated operating expenses were $1.5 billion, up 6% due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses to support revenue growth and lapping the efficiency actions we called out last year on our May earnings call. Consolidated operating income was $878 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior-year quarter, with strong growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing the segment-level results. Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the third quarter. Net interest expense was $31 million, a decrease of 46% year-over-year, as interest income increased as a result of particularly strong cash flow in the quarter, in part due to our successful unwinding of the extended payments program we launched in the March quarter to support our customers during the Change Healthcare outage. The combination of strong cash flow early in the quarter and higher investment rates compared to the prior year drove the significant decline in net interest expense year-over-year. Turning to income taxes, our effective income tax rate was 21.0% compared to 21.5% in the prior-year quarter. Finally, our diluted share count was 200 million shares, a 2% decrease compared to the prior-year third quarter, primarily driven by opportunistic share repurchases. In fiscal 2024, we have repurchased almost $1 billion of our shares, including $700 million directly from Walgreens Boots Alliance. Regarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.3 billion and $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow, as the $600 million impact from the Change Healthcare outage that I just spoke about reversed early in the third quarter. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now, I'll turn to our segment results for the third quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $67.2 billion, up 12%, reflecting strong script utilization trends, including increased sales of GLP-1 products and specialty products to physicians and health systems. Excluding sales of GLP-1 products, segment revenue growth would have been approximately 10%. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 10% to $698 million, as our specialty distribution business saw strong growth in both oncology and ophthalmology in addition to strong overall prescription volumes and biosimilar conversions. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.1 billion, flat compared to prior year on an as reported basis or up 6% on a constant currency basis. International Healthcare Solutions operating income was $179 million, a decrease of 4% on an as reported basis, due to continuation of higher information technology expenses for our European distribution business and lower operating income at our global specialty logistics business as there were less international shipments and lower weights per shipment, all of which was partially offset by positive results at our Canadian business. On a constant currency basis, International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 1%. Our global specialty logistics business is starting to see some good early signs on the demand side and the business continues to invest to further differentiate its global strength in its complex high-touch market. That completes the review of our segment-level results. I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2024 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. I will start with updated adjusted diluted EPS guidance and then provide greater detail on the income statement items driving our improved earnings expectations. Today, we are pleased to raise our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance for the fourth time this fiscal year. We now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.55 to $13.65, representing growth of 13% to 14%, up from our intra-period provided EPS guidance range of $13.35 to $13.55. Our updated guidance range reflects our expectation for continued growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, tapered expectations in the International Healthcare Solutions segment, and lower net interest expense expectations for the fiscal year. Beginning with revenue, we now expect both our as reported and constant currency consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 12% from our previous guidance range of 10% to 12%, given our increased guidance in the U.S. segment. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect segment level revenue growth of 12% to 13% from the previous range of 11% to 13%. In the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect as reported segment-level revenue growth of 4% to 6% from the previous range of 4% to 7% and constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 9% from the previous range of 7% to 10%. Moving to adjusted operating income, we now expect our as reported consolidated adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 10% to 11%, as we narrow our guidance from the previous range of 9% to 11%, and constant currency growth to be in the range of 11% to 12%, narrowed from the previous guidance range of 10% to 12%. Updated guidance reflects expected continued growth toward the upper end of our previous guidance range in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and growth toward the lower end of our previous guidance ranges in the International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect our segment-level adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 11% to 12% from our previous range of 10% to 12%, due to our continued strong growth expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we will lap the prior-year contribution of $0.08 from exclusive COVID therapy distribution and will also begin comparing to prior-year quarters that had contributions from commercial COVID vaccines, which we expect to be comparable year-over-year. In the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect our segment-level adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% from our previous range of 5% to 8%. On a constant currency basis, we now expect adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 10% to 12% from our previous range of 10% to 13%. We are modestly narrowing our International operating income guidance range, bringing down the top end of the range due to our third quarter results in the segment and some softness in demand at PharmaLex. Moving now to net interest expense and share count. We now expect our net interest expense to be in the range of $170 million to $190 million, down from our previous range of $185 million to $215 million, driven by our better-than-expected free cash flow. For weighted average shares outstanding, we now expect our full year count to be under 201 million shares as a result of our opportunistic share repurchases in the quarter. As you will recall, on May 22, we announced that we had completed $550 million in share repurchases in the month, including $400 million repurchase from Walgreens Boots Alliance, decreasing our weighted average diluted share count. Finally, turning to adjusted free cash flow, we now expect to generate $2.5 billion to $3 billion, up from our previous expectation of approximately $2.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow in the fiscal year, given our strong free cash flow generation in the third quarter. That completes the review of our updated guidance for fiscal 2024. As we near the end of the fiscal year, I'm proud of the strong results our purpose-driven team members have produced. The dedication and execution by our team members continue to drive our growth and enable us to deliver on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. Cencora continues to demonstrate our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers, partners and all our stakeholders. Before handing the call back over to Steve, I want to extend my congratulations, once again, to both him and Bob as our company is well-positioned to continue creating value in the short and long term with the company's thoughtful leadership transition plan. Cencora has benefited from having such a purpose-driven leader in Steve for well over a decade and his vision for the company has created a strong foundation for value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders. Under Bob's leadership, we will continue to build on Cencora's momentum and commercial strengths and drive further value for our stakeholders on our path toward our purpose of creating healthier futures. Congratulations to you both once again. Before turning the call back to Steve, I'm going to go through a little bit of historical data, which will take Steve by surprise. And during the 13 years that Steve has been CEO of Cencora, the revenue compound annual growth rate has been 11%, and the adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate has been 14%. And it's a little bit of a coincidence that those were actually the same growth rates we had this most recent quarter, 11% revenue growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth. And then also, during the 13 years that Steve has been CEO, the company has had a TSR, total shareholder return, CAGR of between 15% and 16%. So, Steve, I thought I'd just go through that historical data, and now I'll turn it back over to you.
Steve Collis: Thank you, Jim. You did take me by surprise. But with this being my final earnings call, I want to take a moment to thank our team members, our Board and our stakeholders for the opportunity to serve as Cencora's CEO these last 13 years. In my first call as CEO, I highlighted that we would pursue opportunities to increase our value offering to existing customers, add to our strengths in core competencies and increase shareholder value. Throughout my tenure, we have delivered on that framework and grown significantly, operationally, geographically and financially, as we built upon our scale and expertise as a pharmaceutical distributor and leader in specialty by deepening and broadening our relationships upstream with pharma and advancing our solutions downstream with our provider customers. We have advanced our core distribution capabilities through organic and inorganic growth opportunities, in turn, expanding our reach and providing more patients with the life-saving medications they need. Our leadership and capabilities in specialty makes Cencora a driving force in supporting access and intelligence for cutting-edge therapies. Cencora's demonstrated growth over the past decade-plus speaks to the strength of our execution against our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. Our team's relentless focus has allowed us to continually capitalize on growth across healthcare and to be the partner of choice for both upstream biopharma and downstream providers. Cencora is strategically positioned at the center of healthcare, and as Bob steps into the role as CEO on October 1, the company will continue to build on our momentum, relationships and capabilities, guided by his leadership to drive results and create value for all of our stakeholders. I've had the pleasure of working alongside Bob for almost 20 years and I'm excited to see the future as we watch him lead Cencora. Bob's deep understanding of all facets of pharmaceutical distribution, logistics and commercialization, experience leading all of our businesses during his tenure, and his integral role in helping to shape our strategy over the years makes him incredibly well-equipped to be the company's third-ever CEO. It has been an honor and a pleasure to be a part of the company's evolution and I look forward to seeing how Cencora advances into the future. The numbers that I talked about at the opening of the call would not have been possible without the enormous contribution of so many of my colleagues throughout my 30-year career with the company, and I'm sincerely grateful and humbled by their achievements and dedication to being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. With that, we will now move to Q&A. Operator?
Operator: Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Lisa Gill: Thanks very much, and congratulations, Steve. It's been great working with you for a number of years. And Bob, congrats to you as well. My question really is around how we think about things from here. Obviously, a great quarter, great last several years and also under your tenure, Steve, but as I think about '25, really two questions. One, Bob, any change in the philosophy of how you think about whether it's giving guidance to the Street or any of the growth metrics? And then secondly, for you, Jim, I know usually here in the third quarter, you'll give us some headwinds and tailwinds and things to think about as we think about fiscal '25.
Bob Mauch: Lisa, thank you for the kind words. When you think about going forward, it's -- I'll hit the strategy point first and that kind of links to your question. I think Steve said this, but it's important to remember that Steve and I and the executive team have worked for over a long period of time on our strategy, and that's working as evidenced by our performance. And so, you shouldn't expect any changes there. And that would include how we think about our going-forward guidance and projections, but I'll let Jim answer that.
Jim Cleary: Sure. Great. Lisa, I'll answer the second part of your question. I'll start by saying that we'll provide comprehensive guidance at the end of our fiscal year after we've completed our year-end planning process. I'll also say that we do feel good about our long-term guidance that contemplates operating income growth of 5% to 8% and EPS growth of 8% to 12%. And you asked about puts and takes. Items that would move us within a range include things like growth in specialty products to physicians and health systems and the growth rate in that important part of our business, continued positive utilization trends, of course, timing of capital deployment, including any timing of share repurchases. And then also one other thing for fiscal year '25 is comparison to the first season with commercial COVID vaccines. As you'll recall in the first quarter of fiscal year '24, we sold a lot of commercial COVID vaccines and we're preparing for that and -- for the first quarter of '25, but of course, it's hard to predict the absolute level. I'll finish by just saying that we've consistently delivered strong financial performance, driven by our leading market positions and the continued execution by our team members, our pharmaceutical-centric foundation and our competitive position enables us to capitalize on market trends and continue to deliver solid results. So, thanks a lot for the question, Lisa.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
Michael Cherny: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and I'll echo Lisa's comments, Steve. It's been a pleasure. I know you're not going too far, but we'll certainly miss you on these calls. And welcome hearing from Bob more. Maybe just to kind of follow-up a little bit on the second part of Lisa's question, as you think about the market today, you talked last quarter about some of the changes in list prices and how it impacted the quarterly results you saw, at least from a revenue basis in the U.S., a nice sequential uptick. Where do you see relative to where you'd expect? I mean, Jim, you mentioned the long-term trajectory, but where do you see the health of the markets today as you prepare to give us that full guidance? And in terms of what could be a positive/negative dynamic, obviously, you have a lot of customers, some big, some small going through strategic changes. How does that factor into how you think about the trajectory going forward for your business?
Jim Cleary: Yeah. I'll start out in talking about the overall health of the market. We continue to see very good utilization trends. We saw solid utilization trends in the quarter, which is something we've talked about for quite some time. Those include continued growth of GLP-1s, which of course, drive top-line, but are minimally profitable on the bottom-line. But we are also seeing particularly strong sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems that continue to outpace the broader market growth. And within specialty, we're seeing positive trends in both oncology and ophthalmology. Other kind of macro things as you're asking about, drug pricing, really no new commentary there. Brand inflation, that we would have talked more about last quarter because of the timing, brand inflation continues to be in line with our expectations, but then of course, over 95% of our brand buy-side dollars are fee for service. And generic deflation, really the same commentary that we've had for quite some time now that we've seen a moderation of generic deflation. And of course, our business model is not as reliant on generic pricing because of our contract rebalancing. But overall, in terms of market trends, it's very consistent with our recent commentary.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Congrats, Steve. And looking forward to working more with you, Bob, going forward. Maybe just a question about the PharmaLex business. I know -- can you talk about sort of how pharma -- how that cycle is going? We've heard across the spectrum that we've seen some weaker spending in that. Where do you think we are in that cycle? And how -- what have been your sort of tentative comments from your customers in terms of 2025 budgets there? Thank you.
Jim Cleary: Yeah. So, I will start. We've seen some softness in our consulting business as we commented on -- in our prepared remarks, and that's been noted by some other companies in the space. There are some early positive indicators in the market. It's too early to call it a rebound, but we are seeing some early positive indicators. And our team is really focused on identifying and prioritizing revenue-generating action items. And I'll also say that we do remain confident in our strategic decision to acquire the business.
Bob Mauch: Yeah, Jim, I'll just add. And Elizabeth, first, thanks for the question, and thank you for the warm welcome, but I'll just reinforce what Jim said at the end there. We have a strong belief in the strategic thesis that the innovation in pharma will continue over a long period of time and that our pharma services businesses, which are higher-growth, higher-margin businesses will benefit that. And from time to time, there will be partial slowdowns in that area, but as Jim said, we are seeing improvement.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Allen Lutz: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First, congrats, Steve, on a really nice run here over the past 13 years. One question for Jim. The gross margin was relatively flat quarter -- year-over-year last quarter, but now it seems to be continuing the normal trend down. Is that all due to the reacceleration of GLP-1s? I know there's a lot going on underneath the hood, insulin pricing, vaccine, currency headwinds in GLP-1s, but I'm curious if there's anything else to call out there. Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Yeah, thanks a lot for asking that question. And the decline in gross profit margin this quarter is very explainable. First, let me say, year-over-year in the U.S., it's due to increase in sales of lower-margin GLP-1s. And then, if you look at it on a consolidated basis, really the balance is simply due to mix. The U.S. business grew faster in the quarter, of course, than the International business did and the U.S. business has lower gross profit margins. The International business has more of the kind of higher-margin businesses in it, and so that mix also had an impact during the quarter. Thank you for asking.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is now open.
Eric Percher: Thanks. I can't resist a kind of historic question for Steve, and Bob, I'll welcome you to comment as well. Of late, we've seen quite a few large oncology groups up for sale, and obviously, one of those benefited you last year with OneOncology, and another now in Florida in the news on a possible sale. Steve, do you think that there's a change going on? Is there pressure on these businesses that's leading to this change? Or do you think that they're looking to monetize from a position of strength? And then, the follow-through there is, does that ultimately create opportunity or risk for Cencora?
Steve Collis: Hi, Eric. And thanks to everyone for the kind congratulations. On that question, look, the specialty market is very dynamic. There's no doubt that the aggregators in oncology are becoming more pronounced in their market share, even within our own business, as many community oncologists look to aggregate with shared services and offerings, more comprehensive offerings, but it's not for all of the customers that we have. And I think geography and certain payer mixes within regions, mixes within the practice between Medicare and Medicaid, philosophy around value-based care, all of that can make a difference. We intend to be the leader in the market in oncology and we've demonstrated that for well over two decades. I think Bob is committed to that as I've been, and we'll look to participate vigorously in the market. And sometimes, if that needs investing, we've shown with OneOncology that we will do that. Bob, anything to add?
Bob Mauch: Yeah, Steve. Eric, thanks for the question. I would add, I think what we're seeing is a real demonstration of the value of community oncology within the healthcare system. And they are a high-quality, lower-cost, side of care. And as they come together, they're building scale, which will actually make them more efficient and more effective. And as Steve said, they'll be even better prepared to participate in value-based care programs when those are more widely available. So, I think as a macro trend, it's positive. And as Steve said, we will do our best to make sure that we continue to lead in that area.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And Steve, I'd like to congrats on a successful tenure here, and Bob look forward to working more with you. I just want to kind of maybe follow-up on some of the earlier questions here. Obviously, when your large customers are undergoing sort of a restructuring here and a lot of details probably have yet to be kind of worked out, but I guess when you guys are doing your planning, is it fair to think that you are in discussions with your clients to kind of work through? Do they share with you sort of their plans on how they're working -- thinking through things like closures et cetera, or is that something that you find out along the way? And just maybe sort of how you factor that in when you're thinking about setting up sort of your projections for the coming year? Thanks.
Bob Mauch: Yeah, I'll start with that. So, the answer to your question in terms of how we work together and making sure that their strategic execution goes well, as you'd expect, we work very, very closely together. So, these are not plans that we would find out about after the fact. In fact, we would expect to and be involved in supporting that and helping, right, so that the most successful outcome possible is achieved. And in the example of store closures, that's something that we'll work very closely with Walgreens on, and we expect that they'll have a good level of success in maintaining the volume, but we do work very closely together, not only on but overall in our position with Walgreens and really all of our customers is to make sure that we're doing everything that we can to support their strategy and build long-term strategic relationships. And that's exactly what we're doing as we sit here today with Walgreens.
Jim Cleary: Yeah, and I'll just very briefly answer the last part of the question. And I think it goes without saying, but of course, we stay close to our key customers and we always are estimating growth and take that into account as we're developing our annual plans.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks. So, excluding some of the FX dynamics in the International business, can you detail some of those moving pieces that you're seeing there, like the technology investments that you're making, but also underlying utilization trends kind of internationally? Is there anything else to kind of call out there? And then, just a second question on animal health. Any sort of update on underlying demand trends there across livestock and companion animal? Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Okay. There's a lot there, Erin, and let me quickly go through it. So first of all, on International, as we said during the prepared remarks in the International segment, operating income was down 4.1% this quarter on a reported basis and up 1% on a constant currency basis. And the results -- there are couple of things that we called out. And as we previously called out, there were higher IT expenses in our European distribution businesses and we've continued to do the right thing, which is kind of investing in IT there. So, we have very good systems there. And then, the one other thing that we called out is lower operating income in our global specialty logistics business, which is long term, a great performing business, but what we saw this quarter was less international shipments and some lower rates per shipment. So, those are two things that impacted International this quarter. And we did have this quarter a very good performance by our Canadian business. And so, from a guidance perspective, we brought down the top end of the operating income growth range by 1 percentage point in our International segment. And just to put it into perspective, 1 percentage point is about $7 million. And we indicated we were modestly lowering that range due to the third quarter results and some softness in the PharmaLex business. But overall, what I will say is that results will tend to be a little bit more lumpy in our International business than in our U.S. business, because our U.S. business is really driven by pharmaceutical distribution and the utilization trends there, where the International business has more of the high-margin, high-growth businesses in it that can tend to be a bit more lumpy from time to time. And so, the second part of the question, really nothing new to call out in animal health. Year-to-date, revenue growth has been 7%. We're basically continuing to see the same sorts of trends in companion animal and production animal that we talked about, and I would say, we are seeing just kind of very good execution by our team there. And I think that fully covers it, Erin. Thank you for those questions.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Your line is now open.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And I'll add my congrats to Steve for a tremendous run here and Bob for officially taking the reins. Jim, maybe one for you on guidance. It does imply on the U.S. side a bit of an outsized sequential decline in operating income for your fiscal 4Q. Curious if you could provide a little more detail on what specifically is driving that sequential decline, particularly given, I would assume that you'd see a bit more operating income from commercial COVID vaccines in 4Q versus 3Q. Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Yeah. So, let me address that, and I believe your question was focused on the U.S. segment. And of course, we are increasing our operating income guidance in the U.S. towards the upper end of the previous range. So, we were guiding at 10% to 12% adjusted operating income growth and now we're guiding at 11% to 12% adjusted operating income growth. And really nothing specific to call out there beyond what we have been talking about is solid utilization trends and broad-based, good performance across many business units and particularly strong sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems. So, the thing that could move us within that guidance range as we kind of get to the end of our fiscal year is just kind of how well businesses perform as the year ends. And then, the COVID part of it is key, and so thank you for asking that. We expect the contribution from total COVID to be down year-over-year in our fourth quarter. And the contribution from commercial vaccines, we expect to be comparable year-over-year, but we expect very little contribution from therapies in the fourth quarter, and we are lapping the fourth quarter of last year when we had contribution of $0.08 from exclusive therapies. And so that is kind of the one thing that creates a bit of a headwind in the comp year-over-year is we did have the $0.08 from exclusive therapies last year and we're expecting very little contribution from those -- from commercial therapies this year. Thank you for asking the question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
George Hill: Yeah. Good morning, guys. And I'll extend my well wishes to Bob. And Steve, it's been great working with you. And, Jim, I look forward to continuing work with you. But I guess I'll ask a little bit of a pointed question about the Walgreens relationship, just because the management team at Walgreens has been pretty pointed about the idea of trying to extract more value from its relationship with you guys. I know there's a tremendous amount of investor concern, I think, regarding both the relationship and the earning stream that Cencora generates as it relates to Walgreens. So, Steve or Bob, would love to hear you guys kind of open mic on the status of the relationship kind of earnings exposure. If there's a way that you can kind of talk about that on the call? I can see why that would be a challenge. But just kind of like -- or maybe you can just talk about how you guys are collaborating to drive value for Walgreens. I think any color there would be appreciated.
Bob Mauch: Yeah. Hi, George, thanks for the question and the warm wishes. Yeah, look, Walgreens is an incredibly strategic relationship for us and a strategic partnership between the two of us. As I mentioned earlier in one of the operational questions, we work every day to make sure that we're supporting the strategy of WBA, as they go forward. And I think it's important to note that we have a very broad and strategic relationship. So, there certainly is the Walgreens distribution relationship, there's also the Boots distribution relationship, and of course, we buy generics together. So, as you would expect, we're working very closely with them. We want to do everything that we can to support their strategy as they go forward. But as long-term strategic partners, we're at the table doing everything that we can.
Steve Collis: Yeah. And it's -- of course, George, as you well recall it since 2013, and I think Bob's got it, we also support Boots. That's a key relationship. So, it's something that we're proud of and you can expect that Cencora, in our usual diligent way, will approach this thoughtfully and with a mind to creating long-term value.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Stephanie Davis: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. And echoing everyone else, Steve, congrats on a really strong track record over the years. We've seen a lot of movement in your end market, as George has called out, and as contracts kind of have changed hands this year at what feels like an accelerated rate. So, I wanted to ask you a two-parter. First, how are you differentiating yourself versus your peers during your renewals? Like, what are the big ways you're highlighting you are able to add value? And secondly, I know you've had some kind of changeover in how your contracts are structured as it goes through the years of the contract. Could you remind us on how that changes renewal dynamics? Thanks very much.
Bob Mauch: Yeah, I'll take that. Thank you, Stephanie, very much. Look, the environment is, as it has been for a long period of time, competitive, but also very stable. We work diligently to make sure that we're supporting all of our customers across our entire portfolio, which is really from end to end, from a provider standpoint, here in the United States and outside of the United States. Specifically, we're working to help drive efficiency. We'll work to help improve service levels where that's important to those customers. And it's a customized approach, and that's really important for the large customers in particular. Then, we also have our programmatic services that Steve mentioned, our ThoughtSpot conference and our Good Neighbor Pharmacy independent pharmacy customers. And of course, we've talked about community oncologists as we go through. So, each of those customer segments requires a different approach, but in every case, we work diligently and we invest in having long-term strategic partnerships, so that we bring the resources of Cencora to support that customer strategy. Specifically, on the pricing front that you asked about, Stephanie, we have over many years worked to balance our contracts, so that when we work with a provider customer, pharmacy customer that we are not subsidizing one product category over another so that as mix changes happen, there's not a detriment to the customer or to Cencora. So, it's a bit more predictable as we go forward and as the market dynamics continue. So, we believe it's healthy and a positive in terms of our customer relationships.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is now open.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. I think most of mine have been covered. I wanted to come back to just quickly on, it sounded like a combination of both specialty logistics and PharmaLex, if I understood correctly, it sounded like you referenced early positive signs of a rebound. Just correct me if I'm wrong, if it was just in specialty logistics? But what are those early positive signs or leading indicators that you referenced? Do you have any details you could share? Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Yes. In the discussion of specialty logistics, the specific things that we were referring to when we said early positive signs were some volume trends. And so Eric, it was specifically on that. And I'll also just comment on that, as you know, that's a business that has just outperformed and grown really nicely for many years, and it's just -- it is a fantastic business for the long term.
Operator: Thank you...
Eric Coldwell: Thank you. I realized that...
Operator: Thank you.
Jim Cleary: Thank you, Eric.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open.
Kevin Caliendo: Thanks. Appreciate the time. And, Steve, just want to say always appreciated your calming voice in this crazy world in which we operate sometimes. Super helpful.
Steve Collis: Thank you.
Kevin Caliendo: Guys, I just wanted to ask, have you been approached yet or have you seen any disruption at all from any of your independence from what's been going on with [NADAC] (ph)? Have they come to you for relief or help, or is there anything that you can do try to offset what's been upwards now a 20% hit to their reimbursement? I'm just wondering how -- what the feedback has been from your independent and small regional chains who are being hit hardest by this.
Bob Mauch: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. I'll start with just macro. The independents have been incredibly resilient over a long period of time. And as we've said a few times during this call, our intent is to be really close to them at all times. So, we're always talking to our customers, including the independent customers, about how we can best support them. NADAC specifically, it's a voluntary survey. We've seen the volatility in that survey and we're not seeing specific requests from our independent customers around this, at this time. But it's -- obviously, this and all things in the market around reimbursement, we stay very, very close to and close to our customers.
Steve Collis: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.
Steve Collis: With that, we'll conclude our call, and I'll just make some concluding remarks. I just wanted to thank the analyst community for their interest and support and bearing through 53 quarters of the South African accent, which, of course, has been well shared. And also thank all the people that I don't necessarily call out on the call, including, the people in Jim's team who helped prepare these numbers, and Bennett's team that are so outstanding and so committed to the purpose of Cencora. So, in concluding, I just would also like to wish Bob as much success and performance and pride during his tenure as CEO as I've enjoyed. Thank you for your time today.
Bob Mauch: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-05-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Cencora Q2 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Alex, and I will be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] 
 Now I'll now hand it over to your host, Bennett Murphy, to begin. Please go ahead. 
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2024 second quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Steven Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Bob Mauch, Executive Vice President and COO. 
 On today's call, we'll be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com. We've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website.
 During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q. 
 Cencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call may cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. You have the opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask you to limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. 
Steven Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Before turning to discuss our second quarter results, I want to take a moment to introduce Bob Mauch, our current COO, who we announced in March will be succeeding me as CEO on October 1. For nearly 2 decades, Bob has been an integral partner in shaping and implementing our strategy. In Bob's time leading operations across our businesses, he has developed deep relationship with our partners and team members and his knowledge of our business and considerable expertise will significantly benefit the company as he leads Cencora into our next chapter.
 I want to extend my sincere congratulations to Bob, and will now turn the call to him to make some brief comments. Bob? 
Robert Mauch: Thank you, Steve. I'm excited to be joining today's call and look forward to deepening my relationships with our investor and analyst stakeholders in the quarters to come. It's an honor to succeed you to become Cencora's third CEO on October 1. Cencora is positioned as a leading health care solutions organization is rooted in our purpose, pharmaceutical-centric strategy and growth mindset. Our purpose, capabilities, and the critical role that pharmaceuticals have in health care and patient outcomes motivate me personally and professionally. 
 My parents owned independent community and long-term care pharmacies, so I grew up appreciating firsthand the critical role that pharmaceuticals play and positive patient outcomes. That experience helped shape my 30-plus year career in pharmaceutical care leading me to found Xcenda, the health outcomes consulting firm for pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting me on the path that eventually brought me to Cencora.
 Since then, I've had the pleasure of leading businesses across our company, building and fostering our strong relationships with market-leading customers and partners and developing strong teams that are differentiated by their unique backgrounds and expertise.
 Throughout my 17 years at Cencora, I have worked closely with Steve and our teams to help shape our strategy. During that time, I've had the opportunity to benefit from Steve's leadership and mentorship and his fierce devotion to our people and purpose. I'm grateful that I will be able to continue to work closely with Steve throughout this transition over the next several months, and I look forward to benefiting from his continued leadership, partnership and guidance in his new role of Executive Chair later this year.
 Thank you to our Board of Directors and our team members for the trust and opportunity as I move into this new role. Together, we will continue to drive value for all our stakeholders, both now and in the years to come. I'm pleased to have had the opportunity to join today's call and share how excited I am for my future role.
 With that said, I'll leave it to Steve and Jim to answer your questions as usual. I'll look forward to speaking with you all more in the weeks and months ahead. I'll now turn the call back to Steve to discuss our fiscal second quarter. 
Steven Collis: Thank you, Bob. I also wanted to take a moment to acknowledge Gina Clark, our EVP and Chief Communications and Administration Officer, who announced this morning will be retiring at the end of our fiscal year. Gina has had a distinguished career and made an enduring impact, leading large-scale initiatives across the organization, including uniting our company and our new globally inclusive identity, Cencora. Congratulations, and thank you, Gina, for your significant contributions. 
 Now turning to our second quarter. Our ongoing focus on operational excellence and our team members' execution on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy drove another quarter of strong financial performance with revenue growth of 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%. Our role at the center of health care is core to our strategy and our positioning allows us to serve as a trusted partner while capturing opportunities presented by innovation, leveraging and investing in our infrastructure and extensive capabilities, we support access and efficiency across health care. Our multinational distribution footprint and global platform of commercialization services makes us a natural partner for manufacturers bringing their products to market.
 With our increasing presence in pharma services, we are able to cultivate relationships with pharma early in the development process and position ourselves as not only a provider of logistics and distribution services but also as an integrated partner able to support the successful commercialization of their products.
 Connecting with our manufacturer partners is key to better understanding and anticipating their ever-evolving needs and challenges. In early April, we hosted our first ThinkLive series of the fiscal year, in which representatives from over 30 manufacturer partners, and the Cencora team came together to share their insights or new ways we can collaborate and work to support ongoing innovation in the pharmaceutical space. Over the course of the year, we will host a number of these events focus on the different needs of our manufacturer partners from biopharmas and cell and gene therapy developers to the largest established manufacturers.
 The discussions we are having with pharma innovators provides us with a deep understanding of their pipelines for life-altering innovations, giving us a direct line of sight to development opportunities for our commercialization services portfolio. Additionally, for products that have been launched, our role at the center of the supply chain, and our global footprint allow us to capitalize on valuable insights and shared commercial opportunities, including for launches in additional geographies. 
 Cencora has always endeavored to be a trusted industry partner and our integrated approach to commercialization is increasingly sought out and appreciated by our pharma partners. To this end, we were pleased to win another integrated services and distribution contract with an emerging biotech this quarter, while small in the context of the Cencora Enterprise, wins like this are important proof points that demonstrate our integrated model and global capabilities are differentiated and resonating with manufacturers.
 As we continue to advance our commercialization capabilities, we further strengthen our ability to contribute to pharmaceutical outcomes and support innovation. As the entire health care ecosystem continues to advance, we are embracing the latest technology to support our customers' growth and providing actionable insights to our partners, leveraging data and analytics. We continue to develop solutions for our provider customers, allowing them to focus on patient care and efficiently run their practices. Recently, we introduced an enhanced application that combines clinical, pharmacy, and financial information in one place for specialty physicians. 
 With this integrated platform, our customers can seamlessly aggregate data about their practices across our solution set to analyze their performance and drive success through customizable, easy-to-use dashboards. Similarly, given investments we have made in our infrastructure to enhance the security of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain, we are now able to provide actionable insights to manufacturers leveraging our scale and rich data sets.
 As we continue to invest in our technology and capabilities, we increasingly see opportunities to create value-added data informed solutions that drive innovation and differentiation. Minority investment in OneOncology is another example of our approach to adding solutions that will deepen and expand our relationship with our partners, allowing us to support better health care outcomes in critical areas.
 Since completing our investment in OneOncology last June, the platform has continued to grow as oncologists increasingly recognize the value of joining a physician-led network of like-minded community-based practitioners. To enhance its value proposition to physicians, OneOncology has advanced key IT and practice management technologies while investing in important clinical research and real-world evidence solutions to make community provider participation in clinical trials more seamless.
 We are taking our learnings from our investment in OneOncology to unlock new growth opportunities for all our community oncology customers while allowing them to maintain their independence and treat cancer patients with high quality and cost-effective care in their local communities. 
 Our continued partnership with OneOncology' leadership team and TPG brings together our collective strength as we work jointly to advance accessible quality cancer care. Our commitment to, and investment in community oncology, has been well received as we are clearly focused on supporting the long-term vitality of community providers across the U.S.
 Our extensive capabilities, scaled platform and deep expertise enable us to collaborate with customers to overcome evolving challenges across the health care landscape. During the quarter, the health care industry faced an impactful disruption that prevented providers across the U.S. from receiving the claims payments they rely on to run their practices and ultimately care for patients.
 Our customers, particularly community providers, found themselves in a difficult position, uncertain if they could make payroll for their employees or cover expenses for critical medications needed for patient care.
 Much like we did during the COVID-19 pandemic, our cross-functional teams were nimble in developing solutions, including offering flexible payment terms to allow our customers to keep their businesses running without jeopardizing care until claims processing was restored. By providing solutions and working to address our customers' needs, we deepened our relationships while supporting continuity and access to care. The work we do would not be possible without our purpose-driven team members who diligently work to support our customers and their patients. 
 At Cencora, we are focused on fostering a globally united culture that promotes the well-being of our 46,000 team members across our footprint. A recent example of the strength of our culture was in Lithuania where we operate both the distribution business and a Cencora business services center. We were proud to be recognized by the Lithuanian Ministry of Social Security and Labor with the safest emotional environment award for our shared services center, adding to the accolades the office has received in the past several years. This award is just one example of the strong culture Cencora has built and recognize key elements of our people and culture strategy, including our leading benefits offering.
 I'm proud our teams have embraced our multinational presence which better allows us to serve our customers' needs across geographies and time zones, while maintaining our purpose-driven culture. As we continue to grow as a globally united enterprise, we prioritize building a culture that celebrates the unique backgrounds and experiences of our team members and will provide diverse differentiated perspective, enhancing our business.
 As a crucial link in the pharmaceutical supply chain, it is imperative that Cencora has robust business resiliency plans to ensure the delivery of crucial pharmaceuticals, including in the face of a changing climate. As we further our business resiliency efforts, we are mindful of the impact our operations have on the environment and work closely with our partners to drive sustainability initiatives, help them to understand their emission footprint and ultimately report on our joint progress in partnering with stakeholders across the supply chain on these important topics we amplify our impact across our footprint.
 While we continue to advance our work in our own operations and in partnership with other stakeholders, we were pleased that our efforts were acknowledged by Newsweek on its inaugural list of America's Greenest Companies that recognizes the top 300 companies in the United States who are making progress to positively change their sustainability footprint. Running an environmentally responsible business will continue to be an important aspect of our business resiliency planning and aligns closely with our purpose of creating healthier futures.
 In closing, the ever-changing health care environment necessitates that we remain agile and adaptive alongside our partners, both up and downstream. I am incredibly proud of our purpose-driven team members who exemplified their customer-centric approach and intellectual confidence to help providers maintain access to care during a challenging time.
 As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we remain focused on creating a best-in-class customer experience embracing innovation and investing in our infrastructure to drive our pharmaceutical-centric strategy forward, creating value for all our stakeholders. 
 I will now turn the call over to Jim for an in-depth review of our second quarter results and updated guidance. Jim? 
James Cleary: Thanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn to my prepared remarks, I want to extend my congratulations to both Steve and Bob on our recently announced leadership succession plan. Since joining Cencora in 2015, I've had the pleasure of working closely with both Steve and Bob as we have executed on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and focused on creating long-term value.
 Steve's purpose-driven leadership and strategic vision have shaped Cencora into the company it is today, characterized by our foundation in pharmaceutical distribution, complementary solutions up and downstream and long-standing leadership in specialty. I look forward to continuing to benefit from Steve's expertise as he steps into the Executive Chair role in October. 
 Like Steve, Bob has deep knowledge in and passion for supporting positive patient outcomes through pharmaceutical-centric care. Bob's experience leading our commercial operations and building talented customer-focused teams will benefit our company and all its stakeholders in the years to come.
 Now turning to our results. Cencora delivered strong performance in our second quarter, and we are pleased to raise our adjusted operating income guidance for the full fiscal year. Our teams continue to execute and stay focused on providing customer-centric services and solutions as evidenced in the quarter when we leveraged the strength of our balance sheet to support our customers during a time of industry-wide need.
 The important role we play at the center of health care, powered by our people and the long-term partnerships we have forged positions us well to continue to innovate, solve problems for customers and create significant value across the pharmaceutical supply chain. 
 I'll now turn to a review of our consolidated second quarter results. And as a reminder, my remarks will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. 
 Starting with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $68.4 billion, up 8%, with solid growth in both segments. In the quarter, we saw continued strong trends in sales of specialty products to physicians and health systems and growth in sales to some of our larger customers, offsetting the manufacturer price reductions in certain product classes which were known well in advance. While we've continued to see growth in sales of GLP-1 products, this quarter, the growth rate moderated as we lapped the rapid adoption of the products in the second quarter of our fiscal 2023 and due to GLP-1 supply constraints in the quarter.
 Consolidated gross profit was $2.5 billion, up 7%. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.70%, a decrease of 1 basis point. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.5 billion, up 5% due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses to support revenue growth offset in part by the efficiency actions we called out last year on our May earnings call. Consolidated operating income was $1.0 billion, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year quarter with good growth in both segments, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing the segment level results. 
 Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the second quarter. Net interest expense was $64 million, flat year-over-year. As you will recall, we called out an expected sequential step-up in interest expense on our first quarter earnings call, given the typical seasonal intra-period short-term borrowings and cash use. Higher interest expense in the second quarter compared to the prior year was offset by higher interest income and the September 2023 divestiture of our less than wholly owned subsidiary in Egypt. During the quarter, we issued $500 million in senior notes due 2034 at a coupon of 5.125%. We intend to use the proceeds from the notes issuance to repay our 2024 notes due this month. Regarding income taxes, our effective income tax rate was 20.9% compared to 19.0% in the prior year quarter. 
 Turning now to diluted share count. Our diluted share count was 201.2 million shares, a 2% decrease compared to the prior year second quarter. This was primarily driven by opportunistic share repurchases during the second half of fiscal 2023 and continued share repurchases in fiscal 2024, including $50 million in repurchases in the second quarter in conjunction with Walgreens Boots Alliance [ lock sale ] in February.
 Regarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of approximately $0.5 million. During the quarter, many of our customers were impacted by the Change Healthcare outage that severely limited customers' cash flows as claims payments were delayed. 
 To help our partners, we provided customers in need with extended payment terms giving them the financial flexibility to maintain their operations and focus on caring for their patients. The support we provided to our customers created a cash flow headwind in the second quarter of approximately $600 million, which we fully expect will reverse in our third fiscal quarter. The strength of our balance sheet and execution by our team members has allowed us to play a pivotal role in supporting our customers during this challenging time. And I am appreciative of our team members who work diligently and collaboratively to understand our customers' needs and be agile in the face of uncertainty while being prudent to ensure we also protect Cencora and its shareholders. This completes the review of our consolidated results. 
 Now I'll turn to our segment results for the second quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $61.3 billion, up 8%, with solid growth in our distribution businesses including continued growth in sales to specialty physician practices and health systems and volume growth in GLP-1. Excluding sales of GLP-1 products, which increased by $1.3 billion, segment revenue growth would have been nearly 6.5%. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 11% to $841 million as we continue to benefit from our leadership in specialty, both oncology and non-oncology and solid utilization trends. In the quarter, we also saw a benefit from our focus on managing operating expense growth as we compare to a period with elevated expenses prior to the efficiency actions we took last spring.
 As it relates to COVID contributions, in the quarter, we saw a decline in demand for commercial COVID-19 vaccines and contributions related to exclusive COVID treatment distribution were not meaningful as expected. As we no longer expect contribution from exclusive COVID treatment distribution, we no longer plan to provide guidance for ex-COVID growth rates. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we recognized $0.06 of exclusive treatment contribution which is the only contribution expected in the segment this fiscal year compared to $0.31 in the U.S. of the total $0.38 consolidated contribution for exclusive treatments in fiscal 2023. 
 I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.1 billion, up 5% on a reported basis or up 10% on a constant currency basis. International Healthcare Solutions operating income was $193 million, up 10% on a reported basis due primarily to growth for our less than wholly owned distribution business in Brazil and our Canadian business. In the quarter, our European distribution business delivered growth and benefited from manufacturer price adjustments in a developing market country, which offsets the decline in value of local currency. On a constant currency basis, International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income growth was 22%. That completes the review of our segment level results. 
 I'll now discuss our updated fiscal 2024 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. I will start with EPS and then provide detail on the income statement items driving our updated EPS guidance.
 We are raising the lower end of our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance and now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.30 to $13.50 from our previous range of $13.25 to $13.50, representing growth of 11% to 13%. The updated range reflects our expectation for continued growth and execution in the balance of our fiscal year and also updated expectations on a few items below the operating income line. 
 Moving now to revenue. Our guidance for consolidated revenue growth is unchanged at 10% to 12%. In the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we are narrowing our guidance range for segment level revenue growth and now expect as-reported revenue growth of 4% to 7% from the previous range of 4% to 8%, and constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 10% from the previous range of 7% to 11%.
 Turning now to adjusted operating income. We expect consolidated adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 9% to 11%, up from our previous guidance of 8% to 10% due to our updated expectations for the U.S. 
 In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 10% to 12%, up from our prior range of 9% to 11%. Our increased guidance reflects our strong performance to date and continued growth in the second half, though at a more moderate rate, primarily due to COVID-19 vaccine seasonality and comparing to the prior year fourth quarter, which was the initial quarter that had a meaningful commercial COVID vaccine contribution.
 As context, in the first half, we saw segment level operating income growth of 16%, well above our initial expectations when excluding commercial COVID-19 vaccine contributions, our growth was 8% in the first half. Switching now to exclusive COVID therapies. As a reminder, in the third and fourth quarters, we will have headwinds of $0.05 and $0.08, respectively, as we lap prior year contributions from exclusive COVID therapy distribution. 
 Turning now to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. Our as-reported operating income growth guidance remains unchanged and reflects the strengthening of the dollar in recent weeks. On a constant currency basis, we now expect segment-level operating income growth to be in the range of 10% to 13%, up from our previous range of 9% to 12%. Regarding our adjusted effective tax rate, we now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21% from our previous range of 20% to 21%.
 Moving now to share count. We now expect our weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 201 million to 202 million shares from our previous range of 200 million to 202 million shares.
 Finally, turning to adjusted free cash flow. Our guidance remains unchanged, and we expect to generate approximately $2.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow.
 In closing, our teams across 	Cencora have continued to execute, allowing us to deliver strong financial results. As I reflect on the second quarter, I am impressed by the way our talented team members came together to support our customers, exemplifying customer centricity and agility and responding to challenges.
 As we look to the second half of our fiscal year, our pharmaceutical-centric strategy investments to enhance our infrastructure and drive innovation and our commitment to our purpose will continue to drive differentiated value creation for all our stakeholders.
 Now I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. 
Elizabeth Anderson: I think maybe one sort of on a high-level basis. Can you talk about the succession plan and sort of like how that came about? And then as we think about sort of the next few months sort of the key priorities of that succession plan, and then Bob, is -- you sort of take the reins fully later this year, can we talk about sort of like what your initial set of priorities is there? 
Steven Collis: Yes. Elizabeth, thanks for the question. I'll take it. And so our Board has been obviously a company of our size and the enterprise that we manage, of course, is very focused on the practice of succession planning, and 2 weeks ago, I actually had my 30th anniversary at the company, and of course, 13 years as CEO, and Bob has been in the COO position for 2 years. So we've been focused a lot on making sure that key executives have the right development opportunities.
 For me, personal, it was -- personally, it was really imperative that we have an internal candidate because of the importance of culture in our relationship, the importance of knowledge of our customers and the complex enterprises. Honestly, any new executive that comes in the company, after 6 months, the first thing they say to me is, I'm shocked how complicated everything is. And that's because it's a lot. We have a lot of different aspects to our business.
 And it's -- so it's important that someone that knew the business really well would be my successor. And during the last few years, Bob has exemplified the sort of leadership characteristics that we look for, that the Board and the management team looks to in leadership. He's also a pharmacist, which I think it's also my model where one of the major public wholesalers that has been led by pharmacist, perhaps I'm wrong, Bennett will research it. 
 So I think that, that's a really nice also [ extras ] on Bob becoming the third CEO in Cencora's history. But Bob and I have worked also very closely together as well as the -- all the executive management team has worked very closely with Bob and Jim and myself as we have guided the enterprise. And we have got 6 months left until the actual transition takes place on October 1. It's business as usual. Of course, Bob is thinking a lot about the future and what he will be like. And he'll be joining us on the next call, and you'll all get to name better at conferences, et cetera. And the company is in very, very good hands. And the company is also in very good shape. So I think our investors should feel very good about how Cencora is positioned. So thanks for the question. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. 
Lisa Gill: I wanted to focus on the margin improvement. And as we think about -- I think Jim, you talked about a couple of the key drivers, specialty, nonspecialty, expense growth, but it's very impressive of what you've been able to do. So can you give us a little more color? Are you seeing anything, for example, on the biosimilars side.
 And then just secondly, I wanted to make sure that, that I understood the below line impact, because I'm coming up with a number that's like $0.12 impact based on the tax rate going up by a little bit and the share count going up by a little bit. So I just really wanted to understand those two elements as we think about them playing out for the rest of the year. And Steve, I hope this isn't our last earnings call with you. 
Steven Collis: I'll just go quickly. No, it's not. I'll be on -- I'll certainly be on next quarter. So thank you, Lisa, and I'll hand over to Jim. 
James Cleary: Yes, Lisa, thanks a lot. Thank you Lisa, for that question. We did have a very good quarter from the standpoint of from both gross profit percentage and operating income percentage during the quarter. So thank you for calling that out. We did have very nice margins during the quarter.
 And I'll talk about a number of things that drove the margins. One is the WAC  reductions that I talked about in my prepared remarks, particularly with regard to insulin, that brought down revenue growth, but it caused an improvement in gross profit margin. And as we've talked about in the past, when this sort of thing happens, our team works with manufacturers to make sure that we continue to be fairly compensated, which is what successfully happened in this case. So the WAC  reductions brought down revenue growth but improved gross margin percentage.
 Another thing that impacted GP percentage is kind of the GLP-1 growth was less than we had expected. And I talked about this in my prepared remarks also GLP-1 growth during the quarter was $1.3 billion of growth versus $2.1 billion of growth in the first quarter. And that again caused revenue growth to be a little bit lower but caused gross profit percentage to be a little bit higher and the GLP-1s were a little bit less than we had expected. 
 Another thing that really drove gross profit margin during the quarter and during the first half was contributions from COVID vaccines. The margins are good on COVID vaccines, and our performance was better than we expected, particularly in the second quarter and so that helped our GP percentage, and we'd expect that to drop off in the third quarter. And also, a GP percentage was higher year-over-year in the International segment. So all those things helped our margins.
 And then from an operating margin standpoint, it's not only all those things, but we've done a very good job focusing on managing operating expenses. We had the OpEx efficiency initiatives that we executed a year ago, and we've continued to focus on OpEx. And so we had GP growth of 7%, OpEx growth of 5%, and so that operating leverage helped us which drove our 11% OI growth. And so I think that addresses your margin question.
 And on the below the line stuff, we just are seeing incrementally higher tax rate, and that would have to do with mix. And we're just seeing a little bit more income and growth in the U.S., which has a little bit higher tax rate.
 And then on share count, our guidance is now 201 million to 202 million shares. And after the first 6 months, we're at 201.5 million. And as we do some repurchases in the back half of the year, it'd impacts fiscal year '25 more than fiscal year '24. And so as a result of that, we increased EPS guidance by increasing in a $0.05 at the bottom end of the range. So our EPS guidance overall is up by $0.025 at the midpoint of the range. And so I think that addresses all of your questions, Lisa. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Grosslight of Citi. 
Daniel Grosslight: Congrats on a great run as CEO, Steve, and congrats Bob on your new role here. I wanted to stick with kind of guidance and really around margins for the remainder of the year. Guidance does imply a step down in the second half AOI year-over-year growth, even when you back out the impact of COVID.
 So I'm curious if you can just provide a little more detail on the year-over-year growth as you step down in the second half, and perhaps how the efficiency plan that you put in place last year in the second half of '23 is impacting that year-over-year growth rate. 
James Cleary: Yes. Great. I'd be happy to address all those things. So our updated operating income guidance reflects our strong first half performance and continued operating income growth in the back half of the year. And the difference in growth rate in the first half versus the back half of FY '24 is largely due to COVID vaccine seasonality. And related to that, the COVID vaccine contribution we saw in the first half of FY '24 as well as the contribution we saw in the fourth quarter of FY '23.
 And then also the back half has a headwind due to the $0.05 and $0.08 of contribution from exclusive COVID therapies that we had in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year '23. And then you referenced the efficiency actions we took a year ago April. And so in the back half, as you mentioned, we do lap the expense efficiency initiatives that we implemented last year.
 So in the U.S., the first half, we saw segment level operating income growth of 16% well above our initial expectations. As I said in my prepared remarks, when you exclude COVID vaccine contributions, our growth was 8% in the first half. And our guidance implies very good growth in the back half in the U.S. due to expected continued strength of specialty and solid utilization trends that we've talked about for some time and the growth rate is impacted versus the first half for the specific reasons that I mentioned, which are mostly COVID related. And so I think that addresses your questions. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. 
Eric Percher: I might switch gears to a question on the competitive environment at large. And so for Steve and Bob, I'd be interested to hear your views given some volatility at the pharmacy, new leadership and some consideration at mail and specialty of in-sourcing that they seem to be sticking with the channel. Do you see any significant change? And what do you need to do to compete at the low margin, high volume end of the market?
 And then maybe for Jim, I'd come back to how are the Walgreens synergies you've identified progressing? And I just want to make sure that contract extends through 2029 in its original form. 
Steven Collis: Yes. Thanks, Eric. So it's -- look, this industry, I've been in it for 30 years with the company now, and it's -- I think that our value proposition remains as intact as ever. In fact, probably even more so with the complexity of regulatory environments, with the sort of data and insights that we're able to do, and also the way that we've built out our businesses.
 Most of the different nuances that we're seeing are really relying on some form of partnership or adjacency within our industry and many times are using the established channels. I just came, as you would imagine, back from NACDS, and I remain where we met with many strategic customers. And sure, there are challenges in the industry, particularly on the reimbursement side, which are well documented. The post that pandemic world, is there's a lot of things in influx.
 But I think all the more reason why we stay very close to our customers. We are almost always able to renew our customers, and we think that we provide a great value to those customers. None more so than and Walgreens, where we stay very close to them, and we have a long-term contract through 2029 on the distribution side and even with [ Boots ] through 2031.
 So I think we really focus on those customers. In fact, I think I made the comment to you when I last saw you that one of the things that's really changed is how close we stat to those customers, the larger customers and the small customers, not just in the RFP side but throughout the contract term. And hopefully, throughout the long-term strategic relationships that we have with these customers.
 So Jim, I'll hand over to you now. 
James Cleary: Yes. And I think, Steve, you fully addressed it in your answer, that we are always working with Walgreens and our other large customers on mutually beneficial opportunities and synergies and our management teams are needing to pursue those sorts of things. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Allen Lutz of Bank of America. 
Allen Lutz: I guess more of a high-level question here. How should we start to think about the Inflation Reduction Act, and how that could impact Cencora. Is there any way to think about any direct impact to revenue and margins?
 And then could there be more upstream opportunities to work with manufacturers around some of these benefit design changes. Just wondering if you have any initial thoughts around that. 
Steven Collis: Yes. So the Inflation Reduction Act is certainly something that we're paying close attention to. And we always talk -- I mean even going back to [indiscernible] days, he would say what keeps you up at night and [indiscernible] say [ Washington ] [indiscernible] And I think that's certainly the case more so than ever.
 But of course, the negotiations are underway. And there's -- we're going to go through the steps in the process for the 10 Part B products. But it's hard for us to see that there would be any direct impact on us, at least in the short to medium term. Beginning in 2028, Part B drugs will be subject to negotiation. And of course, we want to be mindful of innovation. It's important that -- 75% of R&D by some accounts is in the U.S. And we -- our message to regulators is always, let's make sure that this most cherished industry, probably one of the most innovative industries in the United States continues to be based here.
 I mean, it's not many decades ago when a lot of innovation took place in the U.K. And I'd say that, that largely has gone by the wayside. And as an American-based company, we would love to see that, that sort of innovation continue here on. I think that, that's also a very important part of the story that should not be lost.
 Also, we would see that manufacturers could adopt some changes in policies, for example, the different formats have longer patent [ flaws ] loss. And we don't think that, that's the way that product development should be approached.
 And the last thing I'd say is when Cencora thinks about the future and thinks about reimbursement and thinks about our provider customers, benefit design has also been very in a way punitive towards pharmacy. And we think that spreading that out more would be of great benefit to the industry and to patients, ultimately, we all serve, and make it much more understandable. I mean the notion that pharmacy is expensive, we think often is directly derived from the way that the co-pays occur at the pharmacy counter, we think that, that form of health care should be more encouraged. It's a much more efficient form of health care, which there's very little disagreement on. So thanks for the question. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. 
Stephanie Davis: Congrats on the quarter. Given some of the GLP-1 accessibility issues that haven't called out, continues to assess through the year, should we assume that GLP-1 revenue tailwinds are going more on this 1 to 2-point contribution range versus the historical closer to mid-single digit. And just given the lower calorie nature of this revenue stream, how should we think about the benefits to your margins versus what we looked at prior. 
James Cleary: Sure. I'll take that, Stephanie, and thanks a lot for the questions. And as we've talked about in the past, the GLP-1 products are a real driver of revenue growth, but they are minimally profitable. They are profitable for us but minimally profitable. And of course, we've said that for quite some time. But we -- I do feel that they'll continue to be a driver of our top line growth. And as I said earlier, what we saw in the second quarter is revenue growth of $1.3 billion from GLP-1s versus revenue growth of $2.1 billion from GLP-1s in the first quarter. And so -- but we do think that they will be a driver of top line growth. And of course, we're just so pleased to be part of an industry where there's this sort of innovation that benefits patients and just look forward to being a beneficiary ourselves of this sort of innovation for years to come. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee of TD Cowen. 
Charles Rhyee: Congrats, Bob and Steve, great working with you and look forward to hopefully catching up with you in person before you head off.
 I wanted to ask a question related, maybe one more for the World Courier side of the business. Obviously, there's talk of the BIOSECURE and that could cause some restriction of doing business with companies of concerns. And also for companies that do business with companies of concern.
 I just wanted to see if there's any potential impact and if you sort of analyzed sort of where maybe your customers of the World Courier side are partnered with? And if you thought through some of that impact and how that might affect you on that side of the business. 
Steven Collis: I'm not exactly sure what regulations are, but I can tell you, I feel incredibly good about Cencora's ability to manage a complex regulatory environment really whatever jurisdiction we are. And if we feel that we can't be comfortable with the regulations and the jurisdiction. We just don't participate in the business. The enterprises have sufficient size and scale that nothing ever makes us want to compromise any of the standards we have. In fact, we keep on increasing those standards. We want to be the leader in them.
 Charles, I think World Courier, in particular, is one of the most complex, but also compliant and thoughtful and plan for businesses that I've ever had the privilege of leading while I'm at Cencora. So I think we'll be able to cope. And I think maybe we can follow up directly with you and see if any particular concerns. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink. 
Michael Cherny: Great. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Maybe just a follow-up, I guess, to Lisa's question earlier about the guidance. I hate doing math on the slide, but I'm giving rough math of call it, $0.14 operating uptick in terms of your EBIT increase. Is that the case in terms of the breakdown into guidance?
 And then relative to the core U.S. health care business, as you think about your long-term guidance relative to where you're shaking out this year against what's also a tough comp. How do you reconcile those 2 pieces? And how do you think about the future? I'm not asking for an increase in guidance, but what could drive growth guidance continuing to be above where your long-term targets are? 
James Cleary: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you for the question. And there was a lot in that question, so I'll try and address it all. I think Lisa had commented that she thought that the OI increase in guidance was about $0.12, and I think you said $0.14. And I'll just say that's kind of the increase in guidance implies, yes, that does imply that sort of increase, and it's really offset by the higher tax and the higher shares. And so as a result of that, we basically increased EPS guidance by $0.025 at the midpoint of the range.
 And then I think the rest of the kind of questions you asked, yes, we have a lot of confidence in our long-term guidance of 5% to 8% organic operating income growth and then another 3% to 4% from capital deployment. And so long-term EPS growth guidance of 8% to 12%. And importantly, that's double digit at the midpoint of the range. And we have had a lot of success for quite some time, and in particular, the last couple of years and have posted some very good growth rates that have been driven from many things from things like our leadership in specialty to solid utilization trends.
 And in particular, as I called out on this call, some of the numbers, some of the -- kind of some of the COVID-related earnings we've had have been particularly helpful in our operating income growth. And as I said before, we're a company that's so well positioned to benefit from innovation that that's one of the things that gives us confidence in our long-term guidance. 
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. 
George Hill: I guess first thing I want to say is congrats to Bob on taking over the CEO role. And Steve, you guys are now the little engine that did, not the little engine that could. But I guess I want to hop in with two quick questions. Just number one, I want to follow up on Eric's question about the competitive environment more generally just because we've seen two sizable pieces of business which has in the last 6 months. So I guess, maybe just talk about if there's anything that we should be alluded to in the competitive dynamic?
 And then Jim or Steve, just one of the things we continue to hear is about the large drug retailers trying to increasingly go-direct to the brand drug manufacturers on terms not necessarily on logistics, trying to kind of clawback some economics from brand drug manufacturers. I guess, can you comment, is that anything that you're seeing or anything that you're facilitating. And do you expect it to have any impact on your business either positively or negatively? 
Steven Collis: Yes. So thank you, George. I do remember that article. And so thank you, and I do -- we are tremendously proud of the way that Cencora has developed in the last few years and how strong our positioning is.
 I made a couple of comments in an earlier question about how well we are communicating on a regular basis with our strategic customers. There's not that many customers that choose to change their wholesaler relationship. And in the U.S. in particular, where the big, big, large contracts are. There's three public companies that I think all do a good job, and it's a really stable industry. And we all very integrated and stay close to our customers. So it's not that usual that customers do change.
 We're not seeing a real big trend. Obviously, the mail order is a little bit different because you've got a lot of high-value products going to very few distribution points. So sometimes you do see some direct contracting there, and that's been around for a long time. But by and large, I think that the trend is to work within the industry.
 Again, the regulations are only getting more complicated. We're going to have the new complex pedigree rules that are being implemented. And it's hard to look at as good as our results have been, it's hard to look at our results and say that we're not really a paragon of efficiency and working very, very adapted in a low-margin environment. 
 So it's -- and building up around that with the cash flow that we have, as Jim gives us a long-range guidance. So I feel very good about our value proposition and our industry's value proposition. And I think that we'll be very enduring, and I don't think there's too much else to call out. Jim, anything you'd add on the competitive environment that you think it's good. 
James Cleary: Yes. 
Steven Collis: Yes. Okay. And thanks for the engine that did. That's a big complement. We've time for one more question, operator. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird. 
Eric Coldwell: I'll reiterate all the congratulations across the board. On U S. pharma revenue growth, you maintained the outlook 11% to 13%. I think you guys know that I'm less worried about revenue growth or sensitivity to revenue perhaps than maybe in other industries. But I am curious second quarter was below Street you have lower GLP-1 growth. There are the handful of negative WAC  price changes. I think there is potential to lower-priced [ Humira ] and maybe some other biosimilars to gain traction now that the PBMs are is aggressively pushing along those lines. And we also have the known customer loss, which I think the market is guesstimating is around $1.5 billion a quarter.
 So there's a lot of moving pieces there on the negative side on -- just in terms of top line growth optics, but you're maintaining that guidance. What gives you confidence? What are the drivers of doing 11% to 13% this year.
 And then maybe if I could just add on, I know that's a ton. But WAC price changes, I'm just curious if you could tell us what you saw for the net WAC price change in March quarter versus the prior year or recent years just to put that in comparison. 
Unknown Executive: Yes. So there's a lot there. And let me say with regard to our revenue guidance, what gave us the confidence, of course, to maintain that revenue guidance is just we're continuing to see solid utilization trends across the market. We're continuing due to our strength in specialty, and specialty growing better than the broader market. That's another thing that's helping us, Eric.
 And then of the things that you called out, of course, the WAC reduction for insulin is permanent, kind of the lower GLP-1 growth during the quarter. Perhaps that's temporary and driven more by some supply constraints during the quarter. So we'll have to wait and see on that. And so we have good confidence in our revenue guidance.
 But then also, and I talked about this a lot earlier on the call, and in my prepared remarks, we spend a lot of time on GP, on gross profit and operating profit. And I commented on a number of things that while it doesn't necessarily drive revenue growth is additive to our gross profit percentage and operating margin. And so that's one thing that, of course, gives us the confidence to increase our operating income guidance by a full percentage point at the bottom and top of the range like we did that quarter. And then was there a second part to the question? 
Bennett Murphy: No, that's good Okay. We go to Steve for the close. 
Steven Collis: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on a busy Wednesday. We are really proud of the performance we reported in this quarter, which reflects the dedication, expertise and teamwork of all of our team members. As you can see, Cencora is very well positioned for the future. Our role in the supply chain is well established, and we will continue to innovate and invest in support of our customers. Thank you very much for your time. Have a good summer. We'll see you in early August. 
Operator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-01-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Cencora's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa and I'll be the Chorus call operator for your call today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Bennett Murphy, SVP, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. The floor is yours. Please begin.
Bennett Murphy: Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2024 first quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today's call, we'll be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com. We have also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. Cencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. You'll have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask you to limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many as possible within the hour. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Cencora delivered an exceptional start to fiscal 2024 with revenue up 15% year-over-year to over $72 billion in the quarter and adjusted earnings per share up 21% year-over-year. Given our continued performance and execution, including our strong first quarter results, I am pleased that we are able to raise our fiscal 2024 full year guidance. The strength of our business is bolstered by the execution of our teams and powered by our commercial partnerships and strategic positioning. Teams across Cencora continue to prioritize customer centricity and enhance the services we provide. We are capitalizing on the positive trends across our business, creating value for our customers and stakeholders, and building on the pivotal role we play in the global healthcare system. Our core in pharmaceutical distribution and breadth of higher margin, high-growth businesses linked with our scale has provided us with a unique expertise which positions us to support both upstream and downstream partners to achieve the best outcomes for patients. Our leadership in specialty has spanned 20 plus years, and over that time we have built an unparalleled suite of services that connects manufacturers and providers. Strategically positioning ourselves in the center of the specialty market, we have created opportunities to partner with leading innovators early in the drug development process through scientific development and consulting, safety and quality compliance, and clinical trial support and logistics. Our downstream services enhance provider efficiency allowing physicians to spend more time with patients, and includes patient experience insights, as well as operational and financial solutions. Specialty medicines and services will continue to be a key area of focus for Cencora as ongoing innovation and increasingly complex therapies drive opportunities for growth and allow us to demonstrate the differentiated value we can provide to our partners. We partner with biopharma players who are developing innovative life changing medications to help improve the lives of patients and advance the standard of care. To support their clinical and commercial success, it is imperative that we invest in all the capabilities we offer and position ourselves to meet their evolving needs. One example is our Global Specialty Logistics business, which offers solutions to transport complex products across our extensive footprint and provides key logistics for clinical trials. We continue to invest to support the growing demand for specialty logistics by enhancing the solutions offered across our footprint and implementing new technologies to drive further efficiency. This quarter, we announced three new transport stations, strategically located across the United States that will improve our ability to handle products in trial and complex products coming to market commercially. Since many of these products require specialized temperature control, we have expanded cryogenic storage and capabilities globally. This ensures we are providing partners with the complex logistics they need for their clinical trial and specialty shipment needs while investing to remain the best-in-class partner with these promising therapies across geographies and categories as innovation in cell and gene therapies continues to excite and advance. Innovation in life sciences motivates us at Cencora and we invest in our operational, technical, and logistics capabilities to ensure we are also innovating to support their tremendous potential for improving patients' lives. Growing our capabilities and solutions in higher margin, high-growth services positions us to be the partner of choice with market-leading innovators and to capitalize on opportunities presented by scientific advancement and the corresponding growing needs for commercialization services and solutions. On the Consulting side, Cencora’s global pharma services group helps our partners to accelerate the speed at which their products go-to-market by helping them navigate the complexity of clinical, regulatory and access challenges. As we continue to integrate PharmaLex biopharma innovators are increasingly seeing the value we offer as a partner providing global pharma consulting alongside our abilities to support their logistics needs from clinical trials to 3PL, especially in wholesale distribution with expertise and significant presence in key markets in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Our expertise enables us to work with revolutionary medicines and products early in the development process and helps support their commercial launches giving Cencora a key role in healthcare innovation. Our expanded and unified enterprise is advancing Cencora's presence as we continue to make investments and better leverage our infrastructure. Our legacy of investing in technology and enhancing operations to increase our efficiency continues to be front of mind as we pursue ways to enhance our services and customer experience. The sophistication, scale and flexibility of our infrastructure was on full display as we handled the significant volume of newly commercial and temperature-sensitive COVID vaccines in the U.S. in the December quarter without negatively impacting our ability to distribute our normal pharmaceutical volume. This is yet another proof point of the value we provide the healthcare system and validates our continued focus on advancing our capabilities to further Cencora's strength at the center of healthcare globally. As we continue to grow and unite as Cencora, we look for ways to capitalize on our range of services across our global enterprise and invest in platforms to improve the speed, precision, and processes in which we serve customers. Cencora leads with market leaders and we must continually progress and adapt to help our customers navigate the complexity of the healthcare landscape. As a global pharmaceutical distributor, we are focused on investing to support the growth and needs of our market-leading customers. We are able to use our scale, reach and expertise to build and advocate for programs aimed at mitigating drug shortages, supporting our customers' ultimate ability to better serve their patients. To that end, we are proud to collaborate with the Drug Supply Chain Resilience and Advanced Manufacturing Consortium whose mission is to work towards a resilient supply chain. Our work with the group involves partnering with stakeholders across the supply chain to identify effective policy solutions aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of drug shortages. These types of initiatives reflect our intellectual confidence and our organization's next-minded approach to addressing challenges and allow us to advance our purpose to create healthier futures for patients around the world. Our position at the center of healthcare uniquely equips our team with knowledge to overcome the obstacles the supply chain faces and plan for future challenges making us a trusted partner for organizations focusing on pharmaceutical supply chain resiliency. Our ESG and DEI goals are meaningful to the success of our company and our ability to deliver on our purpose. We recognize the importance of operating in a responsible manner and set ESG goals aligned with our business that ensures we are maintaining resilient operations, prioritizing our people's growth and wellbeing in the workplace, and supporting Cencora's long-term sustainable growth. We recently published our eighth annual ESG report, which highlights our progress on our ESG programs and how these initiatives contribute to our overall success. One of the key pillars of our ESG strategy is our team members who remain at the center of our company. At Cencora, we prioritize creating a working environment that fosters growth and support for all our employees. We believe that having a diverse and inclusive team underpins our culture and strengthens our operations as we benefit from the insights that come from having a broader set of view and experiences. As we seek to advance our culture, we have been focused on measuring inclusion and engagement in our workplace. We were pleased in our second annual global inclusion survey a majority of our team members indicated we have a highly inclusive culture. As a part of the survey, our team members provided leaders with valuable feedback and opportunities for improvement that will inform our efforts to strengthen our employee experience and working environment. Being purpose driven to create healthier futures, we offer comprehensive benefits and apply policies and practices in our corporate culture that ensure all employees are able to perform to the best of their ability. As an example of this, I am proud that Cencora was a recipient of the Equality 100 Award by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for our work in providing equitable benefits, policies and practices. This award recognizes companies that receive 100 on the Foundation's Corporate Equality Index that measure policies and practices related to LGBTQ plus workplace equality. These achievements reflect the dedication by our team members who have taken an active role in creating an inclusive environment and delivering on our critical role in healthcare each day. As we look ahead to the rest of our fiscal year, we are focused on continuing to capitalize on the strength of our business and the opportunities provided by our pharmaceutical centric strategy in order to deliver value for our customers and other stakeholders. I remain inspired by our team members' execution and drive to deliver on our purpose by demonstrating passion and adaptability as we work through an ever changing healthcare environment to improve lives every day. I will now turn the call over to Jim for an in-depth review of our first quarter results and updated guidance. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn to my prepared remarks, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. Cencora delivered remarkably strong results in our first quarter of fiscal 2024 as our team capitalized on the opportunities provided by our pharmaceutical centric strategy, commercial partnerships, robust infrastructure, and team member execution. In the quarter, this drove over 20% growth for Cencora's adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS. Our strong performance in the quarter and expectation for continued execution and growth in the balance of year leads us to meaningfully raise our full year fiscal 2024 guidance. I'll now turn to a review of our consolidated first quarter results starting with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $72.3 billion, up 15% with strong revenue growth in both segments. We continue to see good utilization trends broadly across our business in addition to continued growth in sales of GLP-1 products, particularly in the U.S. Excluding the increase in sales of GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 12%. Consolidated gross profit was $2.4 billion, up nearly 13% with double-digit gross profit growth in each segment. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.31%, a decrease of 7 basis points. Similar to the past several quarters, our gross profit margin comparison continues to be impacted by sales growth for low margin GLP-1s and less volume of government-owned COVID treatments. The impact of these two items was partially offset by the full quarter contribution from the distribution of commercial COVID-19 vaccines, which have higher gross profit margins given the complexity associated with the products. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.5 billion, up 8% due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses to support revenue growth and incremental operating expenses in the international segment related to the acquisition of PharmaLex, which we closed in January of 2023. Consolidated operating income was $886 million, an increase of 21% compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in operating income also included double-digit growth in both segments, which I will discuss in more detail in the segment level results. Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the first quarter, net interest expense was $41 million, down 12%, primarily due to higher interest income resulting from higher interest rates on investments and lower interest expense due to the September 2023 divestiture of our less than wholly-owned subsidiary in Egypt. Regarding income taxes, our effective income tax rate was 21% compared to 19.1% in the prior year quarter. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Turning now to diluted share count, our diluted share count was 201.8 million shares, a 2% decrease compared to the prior year first quarter. This was primarily driven by opportunistic share repurchases over the course of fiscal 2023 and also repurchases in the quarter including $135 million in open market repurchases and $250 million in repurchases in November, concurrent with a transaction completed by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Regarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and generated $763 million in adjusted free cash flow. In December, we made a commitment to exercise the prepayment option permitted under our opioid settlement agreements. This prepayment of approximately $238 million was made in January and represents the net present value of a future obligation of approximately $345 million. Since this prepayment was unplanned and non-recurring, it will not be included in our adjusted free cash flow consistent with our practices for unplanned and non-recurring payments or receipts relating to legal settlements. We will continue to include the annual planned cash payments associated with our settlement agreements in our adjusted free cash flow and continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $2.5 billion for the fiscal year. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our segment results for the first quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $65.2 billion, up approximately 16%, as we continued to see broad-based growth in our distribution businesses, which benefited from strong utilization trends, including continued volume growth in GLP-1s, growth in sales to specialty physician practices and health systems, and commercial COVID-19 vaccine sales. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 22% to $698 million, driven by strong performance across our distribution businesses, including commercial COVID-19 vaccine sales and operating leverage as a result of strong volumes and the expense management actions we called out on our May earnings call last year. Similar to last quarter, we saw broad-based strength across our human health distribution businesses with good volumes and trends in both specialty and full line distribution. Cencora continues to benefit from leading with market leaders and as a result we continue to see good growth across customer segments and broad pharmaceutical utilization trends. We also had particularly strong growth in our animal health business, which delivered good performance in the quarter and benefited from an easier comparison given industry-wide pressures in the prior year December quarter that we called out last year. Before turning to a review of our International Healthcare Solutions segment performance, I would like to provide an update on COVID-19 related contributions in the U.S. segment for both exclusive therapies and the commercial COVID-19 vaccines. First, regarding exclusive product distribution, in the quarter, we had $0.06 of contribution related to exclusive COVID-19 product distribution in the U.S., $0.03 headwind from the $0.09 of segment level contribution in the prior year quarter. This contribution was in line with the $0.02 to $0.10 of contribution we guided on our November earnings call related to our first quarter of fiscal 2024. For the balance of the year, we expect a $0.21 headwind from exclusive COVID treatments in the segment in line with our previous expectations and guidance. We do not expect a material contribution from these COVID treatments in the balance of the year. Second, regarding COVID-19 vaccines, this quarter we saw an incremental and higher than expected benefit from distributing commercial COVID-19 vaccines. And as we said on our November earnings call, this was comparing to a prior year period where vaccines were distributed by other parties prior to their movement to a traditional commercial distribution model in September. The contribution to our operating income from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the December quarter was highly concentrated in the October and November months and in total was more than double the contribution in the September quarter. Excluding both the commercial COVID-19 vaccine and exclusive COVID-19 treatment distribution contributions, segment level operating income growth would have been 12% as our team's strong execution and our pharmaceutical centric strategy have allowed us to capitalize on good underlying prescription utilization trends and deliver significant growth. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.1 billion, up 7% on a reported basis or up 9% on a constant currency basis. International Healthcare Solutions operating income was $188 million, up 16% on a reported basis or up 20% on a constant currency basis. In the quarter, we benefited from higher shipment weights and improvements in airfreight costs in our Global Specialty Logistics business, incremental operating income from the PharmaLex acquisition and excellent performance in our Canadian business offsetting foreign currency pressure and the September 2023 divestiture of the non-wholly-owned subsidiary in Egypt, which was profitable in the first quarter fiscal 2023. That completes the review of our segment level results. I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2024 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. I will begin with EPS and then provide detail on the income statement items contributing to the increase. We are raising our full year diluted EPS guidance to a range of $13.25 to $13.50, up from our prior range of $12.70 to $13, representing growth of 11% to 13%. The increase reflects our expectation for continued strong performance throughout our fiscal year and the incremental benefit from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the first quarter. Now moving to revenue, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 12% on both an as reported and constant currency basis, up from previous expectations of 7% to 10%. The updated guidance reflects an increase in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth, where we now expect growth of 11% to 13%, up from our previous expectations of 7% to 10% growth. The new guidance range reflects the strong revenue growth we saw in the first quarter, including the year-over-year growth of GLP-1s and continued good growth for the remainder of the year, driven by expected broad based prescription utilization trends. Moving to operating income, we expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%, up from our previous guidance of 4% to 6%. On an ex-COVID basis, which as a reminder excludes the benefit from exclusive COVID-19 contributions in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, we now expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 11% to 13%, up from our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 9% to 11%, up from our prior range of 4% to 7%. For our ex-COVID guidance in the U.S., I will remind you that we only exclude the contributions from exclusive COVID-19 therapies in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 and do not exclude COVID-19 vaccine contributions since they are traditional commercially distributed products. On this ex-COVID basis, we expect U.S. segment operating income growth to be in the range of 12% to 14%, up from our prior range of 7% to 10%. The increase in our U.S. segment guidance reflects our strong first quarter and continued momentum across our business as we continue to benefit from our leadership in specialty and alignment with market-leading customers, allowing us to capitalize on broad pharmaceutical utilization trends. Turning now to the International Healthcare Solutions segment, on an as reported basis, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 5% to 8%, up from our previous range of 1% to 4%. On an ex-COVID basis, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 7% to 10%, up from our previous range of 3% to 6%. The updated as-reported guidance reflects solid underlying performance trends and a slight benefit from current foreign exchange rates versus rates at the time of our initial guidance. Year-over-year currency translation continues to be a moderate full year headwind to our business and on a constant currency basis, we expect segment operating income growth to be in the range of 9% to 12% or 10% to 13% when excluding COVID contributions. Finally, turning to interest expense, we now expect interest expense to be in the range of $185 million to $215 million from our previous range of $210 million to $230 million as our cash flow generation in the first quarter was stronger than expected. From a quarterly cadence perspective, we would expect interest expense to step up meaningfully in the second quarter, similar to the prior year quarter given typical seasonality and cash use. That concludes our updated guidance assumptions. Before I turn to my closing remarks, I would like to briefly comment on our recently published ESG report. This week, as Steve mentioned, we published our eighth annual ESG report that details initiatives we are taking to ensure our business is equipped to operate resiliently, support our team members, and create healthier communities where we live and work. We are proud of the business-aligned approach we take to our ESG strategy and I would encourage those interested to visit our micro site at esg.cencora.com. The report aligns with a number of reporting standards and describes some exciting new initiatives launched over the past year, including our Cencora Healthier Futures Grant Program that aims to support non-profits and charities around the world doing work to advance access to care. We remain committed to fostering transparency and reporting on progress on our ESG strategy. In recognition of these efforts, we were pleased to be named to Sustainalytics 2024 ESG Top-Rated Companies list on both their region top rated and industry top rated lists. In closing, Cencora clearly delivered outstanding results in the first quarter of our fiscal year. I'm incredibly proud of our team's dedication and ability to consistently drive strong performance quarter after quarter. Leveraging the breadth and depth of our pharmaceutical centric solutions, we continue to find opportunities to capitalize on commercial strengths and build upon the momentum in our business to drive value for our stakeholders. Now I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Stephanie Davis: Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a very strong start to the year. I was hoping you could tell us more about the strengths in the core business. You saw outsized operating income growth, so it looks like there was a lot more than GLP-1s driving the beat. So anything else to call out there in the sustainability? And a quick follow-up on the other side of the business, just given some of the geopolitical turmoil, is there anything you could call out on potential international shipping headwinds? Thank you.
Jim Cleary: Sure, Stephanie, thanks a lot for those questions. And with regard to the beat in the core business and the sustainability kind of, let me start out with some of the kind of the drivers of the Q1 beat and I'll call out five things. First, commercial COVID-19 vaccines. We had very strong performance there during the first fiscal quarter. Second is just the continued strong pharmaceutical utilization trends resulting in favorable volume trends broadly across our businesses, including in specialty. Third thing I'll call out is just particularly strong execution by our Cencora team members broadly across our businesses, with our key businesses performing well. And then a fourth thing, and this is key, we had very good performance on operating expenses and good operating leverage as a result of both its OpEx focus and the volumes that we saw during the quarter. And then finally on pricing, including some continued signs of moderating generic deflation during the quarter. And so how do these benefits impact guidance and how sustainable are these benefits that I just called out? Well, I'd say that the first one commercial COVID-19 vaccines, we expect these sales of commercial COVID-19 vaccines to come down very significantly in Q2 to Q4 of fiscal year 2024 compared to Q1, perhaps with an increase at the end of the fiscal year in the month of September as seasonal vaccine activity begins picking up. And as I said in my prepared remarks, if we exclude the contributions from both commercial COVID-19 vaccines and the exclusive COVID treatments, our operating income growth would have been 12% in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment in Q1 versus the 22% that we reported in the U.S. And with regard to the other positive trends that I talked about, we expect these positive trends to continue across our business throughout the fiscal year, but perhaps not at the same level of outperformance as in Q1 and this is reflected in our guidance. And an example I'll give there is operating expenses. On the May call last year, we talked about some operating efficiency initiatives that we took in April of last year, and they were very effective, and as we can see in our results, this quarter with 8% operating expense growth compared to 13% gross profit growth. And kind of the comps get a little bit harder on OpEx in the back half of the year. And so that's one of the things where we would continue to expect to have outperformance, but perhaps not the same level of outperformance. But having said that, I just want to finish by saying we feel really good about the ongoing strong performance of our businesses and our guidance. So thanks for asking the question. And then there was a second part of the question was that on shipping?
Steve Collis: Yes. I could answer. I think it was more to do with geopolitical risk in Europe if I understood. And I would just say, of course, we don't have a crystal end, but I would just say that our business has proved over many geopolitical events, many economic crises to be very resilient, in fact among the most resilient of businesses. As long as patients keep needing prescriptions, as long as pharma companies keep on innovating, as long as payers both government and commercial payers keep paying, we've proven to be very resilient, very inelastic in demand for our core services. It can get a little bit different in commercialization services depending on what's going on with investments in pharma life cycles. But overall, I'd say we tend to be the most durable of businesses. Jim, you want to add something?
Jim Cleary: Yes. I'll just say with regard to shipping specifically, we don't have anything specific to call out, I mean, our teams are experts in this and are very focused on it. And like some of the things that we actively focus on are monitoring any shipping disruptions and working closely with our manufacturer partners and our provider customers to analyze and ensure sustainability of supply. And like I said, we don't have anything specific to call out other than to say our teams are experts in it and very focused on it, Stephanie.
Steve Collis: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: Yes. Thanks very much and good morning. Steve, first, I wanted to start with the International Business, I mean, you called out Global Specialty Logistics as being part of the strong performance on the international side. Can you maybe help us to understand what are some of the keys to that outperformance? Was there anything that was kind of one-time in the quarter? And then just as a follow-up, Jim, I was surprised to hear you say generic price, lack of deflation or stabilization in generic price was number five. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing in the environment there, because I would have expected that that would have been maybe a little bit more of a key driver when we think about the operating profit?
Steve Collis: Yes. So on our logo business, and of course, our World Courier business which does more specialized logistics, are both performing very well. And we expect to see continued growth in those businesses. We have a logo closely linked with our traditional RCS business in the U.S., and we're getting away from those names as we move to Cencora and global programs. But those businesses continue to be of significant interest to manufacturers. They help with the commercialization process. They provide efficiency both for large and small manufacturers and are a key element of our growth. In Europe, we have some stronger competitors there. And it's a more established industry, I'd say. And of course, every country is a little bit different. But as a generalization, I'd say we have stronger competitors there. And certainly Cencora intends to raise the bar. Our leadership is very focused on becoming the leader in that industry in all the major markets we're in. And you'll continue to see us making progress because we have a great understanding of the whole healthcare ecosystem that is hard for others to have. We have it from the provider, the manufacturer perspective, the health system perspective, and we have it across so many different countries and healthcare ecosystems that I think it just gives us some business intelligence that is hard to replicate, and you'll expect us to continue to do very well in those areas. Jim, the second part was for you.
Jim Cleary: Sure. With regard, Lisa, to the moderation of generic deflation, and as we've indicated over the last several months, there's been a moderation in generic deflation, particularly in certain pockets of the market and we've certainly benefited from that to the extent that it's been a smaller headwind. And if the moderation in generic deflation sustains and is more broad, it would really be a benefit to us -- continued benefit to us as the annual headwind would be smaller. In terms of ranking them, just one point I want to make, just the volumes were so strong this quarter with 15% revenue growth and, as you well know, when you can have 13% gross profit growth and 8% OpEx growth, that really is kind of a big driver. That operating leverage is a big driver of operating income growth. And so that volume is driven by a number of things, including commercial COVID-19 vaccines were a really good benefit for us during the quarter. And so I really wouldn't make too much of the ranking though. And the generic moderation trends were certainly positive for us during the quarter. Thank you, Lisa.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Jim, the gross profit was strong despite the downward pressure you mentioned from GLP-1s and government COVID treatments. Can you remind us when the -- how the GLP-1 volumes and also the gross profit have trended over the last year and specifically when the shift in sell side discount occurred, how that plays through for the remainder of the year and whether there's any impact on generic discounts built in there?
Jim Cleary: Yes. And so let me kind of address that with regard to your questions on kind of the GLP-1 growth and the GLP-1 profitability and the impacts it has on our business. And as we talked about, we've continued to see strong growth in drugs in the GLP-1 class. The revenue this quarter grew by $2.2 billion versus the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, our consolidated revenue was up 15%. And if we exclude the increase in GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 12% during the quarter. And then with regard to profitability, my comment there is consistent with what we've said in the past. GLP-1s continue to be more impactful from a revenue growth perspective and are minimally profitable for us given that they're a brand with cold chain requirements also, Eric.
Bennett Murphy: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong start here. On the international side, you called out strength in your Canadian business. I know you have a strong vaccine distribution business up there, but I'm curious if it's vaccines -- COVID vaccines there that's driving that strength, or if there's some other piece of the business on the Canadian side that is performing well. Thanks.
Steve Collis: Yes. No, thank you. Nice to get a question about Canada, which has been a strong business for us a long time. We did several acquisitions there many years ago, and we have an integrated business model there. The business goes by the name of Innomar, and it's both distribution on the specialty side, we run some infusion centers which are really part of a manufacturer commercialization. We have a lot of patient programs. We do 3PL, and it's a health system that is very relevant to our expansion into other countries. And certainly, if you look at the value and the way the Canadian government thinks about new products, and that it's very illustrative of the types of pharmacy and healthcare models we see in Europe. So it's been a good formative business for us and one that we continue to do well in. I would also say that we have an entrepreneurial team that understands the market there that's pretty stable, that’s -- have been with us for a long time. Many of them are actually helping us now in international development, so good business for us and really punches outside of their weight and especially marketing Canada and having a global impact for Cencora now. So thanks for the call out. Jim, you want to add something?
Jim Cleary: Yes. I'll add one minor point in response to your question. There was growth in vaccines in Canada during the quarter, but it was a small part of the growth, really the growth was driven by the core part of the business, which performed very well during the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi guys, thanks so much for the question. One thing that I wanted to explore a little bit more. You obviously said that you're seeing nice performance from the PharmaLex business as it continues to integrate into the core business. One thing we've been hearing from the more the manufacturer side of the equation is just sort of maybe a little bit of reduced spending on the commercialization side. Can you talk about how you're seeing the impact of that in the business? Is it something that you sort of maybe a headwind later in the year? Does it present additional opportunities as they seek to outsource additional services? Can you help us sort of think through that as we think about the rest of the year? Thank you.
Steve Collis: Yes. It's a very good question. Certainly, I understand that. I mean, investment cycle, in life cycles, in the -- in life sciences and the approval cycles, we've had experience with this through businesses like Lash and even in my early days, RCS, as we look at products getting approved or not getting approved, and as you look at the VC funding cycle and as you look at M&A from big pharma and just smaller pharma. And I'd say that the market has been a little bit softer than in the last year to year-and-a-half with some of the geopolitical and inflation and market pressures. But you are seeing a -- I think there's a real thesis of a tremendous investment in innovation, precision medicine, cell and gene therapies, which Cencora is uniquely positioned to capitalize on, and you'll see us continue to benefit we spending just getting ready now for our March strategic plan presentations to the board, we spending a lot of time looking at our commercialization services capabilities, how do we become the best-in-class in all the various areas that we're in, including the four main segments that PharmaLex is in, development, consulting, regulatory affairs, pharmacovigilance, quality management and compliance. And we think that there's a real role for Cencora globally in those launches, in those commercialization services. And you'll see us continue to invest. We're happy with the team we have in place. We're happy with the U.S. presences we have there. And you'll see us continue to benefit and we'll be a little bit affected by the economic cycles. But there's a global trend here, which is a long-term trend, which we intend to capitalize on.
Operator: We now turn to Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Allen Lutz: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. One for Jim. We're about a month into the year, just wondering how are brand price increases coming in versus expectations? Is there anything to call out there? And then what's embedded in the model for mid-year price increases? Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Yes. And so let me talk about brand price increases and what we've been seeing. The January price increase activity was broadly in line with our expectations. And I'll also say that, as we've said in the past, that brand inflation is less important for Cencora than it once was since well over 95% of our brand buy side dollars are fee-for-service. And then what I'll just say with regard to our kind of expectations and what's in the model for the balance of the year with regard to brand pricing, we don't have specific guidance metrics on drug pricing, but our expectations that we have in the model or that will be generally in line with the changes we've seen over the past couple of years. Thank you for the question.
Operator: We now turn to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks. I have two questions here, if that's okay, but on GLP-1s, is there any way you can achieve better economics associated with GLP-1s, or is it just simply a function of the more complex logistics and there's nothing more you can do there? And then on Animal Health, you called that out as strong. What are you seeing in terms of volume and pricing trends across both companion and production in animal, how's the landscape evolving, for instance, in terms of alternative channels? Thanks.
Steve Collis: Yes. Thank you for the question, Erin. On GLP-1s, I would just say that in the long-term, some of the formulations are going to switch. It's such a big category that as we look at renewals of contracts and we have on the sell side, we have somewhere usually around three to five years on those contracts. This is a different category that we would work with the customers to understand what our mutual requirements are. Certainly it's a category that is having a weight on those contracts. It's of such a serious top-line significance and has impacts on the different contractual requirements that we have including mix of products, et cetera. So it obviously will come up in any discussion. We also intend to do more work with manufacturers. We do think that from a clinical perspective, these are products that are interesting at the pharmacy counter, and we're encouraging our independent pharmacists, for example, to stay involved in the dispensing of these products. So it's certainly something that we are very mindful of. And we would expect that over time, you -- as these sell side contracts come up, that you'll see them become more typical brand economics than the headwind, which we've experienced in the early days. Hopefully, that's the aspiration. That's what we would hope to get to. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Sure. Erin, with regard to your question on Animal Health, our Animal Health business had a particularly strong growth in the quarter and it had very good performance. And it also benefited from an easier comparison, given the industry-wide pressures in the prior year December that we called out last year. And so particularly strong operating income growth and also very good performance from a revenue growth standpoint. It had low-double digit revenue growth in the quarter, with growth in both the companion animal business and the production animal business with growth being stronger in the companion animal business. And then one just final thing I'll say is that we've seen just very strong execution by our Animal Health team, just as we have by all of our teams across Cencora. So thank you for that Animal Health question.
Operator: We now turn to Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Steve, obviously a lot of discussion recently around potential changes on how pharmacies are reimbursed by payers and moving to a cost plus model. And I think the argument here is that that industry is at a tipping point where maybe there's less potential for generic substitutions to offset sort of the reimbursement pressures pharmacies face by payers. From where you sit as a key partner to both chains and particularly independent pharmacies, could you comment maybe on what you see in the market in terms of the health of your retail customers? Do you think we are reaching sort of a limit to what pharmacies particularly independents can bear? And if the industry does move to a cost plus model, how might that impact the way you interact, or how might that impact your business and how you interact with the retail customers? Thanks.
Steve Collis: Yes. So I think we always one of the things that I learned early on in my career is that we always have to be very mindful of reimbursement for our provider customers. Of course, we do a lot of work with independents, in particular with Elevate, PSAO, and we've been saying for a while that some of the rates are not manageable. So to see an industry leader step up and really talk about changing the model, I think is very important. We would like to see a fair and transparent reimbursement system for all categories in pharmacy, include -- especially community pharmacy, and especially including independent pharmacists who we feel a special need to advocate on behalf of. So it's early days. It's encouraging that there is some talk about adoption of the cost plus model across the industry, and we'll see how the industry responds and payers respond, et cetera. But we believe that this is a sign that there does need to be an improvement in the base profitability of community pharmacists, which is encouraging.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. A number of mine have been hit, but I might have two small separate ones. First on international, very strong underlying performance. AOI up over 20%. FX foreign currency, I'm curious if you could parse out the impact of Egypt from both a revenue and AOI standpoint, because I believe your AOI would have been up even more X the year-over-year headwind in Egypt. And then secondarily, just a quick one on GLP-1s. I know you don't guide to specific revenue or revenue contribution growth rate, but when we look at your raised revenue target for the year, could you give us a sense on how much of that was or was not related to GLP-1 outlook, i.e., has your GLP-1 growth expectation changed since the last update? Thanks so much.
Jim Cleary: Okay. So let me start out with Egypt, Eric, and we haven't specifically disclosed the size of that business, but let me say, yes, you're absolutely right. Our operating income growth would have been higher in the quarter if we had backed out Egypt, for instance, from the first quarter of last year. But let me kind of give you some data that I think would be helpful, as you do your models over the course of the year. The Egyptian business was profitable in the first fiscal quarter of last year, as we just referenced, and then was essentially flat in Q2 and Q3. And then it had a loss in Q4. And so for the full year, it was a slight -- a slightly profitable business in fiscal year 2023. And so it really doesn't have, if you look at on a full year basis, it doesn't have much of an impact on kind of full year growth rates in the International segment. But as I said, during the first quarter, the growth would have been a little bit higher if we included or if we backed out Egypt from last year. And then with regard to kind of U.S. Healthcare segment and GLP-1. So the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment in revenue growth, we now expect 11% to 13% growth, up from our previous expectations of 7% to 10% growth. And the new guidance range reflects the strong revenue growth we saw in the first quarter, including the year-over-year growth of GLP-1s and continued good growth for the remainder of the year, driven by expected broad based prescription utilization trends. And so GLP-1 essentially contributed 3 percentage points of growth in the first quarter. And we expect just kind of continued good growth throughout our business during the balance of the year and feel really good about the business overall and really good about our guidance. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in and I'm going to kind of get into a niche topic here with CenterX, Jim. I know that you guys have that EPA business and we've seen kind of a surge in demand for EPAs, both as it relates to GLP-1s and the increasing use of biosimilars. So we'd just love to hear you talk a little bit about how that business is performing relative to kind of the GLP-1s in the biosimilar space.
Jim Cleary: Yes. So I'll say, overall, we feel really good about our prospects in global pharma services and patient services and the sorts of things that CenterX does. And we feel just very good overall about the growth prospects there and really don't have any comments beyond that other than to say kind of global pharma services. And those businesses like CenterX are just a key part of our growth this year and over our long-term guidance also.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A. I’ll hand back to Steve Collis.
Steve Collis: Thanks, everyone. I appreciate your patience. We ran a little bit long today. So this wraps up our call for today. I just have to make a little note that at the end of our fiscal year 2023 call, I received a little pouch and it was 50 quarters from my predecessor to commemorate 50 earnings calls. So once we're counting, 51 is clearly one of the most memorable and exciting quarters that we have presented, and even more so to do it under the new call ticker symbol. While we have a lot of work ahead to continue to deliver on our purpose and the potential of Cencora, we are really proud of the work our team members are doing to position us successfully and strategically at the center of pharmaceutical based healthcare. Thank you for your time today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this call has now concluded.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-11-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Cencora Q4 Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Emily, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the call over to our host, Bennett Murphy with Cencora. Please go ahead.
Bennett Murphy: Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today's call, we'll be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website, investor.cencora.com. We have also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. Cencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the permission of the company. You'll have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask you to limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get through as many participants as possible in the hour. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our fourth and final earnings call for fiscal 2023 and our first earnings call as Cencora. Today, my remarks will focus on the continued execution and success of our business in fiscal 2023 and how our strategy and capabilities as a global health care services company position us to further drive value for stakeholders in 2024 and beyond. Fiscal 2023 was a seminal year for Cencora as we united together under our new globally inclusive identity and took key steps to advance our position at the center of health care. I am proud of how we continue to deliver strong results through execution by our team members as we capitalize on the strength of our business, while strategically deploying our capital by both returning capital to our shareholders and making meaningful internal and external investments. PharmaLex and OneOncology were important investments made this year that extended the services and opportunities we have to continue to differentiate the solutions we provide our core customers. Our evolution to Cencora unites our team members under a name that better reflects our impact on health care as we continue to build on our commercial strength. We entered 2023 from a position of strength and have continued to build on the momentum throughout the year, delivering full year adjusted EPS growth of 9%. Guided by our purpose, powered by our foundation in pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by the breadth of solutions we provide our partners, we continue to execute on our strategic imperatives to advance our core business and enhance our capabilities to drive value in the years to come. This year, we expanded our leadership in specialty by enhancing our suite of services for pharmaceutical partners and adding to the solutions we offer providers. In January, we closed on our acquisition of PharmaLex, which broadened our suite of end-to-end commercialization service offerings. PharmaLex complements our capabilities in market access strategy, patient access and adherence and specialty logistics. The business provides us a global platform of solutions to drive our long-term growth in supporting pharma partners across the development and commercialization journey. On the provider side, we made a minority investment in OneOncology, allowing us to deepen our relationships with community oncologists, and which represents the next evolution of our long-standing leadership in specialty. Over the past 20 years, we have been proud to build this leadership in specialty through strategic partnerships and investments to continuously expand the breadth and depth of solutions we provide to both downstream providers and upstream innovators. The acquisition and investments we completed during fiscal 2023 complements our core business and are a testament to our commitment to advancing our leadership in specialty. We also consistently invest in innovation to strengthen our ability to efficiently and effectively serve our customers. Teams across Cencora, from our sales teams to distribution center operations, to consultants in the field, actively embrace innovative technology to drive our business forward and support our pharma partners. One example is our premier Global Specialty Logistics business, which continues to drive innovation by adding services to support clinical trial logistics and commercial time- and temperature-sensitive products through enhanced cryogenic shipping capabilities and expanded use of real-time tracking for shipments. Technologies like these are vital, allowing us to transport highly specialized products while giving our customers 24/7 visibility to their critical shipments, enabling them to better serve patients. Innovation and the rapidly evolving health care landscape necessitate that we remain agile and adaptive to support our customers' needs. As pharmaceutical innovation continues to advance, so too must our capabilities in supporting it. Earlier this year, we opened a new state-of-the-art specialty distribution facility in California. As the specialty space continues its rapid growth, the new distribution center increases our scale and allows us to better support our customers and partners by providing efficient and reliable distribution for these complex products. Cencora's customer-centric approach prioritizes understanding the challenges our partners face and exploring how we can provide them the solutions and services they need to reach and better serve patients. As pharmacists continue to be recognized for their role as accessible care providers who can bridge care gaps, particularly in underserved populations, we aim to provide tools and technology to enable them to spend more time with patients. In August, we hosted our annual ThoughtSpot Conference in partnership with our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network. The conference brought together thousands of independent community pharmacists and gave them the opportunity to attend education sessions on the evolving health care environment and latest technology solutions, connect and learn from industry peers and celebrate the impact community pharmacies have in health care. Our recently launched Cencora Marketplace, which was showcased at the conference, allows independent pharmacies to streamline their ordering process for consumer products in one centralized location. The solutions we provide our pharmacy customers allow them to spend more time caring for their patients and understanding their needs, an important role that has been recognized for the seventh year in a row by J.D. Power, with Good Neighbor Pharmacy ranking #1 in customer satisfaction among chain drugstore pharmacies in its 2022 U.S. Pharmacy Study. Pharmacists also play a critical role in hospitals by working in alignment with physicians and nurses to treat patients. And one way in which they do this is in keeping medication stocked and up to date for immediate use. Recognizing the time hospitals spend on inventory management, our teams look for ways to leverage technology to provide a solution to make this process more seamless. Through RFID tagging, hospital pharmacists can quickly identify out of stock or soon-to-be expired medications, ensuring that patients have access to the medication they need when they need it. This tagging is conveniently done at our distribution sites before medications are delivered to our health system customers. By understanding our customers' needs, our team is able to leverage innovation and create solutions to promote efficiency and address their challenges, advancing our shared goal of improving patients' quality of care. Each day, we are enhancing reach and efficiency in the pharmaceutical supply chain and leveraging the breadth of our global health care services to help our customers navigate the increasingly complex environment they face. Driven by customer and patient needs and our focus on contributing to prescription outcomes, we have forged innovative partnerships aimed at ensuring a stable supply of essential medications. Early this year, we announced a relationship with a nonprofit entity that partners with health care systems to reduce and prevent drug shortages. As the exclusive distributor of their contracted products, we provide supply chain support and ensure that their crucial products reach their members in a timely and safe manner. We have also cemented our role at the center of health care by building long-term relationships with market-leading customers. We provide our customers with valuable services ranging from distribution and logistics to consulting to grow their businesses, which in turn supports our own growth. We are creatively resourceful and next-minded as we assess our talents and strengths and plan for future opportunities to create value for all of our stakeholders. Since the beginning of fiscal 2023, we have welcomed 4 new independent directors with valuable experience and backgrounds that adds to the strength of our board. These new directors add complementary expertise and diverse perspective to support our advancement both internally and externally as a global health care services leader. Our commitment to elevating talent and advancing Cencora's capabilities is pivotal in delivering on our strategic growth initiatives. This year, I am proud to announce we have reached 100% dollar-for-dollar pay equity in the United States and set 3 ESG goals that we believe are relevant to and aligned with our business. Our first goal involved business impact assessments across our footprint to inform our business resiliency planning. Our second goal was focused on female representation in global leadership roles, and our third goal targeted our team member experience in elevating our culture of inclusion. Coupled with the importance of achieving pay equity in our workplace, we know we must be conscious of our culture and footprint to ensure we have the highest caliber talent, engaged team members and resilient businesses. The sustainability of our operations and collective power of our team members drives our ability to live our purpose, strengthens our business and culture and enables our leadership in health care. Cencora's long-term growth and commitment to creating differentiated value drives our investments internally in our people. Our team members are the core of everything we do, power our purpose and drive our execution with their diverse backgrounds and experiences. We are motivating our leaders to foster an environment of inclusion that embraces diversity across the organization, leveraging unique global views across our enterprise and enhancing ways of working, drives efficiency and differentiated customer experience for our partners. We are very proud of our team members, whose dedication and execution powered the successful year we had in fiscal 2023. As we move into fiscal 2024, we are inspired by our ability to unlock new opportunities, united as Cencora, and support the continued evolution of health care. As a global organization united under our new name, we are even better positioned to execute our growth strategy as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution, complemented by higher margin, high-growth commercialization solutions while our purpose and who we are as an organization remain the same, I as well as our 46,000 team members are tremendously proud to now be a part of Cencora. We are confident in our strategy, and by building on our foundation and established services, we are expanding, diversifying and enhancing our position as a partner of choice for our customers and partners, both now and into the future. Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results and to discuss our expectations for fiscal 2024. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Thanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal 2023 was a milestone year as we became Cencora, uniting under a name and stock ticker that are more meaningful and reflective of the important role that we play at the center of health care. Solid underlying business fundamentals, broad-based utilization trends and execution by our team members allowed us to deliver strong results in the quarter and the year. In fiscal 2023, we continue to do what we do best, now as Cencora, driving strong execution, deepening relationships with our partners and continuing to invest in our strengths to advance our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and help drive long-term growth. Now turning to our results. And as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results, unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year September quarter and fiscal year. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release. Beginning with our fourth quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.86, an increase of 10%, which was driven by operating income growth in both segments and a lower share count as a result of opportunistic share repurchases. Our consolidated revenue was $68.9 billion, up nearly 13% with strong revenue growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and also in the International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment continued to see significant growth in sales of low-margin GLP-1 products, and excluding GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 10%. Consolidated gross profit was $2.3 billion, up 9% due to gross profit growth in both segments, particularly in the International Healthcare Solutions segment, which also benefited from the addition of PharmaLex. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.34%, a decrease of 10 basis points. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, the gross profit margin comparison is negatively impacted by 2 U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment items. First, continued volume growth and low gross profit margin GLP-1 products; and second, decreased volumes of government-owned COVID treatments, which have higher margins. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.5 billion, up 10%. This growth was largely driven by higher operating expenses in the International Healthcare Solutions segment, including the addition of PharmaLex. Consolidated operating income was $801 million, up 8% compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in operating income was driven by growth in both segments, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing segment-level results. Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was $61 million, an increase of 18%, due to an increase in intra-period borrowings and related interest rates. Our effective income tax rate was 21.6% compared to 19.8% in the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count was 203.4 million shares, a 3% decrease compared to the prior year fourth quarter, driven by $1.2 billion of opportunistic share repurchases completed over the course of fiscal 2023, including $250 million in August, concurrent with the underwritten transaction completed by Walgreens Boots Alliance. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our segment results for the fourth quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $61.9 billion, up 13% versus the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter. This was driven by sales growth across our distribution businesses and the continued volume growth we have seen in low-margin GLP-1 products. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased by 9% to $633 million. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our leadership in specialty distribution to both physician practices and health systems, broad-based strong prescription utilization trends in human health distribution and a great fourth quarter for our Animal Health business. As we said last quarter, we expected $0.01 to $0.02 of contribution related to exclusive COVID-19 product distribution. We ended the quarter with $0.08 of contribution in the quarter due to the late summer uptick in COVID-19 cases. Additionally, in the month of September, we began distributing commercial COVID-19 vaccines, which was an incremental benefit in the quarter. This contribution is comparing to a period where vaccines were government-managed and being distributed by other parties. Given the complexities, temperature requirements and customer channels associated with COVID-19 vaccines, we captured a larger market share in COVID vaccine distribution than we would have previously expected, having used flu vaccine distribution market share as an initial proxy. That completes my review of the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.0 billion, an increase of 10% on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income was $168 million, up 3% on an as-reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis. In the quarter, we saw good performance from our Global Specialty Logistics business, which offset a continued degradation of results at Alliance Healthcare's less than wholly owned subsidiary in Egypt. We recently completed the divestiture of the stake in the Egyptian subsidiary, and the results of that business will no longer be consolidated beginning in fiscal 2024. Egypt was a headwind for the International segment throughout the year, including generating an operating loss in the fourth quarter. And we are pleased to have divested our stake in this noncore business. In the quarter, we also had higher bad debt expense in International, driven primarily by a reserve established related to a specific pharmacy customer in Europe. That concludes our fiscal fourth quarter discussion. Now I will turn to a discussion of our full year fiscal 2023 results. Our consolidated revenue was $262 billion, up 10%, driven by growth in both segments. On a constant currency basis, consolidated revenue grew 11%. Consolidated operating income was $3.3 billion, an increase of 4% due to the strong performance in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, offset in part by the International Healthcare Solutions segment, which was negatively impacted by the results of the Egyptian business that I just mentioned and the effects of foreign currency translation for much of the year. On a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 6%. From a segment perspective, U.S. Healthcare Solutions had operating income growth of 6%, driven by strong prescription utilization trends, including continued growth in specialty and good execution in our businesses. International Health Care Solutions operating income fell 2% on an as-reported basis due to the now divested Egyptian business. Excluding Egypt, International Healthcare Solutions operating income would have been up over 3%. On a constant currency basis, the segment delivered 7% operating income growth. In fiscal 2023, we had $0.38 of contribution of adjusted EPS related to exclusive COVID-19 product distribution on a consolidated basis compared to $0.72 in fiscal 2022. At the segment level, we had $0.31 of contribution to adjusted EPS in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and $0.07 in the International Healthcare Solutions segment in fiscal 2023. Turning now to interest expense. In fiscal 2023, net interest expense was $229 million, an increase of 9%, as a result of higher intra-period borrowings for parts of the year due to timing of capital deployment, debt repayment and cash flows as well as higher average interest rates on intra-period borrowings. Regarding taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 20.3% compared to 20.6% in fiscal 2022. Turning now to EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $11.99, an increase of 9%, driven by our strong operating income growth and strategic capital deployment. Finally, in fiscal 2023, we generated $3.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow and ended the year with a cash balance of $2.6 billion. We continue to be a strong free cash flow generator and have a balanced approach to capital deployment. In addition to our internal capital expenditures, our acquisition of PharmaLex and our investment in OneOncology in fiscal 2023, this year, we also repurchased $1.2 billion of our shares opportunistically, and just this morning, announced that our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. The dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a reasonable growing dividend, and this is our 19th consecutive year of increasing our dividend. Turning now to discuss our fiscal 2024 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. We have also provided a detailed overview of guidance metrics on Slides 11 and 12 of our earnings presentation. First, starting with EPS. In fiscal 2024, we are guiding for adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $12.70 to $13, representing growth of 6% to 8%, driven by growth in each segment and contributions from capital deployment. Before I detail the building blocks of our solid EPS growth for fiscal 2024, I want to spend some time discussing our approach to COVID-19 contributions in the coming year. Over the past several years, we've recognized benefits related to our role as the exclusive distributor of a number of COVID-19 products, which we have normalized for by providing ex-COVID numbers. As we've indicated from the onset, we fully expected the exclusive distribution products to move to a normal commercial distribution model in the U.S., and as we all now know, that will now occur during the first quarter of our fiscal 2024. The key products driving our exclusive COVID contribution are moving to a commercial model this month. In fiscal 2024, we are anticipating the remaining benefit from exclusivity to be as low as $0.02 or as high as $0.10. We do not anticipate that there will be a meaningful contribution from any remaining exclusive COVID products beyond our first quarter. As we've been doing for some time, we will plan to provide an update on the contribution we recognize from the exclusive distribution of these COVID products. Excluding the benefit from exclusive COVID-19 contributions in fiscal 2023, our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance represents growth in the range of 9% to 12%, with a small $0.02 to $0.10 contribution from exclusive COVID products in fiscal 2024. On Page 13 in our earnings presentation, we have provided a bridge showing the components of our adjusted diluted EPS growth from the adjusted baseline in fiscal 2023. As I mentioned when discussing our fourth quarter results, we began distributing COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. in September and recognized a benefit from gaining access to these products now that they are commercially available. As I also mentioned, we have seen better-than-expected share in the products, given the complex handling requirements of these temperature-sensitive vaccines and the customer channels. Since these products are normal commercial arrangements, we will include contributions related to these products in our as-reported results and will not provide a category-level contribution on them, consistent with our approach to the other pharmaceuticals that we distribute commercially. We continue to monitor trends for these vaccines, which have generally experienced higher-than-expected presumably seasonal demand alongside flu vaccines. Now I will discuss the key income statement items that drive our adjusted EPS guidance. Starting with revenue. We expect consolidated revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 10% on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. At the segment level, we also expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 10% as we continue to see strong prescription utilization trends, including continued growth in products in the GLP-1 class. For the International Healthcare Solutions segment on an as-reported basis, using October foreign exchange rates, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 8%. On a constant currency basis, we expect revenue growth for the International segment to be in the range of 7% to 11%. Moving to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% or 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the COVID-19 contributions I detailed, we expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 7% to 9% or 8% to 10% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we expect operating income growth to be in the range of 4% to 7% in fiscal 2024. On an ex-COVID basis, we expect U.S. segment operating income growth to be in the range of 7% to 10% as we benefit from continued strong fundamentals in our core pharmaceutical distribution business, our leadership in specialty and good contributions from our Animal Health and upstream pharma services businesses in the U.S. For our International Healthcare Solutions segment, we expect operating income growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% on an as-reported basis or 5% to 8% on a constant currency basis. On an ex-COVID basis, we expect segment operating income growth to be in the range of 3% to 6% on an as-reported basis or 7% to 10% on a constant currency basis. The International Healthcare Solutions segment has seen strong performance from our Global Specialty Logistics business and good execution in our European distribution business, which we expect to continue in fiscal 2024. Now turning to interest expense. We expect our interest expense to be between $210 million and $230 million. Moving on to tax rate. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 20% to 21% for fiscal 2024, similar to the prior 2 years. Turning now to share count. We expect that our full year average share count will be between 200 million and 202 million shares in fiscal 2024. Moving now to our adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditure expectations. In fiscal 2024, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $2.5 billion. Our continued generation of strong free cash flow supports our ability to grow our dividend and opportunistically return capital to shareholders through share repurchases while also making important investments to advance our business, both externally and internally. With regards to internal investments, we again expect capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million for the year. We remain focused on ensuring our business is well positioned by investing in our systems and infrastructure to support our current and future growth. In closing, fiscal 2023 was a successful year for Cencora as we delivered strong financial performance and took key steps to advance our strategy. We made investments to support our people and culture and united together as Cencora. As we have demonstrated, our business is well positioned to capture opportunities, driven by the strength of our infrastructure, breadth of our capabilities across the supply chain and thought leadership of our team members to proactively navigate complexities. We move into fiscal 2024 with strong momentum as we continue to capitalize on the opportunities presented by our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and capabilities and remain focused on delivering on our purpose as we create value for our upstream and downstream customers, our team members, shareholders and the communities where we live and work. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: Thanks for all the detail, Jim and Steve. Steve, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question. I think there's been a little bit of an overhang on the stock as you think about your relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance and the lack of leadership. And even with the former leaders, I would say they had less of a healthcare focus. We now have Tim Wentworth, who's been named CEO. I know you've had a long-standing relationship with Tim. I really just would be curious around 2 things. One, when you think about the relationship, do you think that there's an opportunity to even deepen the relationship? Or are there new verticals you can work together on? And what are your thoughts on the leadership, number one. And then number two, when we think about the sale of your stock -- and they clearly are in a position where they probably need to do something, whether it's cut their dividend or sell more stock. I know that they have some future contracts, and the percentage of ownership of ABC as way down. But how do I think about that and your ability -- maybe this is a question for Jim -- to continue to buy back shares as that continues to happen?
Steve Collis: Yes, Lisa. So of course, our relationship with Walgreens is -- and Boots in the U.K. is very significant. We also have the WBAD purchasing alliance. So it's by far the most scaled and material relationship we have. So having said that, we're very pleased that someone who we've known literally for decades like Tim has assumed the mantle. And he has a proven track record. I first met Tim when I was running the specialty business at the former Bergen Brunswig, and he was running the Accredo division at Medco. So go back a long, long time. But our partnership is very strategic. We believe that there's always room to do more because of the scale that we have, and also the challenges that we're going to have. So in the past, we've worked together on purchasing and sourcing initiatives. I think we worked effectively very well together through this COVID season, where we both had our respective roles. There has been, of course, much more patient director in front of the patient. But we think that this relationship will continue to prosper. And we look forward to Tim being very successful in the new role. Jim, do you want to take the second part?
Jim Cleary: Sure. Thanks for the question, Lisa. And I'll talk about the capital deployment portion. We've successfully collaborated with Walgreens on their latest transactions, repurchasing about $250 million in shares from Walgreens in the most recent quarter and over $1 billion in shares from Walgreens over the past year. And if they were to continue to sell our shares, which wouldn't surprise us, we view it as an opportunity to continue to collaborate with them and repurchase some of the shares and the amount that we've repurchased would be dependent on managing our capital needs and opportunities. And I'm pleased to say that this fiscal year that recently ended, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow. So we feel very good about our cash flow generation and our balance sheet and our ability to deploy capital. Thanks a lot for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Anderson: I appreciate the details on '24. I was wondering if you could talk through some -- in a little bit more detail, some of the underlying profit drivers for 2024? And as I'm thinking about them, sort of core customer growth, GLP-1 benefit. Obviously, some of the new -- the benefit for the new acquisitions you've been doing, just to help us sort of get a better sense on where you're seeing perhaps outsized growth, et cetera for the upcoming fiscal year?
Jim Cleary: Great. Well, I'll start off by saying that we feel very good about our guidance for fiscal year '24. On a consolidated level, our adjusted operating income, we're expecting it to grow in the 8% to 10% range. So that's constant currency, ex-COVID. And so some of the things that move us within that range, from a big picture standpoint, it's of course, the growth rate of our higher-margin, higher-growth businesses. In particular, specialty distribution, but also our commercialization services businesses, including World Courier. The continued strength and utilization trends, which we've certainly seen in fiscal year '23. The extent of the strength of those utilization trends in fiscal year '24; certainly, are 1 of the things that will drive our business. Of course, drug pricing always plays a role, including branded inflation and generic deflation rates, sales of COVID products. And I talked quite a bit about that during the prepared remarks. And then, of course, also FX, but typically, we look at this on a constant currency basis. And I could get into a little bit more detailed commentary on some of these things on some of the kind of the moving pieces. As I said during the prepared remarks, we're expecting $0.02 to $0.10 of EPS contribution related to exclusive COVID-19 product distribution with a vast majority of that in the first quarter. We divested, of course, the Egyptian business during the fourth quarter of the year, which we were pretty -- very pleased with. And that business didn't have a meaningful operating income contribution in fiscal '23. So the divestiture will not create a meaningful headwind to fiscal '24. You asked about GLP-1 products, they're a key driver of our revenue growth, but they're minimally profitable for us, so not a major driver of our operating income growth. But -- and so those are some of the things that are -- from a big picture standpoint and a detailed standpoint, that our driving our business in fiscal year '24. And I'll just finish up by saying we have very good confidence in our guidance, given our strong momentum and the strength we've seen broadly across our businesses as we've finished fiscal year '23.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: Guidance-related question here. Steve or Jim, I'd be interested for your view on the list prices related to [A&P cap] changes in January. And obviously, we have the insulins. I'm curious if that was an impact at all in guidance for next year? And if you expect to see others? And then, Jim, I'd be interested in your assumptions on brand increases. Are you assuming in the guidance that it's not as strong as what we saw in '23, and that might leave upside? And then GLP-1s, do those begin to annualize at the revenue line in Q1, in Q2? When do we start to cycle that?
Jim Cleary: Yes. Okay. So let me address those things, Eric. First of all, with regard to insulin pricing. There's nothing that I'll call out. The anticipated impact is reflected within our guidance range. And I'll say that, as always, when there are changes that could impact our economics, we engage in discussions with manufacturers and other stakeholders to ensure that we continue to be adequately compensated for the value we provide. You'd asked about drug pricing and how that impacts guidance. And what I'll say is we don't put out specific guidance metrics on drug pricing, but our guidance contemplates brand and generic pricing changes being in line with what we've seen over the past couple of years. With regard to brand inflation, it's really less important for Cencora because well over 95% of our brand buy-side dollars are fee-for-service. With regard to generic deflation, generic deflation has moderated in recent months in certain pockets of the market. So it was less of a headwind for Cencora in fiscal year '23 versus prior years. And so that was, of course, positive for us. If deflation were to continue to moderate more broadly across generics, it would continue to be less of a headwind for our business. I'll say that from a supply and demand dynamic standpoint, it remains generally in balance, and we work closely with manufacturers to understand their supply and availability of product given shortages in certain areas. But as you know, our business model is not as reliant on generic pricing as it once was in the past. Several years ago, our leadership recognized the need to have more balanced profitability across the portfolio of pharmaceuticals, so we've rebalanced some contracts to make sure that Cencora receives fair compensation for the value we provide across brand generics and specialty, which has been key, especially as the market continues to shift to include more specialty products. And Steve, do you have a follow-up there?
Steve Collis: Yes. Just a couple of things. I just want to say, in terms of anticipated any reforms, as we know, the best of our knowledge, most of the pricing concessions would take place below the WAC line. So that's what we anticipate at the moment. Just then, Jim, on GLP-1s, I'd say they are clearly most impactful on the top line and an incredible example of the innovation in our industry and the patient impacts. We expect continued growth in this category. But again, they are a much more meaningful revenue growth driver than operating income driver, but important part of our portfolio. The last thing I'd say is that we continue to advocate and help our community pharmacies to obtain adequate reimbursement on those products. So thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citibank.
Daniel Grosslight: I want to stick with guidance here. And really relative to your longer-term outlook, which I know hasn't been updated in a few quarters. But you're operating now on an adjusted constant currency basis at around 8% to 10% AOI growth versus your longer-term guidance of 5% to 8%, and that's coming off after a pretty strong fiscal '23 as well. So I'm curious, is there anything, I guess, looking out longer term that would cause that growth to step down perhaps in fiscal '25 and beyond? Or are you in kind of a secularly stronger market than you were when you initially gave that longer-term growth outlook?
Jim Cleary: Yes. So let me start off, and I'll talk about our long-term guidance. And as you know, our long-term guidance, it contemplates operating income growth of 5% to 8% and EPS growth of 8% to 12%, normalizing for exclusive government-owned COVID products and foreign exchange. This -- we are assuming we'll be able to grow 5% to 8%. And each of our segments and capital deployment contribution will be 3% to 4%. Our guidance is higher than that. As you know, in fiscal year '24, as we called out, as you mentioned, on a consolidated adjusted operating income growth basis, it's 8% to 10% constant currency ex-COVID. And there are a number of things that are driving our guidance and fiscal year '24 and a number of things that drive our long-term guidance. And one thing I think to keep in mind is that the kind of the second half of our fiscal year '24, it compares to 2 quarters of particularly strong ex-COVID growth, including 15% growth that we had in the third quarter of fiscal year '23 and then the 14% growth we had in the most recent quarter. But we have really good confidence in our long-term growth capability, and it will be driven by the things that's been driving our recent growth. It's the growth of our higher margin, higher growth businesses, including specialty distribution and our commercialization services business. It's continued strong utilization trends. It's drug pricing and those sorts of things. And so we have good confidence in our fiscal year '24 guidance and very good confidence in our long-term guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz with Bank of America.
Allen Lutz: Steve, you spoke about the recent conference that you attended with the Good Neighbor Pharmacy customers. And our work suggested you've been growing the number of pharmacies under that brand pretty nicely over the past few years. I'm curious with some of the headwinds we're seeing for companies like Walgreens, can you talk about the current state of the independent pharmacy market and what you're seeing there?
Steve Collis: Yes, thanks for the question. Our community pharmacies always differentiate themselves with their resilience. And broadly speaking, they hold up well. Around 20%, 21% of market share. And they've been in that place for several years now. I think with product innovations like GLP-1s and more people doing their vaccine and COVID shots at the pharmacy, it does give an opportunity. Labor and access to pharmacists is probably easier on a more macro level on a smaller basis. And often, some of those pharmacies are in smaller communities, they're very active in those communities. And also, some play a key role in access to underserved communities as a leading health care provider in those communities. So we're proud of our partnership with them. You mentioned growing. And I would say that we do that through our relationships with our buying groups, that we are, I believe, are leaders in the space. And it's a fascinating space for us and one that we'll continue to invest in. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: Yes. And Jim, kind of a question at a high level as you look out to earnings -- operating earnings growth in 2024. Would just love to hear you talk about growth in the specialty business versus what we think of as the regular way, retail store drug wholesaling business. And maybe I would love to hear you talk about margin growth in manufacturer-facing services versus retailer-facing services. And just kind of like where are the pockets -- like when we look at the kind of composite growth targets, kind of where are the pockets of strength and kind of where are the pockets of kind of performance that's closer to the core?
Jim Cleary: Yes. And so as we look at growth opportunities, as you called out, specialty is a key driver of growth for us. And after I talk, I'll ask Steve to talk about it also because, of course, he was the founder of all those businesses. And we're seeing very good growth in and with -- in the specialty market with regard to specialty physician services and physician practices. We're seeing good growth with health systems also, and there's so much innovation that's going on in the market. It's really a long -- it has been, and we think it will continue to be a long-term tailwind for our business. The innovation in that market and the capabilities we have, including all of our wraparound services that we offer. And then just -- and one example of our belief there is the investment that we've made in OneOncology. And then with regard to our commercialization services business, our manufacturer services businesses that are higher margin, we are continuing to make investments there and continue to see very good opportunities. And in addition to specialty, it will really continue to be a focus area for us, driving our growth over fiscal year '24 and the longer term. Steve, are there any things you'd like to add?
Steve Collis: No, no. Thanks, Jim. Well said, certainly, I think if you look at where manufacturers are investing their dollars, of course, there's been a very robust sector in the GLP-1 category in the diabetes and weight loss category. But oncology is one where so many manufacturers are focused. We still feel that we have significant opportunities with biosimilars with some of the other new categories of drugs in this area. Cell and gene therapy are going to be important business drivers for us. Cencora plays an important role in those products. And then on the practice management side, the data, value-based care side, so robust, the sector, and our role in it is so integral to those practices that it's just still a very exciting place to be and one way where Cencora will continue to be the leader. And hopefully, we also look to do more oncology in Europe over time as well. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.
Andrea Alfonso: It's Andrea Alfonso, in for Kevin. I wanted to switch gears a little bit and ask about the international front and given your expectations for 7% to 10% ex-FX and ex-COVID, which is above the LRP targets you've outlined. Could you maybe discuss some of your expectations there a little bit? I assume maybe PharmaLex accretion is improving. But we also are comping against pretty strong growth in World Courier and sort of the volumes per shipment and mix basis. And then maybe what your expectations are for commodities as well?
Jim Cleary: Sure. So yes, we feel very good about our growth opportunity this year in International. One of the things that's driving the growth rate though, I want to make sure you know, is we do have an extra quarter of PharmaLex in fiscal year '24. We had 3 quarters in fiscal year '23, and we'll have 4 quarters in '24. Also we'll really benefit for the fact that we've recently divested the Egyptian business. And that was a headwind in our fiscal year '23, and it will no longer be a headwind in our fiscal year '24. But overall, we also continue to benefit just from the very strong Global Specialty Logistics business, the World Courier business, which has been an excellent performer. And then also solid execution from the Alliance Healthcare team and the Alliance business. And so those are some of the things that drive our growth rate in International in fiscal year '24.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: Great. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on that, as we think about the acquisition of PharmaLex and you've been moving more into sort of pharma services, are there other areas when you think about serving your biopharma manufacturer partners, areas that you're -- maybe you're not in that you think are sort of strategically, kind of -- tangential to things that you're doing now that could be interesting for you as you think about capital deployment going forward?
Steve Collis: Yes. PharmaLex is a strategic asset that's very complementary to our existing services. They, as you know, provide a platform with services in the U.S. as well as a high level of service for a differentiated level of service than we've historically been providing in Europe. We already had a commercialization service category-type businesses with companies like other well-known like Lash and Xcenda. World Courier, in a way, has many aspects of it that are more like a commercial or a commercialization services, but also strong distribution and supply chain expertise in our ultra niche market. So these are areas that are very intriguing to us. We've always had a view that our customers are both up and down the supply chain. And we want to carry on providing those best-in-class services. We have opportunities also for geographic expansion. So where else does it make sense for us to be. And PharmaLex has been very adept at getting into new markets and is present in many, many countries. So some of these compendia works we're doing, we've been talking about them. And business reviews are really truly global in nature to the extent of very few projects that we've worked on in the past. So exciting opportunities for us, strong management team. We focus on the integration. And I think you'll see potential add-on investments and to -- and including geographic, potentially. But at the moment, we're just focused on rolling it in to the extent that we would want with key integration goals. So -- but thank you for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Great. So a lot of my questions have been asked. But just a quick question on Animal Health. What are you currently seeing in the companion and production animal markets? And how do you see that playing out over the next year, just in light of some that still sluggish vet office visit environment that we're seeing? And then a separate question just on the 2024 guide. I think you mentioned the Walgreens relationship earlier, but any other contract changes or material renewals that we should be thinking about that may be embedded in your guidance here?
Jim Cleary: Okay. Yes, sure. I'll start off with the Animal Health business there, Erin, and thanks a lot for the question. And I'll really focus my answer on our business. And as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, our Animal Health business had a great quarter. Both our companion and production animal businesses grew very nicely during the quarter. And despite the companion market having some headline issues with vet visits, we've continued to see good sales growth. And in the production market, the herd count remains near record lows. But given the high price of cattle producers want to make sure they keep their cattle healthy. And so we have seen very good results there, and it's probably been driven by, I think, just really good execution by our Animal Health team the last few quarters. And then with regard to your other question on major contracts coming up for renewal, we don't have any large upcoming renewals in the near term.
Steve Collis: Thank you. That concludes our questions. I'll just make a closing statement. Cencora is proud to finish our first quarter as Cencora, and we move into fiscal year '24 with strong momentum. We are executing, as we always have, to deliver results. We are investing in our business to differentiate our capabilities and deliver long-term growth. We are at the center of health care and the care of the supply chain, the core of the supply chain, including -- very closely tied to these innovative products that we're so proud to represent in the marketplace. Our fundamentals are strong, and our strategy is sound as we are well positioned to continue delivering value for our stakeholders in fiscal year '24 and beyond. Thanks for your time and attention today.
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-08-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's AmerisourceBergen Q3 Fiscal '23 Earnings Call. My name is Jordan, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I'm now going to hand over to Bennett Murphy, the Senior VP and Head of Investor Relations and Treasury, to begin. Bennett, please go ahead. 
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO.
 On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. We have also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes.
 Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
 And this call cannot be broadcast as an express permission of the company. You have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible in the hour. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. 
Steven Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Today, I am pleased to discuss our AmerisourceBergen's pharmaceutical centric businesses, the strength of our balance sheet and execution by our team members have continued driving our strong performance in fiscal 2023.
 In the quarter, we saw continued momentum across our businesses, delivering revenue growth of 11% and adjusted EPS growth of 11%. We are once again raising our fiscal 2023 guidance as we continue to benefit from good underlying business fundamentals and our focus on operating more efficiently. As I said last quarter, we are leveraging our commercial and organizational strength to find ways to better collaborate with a focus on enhancing the way we go to market with our customers. Operating efficiently is critical to our role in the supply chain, and to our ability to invest as we seek to drive further differentiation in our business.
 Guided by our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, we advanced our business by focusing on 4 key areas: community providers, specialty medicine and services, global access and opportunity and customer partnerships. We leverage our robust commercial strengths to provide solutions and forge deep relationships with customers and partners globally. Community providers from specialty physicians and local health centers to pharmacies and veterinarians are the cornerstone of access and care in their communities. We work closely with our customers to provide solutions to support their operational needs and strategic initiatives, as they enhance their patient impact.
 By leveraging our scale and expertise we offer a broad range of solutions to our community provider customers from those designed to help them solve for everyday challenges like marketing and contracting to those designs to help evolve and broaden their reach. One example of this is our [ Fegan ] network of community pharmacies across Europe, where we recently introduced an oncology support program. This program provided community pharmacists with improved training to support patients undergoing cancer treatment. Our [ Faga ] oncology support equips pharmacists to interact frequently with cancer patients with resources to help address topics such as mental health, managing side effects related to treatment and adjusting to lifestyle habits and changes.
 By providing these types of valuable services, we are able to help elevate the role community pharmacists play as critical health care providers within their communities. In the United States, the completion of our minority investment in OneOncology marked an important step in evolving AmerisourceBergen support of community oncology providers. Over the past several decades, we have built our leadership in oncology and been a strong supporter of community oncologists. Leveraging our expertise, we partner with our customers to drive innovation and share best practices to support the health and vitality of those crucial community providers in the spirit.
 Our investment in OneOncology further expands our footprint within the oncology space allowing us to deepen our already strong ties to community oncologists. We look forward to enhancing the value we provide to all our partners as the oncology landscape continues to grow and evolve. As we continue to expand our downstream solutions in specialty, our focus on specialty medicine and services, differentiates us to our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners across the commercialization process, from clinical development to patient access.
 As pharmaceutical innovation continues to advance medical care and health in our communities, we have positioned ourselves as a differentiated leader. AmerisourceBergen's ability to provide global access and opportunity by offering U.S. and pan-European logistics reach. And commercialization support makes us a partner of choice for pharmaceutical manufacturers, particularly as specialty medicines with higher commercial and distribution complexity, are making up a bigger portion of the pharmaceutical development pipeline.
 Our offering is particularly unique in the cell and gene space, where we can integrate logistics with essential patient support services and orchestration technology. While still in early days with cell and gene, we have had positive receptivity to our integrated solutions for these highly specialized products from their biopharmaceutical innovators. Cell and gene therapy is a key area for innovation as it represents an evolving and expanding market with considerable long-term growth opportunities.
 Following the launch of our Cell Gene and Therapy integration hub in April, we announced our support for the commercialization of a recently approved gene therapy. We will serve as the exclusive distributor of the product and provide commercialization support, including 3PL, kitting and storage. Our goal is to simplify the commercialization process for our partners and help them achieve their desired outcomes.
 AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to support the next evolution of innovative products, and we will continue to invest in developing technologies and solutions to increase our value to our partners. Our ability to drive innovation and establish new solutions to serve our customers and partners, is key to advancing our strategy and long-term growth. Transparency into the supply chain has never been so broadly appreciated, and we are focused on providing actionable and timely insights to ensure the supply chain can operate in an efficient manner. Serving at the core of the pharmaceutical supply chain, we take our role seriously handling nearly $1 billion worth of orders daily across tens of thousands of products.
 Our ability to manage thoughtfully, professionally and effectively through disruptions and shortages amplifies the importance of the expertise and diligence we provide in the pharmaceutical supply chain. To further our ability to provide confidence and transparency, we recently announced a partnership with ParcelShield, which will enhance our customers' view of the delivery of critical medications by providing them with real-time packaging, tracking and delivery updates. This example builds on other initiatives we have taken to enhance supply chain visibility, including the addition of real-time tracking on shipments in our global logistics business, and demonstrates how we are leveraging our infrastructure, enhancing our distribution efficiency and creating innovative partnerships to deliver value services for our customers and partners up and downstream.
 We also drive value by leveraging our extensive customer partnerships to develop solutions that will expand access to high-quality care. In 2022, the innovative test to treat initiative began permitting pharmacists to administer COVID-19 tests and prescribe certain COVID treatments. This, in turn, increased accessibility to these treatments, particularly in underserved communities. Taking learnings from the success of this program, AmerisourceBergen has partnered with SteadyMD to pilot a telehealth solution for community pharmacies to expand the number of Test to Treat services they can offer. By working jointly with physicians through the SteadyMD platform, pharmacists can accelerate patient access to Accenture Pharmaceuticals before conditions become critical. These type of initiatives fortify our customer partnerships and support our customers' growth.
 Guided by our purpose of creating healthier futures, we are focused on contemplating and building out other solutions to innovate how we support and grow with our partners as they improve patient care and outcomes. Over the last 2 decades, AmerisourceBergen has recognized the importance of being a purpose-driven company. And unifying under a new name that better represents who we are today and where we are going in the future will allow us to deliver on our purpose, and advance our impact across the health care industry. Today, I am tremendously excited to announce that effective August 30, 2023, and AmerisourceBergen will officially become Cencora and begin trading as COR which will unite our team members under a globally inclusive name and ticker symbol that reflects our core role in health care.
 This new identity will allow us to go to market as a unified enterprise to our customers and partners, showcasing the breadth and depth of our solutions across our footprint. The name Cencora also better represents our commitment to our people who are at the center of everything we do. Our team members are the key to our success and we are focused on creating an inclusive and engaging environment, where our people feel comfortable sharing the unique backgrounds and experiences. We pride ourselves on cultivating an inclusive culture and continually improving upon our efforts to ensure all our team members feel empowered and welcome. We've taken steps to further our inclusion efforts by signing the CEO disability inclusion letter published by Disability IN to ensure an accessible and equitable environment within the AmerisourceBergen team.
 We were also honored to be recognized as the best place to work for disability inclusion after receiving a perfect score on the Disability Equality Index. We proactively set goals and action items to advance disability inclusion and equity, demonstrating our commitment to enacting change within the environment in which people with disabilities work. At AmerisourceBergen, we are powered by our people, and we are proud to promote a working environment that supports and empowers all backgrounds, abilities and genders. As we continue to grow and evolve under our new corporate identity, we will remain driven by our purpose. Our future success hinges on our people, environment and communities in which we live and work and I remain inspired by our team that delivers our purpose every day.
 In the remaining months of our fiscal 2023 year, we look forward to executing on our strategy and investing in further innovation and growth. Building on AmerisourceBergen's strong legacy, Cencora will continue to be a differentiated force within the global health care system and provide value for all our stakeholders. The emphasis we place on innovation and efficiency sets us up for a long-term growth and success as a leader in pharmaceutical centric healthcare. I will now hand the call over to Jim for a more in-depth look at our third quarter results and updated guidance going into the final quarter of our fiscal 2023. Jim? 
James Cleary: Thanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. AmerisourceBergen delivered another quarter of strong results as our team members' execution continues to create significant value for all our stakeholders. Our results speak to the strength of our business and our continued work to drive efficiencies.
 In the quarter, we also strategically deployed capital closing our minority investment in OneOncology, an example of investing to further our strengths and we continue to opportunistically repurchase shares to also return capital to our shareholders. Before I turn to our third quarter results, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release.
 Turning now to our third quarter results. AmerisourceBergen had adjusted diluted EPS of $2.92 and an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter, driven by growth in both segments, and a lower share count due to opportunistic share repurchases over the past year. Our consolidated revenue was $66.9 billion, up 11.5%, driven by growth in both segments, particularly in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which had broad-based growth across our customer base, including growth in sales of products labeled for diabetes and weight loss in the GLP-1 class. Without this increase in GLP-1 products, our consolidated revenue growth would have been more in line with our consolidated gross profit growth.
 Consolidated gross profit was $2.2 billion, up 8% due to growth in both segments. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.33% and a decline of 11 basis points due primarily to lower contribution from COVID treatments, which have higher gross profit margins and continued volume growth in GLP-1s, which have lower gross profit margins. Both these margin impacts are to be expected given the unique characteristics of each of these product groups. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.4 billion, up 7.6%, primarily due to higher expenses in our International Healthcare Solutions segment. We continue to focus on creating efficiencies and working collaboratively to drive value for our stakeholders which contributed to the sequential year-over-year moderation of growth in operating expenses in the quarter, particularly in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment as a result of actions we have taken.
 Consolidated operating income was $822 million, an increase of nearly 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Our operating income growth was driven by solid performance in both segments and I will provide more detailed business drivers when discussing segment level results. Moving now to our net interest expense. For the third quarter, net interest expense was $58 million, an increase of 9.5% versus the prior year quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect net interest expense to be at its highest level this fiscal year given cash use in the past few months. Now turning to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 21.5% compared to 20.2% in the prior year quarter. As we called out last quarter, we continue to expect our full year fiscal 2023 effective tax rate to be towards the bottom end of our guidance range of 20% to 21%.
 Turning to diluted share count. Our diluted share count was 204.4 million shares a 3.5% decrease compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, driven by share repurchases we completed over the last 12 months. This included $100 million of repurchases in the third quarter in conjunction with transactions, Walgreens Boots Alliance executed. Going forward, we expect transactions to continue to occur and we anticipate continuing to collaborate and coordinate with Walgreens Boots Alliance as we have done over the past year. Regarding our cash balance and free cash flow, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion of cash. Our adjusted free cash flow for the 9 months ended June 30 was $1.5 billion, and we are now slightly improving our adjusted free cash flow guidance to be at least $2 billion for the fiscal year, up from approximately $2 billion. This completes the review of our consolidated results.
 Now I'll turn to our segment results for the third quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $59.9 billion, up 12% for the quarter with broad-based growth across our customer base, including sales of products in the GLP-1 class and also sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased by 9.5% to $635 million as we saw good pharmaceutical utilization trends across our business, and our Animal Health business had another good quarter with growth in both the companion and production animal markets. Our operating income growth also benefited from an easier expense comparison as we lapped inflationary pressures that began in the March quarter of fiscal 2022 and from efficiency initiatives that we have taken, both of which we called out last quarter.
 This combination of operating expense items helped improve our operating expense margin in the quarter, offsetting most of the gross profit margin pressure from lower COVID-19 treatment contributions and increased volumes of GLP-1s. In the quarter, U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income margin did still have a year-over-year decline of 3 basis points to 1.06% as a result of our mix of those 2 product groups. As a reminder, COVID product volume has continued to decline as expected, and we are earning a fee for distributing government-owned products and GLP-1s are a big driver of revenue growth but not a meaningful driver of operating income growth.
 I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.0 billion, up 5.6% on a reported basis or up 12.4% on a constant currency basis. In this segment, we saw growth in all our businesses. International Healthcare Solutions operating income was $187 million, up 6% on a reported basis or 7% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid performance in our Global Logistics business, and the inclusion of PharmaLex in the quarter, which offset the impact of the divestiture of our Brazilian specialty business in June of 2022. As a reminder, this divested business contributed nearly 2% of segment level operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. That completes the review of our segment level results.
 I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2023 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Full details of our fiscal 2023 guidance can be found on Pages 8 and 9 of our earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website. Starting with revenue. We are raising our consolidated revenue guidance and now expect our revenue growth to be at least 8% to reflect stronger revenue growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and favorable currency movements in the International Healthcare Solutions segment relative to our prior guidance.
 In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect revenue growth to be at least 9% and which reflects strong pharmaceutical utilization trends and also the increase in volume of GLP-1 products. In the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we are raising our as-reported revenue growth guidance to be in a range of 1% to 4%, up from our previous expectation of a 3% decline to flat due to favorable currency movements relative to our May guidance. Moving to operating income. We are narrowing our consolidated operating income guidance to a range of 3% to 4% growth from the previous range of 2% to 4% growth, primarily to reflect the strong performance we have seen in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, and to reflect favorable currency movements in the International Healthcare Solutions segment.
 In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect segment operating income growth to be in the range of 4% to 5% from our previous range of 3% to 5%, excluding contributions related to COVID-19 treatment distribution. We now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 7% to 8% from our previous range of 6% to 8%, and we are more likely to be near the top end of that 7% to 8% range. In the third quarter, COVID-19 treatments contributed $0.06 to our consolidated EPS with about $0.05 in the U.S. and $0.01 in the International segment. This brings our total COVID treatment contribution year-to-date to $0.29. Our full year expectations for COVID treatment contributions remained generally unchanged and we expect only $0.01 or $0.02 of COVID-related contributions in the fourth quarter with the contribution occurring in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment.
 In the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect as-reported segment operating income growth to be in the range of flat to 4% growth, which reflects favorable FX rates relative to our previous guidance. As a result of these updates, we are raising our full year diluted EPS guidance from our prior range of $11.70 to $11.90 to a new range of $11.85 to $11.95, representing growth of 7% to 8% on an as-reported basis or 12% to 13%, excluding COVID-19 treatment contributions. As you turn to your models, there are a few items we wanted to remind you of as you think about the fourth quarter and the year ahead. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we had $0.17 of contribution from distributing COVID treatments, $0.16 of which was in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment.
 As I mentioned, this year, we expect to only have $0.01 or $0.02 of COVID treatment contributions in this year's fourth quarter, which will impact year-over-year growth rates. It's also important to keep in mind, that [ into ] the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the dollar was at historically strong levels versus most major currencies. This should create a tailwind in the International Healthcare Solutions segment on an as-reported basis, as we lap that easier comparison and as reported growth is expected to be higher than constant currency growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This dynamic is reflected in our increased as-reported operating income guidance at the International Healthcare Solutions segment level, and in our constant currency operating income guidance, which remains unchanged at the International Healthcare Solutions segment level.
 We are in the middle of our planning process and feel confident that the strength and resilience of our core business, and our value-creating approach to capital deployment will allow us to deliver on our long-term growth guidance. While it remains early in our planning process, at this point, we would expect contributions related to COVID treatment distribution to be minimal in fiscal 2024. As usual, we will provide full fiscal 2024 guidance in November when it can be fully informed by our detailed planning process. Before I turn to my closing remarks, I would like to provide a brief update on one of our key ESG initiatives. As we have discussed, in fiscal 2023, we introduced an ESG metric within our executive compensation program that includes 3 quantifiable components focused on business resiliency, female representation in leadership roles, and employee inclusion and engagement.
 During the quarter, we successfully completed the business resiliency target by completing business impact assessments across our locations. This exercise informs our resilience planning and ensures we are able to continue operating in the face of natural disasters and a changing climate. To this end, we were also proud to be recognized by Forbes on their first-ever Net Zero Leaders list. This list recognizes businesses that are leading the way not only in transitioning to a low-carbon economy by 2050, but also our embedding sustainability practices into their business and working to achieve sustainability targets. Companies were evaluated across industries for the robustness of the company's climate governance strategy and risk management principles. We continue to focus on maintaining strong business resilience practices to allow us to deliver on a role at the center of the pharmaceutical supply chain.
 Reflecting on this being our last earnings call with the corporate name AmerisourceBergen, I am impressed by our company's track record of adapting and evolving over the years. We have executed on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, building on our foundation and pharmaceutical distribution, and expanding our suite of solutions for both our customers and manufacturer partners. Looking ahead, I'm excited that on August 30, we will begin trading under the ticker symbol COR, C-O-R on the New York Stock Exchange. This ticker is more meaningful and reflective of our business and role in the supply chain. As we begin our next chapter at Cencora, I am confident that our team members will build upon the legacy we have created and continue to drive long-term growth for our stakeholders. Now I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. 
Elizabeth Anderson: Congrats on the quarter. One that was particularly impressive as we think about the performance in the quarter was obviously the improvement in the OpEx. Can you help us sort of think about the sustainability of that improvement as we think about maybe the fourth quarter and then maybe conceptually beyond that? 
James Cleary: Yes, thanks so much for asking that question, Elizabeth. One thing we were really pleased about -- there's obviously so many things we were pleased about during this quarter. But one of the things we were pleased with is that our OpEx growth was slower than our gross profit growth. So as I'm sure you saw our gross profit growth during the quarter was 8.0% and our OpEx growth was 7.6%. And really where we saw the improvement was in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment where our operating expense margin declined by 11 basis points.
 And we really were able to achieve this by focusing on aligning our internal capabilities to our customers' needs and creating a more efficient organizational structure. And we had talked about that on the May call. And that's something that we were very focused on. And then we also benefited from lapping inflationary pressure that had started in the March quarter of fiscal year '22. And so we lapped that pressure, and so we had less cost pressure during the quarter. And so as we look towards the fourth quarter and we look towards fiscal year '24, this is something that our company is very focused on. We're very focused on efficiency, so we can really align our capabilities to our customers' needs and have an efficient organization. So thanks a lot for asking that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. 
Lisa Gill: Just want to understand a couple of things better on the margin side. So first, in your prepared comments, you talked about exclusive distribution relationships on cell gene therapies. And then you talked a little bit about the growth in GLP-1s, which I understand, high dollar value when we think about it branded, but probably a lower margin as we think about your book of business.
 How do I think about like the progression of margin, especially in the U.S. distribution component of the business as we think about; one, exclusive distribution relationships; two, the continued growth in GLP-1; three, biosimilars, how that plays a role.
 And then just lastly, like anything else that I should keep in mind, whether it's generic price deflation, which seems to have moderated as we start to think about not just the fourth quarter, but thinking about '24 as well. 
James Cleary: Yes. There's a lot there. And so let me start out by talking about GLP-1s because they were such a driver of revenue growth during the quarter. And I mentioned during my prepared remarks that we had about 11.5% revenue growth in the quarter and that if we backed out GLP-1s, our revenue growth would have been more in line with our GP growth of 8.0%.
 And so GLP-1s really are a driver of top line revenue growth. But from an operating income standpoint, they are minimally profitable. And so they really are a driver of top line, but minimally profitable at the operating income line. And this is caused by the fact that the gross profit margins on them are low. And then, the operating expenses are a little higher because of the cold chain nature of the product. And then with regard to things like exclusive cell and gene relationships, of course, those sorts of things are very positive for the company and very strategically important. But in terms of dollars, small at this point in time.
 Biosimilars, you asked about, they continue to be in a really kind of key and a growth opportunity and margin opportunity for AmerisourceBergen. You asked about generic deflation. And during the last few months, we have seen some moderation of generic deflation in certain pockets. This is too early to call a trend. But of course, if it were to broaden beyond a few pockets into a broader range of generics, it certainly would become a tailwind for the company. But you mentioned, in particular the U.S., and I think probably the thing that I'll point out -- and I talked about this in the prepared remarks on a consolidated basis.
 But in the U.S. segment, the gross profit margin decline during the quarter was 13 basis points, and that was really driven by 2 things. One is less sales of COVID therapies, which are high margin and then greater sales of GLP-1s, which are lower-margin products and minimally profitable. But -- and so I think that addresses your questions, but I just want to finish by saying, we were really pleased by  results we had during the quarter, in particular, the operating income growth that was driven by several things, including strong, broad-based results across many businesses, good utilization trends we saw in the U.S. and then the good performance we made on the OpEx front that I had earlier talked about. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. 
Eric Percher: Thank you for the commentary on GLP-1. I want to stay on that subject and it's good to hear they're minimally profitable for Amerisource, but what we're hearing from pharmacies, particularly independence is that they're not profitable. And it sounds like maybe even the same for chains. So given the importance of independents, have you had to help them offset that? Or is that the role of the manufacturer and others in the supply chain? 
Steven Collis: Yes. So Eric, thanks. As you know, we price more on product category, so this would fit into a branded and indeed, oral category that's dispensed mainly in the retail sector. A fairly significant amount of this is going through mail order.
 So it's -- we don't discount on a particular product category, even as significant as this product category is. But we do regard ourselves as a liaison. So of course, we'll be talking on behalf of Good Neighbor Pharmacies in particular, you look at the Elevate network, we discussed this as a key product category that is affecting profitability, reimbursement stability in the community pharmacy. But it's not anything that we are discounting on a particular art  on a particularly category basis. So it just fits into that broader category. Of course, these products are extremely important, a good example of innovation and there is a lot of product, a lot of positives about the product as well.
 I think we shouldn't only look at this in terms of the negatives. I mean, I think there will be a whole lot of benefits to the pharmacy industry as this category evolves including the monitoring of side effects, potentially anything else that pharmacists can do to help manage the health of their patients and AmerisourceBergen will, of course, be there to assist. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Grosslight of Citi. 
Daniel Grosslight: Congrats on another strong quarter here. I just had a quick question on the adjusted operating income guidance for the rest of this year and how we should think about that going into '24. So if you back out the COVID impact and assume that you're going to be at the high end of the range for the fiscal year. It implies around a 2% sequential step-down from 3Q.
 I'm curious if there was any pull-through from 4Q into 3Q that may be causing that sequential decline? Or is that kind of the normal seasonality now? And then going forward, is kind of a like low teens, high double -- high single-digit growth rate in that segment reasonable? 
James Cleary: Yes. Thank you for asking the question. And let me say, of course, we were really pleased with the results during the quarter. And as -- and due to that, we did really kind of across the board raised our narrowing of guidance for fiscal year '23. And we have a lot of confidence in our updated fiscal year '23 guidance, and we have a lot of confidence in our long-term guidance, which is, of course, 5% to 8% organic operating income growth. And then including capital deployment, it's double-digit compound annual growth rate for adjusted EPS at the midpoint of the range.
 Of course, both those exclude COVID and exclude CapEx, but we -- there are, of course, a number of things that can impact results quarter-to-quarter and timing and those sorts of things. But rather than kind of get into the details there. I just want to say that as we are starting into fiscal -- excuse me, the fiscal fourth quarter, we've got a lot of good momentum in our business. We're seeing strong utilization trends in the U.S. We're seeing good performance in just a number of areas of the business, and that's what gives us a lot of confidence in both our fiscal year '23 full year guide and our long-term guidance that I talked about. And of course, we're just in the middle of our fiscal year planning process now, and we'll look forward to providing our fiscal year '24 guidance on the November call. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee of TD Cowen. 
Charles Rhyee: Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to go back talking about sort of the services that you're looking to do that you are providing for pharma manufacturers here. You talked about more commercial support, the cell and gene therapy hub, et cetera. Can you talk about a little bit maybe how maybe OneOncology fits into this? You look at some of your peers and some of the efforts that they're making in terms of sort of upward facing services to manufacturers. I know you have a lot of that when we think about World Courier as well.
 What is the broader strategy? And what are the services that many manufacturers are starting to ask from folks like you? And what's the unique position that you have here in -- and I guess, ultimately, how much share of a business do you think this will be when we think of Cencora going forward? 
Steven Collis: Yes. Charles, thanks for the question. That's -- I'll try to cover all the elements you asked. Of course, one of the ways at AmerisourceBergen has a differentiated value proposition is our strong portfolio of distribution capabilities and key strategic relationships are really -- we juxtapose and relate those into our upstream relationships and try to provide more services to manufacturers.
 So key themes that you should keep in mind is our presence in specialty distribution, where we've been the leading community oncology. And this will only be enhanced by the OneOncology acquisition, where we expect to have learnings. There's been a lot of activity, for example, recently in urology. But -- so that could be a future area of interest for us. As any of these physician dispensing capabilities, we come up in areas that we're already active in, including urology and rheumatology, ophthalmology, that will be of interest, and neurology could be one that we are very interested in as well. Aligned with our distribution capabilities to the dispensing physician and what we often call the Part B market is our GPO capabilities.
 And then I'd have to say AmerisourceBergen has really focused and invested in the development and the breadth and depth of our commercialization services. The customer is the biopharmaceutical manufacturer who will actually be billing for a lot of these services. And I think if you look at the various businesses that we've been invested in, go back to [ '98 ] when we invested in Lash. We started our ICS business for pre-wholesale third-party logistics. We have always been a leader in this area as well. And our goal is to provide an end-to-end suite of solutions and support our partners at every stage of the commercialization journey.
 So of course, as you have new more complex therapies, none more so than more intriguing than cell and gene therapies and you have -- when you launch them, you have cost issues, you have access issues, you have, of course, the distribution and storage issues, transportation issues. AmerisourceBergen is really creating a lot of services around this. And you've heard how we even -- for a unique product. Now we're doing some kitting and different sorts of handling for cell and gene product. So we will continue to evolve our business. There's a lot we can do. We can track outcomes  on a therapy-specific level. In some cases, we've done that in the past. So we will be responsive to the needs of the market and continue to add value to -- for patients on the access front and to manufacturers on taking those different distribution and other points we have to get their products into the market and efficiently and effectively. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Alfonso of UBS. 
Kevin Caliendo: It's Kevin Caliendo for Andrea. Yes, on the International segment, you've discussed pricing visibility. And on World Courier, there's been a benefit from higher weight per shipment. Is that dynamic what increases pricing organically on a go-forward basis?
 I guess what I'm really trying to -- try to understand here is what -- how should we think about what drives margin improvement here and internationally besides operating cost, headwinds easing for the -- just for the whole international segment. Is that one of the big drivers? Or is there anything else we should think about in terms of the international margin or the potential for margin improvement in that business? 
James Cleary: Thanks for asking that question. And as we look at the international business, you asked about World Courier, and there has been some benefit from price. But I think as we look forward there, probably a good deal of the benefit we'll see from World Courier will be in volume growth.
 As we look at margins overall in the international business, probably what will impact it more than anything else is a mix. And as we deploy capital like we did in PharmaLex, those will be in higher margin, higher growth businesses. And that will -- over a period of time, it should positively impact margin percentage growth in the international business. And I think that will be the key driver. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird. 
Eric Coldwell: I'm going to shift topics here a little bit. We're seeing aging of receivables and weaker cash collections in certain of our health care services coverage. Biopharma clients simply trying to hold on to cash as long as possible to take advantage of interest rates. I know payments really never seen as a risk here, but at least on the pharma side.
 But I'm just curious, what are you seeing in contract renewals, client negotiations when it comes to payment terms? And are you seeing any of your upstream or downstream accounts trying to hold on to cash longer than they have in the past? 
Steven Collis: Yes. I can start out. It's an interesting question given the interest rate environment and the different -- the sort of near recession we've had, I'm not the economist on this call, but the terms in our business are very stable. There are longer terms often given to the physician segment, but we are not seeing anything discernible, noticeable on changes in terms.
 Certainly, there's a tighter funding environment for biopharma manufacturers and especially start-up innovative products. But that's a cycle we think we may be seeing some sort of signs of optimism there. And we, of course, follow very closely some of the World Courier peers, larger life sciences type services companies and note their pronouncements, the comments on this. But nothing specific, I'd call Jim out on. When we actually negotiating fee-for-service and clauses, I mean, the terms are pretty well established. And the last thing I would say is that with nearly 30 years in the business, the resiliency of the balance sheet that we have, the inventory, the overall majority of the manufacturers we have are -- and I'd say the vast majority of, we've had some few smaller manufacturers have run into financial problems in the last couple of quarters. But it's -- if you look at the gross business of AmerisourceBergen, it's fairly negligible. And very stable. Jim, you want to add something? 
James Cleary: Yes. So this is, of course, something that we monitor and something that we manage very closely and constantly, and there's no meaningful change to call out. Of course, in a working capital management and ROIC and free cash flow are such key value drivers for us over the long term. This is something that we really stay on top of. And I said there's -- as I said, there's no major change to call out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. 
Jonathan Yong: It's Jonathan Yong on for A.J. Just going back to the generic pricing commentary, and I appreciate that the improvement is in the pockets of products. I guess how are you thinking about this from a competitive landscape? Is the increased pricing perhaps providing an opportunity to gain share in the market if your purchasing might be better than others? Just curious to get your thoughts there. 
James Cleary: So yes, like I said earlier, this is -- what we're seeing is the last few months is a moderation of deflation. And again, as you said, it's in pockets. So too early to call a trend. And -- but of course, but [ we're ] a trend, it would be a benefit for us. And then on the sell side, which you talked about, what I'll say on the sell side is it's a competitive market, and it's a stable market also. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Bank of America. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Dan Clark on for Mike. Are you seeing any impacts to sterile injectable pricing margins or supply after the Pfizer plant was disrupted a little earlier this month or last month? And if so, how does that impact factored in the guidance? 
Steven Collis: It's very quick. It's very soon. Obviously, that was a plant that manufactured a couple of injectable products. We've actually worked closely with Pfizer in this particular instance to see if we could help, we had a distribution center closed by the impacted manufacturer plant. But nothing to report yet. It's -- we're keeping our eye on this. Our supply chain group does a fantastic job, has managed through COVID has managed through all sorts of setback.
 We had the farmer nationalism that we had on one of the calls. We had a lot of concerns about that. I don't think that one manufacturer plant will impact us. And also you're talking about one of the most well-established resilient manufacturers. I would imagine they have their contingency plans and business continuity plan. So I think we did -- Jim and I and Bob Mauch, our COO. We did have a call with our supply chain people to understand and nothing alarming yet, but we will keep a close eye on the situation, and we feel confident we can manage through this as we have a lot of the setbacks and -- not overall material to what AmerisourceBergen does. 
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. 
George Hill: And James, I want to come back to Eric's question talking about  GLP-1s and generics. And I guess has the growth of the GLP-1 kind of changed the generic mix and kind of compliance hurdles in the independent channels? And I guess has this led to the independence kind of like artificially hitting generic compliance numbers with you guys to kind of offset the brand into generic mix. I would just kind of love to hear you delve into that dynamic a little bit more. 
Steven Collis: George, it's a good question. I mean the growth of these products have been producing headlines, and it has altered. But we are -- far from a rigid organization. We have discussions with our customers. We stay very close to the customers. I think -- in fact, I think one of the things that I've been really proud about the teams in the last few years is we don't just do all customers when it comes to RFPs, the large and the small customers.
 We're trying to stay very close to them and we have a whole lot of new resources, including the telehealth attributes that we're trying to help with our venture capital funds, but also just the general communication tools that we have with customers and the coverage we have in the market. As Jim said, is competitive but stable. So we know our customers well, we know what's going on. And if we have issues, we help with them. And certainly, the growth of this product category is something that will be discussed and potentially could be adjusted for. But no clear trend yet, but it's definitely a good thought and we have our big retail trade show this weekend.
 And I'm sure that this is going to come up because we have -- Bennett uses the term headline grabbing products and they are. I mean since the hepatitis drugs, we've never seen anything market, but this is definitely more sustainable and even much bigger than that. So -- and of course, much different payer mixes, et cetera. But we want to make sure that our partners, community pharmacies in particular, are stable for the long term, and this would include the management of these products, which are important for their patients.
 So last question? 
Unknown Executive: That was the last... 
Steven Collis: Okay. Well, thank you today. Thank you. We are kind of a little bit emotional here as we report our last quarter as AmerisourceBergen. And I know Dave [ Yost ] is going to be turning over. He doesn't like that we haven't changed us. But we are very, very excited to be talking in the future about Cencora. Cencora is a name that I think really resonates with myself and the team as we look towards a future where we're even more of a United Global Health Solutions leader.
 This name has been studied very well by AmerisourceBergen, and we really believe that it resonates with our team and who we are. What's also extremely important, and I cannot understate this enough, is who we are, what we do and how we do it will not change. We will continue to be a purpose-driven pharmaceutical-centric leader powered by our team members and driven to provide differentiated solutions to our pharma partners and provider customers. We will continue to build on our foundation in pharmaceutical distribution, further our leadership in specialty distribution and services and carry forward our long track record of execution and creating value for all our stakeholders as Cencora. Thank you for your time and attention today. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's event. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-05-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the AmerisourceBergen's Q2 Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Emily, and I'll be coordinating your call today. After the prepared remarks there will be opportunity to ask questions.  I will now turn the call over to our host, Bennett Murphy. Please go ahead.
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's fiscal 2023 second quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. We've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our Investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K. AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the express permission of the company. You'll have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management.   With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Today, we will discuss AmerisourceBergen's fiscal 2023 second quarter results and how our execution against our strategic imperatives and thoughtful capital deployment position us to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth. In the second quarter, we delivered strong financial performance with revenue growth of nearly 10% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%. Our performance reflects our team members' focus on execution and ability to deliver differentiated solutions to our customers and partners. Additionally, we continue to leverage our infrastructure and scale to increase efficiency and align our capabilities to our customers' needs. This continued emphasis, along with the fundamental strength of our business and balance sheet, power our ability to continue investing internally and externally to drive our future growth. As part of our work to bolster productivity and efficiency, we are leveraging our robust infrastructure to align our capabilities to commercial needs and optimize our organizational structure. Across the company, our leaders and team members continue emphasizing collaboration to capitalize on our collective power as we adapt to an ever-changing landscape with a focus on preparing for future opportunities and growth, while delivering on our goals of today. Continuously pursuing efficiency is vital in our business. And in parallel, AmerisourceBergen is executing and delivering strong performance. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as we continue to capitalize on opportunities provided by our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and capabilities. Our results continue to demonstrate the value of our pharmaceutical-centric strategy key strategic partnerships, leadership in specialty and comprehensive global commercialization services. Our leadership in specialty distribution is a key differentiator for AmerisourceBergen, both with pharma manufacturers and with our downstream provider customers. Through our scale, commercial expertise and deep understanding of the challenges providers face, we are able to offer a comprehensive range of services, including our GPOs, data analytics and technology solutions that help them manage effectively and devote more time to serving their patients. In addition, leveraging our position at the center of health care, we facilitate communication, education and knowledge sharing between providers, pharma manufacturers and key thought leaders through our extensive network. One example of this was our recent ION Exchange meeting, which brought together hundreds of our ION GPO members to participate in panel discussions addressing the complexities community oncologists face and provided them with valuable opportunities to connect with fellow physicians and other industry partners. Community oncologists are important partners for our business, and community care is crucial for efficiency and quality in health care as we continue to invest in and enhance our business. We are committed to accelerating our growth and leadership in specialty by advancing oncology-focused practice solutions and services and continuing to lead with market leaders. Most recently, we announced our agreement to invest in OneOncology, a network of leading community oncologists with 900 affiliated providers across 14 states. This investment will deepen and enhance our strong ties to community providers. And OneOncology's practice management services are complementary to AmerisourceBergen's existing capabilities in inventory management, practice analytics and clinical trial support. We know OneOncology and its members well, with many of the physicians serving as advisers to ION and with AmerisourceBergen having served many of these practices for over two decades. Our future plans for collaboration with OneOncology include opportunities for sharing key insights to enhance the value we are able to provide all our community oncology partners as we look to a future with data, analytics and value-based contracting will play an even greater role in community oncology. The trusted relationships and legacy we have both within communities support our ultimate goal to create better patient experiences and outcomes across specialty classes and sites of care. Our commitment to our relationship goes beyond providing high-quality dependable services every day. It also means that we are flexible and agile, helping our partners navigate complexity to provide reliable access to pharmaceuticals. We invest and innovate to provide our partners with new technologies and resources, broadening the scope and scale of our portfolio of capabilities. For example, World Courier recently enhanced its white-glove customer experience by adding real-time location monitoring on all multiuse packaging shipments, setting a new standard for tracking in the pharmaceutical logistics industry. The ability to track and monitor the precise location of shipments in transit globally allows us to deliver superior service to our customers, proactively anticipate potential risks and ensure the secure and timely distribution of products. This capability further expands AmerisourceBergen's leadership in specialty logistics and positions us to be the partner of choice for innovative products in development and coming to market, such as cell and gene therapies that often require the ability to monitor temperature and location in real time. Cell and gene therapies are an exciting new frontier for health care and pharmaceutical innovation, and AmerisourceBergen is focused on evolving our solutions to help orchestrate services across the treatment development and patient journey. In April, we announced the launch of our cell and gene therapy integration hub, a new platform agnostic system offering cell and gene therapy developers support at every stage of the product life cycle, from clinical trial to specialty logistics services, market access strategies and patient support services. While certainly in its early days, we understand how important it is for AmerisourceBergen to play a vital role in helping to advance innovation and access to these products. As we continue to invest in our business and differentiate our value proposition, we are applying our intellectual confidence to capture new opportunities for emerging trends and future innovation. For our upstream partners, we support a common goal of accelerating treatment time to market and maximizing product success. For partners, big and small, we offer a unique comprehensive suite of services that supports customer needs, including deep expertise in specialty pharmaceuticals, an efficient and innovative approach to support products throughout the commercialization journey, and a global footprint paired with local expertise, including the U.S. and European 3PL and global specialty logistics. Over the last year, we have detailed how we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities in the pharma services market, particularly with small and midsized biopharma manufacturers, who are more likely to outsource key parts of the clinical development and commercialization process. According to a recent IQVIA report, these emerging biopharma companies are rapidly gaining share, having originated a little over two-thirds of new drugs in 2022, while representing two-thirds of the innovation pipeline. Importantly, these companies are increasingly launching products independently upon approval. In fact, nearly 70% of drugs originated by emerging biopharmaceutical manufacturers were launched independently in 2022. Our recently closed acquisition of PharmaLex enhances our portfolio of solutions to support pharma, both large and small, as they move through the development process. We are uniquely positioned to provide key solutions, including pharmacovigilance, regulatory affairs consulting and clinical trial logistics, to help accelerate time to market and support ongoing access across geographies. As these players increasingly manage the entire product life cycle, our global footprint and comprehensive suite of pre- and post-commercialization services positions us to be their partner of choice. We continue to invest, partner and build to ensure that we have the right capabilities in place to expand the reach of innovative therapies and transform patient access and support, all while positioning our business for future growth. As a purpose-driven organization, our future will be defined by impact on our people, environment and communities in which we live and work around the world. In February, the earthquakes that impacted Turkey had a devastating humanitarian impact. Following the earthquakes, we committed funds to assist in local on-the-ground support and product donations, and AmerisourceBergen Foundation provided a package of relief funds to our strategic nonprofit partners who have extensive experience in supporting disaster response efforts. Our Associate Assistance Fund supported impacted team members based in Turkey by providing resources for shelter immediately following the earthquake, assistance to those who are hospitalized and longer-term financial systems for housing and other crucial needs. Team members continue to support their colleagues in Turkey by taking advantage of our foundations 2-to-1 donation matching program, and I am proud of the work our teams have done to help one another in times of need. Our work to support access and equity is key to delivering on our purpose of creating healthier futures, and we are helping to build a community where everyone can thrive. We are collaborating and engaging with team members, partners, customers and patients in our communities, working together with a shared goal of creating fair and comparable access. This means working to improve health access and equity in the communities in which our team members live and work. One such initiative is our pharmacy recruit solution, which is creating a program for community pharmacists to contact potential qualified patients and refer them to clinical trial sites for enrollment. We hope that this initiative will help reduce representation gaps that can exist in clinical trial research by leveraging the reach and trusted relationships of community pharmacies. These efforts are deeply aligned with our purpose, and we will continue to work to address the systemic barriers that exist within the health care ecosystem, reduce the disparities that disproportionately impact vulnerable communities and empower more equitable health outcomes for patients. Driven by our purpose, powered by our team members and fueled by the strength and resilience of our business, we continue to deliver value for all our stakeholders. Leveraging our foundation and distribution and our portfolio of complementary pharmaceutical-centric solutions, we create differentiated value for our customers and partners as a key connector at the center of the health care system. As we look forward to the remainder of the fiscal year, I continue to be inspired by the thoughtfulness and tenacity of our team members around the world who live our purpose each day. Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our second quarter results and our updated guidance. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Thanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. In our second quarter, AmerisourceBergen delivered strong financial performance as our businesses continued executing and delivering a differentiated value proposition to our customers and partners. Operationally, we are focused on increasing efficiency throughout the organization, while continuing to prioritize growth and ensuring that we are innovating to support the needs of our customers across our business. Additionally, we continue to be focused on making thoughtful and strategic investments to power our long-term growth, supported by our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation. Before I turn to our second quarter results, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results, unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release. Turning now to our second quarter results. AmerisourceBergen finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.50, an increase of nearly 9% over the prior year quarter. This solid growth was driven by strong performance in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which more than offset the gross profit headwind from lapping the peak of COVID-19 therapy contributions in the prior year; good operating performance in our International Healthcare Solutions segment, which helped to offset some of the foreign exchange rate pressure; and a lower share count due to our opportunistic share repurchases during the past year. Our consolidated revenue was $63.5 billion, up 10%, driven by growth in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and offset by a slight decline in our International Healthcare Solutions segment, which was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates and the divestiture of Profarma Specialty in June 2022. On a constant currency basis, consolidated revenue grew 11%. Consolidated gross profit was $2.4 billion, up 6% due to growth in both segments. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.71%, a decline of 13 basis points, due primarily to lower COVID treatment contributions and mix in the quarter. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.4 billion, up 9%, due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses. As expected, our year-over-year operating expense growth rate slowed sequentially from the first quarter. As we have called out previously, in the second half, we will lap the inflationary pressures that began in the prior year March quarter. We will see operating expense growth slow significantly, particularly in the fourth quarter, due in part to incremental expense management actions taken, which put us on track to have a more normal growth rate in the mid-single-digit percent range for the full year. We continue to focus on leveraging our existing capabilities and scale to create efficiencies, while also investing in our talent and growth initiatives to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all our stakeholders. Consolidated operating income was $932 million, an increase of approximately 2% compared to the prior year quarter or up 4% on a constant currency basis. Our operating income growth was driven by solid performance in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which offset currency-related pressures in the International Healthcare Solutions segment. I will discuss more detailed segment-level business drivers when reviewing segment-level results. Moving now to our net interest expense. For the second quarter, net interest expense was $64 million, an increase of 21%, which was anticipated, and we indicated would occur on our February earnings call. For the remainder of the year, we would expect quarterly net interest expense to be similar to this quarter. Turning now to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 19% compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. We expect our effective income tax rate to be towards the lower end of our range of 20% to 21% for the fiscal year with higher tax rates in the next 2 quarters. Turning to diluted share count. Our diluted share count was 204.3 million shares, a 3.6% decrease compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, driven by share repurchases we completed over the last 12 months. Regarding our cash balance and free cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash. In the quarter, we repaid the remaining $675 million of short-term debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition, fulfilling our commitment to the ratings agencies to pay down 2/3 of the acquisition debt within 2 years of closing the acquisition. For the first 6 months of the fiscal year, adjusted free cash flow was $1.1 billion, and we remain on track to achieve our adjusted free cash flow guidance of approximately $2 billion for the fiscal year. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our segment results for the second quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $56.7 billion, up approximately 11% for the quarter, with broad-based growth across our customer base, including sales to our largest customers and sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems. This growth was moderated by a decline in sales of COVID-19 treatments versus the prior year quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased by 3.6% to $756 million, driven by growth in specialty and across our distribution businesses as utilization trends continued to be strong. Additionally, in the quarter, we had good results in our Animal Health business, which is in line with the normalization that we foreshadowed on our February earnings call. As a reminder, the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment is lapping the March 2022 peak quarter for COVID-19 treatment contributions. Taking a step back, if you look at the segment year-to-date, for the 6 months ended in March, U.S. segment operating income was up 5.6% for the first half of 2023 versus the first half of 2022, if you exclude COVID-19 treatment contributions from both periods. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $6.8 billion, down 0.2% on a reported basis or up 12% on a constant currency basis. The as-reported decline reflects the divestiture of Profarma Specialty and unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year quarter. International Healthcare Solutions' operating income was $176 million, down approximately 6% on a reported basis, driven by a decline at Alliance Healthcare due to the effect of foreign currency exchange rates as well as the June 2022 divestiture of Profarma Specialty, which represented 3% of segment level operating income in the prior year quarter.  The decline was offset in part by strong growth at World Courier and the contribution from Pharmalex in the quarter. In the quarter, World Courier continued to perform well as the business saw good trends and demand for international shipments. On a constant currency basis, the International Healthcare Solutions segment delivered 7% operating income growth. That completes the review of our segment level results. I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2023 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. Full details of our fiscal 2023 guidance can be found on pages 8 and 9 of our earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website. Starting with revenue. We are raising our consolidated revenue guidance to a range of 6% to 8% growth to reflect the strong revenue growth we saw in the first half of the year in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and favorable currency movements in the International Healthcare Solutions segment relative to our prior guidance. We now expect revenue growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment to be approximately 7% to 8% or towards the higher end of our previous range of 6% to 8% growth. In the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we are raising our as-reported revenue guidance to a range of a 3% decline to flat, up from our previous expectation, about 1% to 5% decline. Moving to operating income. We are raising our consolidated operating income guidance to a range of 2% to 4% growth from the previous range of 0% to 3% growth to reflect the strong core performance in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. In the second quarter, COVID-19 treatments contributed $0.11 to our consolidated EPS, with about $0.09 in the U.S. and $0.02 in the International segment. COVID treatment contributions in the quarter were slightly higher than our expectations, bringing our total contribution to $0.23 for the first half of the year, and we now expect the contribution from COVID-19 treatment distribution for the full fiscal year to be around $0.30 compared to our previous expectation of $0.25 to $0.30. We expect the small remaining contribution to be in the U.S. segment. On an as-reported basis, we are raising our U.S. segment operating income growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%, up from our prior range of 1% to 4%, to reflect the continued strength and execution of our core business. Given our expectations for the core U.S. business, we are increasing our guidance for U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income growth, excluding COVID, to be in the range of 6% to 8%, an increase from our previous expectation for growth of 5% to 7%. This metric reflects the core performance of our U.S. segment, which represents roughly 80% of our consolidated operating income and helps provide visibility beyond the diminishing transitory contributions from distributing COVID treatments. Finally, we now expect weighted average diluted share count to be approximately 205 million shares, down from our prior expectation of approximately 206 million shares, due to lower-than-anticipated dilution to date. As a result of these updates, we are raising our full year diluted EPS guidance to a range of $11.70 to $11.90, up from our prior range of $11.50 to $11.75, representing growth of 6% to 8% on an as-reported basis or 11% to 13%, excluding COVID-19 treatment contributions. Before I turn to my closing remarks, I would like to provide a brief update on how AmerisourceBergen is working to help advance ESG initiatives across our industry. Recently, we partnered with the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers and IQVIA to develop an industry ESG framework. In this framework, we leveraged our experience reach and relationships to help support pharmaceutical wholesalers aligning on and advancing key ESG initiatives. Through this framework, IFPW members share best practices on key topics, including environmental stewardship, human capital management and health equity. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the IFPW to move this important initiative forward. In closing, AmerisourceBergen has a strong track record of execution and performance. We have delivered strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year, and our updated fiscal 2023 guidance reflects the continued strength and resilience of our business. We are well positioned to continue deploying capital internally and externally to advance our business while being good stewards of shareholder capital. I want to thank our purpose-driven team members and leaders for their strong execution and commitment to efficiency, growth, collaboration and innovation to help create differentiated value for all our stakeholders. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?
Operator:  Our first question today comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa, please go ahead.
Lisa Gill: First, Steve, I want to say congratulations on this OneOncology deal. I think it's a great deal for AmerisourceBergen, but I want to focus my question on an area that we've been writing about. And that's really about the changes in the diabetes and insulin market. Can you remind us how the change or the price cut on insulin will impact you as a drug distributor? And then how do I think about new drug classes like GLP-1s that are substantially more expensive? Are they creating an opportunity? And are you seeing that come through your numbers that we saw that were so strong in the U.S. distribution component?
Steve Collis: Yes. Lisa, and thanks for the question. So let me start off with the insulin pricing. So AmerisourceBergen and our industry will be in the forefront of discussions with manufacturers and stakeholders. The current fee-for-service model obviously is based off the list price or the WAC price, and it provides the transparency for the industry, including manufacturers and distributors. So as these products change the pricing, and we understand that there've probably been no products that are more high profile, that are more important to patient care in terms of the chronic nature of the diabetes condition. And with the high list price and the heavily rebated products, we anticipated that there could be changes. For us, we will try preserve our economics. We do have an ability to negotiate on a fee-for-service basis with the manufacturers. And I think everyone in the industry recognizes that the requirements and the expectations for distributors are becoming even more profound, if you look at the drug security and pedigree changes that are coming into place, the high inventory demands, a much more difficult environment in terms of interest rates. I think our role has never been clearer. I was at NACDS last week, got to meet with all sorts of customers. And we should never take for granted the basic financing, inventory and shipping functions that we do. Those are incredibly important to the health of our customers and our patients. The second part of your question was on the new class of products, sometimes called the GLP-1 drugs, as I noticed the category we're talking about. I think it's just really important for us to follow the prescription dollar. We have done that, whether it's cell and gene therapies or on specialty oncology drugs or ophthalmology drugs. And this category is the class or trade is mainly retail. We're well represented in that class, through both mail-order customers and even more specifically through large customers like Walgreens. So we will keep our market share, which is very impressive, somewhere in north of 30% region on these products. And it's just another example of how innovation in health care and new products are going to help drive AmerisourceBergen's growth and fundamentals. So thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please go ahead, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth Anderson: I guess my question would be just in terms of as we think about the back half of the year, is that the reason that you guys are currently forecasting that you wouldn't see the typical step-up in utilization and sort of revenue growth that you tend to see as you move into the third and the fourth quarter? The reason I asked because given your sort of year-to-date performance, it seems like you guys might be tracking ahead of that. So I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then secondly, can you just talk about sort of any of your early learnings from the PharmaLex acquisition now that had sort of closed, and you guys have had it under -- owned it for a few months now?
Jim Cleary: Yes. Great. I will start off, and I'll talk about the back half of the year, and then I'm sure Steve will want to talk about our positive experience we've had thus far with the PharmaLex acquisition. We -- in our guidance, we're implying strong performance in the back half of the year. And as we talked about during the call, during the prepared remarks, we increased our adjusted operating income guidance in the U.S. ex COVID from a 5% to 7% growth to 6% to 8% growth for the year. And really, what's driving the back half is the same sort of things that drove this recent quarter where we performed very well. We're seeing strong U.S. core growth, particularly ex COVID. We're seeing utilization trends that continue to be strong. We're seeing broad-based growth across our customer base, including sales to our largest customers and sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems. We also saw good results in our Animal Health business this most recent quarter. And so it's those sorts of things that are driving the continued good performance in the second half. We're also -- as we said during the prepared remarks, we're expecting for OpEx growth to slow during the second half. And we're also expecting some better FX in the second half, where it was a headwind in the first half, we're expecting it to be a slight tailwind in the second half. So those are some of the things that are driving the good performance and the increase in guidance. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to talk about PharmaLex.
Steve Collis: Yes. Thank you for the question on PharmaLex. We're very proud of this acquisition. I think it really highlights AmerisourceBergen, a commitment to being in the markets we serve, a global commercialization solutions provider. And we really -- I think the leadership under Bob Mauch, that is really focus on the integration of this acquisition, are doing an outstanding job. Most recently, there were a continuation of the planning meetings with both the U.K. and German teams to incredible markets, important markets for that team. I think just getting to know AmerisourceBergen, getting to know our different offerings, getting to understand what World Courier does and extended does, for example, has been key learnings for their team. And we are impressed with the quality of the teams and their positioning within the channels and are very interested in helping them grow and develop the business. Initially, I think organically and in future, perhaps if you're looking at expansions of both lines of service as well as geographic lines. Just to remind the audience that services that PharmaLex provide fall under four main segments: development, consulting, regulatory affairs, pharmacovigilance, quality management and compliance. These are areas that we think will be critically important to the future of the small and medium companies, of course, the larger companies as well. But as we highlighted in the scripts, we are focused on providing additional services to that category of customers. And that's traditionally where PharmaLex has been highly successful, and we expect to only invest and grow behind that team. And we're just so far, so good. I'm proud of the way that our team has really embraced this acquisition. And I think it's also part of the reason why Cencora is going to be a very good strategic name change for the company as we look to the quarters ahead.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric, please go ahead.
Eric Percher: I wanted to follow up on the question that rent insulin and GLP-1. And my question is a little bit on the give and take. First, on the insulin or any other products that we see lower prices in front of the AMT cap sunset, I know you've got experience with manufacturers in having renegotiated over the last three or four years and earning a fair fee. So I'd love to hear any analogues that you could provide on the ability to ensure that you continue to receive similar economics. And then on the GLP-1s, our understanding is that a lot of the pharmacies are -- tend to be low or no margin products. Do you need to give a little there and to help the independents, in particular, as they see increases in volumes of GLP-1?
Steve Collis: Yes. Thanks for the question, Eric. As we don't really get into individual product economics. I think one of the things that I think has worked for our industry over time is that we really do provide a portfolio of customers. There's no customer that I'm proud of that we're providing one or two single products to. We like to provide all the products. And I think that's also the value proposition we offer to manufacturers is the knowledge that we have of all classes of trade and truly unique to the U.S. market, as you know. And probably to me, one of the strongest fundamental drivers are of the U.S. market. Having said that, our current fee for service, as I said, provides transparency. We have got certain rights in the event that there's a change in economics to negotiate with those manufacturers. And I think these are some of the manufacturers that we work with literally for decades. We're in the first fee-for-service generation of contracts. And I think they understand that our economics need to be strong and solid, and we need to offer good returns to our investors. And so these are respectful discussions with changes in business conditions. We expect we're not new to reimbursement change of affecting market prices. And again, we think that overall, this is a benefit to patients. And at the end of the day, if it's benefiting our constituencies, that will benefit AmerisourceBergen. So I don't have a tremendous amount of concern on any of these themes. Jim, anything you'd add?
Jim Cleary: Steve, I would just emphasize the point that you were making earlier that the value we provide in the supply chain and the services we provide are just highly justifiable.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: So on the international side of the business, can you speak a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of underlying demand trends, underlying utilization across that wholesaling business? And then on World Courier, can you give us an update on fundamental demand to across that customer base? Have you seen any volatility there? And where are we at now in terms of integration across Alliance and its ability to work with the higher growth areas, such as World Courier?
Steve Collis: I can start off, and maybe Jim can add in some trends. I just would say that in Europe, it's been very resilient. There's nothing that I would report as surprising. Of course, Turkey is a big market for Alliance, and that's got a little bit more economic dependencies based on the economy and inflation. But our core European markets are very stable. I'm actually looking forward. I'm going next week to visit a bunch of the countries for the first time and very much looking forward to that trip and learning more. But demand remains solid. As you know, the winter was better than expected in terms of the energy shortfalls and deficits that were anticipated. And our markets have been performing very well. We continue to engage with regulators. For example, in France, we're looking at how do we help with a switch to doing more specialty in pharmacies in the community setting. Those are the sort of initiatives that really get us excited. How to do more at the retail setting and how do we even service some of the hospital settings through changes in manufacturer contracting, et cetera, looking at our logo business, those are key initiatives for us. World Courier is just a tremendously high-performing asset. We continue to, I think, lift the bar on innovation. Literally, I'd say, and I try to be fairly modest then, but I am incredibly proud of the work that our companies do in World Courier, just foremost amongst that. Every time I get on the phone with them, I'm so impressed with the dedication, the professionalism, the innovation mindset. And this was truly the best of an acquisition that we have completed. This week took a very good private company that was well resourced in a way that had a great footprint. And we've just made it, I think, so much better, professionalized management, really invested in the systems. And this is a sort of thesis that drove also, I'd say, our Alliance investments. So we're tremendously proud of the World Courier. And of course, it's been part of AmerisourceBergen for 11 years now. Jim, anything you'd add on pricing trends?
Jim Cleary: Sure. I'll just say that we had very good operational performance internationally during the quarter. Revenue was down 0.2% on an as-reported basis, but up 11.9% on a constant currency basis. And operating income was down 5.9% on an as-reported basis, but up 7.3% on a constant currency basis. And please keep in mind that in this quarter last year, we had Profarma Specialty in the numbers also, which has since been divested, which contributed 3% of the segment operating income last year. As Steve said, one of the key drivers this quarter was performance at World Courier. And we are seeing, as Steve was saying, like good, workings and synergies between World Courier and Alloga at Alliance, and now PharmaLex is getting involved with that, and so there's good opportunities there. And we're also, from an administrative standpoint, seeing good shared services opportunities between the business. And of course, as we've called out before, some very good tax synergies between the businesses as we become a more global company. So thank you for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Charles, please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes. I just wanted to follow up on PharmaLex real quick. You talked about the opportunities to work with small and medium biotech companies. There's been obviously a lot of discussions regarding sort of the biotech funding ideal. Any comments on what you're seeing in the market right now? And what kind of feedback you're receiving from your clients as it relates to this? And then just a follow-up on OneOncology. You mentioned before the potential for value-based contracting. Can you go into that a little bit more? Is that something where you're looking to take risks in certain situations? And how would that look at that?
Steve Collis: Yes, let me quickly do the OneOncology question first because it's -- I appreciate getting that opportunity. Look, we are not -- first of all, they will be an independent business entity. Our point is that we have a lot of experience, particularly through our IR network or managing analytics and helping aggregate data on behalf of members. OneOncology really will take it a step further. And we're saying that the future, the professional and clinical requirements to be in the community and to be serving cancer patients is only going to be increased. The bar is going to be lifted. So investing in this new model, we think, can benefit, of course, OneOncology and the two partners, that's TPG, AmerisourceBergen, but also the physicians who run the business, many of whom we've known for over two decades. These are very successful professional and business people. And we want to help use that expertise to deepen our relationships with community oncologists. So if you think about AmerisourceBergen right now, we have the distribution business. We have the ION business. And potentially, this is a third way for us to be involved and participate in the market. So I would say that. On the biotech and the funding, our business gets really impacted by long-term trends. I am convinced, and I think everyone in the Life Sciences business should be, that there are incredible investment thesis that makes sense for a venture capital and all other forms of capital to invest behind. We're only getting smarter. I think areas like ChatGPT are going to enhance artificial intelligence, are really going to enhance the drug discovery process. It's going to enhance the ability to share information. I think there are trends of cooperation between a lot of the countries that AmerisourceBergen serves that could help also facilitate launching of drugs. And I just think it's a tremendous time to be in this industry. And we've talked a lot on this call about the GLP-1 class of drugs. I mean, could be incredibly promising. Of course, we all know some good stories here about people who've been prediabetic and have been literally -- the clinical pathway has been altered by this. So tremendously excited to be a part of this. And I think AmerisourceBergen is really of the scale, sophistication and knowledge base that we can help truly make a difference in patients' lives, which is part of our purpose. Jim, anything you'd add?
Jim Cleary: I think that covers it, Steve. Thanks.
Steve Collis: Yes. And just one thing. If we look at AmerisourceBergen, a lot of the work we do, even at companies like PharmaLex, it really doesn't start in Phase I and II. It's -- fortunately, we're more in the Phase III side. So I think that's just another point that Bennett wanted me to make. Got to give the investor guy some credit here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Cherny : Jim or Steve, in the press release, you noted how some of the strength in the quarter is from your two largest customers. I guess maybe juxtapose that. Can you give us an update on what you're seeing on the smaller customer side? Where your independents are focused with you? And if at this point in time, given macro worries, if there are any other services that you've either started to provide or other opportunities where you can help and support them as they work to sustain and manage their businesses.
Steve Collis: Go ahead, Jim.
Jim Cleary: Yes. I would say kind of a key thing about the quarter and is just how broad based the results were particularly in the U.S. business. And we called out sales to largest customers, and we provide details on that in the Q. And we did see our two largest customers have quite good growth in sales. We also called out, as we frequently do, increase in sales of specialty products to both physician practices and health systems. But just -- those are just 2 of the things that we called out. I think probably the kind of the key thing on this quarter in the U.S. is just how broad-based it was, and that would include strong performance in independent -- excuse me, independent pharmacies also. And then as I said earlier, a very good quarter in the Animal Health business. And I think Steve has a couple of things he wants to follow up on.
Steve Collis: Yes. I mean it's -- the community pharmacists, it's quite incredible how well they hold up. And I think in a way, that sure in the initial days of COVID, I think there was a trend towards people and may or having more market share. But this marketplace really supports all sorts of pharmacy solutions. Definitely, I think the role of the vaccinations in the pharmacies has been a good example of our pharmacists practicing at the top of their scale. And we continue to see our pharmacy customers gain inroads and preserve their market share. And that, in fact, I think most of our payer customers, when we look at our Elevate Network, recognize that they have an important role to play. We try to get, as we pointed out in the script, community pharmacists to play even a role in looking for clinical trial participants, patients that could participate, particularly in disaffected communities, communities that don't often participate in trials. So it's just an exciting time to do this kind of work. It's an exciting time for our customers. We have our trade show coming up over the summer. And I know that engaging with those folks always just makes us excited about how they're looking at their patients, their communities and what they can do to serve. Also, I would say, our oncology business, which is comprised largely of independent oncology practices, continues to thrive. And I think it will only be strengthened by the continued commitment that we show to the sector. And I think that's the message to our customers on why we're investing in OneOncology as one of the lead investors. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead, Steven.
Steven Valiquette: So I also have just a couple of questions here on OneOncology. I guess, first, just to confirm a couple of things on the structure. I guess it's not clear. Will the new JV with TPG consolidate the total practice revenues generated from the 900 affiliated providers? Or is the revenue in the JV more derived from some sort of adviser fees or just some cut of the practice rate? Just want to get a sense for how much of a true ownership there is of the affiliated providers. And then question two, just thinking about the synergy potential, it wasn't clear. Is ABC currently the primary drug distributor to the majority of the roughly 900 affiliated practices? Or do your competitors have a large -- or a material share of that distribution that under your ownership, you could theoretically shift to yourselves? Just want to get a sense for that, too.
Steve Collis: Yes. OneOncology is technically an MSO, so they get management fees and then they offer some benefits of centralization. They have focused on leading practices across -- either they're in several geographies. And oncology supply has been the lead distributor for almost -- for all the practices. It's possible that some of the practices may not be fully integrated and using one of our competitors. But as you know, if you exclude OneOncology, AmerisourceBergen's share of Immuno-oncology is pretty high. So really would anticipate that as they bring new practices in that we would benefit from that. But no, we are the primary distributor to OneOncology. Jim, add something?
Jim Cleary: Yes, Steve, I'll just follow up. And the deal is structured as a joint venture, and we do not own the practices nor consolidate the revenue, as Steve was saying. And of course, it's a JV between AmerisourceBergen, TPG and OneOncology's affiliated practices and physicians. And upon closing the deal, we'd expect to have an initial ownership stake of approximately 35% in the joint venture with TPG, and the OneOncology practices and physicians owning the remaining 65%. And we currently intend to account for the investment after closing under the equity method of accounting, and our share of the joint venture's income or loss would be recorded in other income and included in our adjusted operating results.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: I'm sure we'll get more details in the Q on this. But apart from the expected normalization what drove Animal Health strength this quarter? And how is companion versus production trending?
Jim Cleary: Yes, it was a good quarter for the Animal Health business. And we signaled three months ago during our earnings call, but that's what we expected as a normalization of the business. And there was 6% revenue growth, and it was a good revenue growth in both companion animal and production animal during the quarter. We feel there probably are still some staffing pressures at that clinics weighing on visits, but we felt good about the 6% growth, and it was comparable growth rates in both companion animal and production animal. And I think importantly, we saw solid trends exiting March.
Steve Collis: Thank you. I will now take the final question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, George.
George Hill: Just a quick one on 340B. There's been a lot of manufacturer pullback in the 340B space. I'm wondering if you guys have seen that impact, either yourselves directly through your relationships with health system providers? Or even though you called out the strength in your largest customers, kind of any impact on your largest customers? And Jim, I thought maybe you might just remind us kind of what percentage of the core drug business is exposed to kind of doctors and health system providers as opposed to pharmacies and other, what we would consider regular way retail locations?
Steve Collis: We don't really comment on it. I mean, obviously, the general trend is that 340B is growing. AmerisourceBergen is growing in our health systems business. It's an important customer segment for us. I think a couple of years ago, we were lagging a bit in market share. We've really been able to enhance the team in the Health System segment of growing with market leaders. We have, I think, good relationships with the hospital GPOs and with other key providers and continue to participate where it makes sense in RFPs. Probably this is a sector where there's more RFPs because of the contractual relationships. And a lot of the hospitals are in the 500 million range in annual volume, which wouldn't be big enough for us to comment on an individual basis, but there's pretty -- every few months, we participate in a large hospital where it makes sense for us to participate. I would say on 340B, we follow the market obviously, some of this historically had hurt some of our Part B car business as it went into health systems. I think we've been very effective at servicing both classes of trade and being objective providers. I think often this channel -- the thoughts of channel conflict can largely be dismissed and objectively by being a fair provider and really being transparent about what your different strategies are. And so we don't really over focus on this and just follow that prescription dollar, and I think that's been the best strategy for us, George. So I see we're a little bit past 9:30. So I just want to say how proud Jim and Bennett and I were to report this quarter. It's a tremendously strong second quarter for AB. I think really enhances the theme of us making the right sort of capital deployments. Our acquisitions that we've made recently continued to track very well. And I think it adds hopefully to our reputation of solid execution and building on our strengths. We are excited to have OneOncology join our family of companies in a way through the investment that we've made. And just in summary, I would say that AmerisourceBergen as a purpose-driven company and future as Cencora is very well positioned for long-term growth, and we'll offer our shareholders a differentiated return. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-02-01 12:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the AmerisourceBergen Q1 FY 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Bruno and I will be operating your call today.  I will now hand over to your host, Mr. Bennett Murphy. Mr. Bennett. Please go ahead.
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's fiscal 2023 first quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. We've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. During the conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income, and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. You will have an opportunity to ask questions after todayâs remarks by management and we ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Today, we will discuss AmerisourceBergen's fiscal 2023 first quarter results, our future under a new unified identity, and our impact from our position at the center of global pharmaceutical innovation and access. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered solid financial results, with revenue of nearly $63 billion, representing 5% growth on a year-over-year basis along with adjusted EPS growth of 5%. These results reflect the resilience of our business as we focus on execution excellence, provided value-added solutions to our customers, and benefited from our strong market position. We also acted on opportunities to utilize our strong balance sheet to employ our value-creating approach to capital allocation. Our business continues to have strong fundamentals as we maintain our focus on providing a differentiated value proposition to our customers and partners up and down the health care value chain. Importantly, our performance underscores the strength of our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, as we leverage our expertise, capabilities and scale to drive our long-term sustainable growth. As we announced last week, our future includes operating under a new unified identity as Cencora. Our new name resonates with customers and team members across geographies, reflects who we are as a purpose-driven organization, and better represents our impact across pharmaceutical care. Cencora also aligns with our growth strategy and long-term vision of building on our leadership in pharmaceutical distribution and growing our high-margin, high-growth businesses. Importantly, while our name will be changing, our purpose and who we are as an organization remains the same. We remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures as we focus on advancing our core business, enhancing our capabilities and growth and innovating to further drive our differentiation. We continue to advance our core business by providing our market-leading customers with a leading distribution network. Throughout our history, we have invested in our infrastructure to ensure that critical medications reach their destinations efficiently, reliably and securely. We also seek to be next-minded in our investments, and we have further enhanced our specialty distribution infrastructure with a new state-of-the-art facility on the West Coast, which we celebrated opening during the quarter. We are now even better positioned to support our customers and partners with the unique logistical needs and by facilitating patient access to their specialty medicines, we promote the continued rapid growth of specialty pharmaceuticals in the market now and in the pipeline for the future. To strengthen our role as the partner of choice for global pharma and biotech companies, we continue to plan for the future of healthcare delivery and enhance our capabilities accordingly. This includes building on our legacy of leadership in specialty medicines to support our customers' growing needs across a broad range of categories. We have recently expanded our portfolio of specialty solutions with the acquisition of PharmaLex, a leading provider of pharmaceutical services ranging from clinical development consulting to market authorization. PharmaLex enhances our capabilities with additional regulatory affairs, development consulting and scientific affairs, pharmacovigilance and quality management and compliance services in both the US and internationally. With these enhancements, the acquisition not only advances our strategic imperative of expanding on our leadership in specialty but also on investing in innovation to further drive our differentiation. With assets such as PharmaLex, our comprehensive portfolio of specialty distribution and commercialization solutions is uniquely positioned to serve pharma and biotechs across the product life cycle, lead specific logistical and market access needs and ultimately deliver the most innovative and promising treatments to the patients who need them. As we continue to support pharmaceutical innovation and access, we are focused on enhancing our differentiation by investing in our business to support our partners in bringing the latest scientific advancements to patients worldwide. In the area of cell and gene therapy, for example, we have many capabilities to serve our customers' current and future needs. This includes our technology-centric partnerships such as our integrated technology platform designed to accelerate patient access to prescribe cell and gene therapies and to deliver complete visibility throughout the treatment journey. This also includes investing in our global specialty logistics capabilities which range from facilitating decentralized clinical trials to providing white glove distribution of the most time- and temperature-sensitive therapies. With capabilities that ensure life-sustaining pharmaceuticals are consistently delivered on schedules at the right temperature and through the most complex situation, we have gained the trust of pharma and biotechs worldwide to be their partner of choice. This trust is built individually partner-by-partner, and behind each success story is the unparalleled dedication and talent of our team members who now include the team from PharmaLex. Our people are the foundation that drives our business forward and I'm humbled every day by the impact we make as we are guided by an unwavering pursuit of our purpose. United in our responsibility to create healthier futures, we embrace our role as a responsible business from a foundation of ethics, integrity, and transparency, we are committed to advancing our environmental, social, and governance initiatives to foster a positive impact on the planet and people while improving access and equity in health care. Last week, we published our seventh annual environmental, social, and governance report, which highlights the progress we made in fiscal 2022. I'm particularly proud of the progress we made to create a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture. In fiscal 2022, we established a center for excellence that oversees governance of DEI, including our DEI Global Counsel and employee resource groups, establish channels through which teams across the organization can better partner, collaborate and consult, and improve the way we measure our progress using a data-driven approach. In a similar fashion, our supplier diversity program has made great progress investing in minority-owned enterprises. I'm impressed by the direct, indirect, and community impacts of our $1.8 billion spend with small and diverse suppliers. Through our program, we have supported more than 11,000 jobs within our supply chain and in suppliers' communities. We remain committed to making a positive impact in our communities. In recent years, our business has been at the forefront of responding to global health care challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic and the mpox public health emergency. From these experiences, we have strengthened our public and private relationships and further evolved our capabilities to increase our agility and resiliency. We are well-positioned to solve for potential future challenges, in particular, those that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations due to our footprint, reach, and strong relationships with governments, manufacturers, providers, and community organizations. One significant global health issue that we are helping to address is antimicrobial resistance, which the World Health Organization, the US government, and the European Commission have each initiated action plans around. We recently led a call to action for health care distributors in partnership with GIRP, the umbrella organization for full-service health care distributors in Europe to explore public and private multi-sector collaborative efforts to drive a global response. ESG has become increasingly important to our stakeholders and to hold ourselves accountable to making progress in areas that further our business objectives and reinforce our ESG priorities. We are incorporating an ESG metric within our executive compensation program for fiscal 2023. Designed based on feedback we have collected, our ESG metrics includes three quantifiable components focused on business resiliency planning for climate-driven events, female representation in leadership roles globally and employee inclusion and engagement. As we continue to think about what the future holds for public health, pharmaceutical innovation, care delivery and more, we are also constantly evaluating our leadership to ensure that we have the right team driving our future success. This includes the individuals guiding our organization from the top and we are pleased to have welcomed Dr. Redonda Miller to our Board of Directors in January. The addition of Dr. Miller, who is President of Johns Hopkins Hospital, further illustrates our focus on adding key skill sets and diverse perspectives to help support our business strategy and delivering on our purpose. We also want to offer our sincere thanks and appreciation to Dr. Jane Haney and Mike Long for their meritorious service. Their advice, wisdom and counsel have helped shape the AmerisourceBergen of today. Looking forward to the rest of the year and beyond, we are powered by the resilience of our business and remain confident that our pharmaceutical-centric strategy will deliver long-term sustainable growth by enabling us to capture exciting opportunities in pharmaceutical innovation. We have a strong foundation in place, and our high margin, high-growth services reinforce the differentiated value we provide to our partners and customers, which in turn strengthens our relationships and bolsters our position at the center of global pharmaceutical innovation and access. As we continue to advance our foundation, enhance our capabilities and invest in innovation to further drive our differentiation, we remain purpose-driven and well-positioned to create significant shareholder value. Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our first quarter results and our updated guidance. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Thanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn to our results, I want to join Steve in expressing my excitement on our recent announcement that we intend to change our name to Cencora in the second half of calendar 2023. By becoming Cencora, we will be able to better connect with our team members, customers and other stakeholders on a unified basis across our footprint, and Cencora will better represent our role and impact as a leading healthcare solutions organization supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access. Now turning to our first quarter results, and as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. AmerisourceBergen delivered solid results in our first quarter that were mostly in line with our expectations. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.71, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Adjusted EPS benefited from a lower share count as a result of our recent opportunistic share repurchases, and strong fundamentals in our business helped offset previously anticipated elevated expenses in the quarter. Our consolidated revenue was $62.8 billion up 5% driven by growth in our US Healthcare Solutions segment, which was offset by foreign currency pressure on the translation of our sales in the International Healthcare Solutions segment. While the US dollar weakened from the historically strong levels seen in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the year-over-year comparison still created a headwind as expected, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing segment level results. Consolidated gross profit was $2. 1 billion, up 5% due to growth in the US Healthcare Solutions segment. While each segment had better gross profit margins relative to the prior year quarter, consolidated gross profit margin was flat year-over-year as the foreign exchange impact on the higher-margin International Healthcare Solutions segment was a drag on margin growth at the consolidated level. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.4 billion, up 9.8% due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses to support revenue growth and reflecting inflationary impacts on certain operating expenses. As I called out on our November earnings call, we did not begin to see inflationary pressures in our business until towards the end of the March 2022 quarter. The higher expense growth rate in this year's first quarter was driven by a tougher comparison versus the prior year period. We expect the operating expense growth rate to decline sequentially in the subsequent quarters and to become a more normalized rate for the full year. Consolidated operating income was $734 million, a decrease of approximately 2% compared to the prior year quarter or up 4% on a constant currency basis. The as-reported decline was driven primarily by the impact of foreign currency translation for the International Healthcare Solutions segment, and was partially offset by growth in the US Healthcare Solutions segment, which I'll discuss in more detail when I review segment level results. Moving now to our net interest expense for the first quarter, net interest expense was $46 million, down approximately 14% due to higher interest income resulting from higher cash balances and interest rates on investments. Looking ahead, our average cash balances will be lower following the opportunistic share repurchases we announced in the quarter, the successful early completion of the PharmaLex acquisition, and the upcoming March 2023 debt repayment. Our lower invested cash balances will drive our net interest expense higher in the coming quarters and result in higher interest expense versus fiscal 2022, as I called out in November. Turning now to income taxes, our effective income tax rate was 19.1% compared to 21.2% in the prior year quarter. The lower tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations and we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 20% to 21%. Our diluted share count was 206.3 million shares, a 2.3% decline compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, driven by opportunistic share repurchases over the past several months, including $700 million of repurchases completed in November and December. Regarding our cash balance, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash due to the timing of holidays around the PharmaLex acquisition closed at the beginning of January. We prefunded the acquisition on December 29, which resulted in a prepaid asset on our balance sheet and lower cash balance when we closed the quarter. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $584 million, and we remain on track to achieve our adjusted free cash flow guidance of approximately $2 billion for the fiscal year. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our segment results for the first quarter. US Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $56.2 billion, up approximately 6% for the quarter as we continued to see strong specialty sales and broad based solid growth in our human health distribution businesses. US Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased by approximately 1% to $572 million. Sales to specialty physicians and health systems were once again strong in the quarter as our leadership in specialty continue to position us well to deliver growth including in biosimilars, where we are seeing good trends in oncology and more recently, ophthalmology. The strength in specialty and broad-based good utilization trends in human health distribution helped to offset the previously anticipated higher operating expenses, as well as softness in the animal health market. As has been widely discussed in the animal health industry, there are short-term pressures in both the companion and production animal markets. From a cadence perspective, however, some of the softness in our animal health business in the quarter is related to timing and will normalize in the second quarter. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $6.6 billion, down 0.6% on a reported basis or up 17.7% on a constant currency basis. The as reported decline was driven by the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue for Alliance Healthcare as the business is more exposed to currency fluctuations. International Healthcare Solutions operating income was $161 million, down approximately 10% on a reported basis, driven by the impact of foreign currency translation on income for Alliance Healthcare and the divestiture of ProPharma Specialty, which represented approximately 3% of segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. When looking at the segment on a constant currency basis, it delivered 11% operating income growth driven by solid underlying fundamentals and favorable manufacturer price adjustments this quarter in one of our developing market countries. From a cadence perspective last year, this price adjustment occurred in our second fiscal quarter. This price adjustment activity offset the negative impact of the decline in the value of the local currency. That completes the review of our segment level results. I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2023 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. Full details of our fiscal 2023 guidance can be found on Pages 8 and 9 of our earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website. I'll begin with EPS. We are raising our full year diluted EPS guidance to a range of $11.50 to $11.75 up from our prior range of $11.30 to $11.60, representing growth of 4% to 7% on an as reported basis, or 6% to 9% on a constant currency basis. Our increased EPS guidance range is primarily a result of our opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter, which results in our updated guidance on full year diluted average share count. We now expect our share count to be approximately 206 million shares, down from our previous range of 207 million to 209 million shares. Our increased EPS guidance range is also a result of the higher as-reported operating income and international health care solutions, partially offset by the reduced contribution from COVID in the US. Next, I would like to provide a brief update on COVID-19 treatment distribution contributions. In the first quarter, COVID-19 treatments contributed $0.12 to our consolidated EPS compared to $0.14 in the first quarter of last year, with about $0.09 in the US and $0.03 in our international segment. Given trends we have seen to-date, we now expect the full year contribution from COVID-19 treatment distribution to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.30, down from our previous range of $0.30 to $0.35 that we provided in November. For the rest of the year, the majority of the expected COVID contribution is in the US segment with just a few more pennies of contribution expected in the International segment for the year. To reflect the lower expected contribution from COVID treatment distribution, we are lowering the bottom end of our US healthcare solutions as reported operating income guidance. We now expect the segment to deliver as reported growth in the range of 1% to 4% growth widened from the prior range of 2% to 4% growth. Our guidance for the US Healthcare Solutions segment excluding COVID contributions remains unchanged at 5% to 7% growth in fiscal 2023. Now moving to the International Healthcare Solutions updated segment-level operating income assumptions. We are raising our as-reported operating income guidance for the International Healthcare Solutions segment to a range of a decline of 3% to growth of 1% from our previous range of a decline of 7% to a decline of 3%, driven by the general weakening of the US dollar and the incremental contribution from PharmaLex. The accretive and strategic deal is another example of how we create incremental value through capital deployment, and we are excited to welcome the PharmaLex team to AmerisourceBergen. PharmaLex's leading solutions built upon our existing capabilities and will allow us to deepen our partnerships with pharma manufacturers as we provide support throughout the cycle from clinical development to regulatory support and access strategies to providing logistics services. For additional operating income guidance measures for the International Healthcare Solutions segment, I would refer you to our investor presentation deck. These guidance measures also were increased driven by the general weakening of the US dollar and the incremental contribution from PharmaLex. In summary, regarding the updates we have made to guidance, there is no change in our guidance for as-reported consolidated adjusted operating income. And we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year, all while lowering our expectations for COVID contributions. Before I turn to my closing remarks, I would like to briefly discuss a few highlights about how we are working to ensure a resilient supply chain and mitigate our impact on climate change. As a crucial member of the global pharmaceutical supply chain, we play a key role in ensuring the safe and reliable supply of medications. We take this role seriously and have robust plans and teams in place to support supply chain resiliency. In fiscal 2022, we advance these efforts and expanded the scope of our physical risk assessment process to reflect our expanded footprint since we last conducted a physical risk assessment in 2020. In 2022, we included nearly 400 sites across 24 countries, up from 100 sites. The updated assessment will inform our business continuity planning process to help ensure the continuity of supply in the event of extreme weather or natural disasters. While we prepare for and adapt our business to address the impacts of a change in climate, we continue to look at ways we can reduce our carbon footprint and be good environmental stewards. As part of these efforts, in May 2022, we submitted a near-term target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to the science-based targets initiative for validation. In January, we learned the science-based targets initiative approved our near-term science-based emissions reduction target. In addition to the items Steve and I have discussed today, our recently published ESG report contains additional information on how we are living our purpose and creating healthier futures through our ESG initiatives. The report aligns with a number of leading ESG reporting standards and frameworks and key data points have been externally assured. I would encourage you to review the report's entirety on its dedicated microsite at esg.amerisourcebergen.com. In closing, our updated fiscal 2023 guidance reflects our continued strategic use of capital to create value for our stakeholders through a combination of returning capital to shareholders and investing in our business to further our value proposition for our partners. Powered by the continued resilience and growth of our business. As we progress through 2023, we remain focused on executing on our long-term strategy, and through our foundation and pharmaceutical distribution and complementary higher-margin, high-growth businesses, we are well positioned to create long-term sustainable growth. Now I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?
Operator:  Our first question is from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Elizabeth, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks very much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk about PharmaLex a little bit more. Obviously, that was nice to see the transaction closed early. And now that you've had it for a whole month, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what some of the early wins are in terms of from like a client perspective and sort of what they're most interested in, and what are some of the things that have been new to you since fully taking ownership of the asset.
Steve Collis: Hi. Good morning, Elizabeth, and thanks for the question. Maybe I could just start with some general comments about our approach to capital deployment. Literally, there's nothing this management team takes more seriously other than our reputation and capital deployment. It's our key opportunity, and we want to make sure that we leverage all the available dollars we have. Having said that, PharmaLex is a continuation of AmerisourceBergen's strategy of investing to further our leadership in specialty distribution and services. Our portfolio has literally been built through decades of significant organic and inorganic strategic investments, including this recently completed acquisition. This is complementary to our US existing manufacturer services platform, and also, you will recall that when we bought the Alliance business, we focused on their value-added services businesses, and in fact, pointed out that they had a higher percentage of the operating income coming from those services. So, we feel that this significantly enhances our international capabilities. AmerisourceBergen is focused on growing our higher-margin, higher-growth businesses. And particularly, we've identified this area as a robust area for us. Our goal is in the long term to be the first stop for any services that manufacturers would like to deploy our businesses like PharmaLex and AmerisourceBergen for. Let me also just say that I was literally two weeks ago with the PharmaLex management team. We've had some calls before, it was a pleasure to meet them in person. I've been very impressed with the approach that Bob Mauch and his leadership team have taken with this integration and with the merging of PharmaLex into our existing businesses. And I'm very excited about the opportunities ahead for this acquisition. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open, please go ahead.
Michael Cherny: Perfect. Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe if we can dive into the US segment for a bit. There's a number of moving pieces embedded within your reiterated 5% to 7% ex-COVID EBIT growth. You talked about some of the OpEx pressure you have that's annualizing over the course of the year versus last year. You talked about some of the variability in animal health. Along the other side, what's allowing you to drive forward with hitting that robust growth metrics, thinking through where some of the potential upside variability may be in volume versus price versus mix? Just curious to dig a little bit more into some of the good stuff there that's putting you basically within the general range that you would typically have as part of your long-term guidance from last year's Analyst Day?
Jim Cleary: Yes. Thank you, Michael, for asking that question and I think really kind of a key point and a key takeaway is that we really have continued strong performance in our US business and strong performance in specialty and broadly across human health distribution, and we're seeing continued strong utilization trends. And so that's true in the US, and it's really true at Alliance also where we saw international strong performance and utilization trends during the quarter. I called out in my prepared remarks as you referenced that COVID came in below our expectations during the quarter. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we had a softer quarter for animal health and higher OpEx growth rate during the quarter, but we expect that to normalize for the full year. And really kind of, I think, the key takeaway is just strong performance and execution both in specialty and broadly across human health distribution, and that's kind of evidenced in our maintaining that guidance rate, excluding COVID of 5% to 7% in the US segment. And as reported, excluding COVID, on a consolidated basis, improving our adjusted operating income guidance from 3% to 5% to 4% to 6%.
Operator: Our next question is from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Erin, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great. Thank you. Can you speak a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of underlying utilization trends in that international wholesaling business? And have there been any surprises in the most recent quarter that we should be aware of, and how should we be thinking about the quarterly cadence for the balance of the year there? And just more broadly, kind of on international, in the next five years or so, does your international segment and footprint and integration across that business look vastly different to you? And just with the name change and just thinking about how you think about the contribution of international over the next five years or so. Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Yes, I'll start with some to the question, Erin, and then I'm sure Steve will want to comment also. So in the international business, we're seeing good utilization trends and performance. Alliance had another strong quarter. If we look at our guidance update that we've done in the International segment, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, on an as-reported basis, we increased our guidance by 4 percentage points at the low end of the range, and 4 percentage points at the high end of the range. And that's essentially evenly split by the impact of FX since the dollar has generally weakened since we put out guidance and also the early close of PharmaLex. And so each of those things is worth about 2 percentage points. But overall, in terms of the execution of the business, or I should say the performance of the business, we're seeing really good execution by the management team and a good utilization trends. The one thing I'll comment on, and I did mention this in the prepared remarks, is there was a price increase in a developing market that happened in the first quarter of this fiscal year that happened in the second quarter of last fiscal year. So that will impact the cadence just a bit. Steve?
Steve Collis: Yes, thanks, Erin. I think AmerisourceBergen is very is very consistently facing -- is trying to really be squarely in the prescription drug market, our services and distribution are anchored around the prescription market. I've been impressed with Alliance. It's now our seventh quarter reporting them, and they've been very resilient. We have strong market positions in almost every country we're in. and where we've had to, we've complemented it. Some of the smaller markets, for example, Norway and Netherlands, we're in retail. We've also got a very strong Alloga business, which was one of the most interesting aspects of this integration and acquisition for us. We're aligning that very closely with our ICS business, which is being more closely aligned with World Courier in the past historically and is focused on the more complex therapies. And Alliance Alloga business has a very strong basis in core pharmaceutical products. So I'm also excited about what PharmaLex is going to bring to the equation. We have about 2,500 team members that we've added with PharmaLex and about 800 of them have PhD equivalent degrees. I go back to my experience and a lot smaller scale, but when we acquired Xcenda when I was at the specialty group, the uplift in talent and intellectual thought around the manufacturer was so important to the development of the specialty group, and I think that PharmaLex can be analogous to our European and international business growth. So, we're -- I think we're just are very well-positioned. I like what this acquisition is going to bring to us. And Jim just has one more comment I'd like to make.
Jim Cleary: Yes, thanks. Just one thing I do want to say, Erin, thanks very much for the question on international, I do want to say, of course, as you look at our business overall, our operating income mix is about 80% in the US and 20% international.
Steve Collis: Thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question next from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Eric, your line is now open, please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. A question on US health care, I see you pretty consistently called out specialty to physician practices as a growth driver. And I noticed the last quarter or two, we haven't seen mail called out, recognizing it could be reading too much into the -- a few words here. But I'm curious, is there any change to distribution activity or self-distribution for the largest mail and specialty clients, and I know there's been some discussion that we could see biosimilar source directly as we see larger volumes in the pharmacy benefit. Any thoughts on those trends?
Steve Collis: So, Eric, thanks for the question. No, we -- AmerisourceBergen is focused on following the prescription dollar -- so we have a broad segment of our customers, and I think it's well known that Express Scripts Cigna is our lead customer in that area. They are a fast-growing customer and we're not going to comment too specifically on them. But some of the customers do source Part D, more specifically Part D products directly and we'll see that, that trend could continue. But it's just really one segment of our portfolio of customers, and we're happy with the relationship. We want to do the best job we can as a distributor for them. And the needs of large complex customers like Express Scripts are very different than the needs of some of our smaller customers that tend to use our services more readily. So, probably that's all on that. Jim, anything you'd add?
Jim Cleary: I think that covers it. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Charles, your line is now open, please go ahead.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned before opportunistic share repurchases over the last few months. Can you talk about sort of what the capacity you have to continue to do that if, for example, Walgreens was to continue to take down its stake in the company, can you kind of give us a sense for sort of where you are in terms of that?
Jim Cleary: Yes. We obviously, we feel very good about the opportunistic share repurchases we've done over the past several months. And as you know, we've successfully collaborated with Walgreens on their two latest sales, repurchasing about $700 million in shares in conjunction with those sales. And we view these as a good opportunity to repurchase shares. And we continue to maintain a collaborative relationship with WBA. And we would expect to work together on any future plan sales, including potentially repurchasing shares. And that's as a result of our very strong financial position, which continues, of course, and our focus on opportunistic share repurchases. And so if they do decide to sell additional shares, we would view it as an opportunity to repurchase.
Operator: Our next question is from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. George, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions. Jim, I'm going to take a shot at kind of two numbers related questions. I guess number one is with the closing of PharmaLex, can you say whether or not manufacturer services is now greater than 50% of gross profits in the International segment? And my brief follow-up would be is that if we look at the macro level, specialty drugs are now approaching 50% of kind of total sales in the Pharmaceutical segment. Is it safe to assume that, that mix is kind of reflective of ABC's US drug sales mix as well? Thank you.
Jim Cleary: Yes, and so there was a lot there, and we specifically do not break out the percentage of manufacturer services. But I will say that those sorts of services are a really important part of our international business, just like they are in the US business. And I think one kind of key thing to call out is you'll note that our operating margin is significantly higher in the International segment than it is in the US segment. And the reason for that is those higher-margin services businesses are a higher percentage of sales in our international segment than they are in the US segment. And they're driven historically by things like World Courier, of course. But Alloga also, which is Alliance's very successful 3PL business and some of alliances services business. And now it's an even greater percentage of the business given the exciting acquisition of PharmaLex. And so that's just a little bit of commentary on the international market. And you asked about specialty products. In some cases, a number of the specialty products in the international market are 3PL. And so I think you also asked about the US business. And of course, specialty continues to be a driver for us in the US market, as you know, very well. And we're a leader in the specialty business, both for physician practices and for non-physician parts of the business, and it's really kind of a leading part of our legacy businesses that Steve started many years ago and a super important part of our future through our key partnerships.
George Hill: Thatâs helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Steven, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Steve Collis: Steve, are you there?
Operator: Steven, your line is now open. You can proceed with your questionâ¦.
Steve Collis: All right, we'll go to the next question then Bruno.
Operator: No Problem. Our next question is from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Eric, your line is now open, please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks very much. Two, if I might, and they're both somewhat related in terms of when you first outlined the guardrails on fiscal 2023 outlook versus the updates today. First one, HUMIRA. I know pound-for-pound, it's not as important as certain other drugs due to the channel of administration. But have your views changed at all now that we have front and center, we have the launch here? Have you had any change in perspective on the dynamics of that particularly large biosimilar in the market? And then second and somewhat correlated on the guidance timing through the last seven, eight months, whatever it is, the corporate name change in rebranding, maybe a bit of a silly question, but there will be some expenses associated with that absorbed in guidance or is it incremental? I guess, when you first laid out the guardrails on fiscal 2023, were you assuming some expenses here or is this a newer topic that you've just subsequently absorbed? And if you could quantify that impact on the expense and capitalization side, it might be interesting? Thanks so much.
Steve Collis: Thanks. Good to hear from you Eric. So, I'll start off. Obviously, we've talked about this for a while, and it seems like it was never going to be here. But of course, our first biosimilar HUMIRA launched this week, and it's an important drug for the US health system, by some measures, the largest drug in history. And the introduction is going to be an important creator of headroom for the new innovative therapies that AmerisourceBergen is so well-positioned to serve our stakeholders in. So, that's important. The first -- so we're interested to see how the trends go. And again, in July, we'll see some more entrants, and some of them have different clinical aspects to them as you well know. But we've said consistently that Part B is our sweet spot. This is very much a Part D drug, and it will be incrementally better for us in margins, but it's mostly mail order. And as was pointed out previously, some of our Express Scripts, for example, and other customers in that category could be ordering directly, and they have limited locations, and it's a much easier distribution function for manufacturers to fill. So, not -- it won't change our guidance or anything too much, but it is a very serious milestone in biosimilars, and we'll look to see how the market absorbs this product. Jim, anything on the other guidance aspects?
Jim Cleary: Yes, Eric had asked about the name change and some of the costs and whatnot related to the name change. And Eric, we aren't going to get into a lot of specifics at this time, but I will say that the spend will be spread out over the next three years, and it really happens in three phases. The first is planning and preparation, the second is launch, and the third is ongoing brand migration and a majority of these costs will be GAAP only as they are nonrecurring in nature. And then a portion of the cost will be capitalized and depreciated over time and recorded against our adjusted non-GAAP results. I'll also comment that with regard to amortization of some of our existing trade names, there will be an increase in amortization expense, and it will be recorded and disclosed beginning in our March quarter and as a reminder, amortization expense relating to trade names is accounted for as a GAAP-only expense and is not included in our adjusted results.
Operator: Our next question is from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Steven, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me back in here. Just a general question around Europe. There's been some chatter in the marketplace about the possibility of expansion, the ability for entities in certain European countries to be able to potentially source drug inventory from other external European countries that may lead to lower drug costs. I guess I'm just curious if you have any high-level thoughts around this and at least maybe directionally, maybe talk about how this could impact your international operations. Thanks.
Steve Collis: Yes, so not a key area of focus for us. There is definitely a parallel trade market in Europe, which is actually highly regulated. But I haven't heard that there's any intention. This is not something we focus on. I haven't heard that there's any intention to expand that. And we really don't have much further insight on that. Jim, do you agree?
Jim Cleary: Yes. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Brian, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning. Just a quick question. Steve, how are you thinking about macro in the US? It looks like the US business is holding up pretty well, but as I think about your guidance for the year, how should we be thinking about the assumptions you've baked in, in terms of the expected hitting of the recession sometime in the middle of this year? Thanks.
Steve Collis: Yes, we, AmerisourceBergen, I think if we prove one thing, and our industry, in fact, has proved that we are pretty resilient. And what's important to us is that our -- the patients that we ultimately serve are able to access products. And the payer systems, both the commercial and government systems, continue to work very well. And I think I've told the story many times and in 2009, which is my first year running the full-on drug wholesale business in that time, and of course, the whole world was melting down. And we had less than $4 million or $5 million in bad debt. So but key for all of our businesses, whether it's Europe or US, is continued patient access to care. And in many cases, we are working with single-payer systems. But I just want to stress that one of the beauties about AmerisourceBergen is we go through many cycles, but the core and the specialty businesses and the manufacturer services we provide are so fundamental to the health systems. And then we are also very good at adapting to whatever changes we need to make. So I would say COVID is an extremely applicable application of that. We really were able to adjust so many of our businesses to go virtual and really had one month of disruption, I would say, because of just so much of the economy moving inside. But other than that, I have to say that AmerisourceBergen has proven through all sorts of cycles that we are very resilient and carry on producing earnings and cash flow, which is very important. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Well, Steve, I would just echo that. From my perspective, it's just one of the â just one of the wonderful things about our company and our industry is our proven resilience.
Steve Collis: Well, that wraps it up for today. And Jim, thank you for ending on that keyword, resilience. I would say that we had an excellent quarter, and I'm excited about the Cencora name change. And whether we're talking about AmerisourceBergen or in the future Cencora, we are highly differentiated and well-positioned for long-term growth anchored in our core distribution and specialty services and also with our very high potential customer base. And we'll continue to benefit from growth in the pharmaceutical market, driven by patient demographics, prescription utilization trends, and continued innovation. Thank you for your time today. It's been a pleasure spending this last hour with you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-11-03 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the AmerisourceBergen Q4 FY 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Glenn, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Bennett Murphy, to begin. Please go ahead. 
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's Fiscal 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO.
 On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. We have posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website.
 During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be broadcasted without the express permission of the company. You have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the over to Steve. 
Steven Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Today, my remarks will focus on the successes about 2022 fiscal year and the ways in which our leading distribution and pharmaceutical solution capabilities are core to advancing global pharmaceutical innovation and access, ultimately driving significant value creation for all our stakeholders.
 AmerisourceBergen delivered another strong fiscal year, driven by the resilience and strength of our business as our team continue to execute to advance our strategic priorities and build on our foundation for future growth. First, we leveraged the strength of our leading pharmaceutical distribution businesses. During fiscal 2022, we were proud to continue to support the continued global response to the COVID-19 pandemic as the exclusive distributor of emergency use authorization treatments in the U.S. and by supporting the distribution of vaccines and test kits internationally.
 Guided by our purpose, and empowered by our commercial strengths and execution, we played an important role in supporting public health. This also presented an opportunity to enhance relationships with key stakeholders worldwide, including governments, public health agencies, and providers and pharmacies. Importantly, we also continue to support our community provider customers from pharmacies to physicians to veterinarians all of whom are integral to ensuring patient access and care in our communities around the world.
 Second, we solidified our global capabilities to further enhance our customer experience. In the nearly 18 months since our acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, we have continued to integrate the business and facilitate collaboration across teams. As we look forward to the next phase of our integration, we are focused on streamlining our solutions under one commercial leader. Group President, Bob Mauch, will now also oversee Alliance Healthcare and assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer. By uniting and simplifying our commercial operations, we will engage with our partners as a truly integrated healthcare solutions leader, fortifying our position at the core of the global pharmaceutical supply chain.
 Third, we advanced our legacy of responsible corporate stewardship with our ESG commitments, engagement and reporting, including further aligning our ESG work with recognized international standards, frameworks and initiatives. One important area where we continue to evolve our programs and policies is in diversity, equity and inclusion. And as a sign of progress, I'm pleased to say that our most recent gender pay data in the United States indicates that for every dollar male employees are paid, female employees in AmerisourceBergen are paid [ $0.998], an increase from our previous ratio of [ $0.994 ].
 Furthermore, to extend our work in DEI, we are making important investments to support health equity in our communities. These efforts include our disparities in cancer care task force, which is focused on addressing disparities and analyzing social determinants of health for oncology patients at the community level. In August, we held our first ever disparities in Cancer Care Summit, where we brought together researchers, community physicians, patient advocates, payers and healthcare leaders to collaborate and share information. By uniting thought leaders and industry leaders, we hope to stimulate, innovative partnerships that will address the disparities in cancer care today.
 We are also focused on supporting our people. Based on feedback, we have solicited from our team members, we have evolved our workforce policies to address post-pandemic labor trends, reinforce the strength of our culture, investing in our talent and aligned their development with our goal for the business. We recognize that our people are our most important asset and that's the strength of our performance, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team members around the globe.
 With purpose-driven dedication, commitment and expertise, our teams are executing against our strategic pillars to maintain a leading share of pharmaceutical distribution and best-in-class efficiency while growing our higher-margin and higher-growth businesses.
 Looking to the year ahead and beyond, we have strong momentum, and the importance of pharmaceutical care and the opportunities provided by continued pharmaceutical innovation bolster our strategy and fortify our ability to create additional stakeholder value. To advance our foundational pharmaceutical distribution business, we lead with market leaders around the world. It's no coincidence that customers are our first strategic pillar because they are at the center of everything we do. Our key anchor customers range from upstream emerging biotechs and large pharma manufacturers to downstream providers across the spectrum of care delivery, including physicians, community and specialty pharmacies, health systems, veterinarians and government agencies. We form long-term strategic partnerships to solve for the current and future needs of our customers. And with our expanded footprint and capabilities, we are now able to partner with them on a truly global scale.  
 This includes supporting them with a technologically advanced standard setting infrastructure. For a distributor, maintaining infrastructure is table stakes, and we are proud that our historical investments have enabled us to be a leader in adopting new technologies and innovations to fulfill our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.
 In particular, our footprint efficiency and capabilities in data and analytics have enabled us to support the COVID-19 pandemic response globally. Today, we are proud to be supporting the response to monkeypox, and we stand readily to facilitate patient access to life-changing and life-sustaining medication to advance public health around the world.  
 To ensure future readiness, AmerisourceBergen is enhancing our capabilities to grow our higher-margin, higher-growth businesses to support the rapidly evolving and global nature of pharmaceutical innovation, at the center of which is specialty medical care. Our team members, customers, suppliers and investors have known and appreciated AmerisourceBergen as the leader in specialty. Our specialty business is nearly 30 years old, and the tremendous investments we've made in our specialty capabilities have helped build us into the leader we are today and have laid a strong foundation for us to lead in the specialty of the future.
 Cell and gene therapies, for example, is one area with a combination of scientific breakthroughs, regulatory support and industry developments by accelerating product pipelines and patient access. To support this cutting-edge innovation in patient care, we deploy our broad and expanding platform of capabilities in distribution, commercialization and specialty logistics. This includes assets such as World Courier, Alloga and Innomar, which we are able to leverage to provide pharma manufacturers with the expertise needed to solve their most complex problems now and plan for the solutions of tomorrow.
 Specialty medicines play a key role in future pharmaceutical innovation. And with our continued innovation and investments, we further strengthened our leadership and capture this growth opportunity. AmerisourceBergen is also well positioned to benefit from high and increasing demand for outsourced manufacture consulting and logistics services as we solidify our role as partner of choice for global pharmaceutical manufacturers.
 Through our various investments and partnerships, we offer a differentiated portfolio of commercialization solutions to support pharmaceutical innovation. Our recently announced acquisition of PharmaLex, for example, enhances our portfolio of solutions across our footprint and represents our ability to support clients at every stage of the commercialization journey from providing market access strategies and early-stage clinical development consulting services to leveraging our pharmaceutical distribution reach and specialty distribution leadership to bring innovative products to market.
 We are differentiating and getting closer to our pharma partners by expanding our solution set, advancing our core capabilities and leveraging our existing commercial strength, ultimately contributing to positive pharmaceutical outcomes.
 We further drive our differentiation by investing in innovation to both advance our foundation and enhance our capabilities. Our investment strategy prioritizes continually improving and building on our strengths, supporting customer needs and ensuring our continued leadership in core capabilities such as supply chain excellence, clinical practice efficiency and patient access and adherence. We are also next-minded and focused on areas where we see trends leading to future growth such as clinical trial service, digital commerce and home health.
 In clinical trial services, for example, we continue to play a leading role with direct-to-patient capabilities, helping our customers manage complexities as they increasingly adopt decentralized and hybrid models. Through this capability, we leverage our capabilities and reach to support pharmaceutical innovation and facilitate patient access. And to create the next generation of solutions to power our success long into the future, we continuously innovate through a combination of internal investments, capability building, strategic partnerships and venture capital.
 We remain committed to creating differentiated value for our stakeholders. Our long-term sustainable growth is supported by investments in our people and culture and our commitment to ESG. Our people drive our business forward, and we are committed to investing in and supporting them with a culture that unites, cultivate and empower them. Underpinned by our purpose and guiding principles, we are advancing our talent and culture to support our strategy and innovation to create an energized, diverse and inclusive workplace that helps our talent be action-biased, credibly resourceful and next-minded.
 Our business is supported by the right people, including at the top of the organization. We recently had the pleasure of welcoming to our Board of Directors, Dr. Lorence Kim, whose business acumen and knowledge of healthcare and pharmaceutical innovation, will serve AmerisourceBergen well in his new capacity as an independent Director.
 We are focused on adding key skill sets and diverse perspectives to help support our business and strategy as we continue our process of Board succession planning. Just as we invest in our people, we also invest in our communities, which have grown in scale and geography. With this in mind, we continue to evolve our environmental, social and governance initiatives to create healthier futures around the world, which includes adapting to a change in climate, promoting health equity and embracing a culture of transparency, ethics and integrity. We take very seriously our leading role in healthcare, and we are committed to being a sustainable and responsible business.
 We are pleased with the progress we are making towards our long-term vision of expanding our leadership in pharmaceutical distribution and growing our higher-margin, higher-growth businesses. We have the right strategy in place to do so. By advancing our foundation, enhancing our capabilities and investing in innovation to further drive our differentiation, we are solidifying our position at the core of global pharmaceutical innovation and access.
 Our leadership and growth are further supported by our strong financial foundation and value-enhancing capital allocation strategy, which Jim will discuss shortly. Just as importantly, we live our purposes of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures with a focus on creating a better future for all of our stakeholders.
 Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results and to discuss our expectations for fiscal 2023. Jim? 
James Cleary: Thanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Reflecting on fiscal 2022, I am proud of the strong execution and performance by our teams as we advanced our company commercially and strategically, playing our central role in connecting pharma manufacturers with providers and patients as a leading healthcare solutions provider.
 Throughout the year, our teams navigated exceptionally well through a complex environment to ensure the delivery of crucial medications and services around the globe.  
 Before I turn to our results, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year September quarter and fiscal year. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release.
 Beginning with our fourth quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.60, an increase of 8.8%, which was driven by strong performance in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. Our consolidated revenue was $61.2 billion, up approximately 4%, driven by growth in our U.S. healthcare solutions segment, offsetting weaker sales in the International healthcare solutions segment as a result of foreign currency translation pressure due to the historically strong dollar. 
 Consolidated gross profit was $2.1 billion, up 5% due to growth in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment. Consolidated gross profit margin expanded by 4 basis points in the quarter to 3.44% driven by growth in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment. Consolidated operating income was $741 million, up 7% compared to the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by a strong performance in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment, more than offsetting the decline in the International healthcare solutions segment, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance.
 Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was $52 million, down 5.6% as a result of higher interest income. Our effective income tax rate was 19.8% compared to 20.3% in the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count was 210 million shares, a 0.4% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by opportunistic share repurchases in the second half of our fiscal year. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our segment results for the fourth quarter. 
 U.S. healthcare solutions segment revenue was $54.8 billion up 5% for the quarter as we continue to see broad-based solid performance and utilization trends across our portfolio. Revenue growth was impacted by lower sales of commercial COVID-19 treatments that have traditional commercial revenue associated with them, unlike the government-owned products that contributed more meaningfully to operating income in both the quarter and full fiscal year 2022.
 U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased by 14% to $578 million. In the quarter, our specialty physician services business delivered strong growth across specialty classes. We also continue to benefit from strong biosimilar utilization in both specialty physician practices and health systems. Operating income margin increased by 9 basis points to 1.06% due to the distribution of COVID-19 treatments and growth in specialty physician services.
 Also, again, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we had elevated operating expenses as we made investments in our talent and growth initiatives. This impacts the year-over-year comparison for the segment in the quarter as we benefited from lapping those prior year expenses.
 I will now turn to our international healthcare solutions segment. In the quarter, international healthcare solutions revenue was $6.4 billion down 3% on a reported basis. International healthcare solutions operating income was $163 million down 13% on an as-reported basis driven by the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestiture of Profarma Specialty, which occurred in June 2022 and contributed $6 million in operating income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
 When looking at the segment on a constant currency basis, we believe the underlying business fundamentals are solid. In the quarter, we continued to have strong performances at World Courier, and Alliance Healthcare continued to execute well as we navigate inflation in the local economies.
 While the strong dollar continues to be a headwind on an as-reported basis, our teams throughout the segment have delivered good operational performance with solid trends across the businesses. As we look to 2023, we are excited to continue our progress on integrating Alliance Healthcare and to expand our global pharmaceutical solutions platform with the previously announced pending acquisition of PharmaLex.
 That concludes our fiscal fourth quarter discussion. Now I will turn to a discussion of our full year fiscal 2022 results. Our consolidated revenue was $239 billion up 12% driven by growth in both segments and benefiting from the full year contribution of Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue was up 5%. As we have indicated throughout the year, we had lower revenue recognized from COVID-19 treatment in the United States due to much of the volume associated with COVID treatments this year being associated with government-owned emergency use authorization treatments.
 In the prior year fiscal 2021, we had approximately $3.7 billion of sales related to COVID-19 treatments versus $1.7 billion in fiscal 2022. Consolidated operating income grew 20% to $3.2 billion driven by the full year contribution of Alliance Healthcare and solid performance across our portfolio, including sales to specialty physician practices.
 From a segment perspective, U.S. Healthcare Solutions had operating income growth of 9%, while international healthcare solutions operating income grew 81% year-over-year to $706 million. In fiscal 2022, we had $0.72 of contribution related to COVID treatment, test kits and vaccine distribution with $0.62 in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and $0.10 in the international healthcare solutions segment.
 Turning now to interest expense. In fiscal 2022, net interest expense was $211 million, an increase of 21% as a result of debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. In fiscal 2022, we repaid $1.1 billion of debt and expect to repay the remaining $675 million in short-term Alliance Healthcare-related debt by March 2023, delivering on our commitment to the rating agencies to repay 2/3 of the debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition.
 While we project that our total corporate debt will be lower in 2023, we expect our interest expense to increase somewhat in fiscal 2023 due to local country-level subsidiary borrowings at higher interest rates.
 Regarding taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 20.6% compared to 21.3% in fiscal 2021, as we began to realize tax synergies related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition.
 Turning now to EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS grew 19% to $11.03, driven by the incremental 8-month contribution from Alliance Healthcare and solid growth across our businesses. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $3 billion, and we ended the year with a cash balance of $3.4 billion. As a result of our better-than-expected cash flow generation and our strong balance sheet, we opportunistically returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of $500 million in shares in the back half of the fiscal year during a time of equity market fluctuations. After these repurchases, we have approximately $900 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.
 That completes the review of our fiscal 2022 results. I will now discuss our fiscal 2023 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. So the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. We have also provided a detailed overview of guidance metrics on Slides 9 and 10 of our earnings presentation.
 Starting with revenue. We expect consolidated revenue to grow in the 5% to 7% range on a reported basis and in the 6% to 8% range on a constant currency basis. On a segment level, we expect U.S. healthcare solutions revenue to grow in the 6% to 8% range and international health care solutions, on a reported basis, we expect revenue to decline in the 1% to 5% range. On a constant currency basis, we expect the international segment's revenue to grow in the 8% to 12% range.
 Moving to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income to grow in the 0% to 3% range or 3% to 6% on a constant currency basis. Excluding COVID contributions, we expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the 3% to 5% range or 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis. On a segment level, we expect U.S. healthcare solutions' operating income growth to be in the 2% to 4% range.
 As we've called out throughout the year, in fiscal 2022, we had a significant tailwind related to the work we did to distribute COVID-19 treatments across the U.S. In the fourth quarter, the COVID treatment contribution came in slightly stronger than expected, bringing our total COVID treatment contribution for the segment to $0.62 for the year.
 In our fiscal 2023 guidance, we have embedded approximately $0.30 of contribution in the U.S. segment related to COVID treatment distribution. Excluding the contributions from COVID-related operating income, we expect U.S. segment operating income growth to be in the 5% to 7% range in fiscal 2023, generally in line with the long-term guidance we introduced at our Investor Day in June.
 Turning now to our International healthcare solutions segment fiscal 2023 operating income guidance. We expect international healthcare solutions segment operating income to decline in the 3% to 7% range on an as-reported basis or 5% to 9% growth on a constant currency basis. In fiscal 2022, the international segment had a $0.10 contribution related to COVID vaccine and test kit distribution. In fiscal 2023, we expect a few cents of contribution from COVID-related business in the segment.
 On an ex-COVID as-reported basis, we expect the international healthcare solutions segment operating income decline to be in the 1% to 5% range or operating income growth of 7% to 11% on a constant currency basis.
 As you turn to your models, there are a few items impacting the international segment from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023. First, we completed the sale of Profarma Specialty in June which represented 2% of segment operating income in fiscal 2022. Second, the historically strong dollar created pressure in the segment during fiscal 2022, largely in the second half of the fiscal year. While FX pressure impacts the translation of income for our business, there are some elements of our business that mitigate FX risks, including that we operate and source in the local countries where we generate sales. While we expect an FX headwind in 2023 over 2022 using rates as of late October, the impact is fully reflected in our 2023 guidance and would largely be front-half weighted as the dollar did not significantly strengthen until the back half of fiscal 2022.
 Third, as we said in the September announcement of our intent to acquire PharmaLex we anticipate closing the acquisition by March and expect the business to contribute approximately $0.15 in the last 7 months of our fiscal year. Our teams are making good progress and are on track to close the acquisition on schedule. The acquisition is accretive and adds to our higher-margin, higher-growth pharma manufacturer services platform for long-term value creation.
 Despite FX and inflationary pressures, our International Healthcare Solutions segment has delivered solid operational performance in the businesses and the segment, our core component of our strategic vision. With our distribution, scale and portfolio of manufactured services, we're uniquely positioned to support pharmaceutical innovation and access across our footprint.
 Moving on to tax rate and share count. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 20% to 21% for fiscal 2023. We expect that our share count will be approximately 207 million to 209 million shares as we will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares in fiscal 2023. Given these expectations, we are guiding for adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.30 to $11.60 on an as-reported basis, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2% to 5% or 4% to 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding both the COVID-19 contribution of $0.72 in fiscal '22 and the expectation for approximately $0.30 to $0.35 of contribution in fiscal 2023, EPS growth would be in the 7% to 9% range or 9% to 11% on a constant currency basis.
 There are still many variables that make it difficult to predict the timing and realization of COVID treatment contribution. While this is our current estimate of COVID treatment contribution, we will continue to review trends over the coming months and make adjustments to our expectations as necessary.
 Turning now to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million as we continue to invest to advance our business and support future growth opportunities. For adjusted free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $2 billion. Since the opioid settlement agreement has been agreed to and annual payments are now predictable, the cash payments associated with the settlement are now included in our adjusted free cash flow guidance, which is the driver of lower adjusted free cash flow guidance in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022.
 As a reminder, in fiscal 2022, we made 2 payments related to the settlement both at 2021 and the 2022 payments that totaled approximately $775 million.
 Before I make my closing remarks, while we do not provide guidance on a quarterly basis, I would like to provide some color on our quarterly cadence as you turn to your models. First, the dollar did not substantially strengthen until the second half of our fiscal year 2022. As a result, in fiscal 2023, we expect to see a more significant FX related headwind in the first half. Second, in fiscal 2022, inflationary pressures in the business were largely in the last 7 to 8 months of the year, resulting in a tougher comparison for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as we continue to carry those higher costs sequentially.
 While we feel very good about our growth rates in our full year fiscal 2023 guidance, these 2 factors create a tougher comparison in the first half of our fiscal year, particularly in the first quarter.
 To conclude, fiscal 2022 was a successful year for AmerisourceBergen, as our purpose-driven team members delivered exceptional execution and performance. We entered fiscal 2023 with strong momentum, and our increasingly united teams are creating differentiated value for our customers, partners and the patients they serve. We are well positioned to continue to drive value for our stakeholders by continuing to leverage our commercial strengths to create efficiency, investing in innovation to enhance our capabilities and deploying capital thoughtfully and strategically.
 With that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have our first question, comes from Lisa Gill from JPM. 
Lisa Gill: Great. And thanks for all the comments and color today. Steve, I want to start with a bigger strategy question, and that's really around specialty. One, we hear about a number of different JVs and relationships in the marketplace. I'm just curious as to how you're Board feeling in the current market, one, from a competitive landscape perspective. And then two, biosimilars is an area that we've really been focused on. You did highlight that in your commentary as an opportunity. So maybe if you could talk about those 2 things. And then secondly, if I could ask, Jim, can you just talk about upper and lower end of the COVID range? What's in there? 
Steven Collis: Okay. Lisa, good to hear from you, and thank you for the question. Yes, I could not be more proud to speak about our specialty distribution and services business. We started the business, as you know, almost 30 years ago. And it's interesting because ION oncology supply, of course, were the formative businesses and we've added a lot of capabilities, of course, on the distribution side with companies like Besse and then most importantly, Lash and Xcenda got us into the services area. And we now with the ICS and World Courier and PharmaLex, we continue to build out our portfolio in ways that are very thoughtful to both our up and downstream customers.
 But on the legacy specialty business, let me just say, we've always adapted the business for the needs of both large and small customers. If you look at the market shares we have considering that a good portion of the market in community oncology in the U.S. which is where our biggest business is, is not available to us. The market shares we have are pretty impressive, and we've maintained them those relationships for a long time. And we do that with exceptional service, pricing and strong relationships on the ground. Then you look at the development of services like ION and the clinical pathways and the information and data that manufacturers require, and that help our practices better perform in this current environment and the ongoing needs to enhance that and then refine that and increase it, including areas that AmerisourceBergen hasn't until recently been active in like ESG, like clinical trial -- diversity in clinical trials, like more and more longitudinal information, and we really have a tremendous presence.
 One of the drivers right now in oncology business is the aggregators, and AmerisourceBergen is proud to be partnering with the 3 largest aggregators. So we work, of course, with the small customers, but we are able to be the lead distributor for those 3 aggregator companies, which are highly active, and we anticipate that they will continue to grow as the market evolves.
 We've also developed a good practice for institutional accounts that want to get more in this market. But I could talk about this a lot. I feel I also need to talk about our investment in services, which really helps expand on the presence that we have in the market. It helps compound our theme of international growth and differentiation. It helps enhance our outcomes and the outcomes for our pharma companies.
 And you asked about biosimilars. We are going to be working hard on both Europe and the U.S. to help our customers access them to access them profitably, to access them on behalf of their patients. I think we've already demonstrated tremendous success. And our sweet spot is, again, like it was with the generics 2 to 4 players, we do best, and once it gets too much beyond that, it's -- the reimbursement declines a lot for our customers. And we really are evaluating the shifts and what makes clinical and economic sense for our customers. But it's been a tremendous -- it creates a lot of headroom for our suppliers and for actual drug spending, which we believe is the most efficient form of healthcare. And I could talk a lot about this, but I know you have a question for Jim, and thank you for asking me to talk about our business.
 Last thing I'd say before I hand over to Jim, just this week, we celebrated the opening of a new hub for our specialty services on the West Coast, and it looks terrific. I can't wait to get there in the next year or so. But it just shows you the growth of the actual distribution of specialty products including biosimilars and looking at emerging areas like cell and gene therapies is so important for our manufactures and our provider customers that we've now opened a third largest regional center. So Jim? 
James Cleary: Sure. Lisa, you had asked about COVID therapies and our contribution from COVID therapies. In fiscal year '23, as we indicated, we're expecting $0.30 to $0.35 with approximately $0.30 being in the U.S. and a few cents international. And that's down, of course, from the contribution in fiscal year '22, which was $0.72. And we said we were a little bit ahead of expectations in the fourth quarter. We had a contribution from COVID therapies of $0.17. And so this is something that is hard to predict, and so we'll be very transparent, and we will indicate what our COVID therapy contribution in each quarter, as people will see in their earnings presentation that we posted this morning, this is why we provided guidance both including and excluding COVID therapies.
 And I will note that in the month of October, it was a little bit lighter than we expected. But we are providing the guidance for the year of this $0.30 to $0.35, and we will be transparent and update on it every quarter. And I'll just finish by saying, of course, we're very proud of the role that we served as the distributor of a number of these COVID therapies, Lisa. 
Operator: We have our next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. 
Michael Cherny: Maybe if we could drill down a little bit more on the U.S. health care business and especially the segment EBIT, as you think about the puts and takes heading into next year, script growth, pricing, other areas of the business thinking like MWI, how do you think about the variability within that guidance, call it, the 5% to 7% ex-COVID range? And what are the areas, if we can, that you think are most point in the right direction versus areas that potentially have some level of overhang or slower growth versus what you would typically expect to see? 
James Cleary: Yes, I'll start the comment there. And as you commented on, our guidance for adjusted operating income growth in the U.S. segment ex-COVID is 5% to 7%, and of course, that's driven by continued strong operational performance really across multiple businesses. We continue to really execute very well and have -- and a particularly strong growth in our specialty business. And of course, we would continue to expect to see strong growth there. As I commented before, one of the other moving pieces in the business is COVID therapies. But of course, if we kind of focus on the ex-COVID.
 I just think, Michael, we're seeing strong utilization trends, and so we haven't seen any surprises there as we would expect utilization trends are strong. And then just really good performance across just multiple businesses that drove the growth rates in '22 that we would expect to see to continue in '23. 
Operator: We have our next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. 
George Hill: Yes. I'll try to sneak 2 in. Jim, just to make sure I heard you correctly, on PharmaLex, as we think about '23, you guys are calling for AOI up, call it, 7% ex the noise. So with the inclusion of PharmaLex, is the core actually up kind of 11x to 15x PharmaLex? Or should we be thinking up 11x to 15x inclusive of PharmaLex, it's a back-end weighted number? I just -- I kind of didn't hear the math clearly on that. 
James Cleary: Yes. And so what I would draw people to take a look at is Page 10 of the earnings presentation that we posted to our website earlier today, which shows the growth rates of our International Health Care Solutions segment. And it really kind of report that we show it on an as-reported basis, a constant currency basis, as reported, excluding COVID constant currency, excluding COVID, then we also show what the impact of the acquisition is.
 And for PharmaLex, we're expecting a March 1 close. We are expecting it to contribute $0.15 to fiscal year '23. And what I'd say is if you look at international healthcare solutions segment, our growth rate, constant currency, excluding COVID, is 7% to 11%. And if we were to back out the impact of the acquisition, that would take about 4 percentage points off the -- both the bottom end and the top end of that range, which I think answers your question. 
Operator: We have our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company. 
Charles Rhyee: Yes. And maybe just to look at the guidance again here. You're obviously guiding to very strong growth if we look at excluding COVID on a constant currency basis. Back at your Investor Day, you talked about sort of a long-term guide of about 5%; adjusted operating income growth, 5% to 7%. It looks like here, though, you're kind of guiding better than what you were kind of indicating on a long-term basis. Anything coming up in this year that you would kind of call out to say maybe is sort of a near-term benefit that you might not see going on sort of indefinitely? Or is there an opportunity to -- where sort of the long-term adjusted operating income growth could be better than what you were kind of indicating back to -- at the Analyst Day? 
James Cleary: Yes. I would say that this is in line with the guidance that we provided with at Investor Day, where we talked about 5% operating income growth and 8% EPS growth in fiscal year '23. And then we talked about 5% to 8% operating income growth over the long term and then an additional 3% to 4% from capital deployment.
 And I think, feel like these results and guidance that we're talking about today are very much in line with what we indicated back on Investor Day, and it's really kind of driven by our leading presence in distribution, both in the U.S. and internationally and then our ability to supplement that with higher margin, higher growth businesses that are able to contribute to our operating income growth and then deliver the capital deployment, both through acquisitions like the PharmaLex acquisition in fiscal year '23 and share repurchases, as we've demonstrated over the last 6 months with about $500 million of share repurchases. 
Steven Collis: Yes, just one comment, Jim, too. I would say we end the fiscal year with a lot of momentum, and it highlights the resiliency and just core demand for our services. We really -- we should never -- appreciate this tremendous industry we're in. 
Operator: We have our next question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. 
Eric Percher: Question on free cash flow trajectory. In the last 5 years, we're not seeing our profit growth and free cash flow. I know there's some obvious factors around investment and the opioid settlement. But I'd welcome your view on underlying growth in fiscal year '23 and the opportunity to see free cash flow expansion post settlement? 
James Cleary: Yes. And so first of all, I'd say we were really pleased with our free cash flow in fiscal year '22. Our adjusted free cash flow of $3 billion in fiscal year '22. And as I look forward, Eric, I'd just kind of see the free cash flow metrics kind of being about the same as they have been. And of course, they've been very favorable, and we've had great performance on free cash flow. But I don't really kind of see anything that would kind of change those metrics.
 Of course, as I commented in the prepared remarks in fiscal year '23, now that the settlement is known, we will be subtracting the settlement out of free cash flow, not adding it back. But in terms of the metrics, I view kind of our working capital is one of the very positive things about our business and kind of seeing those free cash metrics being kind of consistent. 
Operator: We have our next question comes from Eric Coldwell from Baird. 
Eric Coldwell: That last Q&A kind of covered my FX follow-up -- or sorry, free cash follow-up. But I did have a separate question on MWI. I'm just curious. What are you thinking about the performance of that business currently in the outlook? My thought process is the companion side is perhaps on the back half of the COVID pet boom. And then at least historically in periods of weaker economies and global challenges, maybe production animal support goes down a bit, less animal consumption, et cetera. So just hoping we could get an update on MWI and your outlook for next year. 
James Cleary: Yes. And so it has been a lower growth year for MWI and the animal health market in '22. I think for the year at MWI, it's about 3% growth and a little bit higher than that in companion animal and a little bit lower than that but still growth in the production animal market. And of course, it's comping over some very strong years in the animal health market, where there are a lot of pet adoptions during COVID, and that really drove the market for a period of time.
 And then I think what's been happening this year is there have been some staffing issues. Of course, as the labor market has been tight, there's been staffing issues in veterinary clinics. So it's a little bit harder to get an appointment. And so that's impacted the market, but it's a very strong market and a very strong business for the long term. And in both good economies and bad economies, that market has performed well. And I think we would continue to see that over the long term. 
Operator: We have our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. 
Kevin Caliendo: I had 2 international questions tied into one. Is -- do you expect there to be any future recurrence of the Turkish FX remeasurement expense on inventory? And also, were there any excess fuel energy costs in the U.K.? Was that an incremental headwind to you -- a material headwind to you? Because it's certainly something that's popped up on our radar screens, it's being potentially a problem. 
James Cleary: Yes. And so with regard to Turkey, there is a mechanism in that market so that -- each year, there is a price increase, which really protects us for many devaluation in the currency. And so we would expect that annual price increase to be recurring in future years, like it has been in past years. And so in fiscal year '22, the price increase really offset the currency devaluation, and our guidance assumes that the same thing happens in '23, although the level of price increase may be lower.
 And then with regard to fuel and the U.K., yes, I mean, we have had inflationary pressures, particularly in the second half of fiscal year '22 in the U.K., and we would expect those to continue in fiscal year '23, and it's fully reflected in our results and our guidance. And I would say that our team at Alliance is just very good at controlling costs. But we absolutely do have a headwind from inflation that's reflected in our guidance. 
Operator: We have our next question comes from Stephen Valiquette from Barclays. 
Steven J. Valiquette: Great. So with the U.S. healthcare solutions segment operating growth, 5% to 7% ex-COVID, can you just remind us at a high level whether or not there's any notable call-out just on negative impact from customer contract renewal pricing being absorbed within that 5% to 7% growth assumption? If there is, obviously, it's positive, you still get there. But just curious if that was a factor not just -- either measured in basis points, et cetera, just within that. 
James Cleary: Yes. Yes. No, we have no call-outs there. And of course, we're very proud of our ability to be able to renew with customers, and very pleased with our success there. And what we're seeing really in the U.S. is just continued broad-based growth and performance across a number of businesses. 
Operator: We have our next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. 
Albert Rice: Just want to ask about capital deployment, and 3 aspects to it really. By March '23, you're saying you'll be done with the need to pay down the debt that you committed to the rating agencies for the Alliance deal. Does that impact your priorities and where you think your capital deployment will go? You've also got the strong dollar, which I know is impacting on the translation side, but you've got 2 businesses doing very well, World Courier and Alliance. Any thought about using the strong dollar for other acquisitions internationally?
 And then, I guess, finally, just the Walgreens stake, does that affect your capital priorities in anyway? Do you need to hold reserve in case you have an opportunity to buy your shares back through -- in anything they do? 
James Cleary: Yes. So thank you very much for that question. Of course, our capital deployment priorities remain consistent and continuing to invest in the business, strategic M&A, opportunistic share repurchases and maintaining a reasonable growing dividend. And with regard to parts of the question that you asked, we obviously will continue to look at strategic acquisition opportunities. We feel really good about the PharmaLex acquisition and the opportunity that, that creates for us in the global biopharma market.
 And then with regard to the Walgreens question you asked, if Walgreens does decide to sell additional shares, of course, we'll view that as an opportunity to collaborate with them and be a repurchaser of some of the shares. And I think through our actions over the last 6 months, we've demonstrated our interest in opportunistically repurchasing shares. And this is all enabled by our very strong free cash flow. We really exceeded our guidance on adjusted free cash flow for fiscal year '23 and we're fully -- are fully meeting our commitments, of course, as you mentioned, to pay down the Alliance debt. 
Operator: We have no more further questions. I will now hand the call over back to Steve for closing remarks. 
Steven Collis: Thank you, everybody, for your participation today. I hope that Jim and Bennett and myself were very clear that we are tremendously proud of AmerisourceBergen's performance in fiscal year 2022. We enter fiscal year 2023 with tremendous confidence, which is only enhanced by the flexibility, our strong balance sheet affords us. AmerisourceBergen is making the right strategic, human and operational investments to continue to grow our franchise in ways that will enhance value for all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your time today. 
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Have a lovely day. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-08-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the AmerisourceBergen Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Victoria, and I will be contour call today. . I'll now pass over to your host, Bennett Murphy, Head of Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead.
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's fiscal 2022 third quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today's call, we'll be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. We have also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website.  During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of QS assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be or broadcast without the express permission of the company. (Operator Instructions) With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on opioid-related litigation. As previously disclosed, we have reached an agreement for a settlement with the state of Oklahoma that is consistent with the state's allocations under the comprehensive settlement agreement. That brings the total number of states saving opioid-related claims to 48 or 49 eligible states. In July, we were pleased to receive a ruling from a federal judge that held that our distribution of FDA-approved medications to licensed and registered health care providers in Capell County and the City of Huntington was not a public nuisance, and we are optimistic the ruling will hold up upon appeal. Additionally, we reached an agreement with the remaining counties and municipalities of the state of West Virginia to resolve opioid-related claims. We are encouraged by this continued progress, and we will not comment deeply at this time. AmerisourceBergen continues to work diligently with our partners to combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions that help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve.  Turning now to our third quarter of fiscal '22. AmerisourceBergen delivered another quarter of strong results driven by continued high levels of execution across our company and the strength and resilience of our businesses. During the quarter, revenue was up 12.5% over the prior year period to $60 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by 20% and adjusted EPS grew by 21%. These strong results and the increase in our full year outlook, which Jim will discuss in greater detail, are driven by our team members' continued strong execution, the resilience of our businesses and our differentiated solutions. Our business is further enhanced by the strength of our foundational pharmaceutical distribution business, our position in the market and our strategic focus on the 4 areas of specialty medicine and services community providers, long-term customer partnerships and providing global access and opportunity.  In our first focus area of specialty medicine and services, we continue to benefit from our market leadership and ability to capture growth opportunities as pharmaceutical innovation continues to advance. In the U.S., we are benefiting from demographic trends increasing biosimilar utilization and the downstream services we are able to provide to support specialty physician practices as they continue to grow along with the market. We continue to support the growth of biosimilars with services both upstream from helping biopharma manufacturers with clinical development, commercialization and launch to downstream supporting provider education and patient access. We also continue to see good growth across specialties from oncology to ophthalmology and rheumatology driven by our GPO data and analytics and additional value-added capabilities.  Looking to the future, the specialty market is driven by exciting scientific developments that enable increasingly precise and personalized treatments for diseases that were once thought of as untreatable. And we are positioning ourselves to support this innovation and capture these global growth opportunities.  In our specialty physician services business, we are well positioned to continue to support successful product access and utilization. In the quarter, we continue to benefit from our scale creating value for our downstream physician customers, both around the innovative products in the market and also on the biosimilar front in oncology and seeing early-stage positive signs in the ophthalmology side.  On the logistics side, World Courier remains the market-leading solution for its expertise in specialty logistics and have stepped up to help our customers navigate global complexities. World Courier's capabilities, including expert execution, next-generation thermal packaging and advanced tracking technology enable safe and secure deliveries to their most remote communities and extreme climates. We continue to enhance our global logistics capabilities through World Courier, Alloga, Innomar and our other specialty focused businesses to offer robust clinical and commercial support, such as direct-to-patient logistics and temperature-controlled transport and storage solutions.  Recent investments include opening or expanding our facilities in strategic markets worldwide to add more cold chain capabilities and especially cryogenic storage to meet increasing demand. With enhanced capabilities and expertise, we strive to further strengthen our market leadership to capture the opportunities ahead and facilitate pharmaceutical innovation.  Our second focus area is community providers. Globally, community providers are integral to supporting the health of their local communities with key health care services and our critical providers in underserved areas. Community pharmacies, for example, play a key role in helping health care systems, both in the U.S. and abroad to reach communities of all types, reinforcing the value of independent pharmacies.  2 weeks ago, we hosted our annual ThoughtSpot conference for our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network, which coincided with the network's 40th anniversary. After hosting ThoughtSpot remotely during recent years, it was energizing to once again spend time with local community pharmacists in person to collaborate and to celebrate their impact in their communities. This conference was even more special as we were joined by Alliance Healthcare team members that serve its Alphega independent pharmacy network in Europe as part of the best practice sharing we are conducting across our business.  Coming out of ThoughtSpot, I remain amazed and inspired by the resilience, passion, connection and ability of independent pharmacies to tailor their services to match patient needs, and patients are responding with high praise. Our own Good Neighbor Pharmacy network was ranked highest in customer satisfaction with chain drugstore pharmacies in J.D. Power's 2022 and U.S. pharmacy study. Incredibly, this is the 11th time that GNP has earned this recognition in the last 13 years and the network's sixth consecutive win.  AmerisourceBergen is focused on assisting the professional pharmacy to increase its role in patient care in ways where the pharmacist has proved they can assist in providing expert patient care in an accessible setting. We are pleased to see that the pharmacist role continues to be more elevated. And importantly, we were pleased to see the U.S. FDA's revision to the Paxlovid EUA authorizing state licensed pharmacists to prescribe the COVID-19 antiviral to eligible patients.  This action by the FDA reflects the value that can be gained by the U.S. health care system if the role of pharmacists can be expanded. Americans rate pharmacies as the most accessible amongst health care destinations, including emergency departments and primary care physicians' offices, and many now have a pharmacy-first mentality when looking to improve their well-being. Pharmacies are providing 2 out of every 3 COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in America and 45% of pharmacy COVID-19 vaccination sites are reported to be in areas with moderate to severe social vulnerability. Clearly, community pharmacies are a critical extension of our public health care system and an essential access point for those who need care the most. AmerisourceBergen is proud of our work to support independent pharmacies, including by advocating on their behalf for health equity policies that ensure access to their critical services.  The third focus area for AmerisourceBergen is our long-term customer relationships. From upstream biopharma manufacturers to downstream pharmacies, veterinarians, physicians, health systems and government agencies, we leverage our strong core pharmaceutical distribution capabilities to support patient access wherever a prescription is needed. The strength and reach of our distribution capabilities have helped us continue to enhance our relationship with health care providers, big and small, and our relationship with stakeholders worldwide have been further reinforced throughout the pandemic.  We continue to see strong prescription utilization trends across our core distribution business and benefit from our broad portfolio of anchor customers. These long-term partnerships position us well to continue to benefit from the well-documented resiliency of the pharmaceutical supply chain. As partners, we also support our customers by making next -- investments to help them stay ahead of an ever-evolving health care landscape.  Digital therapeutics, for example, is an area of opportunity for future growth. And to help innovators commercialize treatments and reach patients, we are preparing to launch DTx Connect, a platform that will integrate with EMRs and simplify the prescription and nonprescription digital therapeutics process. Similarly, we are partnering to provide digital and e-commerce solutions so that veterinary practices can communicate more effectively with the increasingly digital savvy clients and operate more efficiently. With our knowledge base across all sites of care geographies, AmerisourceBergen is creating increasingly more opportunities with our customers by problem solving and focusing on building enduring long-term relationships.  Our fourth focus area is providing global access and opportunity. Earlier, I mentioned the key role that World Courier plays in the global pharmaceutical supply chain with its expertise in specialty logistics. This quarter, we also celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our Alliance Healthcare acquisition. And as I reflect on the past year, the word that comes to mind is unity. Our teams have made great progress on integration, and we are more aligned than ever to our shared purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.  We are already beginning to realize the benefits of operating in a shared environment that allow teams to glean knowledge and best practices from colleagues in other areas of the business and in other markets. One example is a recent exchange of visits between our distribution center leaders, in which our European team members visited our U.S. human and animal health distribution centers and our U.S. team members subsequently visited distribution centers in the U.K. Through these visits, the team has been able to share best practices around supply management, automation, performance tracking and productivity management and operational planning and design. While we recognize the differences that exist between international markets, we are ready to identify, adapt and invest in proven best-in-class technology, supply chain, commercialization and services solutions.  We've also had the chance to unite around our manufacture partners. Recently, teams from both the U.S. and Europe met with one of our global partners to hold joint workshops looking at how we can work together to achieve shared successes. That manufacturer shared with me at our ThoughtSpot conference their desire to be our first truly global partner.  There's no doubt in my mind that we are establishing the right culture and methodologies to capitalize on AmerisourceBergen's assets in ways that will differentiate us by taking advantage of our global reach and unique knowledge, scale and expertise in all the markets where we operate. The progress we've made so far to integrate our business and teams is as a result of the tireless effort of all of our global team members. I've mentioned in the past the strength of the Alliance Healthcare team, and they continue to impress with their resilience and their ability to execute and deliver strong operational performance. We look forward to finding more opportunities to further strengthen our operations and to partner with our customers to offer truly global solutions that help them stay ahead of a continuously evolving environment.  Our team members are a fundamental driver of our long-term sustainable growth. At AmerisourceBergen, we firmly believe that our people are our most important asset, and our benefits and talent development programs are data-driven and based on employee input. During the quarter, we conducted our 2022 employee experience survey, which showed that our team members feel connected to our purpose, their managers and each other in making a positive impact on our customers and the health care supply chain. The valuable insights we have gained through the survey around cultural inclusion, team member satisfaction and engagement will help guide us as we build the united culture.  Our Board and executive management team are committed to being a company that is transparent, ethical and a fair employer. We take our responsibilities to our 42,000 team members very seriously, and our goal is for them to always not only respect the company but also to be inspired by the work we do and fulfilling our purpose.  In addition to unity, we value a diverse, equal and inclusive culture. Our goal is to foster a global workplace that values all cultural, experiential and philosophical perspectives, creates pathways for every team member to thrive, make a positive impact on our communities through equitable access to health care and is transparent and accountable for progress.  To further our goals, we published our first DEI summary report, which shows where we stand today and how we're going to hold ourselves accountable for making progress as we move forward. An important part of AmerisourceBergen's DE&I strategy as well as our broader ESG strategy is having a positive impact on our communities through equitable access to health care.  One of the key channels through which we support healthy communities worldwide is our AmerisourceBergen Foundation, which recently committed funds to the United Nations Foundation's Shot at Life campaign. The campaign is instrumental in supporting global vaccine equity and protecting the world's most vulnerable children from devastating diseases. The funding will be used towards vaccine interventions in marginalized populations, such as refugee communities and will specifically support vaccine delivery, transportation, logistics and community engagement. We are proud to support such important work that truly reflects the global impact we have when we live our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.  Today's strong results reflect the value of our core global pharmaceutical-centric businesses and the value created by the execution and intellectual confidence of our team members. Driven by our purpose and supported by our proven resilience, we remain confident in AmerisourceBergen's ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth by maintaining a leading share of pharmaceutical distribution and best-in-class efficiency while growing our higher-margin, higher-growth businesses.  Our strong position enables us to achieve this vision as we deliver on our strategic imperatives and focus on specialty medications and services, community providers, customer partnerships and ensuring access and opportunity for patients around the world. Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our third quarter 2022 results and to discuss our updated financial guidance. Jim?
James Cleary: Thank you, Steve, and thank you all for joining us on today's call. Before I turn to our results, as usual, my comments will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year June quarter. For more details on our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release. In our third quarter, AmerisourceBergen continued to deliver strong results as our teams executed on our strategic imperatives. Our core foundation in pharmaceutical distribution and suite of complementary higher-margin, higher-growth services around the world position us well to deliver differentiated long-term value creation supported by our commitment to talent, diversity, equity and inclusion and ESG.  As Steve mentioned, in June, we passed the 1-year anniversary of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Our purpose-driven teams have worked diligently on integration and execution, and we are pleased that the acquisition has delivered high teens EPS accretion in its first year as expected.  Turning now to our third quarter results. AmerisourceBergen finished the quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.62, a 21% increase with solid operating income growth in both segments. Our consolidated revenue grew approximately 13% to $60.1 billion, driven by revenue growth in both segments. Consolidated gross profit increased 27% to $2.1 billion as a result of increases in gross profit in both segments. Gross profit margin grew by 39 basis points to 3.44% driven by the Alliance Healthcare acquisition, an increase in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment and good performance in the International healthcare solutions segment.  Consolidated operating expenses were $1.3 billion, up from $996 million as a result of higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses as well as depreciation expense primarily due to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Consolidated operating income was $756 million, up 20%. The increase was driven by operating income growth in both segments, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing segment level results.  Turning now to interest expense and the income tax rate. Net interest expense was $53 million in the quarter, an increase of 3% due to an increase in debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and partially offset by higher interest income on invested cash. Our effective income tax rate was 20.2% compared to 21.0% in the prior year quarter.  As it relates to our full year fiscal '22 tax rate guidance of approximately 21% to 22%, we would expect our full year tax rate to be at the lower end of that range. Our diluted share count increased 1.4% to 211.7 million shares as a result of dilution related to employee compensation and the June 2021 issuance of 2 million shares to Walgreens Boots Alliance in connection with our acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, offset in part by share repurchases in the quarter.  Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, fiscal year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $1.55 billion for the 9 months ended June 30. We ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash, including approximately $270 million of restricted cash on our balance sheet. In the quarter, we repaid $5 million in senior notes due March 2023 as we continue to make progress in paying down debt issued to acquire Alliance Healthcare. The remaining balance on the senior notes due March 2023 is $1 billion. This completes the review of our consolidated results.  Now I'll turn to our third quarter segment level results. Starting with our U.S. healthcare solutions segment. Segment revenue increased by 6% to approximately $53.4 billion driven by an increase in sales across our portfolio including increased volumes in mail order and growth in sales to specialty physician practices. Segment operating income was $580 million representing growth of 9.5% versus the third quarter of fiscal 2021. In the quarter, specialty physician services experienced strong broad-based growth to oncologists and other specialists as our industry-leading solution set continues to drive growth.  U.S. healthcare solutions segment operating income margin increased 3 basis points in the quarter due to fees earned from the distribution of government-owned COVID treatments. As a reminder, we distribute both commercial COVID-19 therapies and government-owned COVID-19 therapies. The contribution from government-owned COVID therapies is not a meaningful revenue driver given the fee-based nature of the business.  As it relates to COVID therapy earnings impact, COVID therapies contributed $0.14 to the June quarter exactly half of the $0.28 contribution we called out on our May earnings call as remaining for the balance of our fiscal year in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment. As a reminder, our full year estimate for COVID therapy contribution in the U.S. healthcare solutions segment is still approximately $0.60, $0.46 of which we have realized in the segment through our third quarter. If COVID therapy volume trends in July were to continue through August and September, we would expect to see a couple of pennies worth of decline in COVID therapy contribution sequentially but clearly in that $0.60 full year ballpark.  I will now turn to our international healthcare solutions segment. In the quarter, international healthcare solutions revenue was $6.7 billion, including $5.5 billion in revenue from Alliance Healthcare. Segment operating income for the third quarter was $176 million up 75% driven by the 2 months incremental contribution from Alliance Healthcare and strong operating performance at World Courier, both of which had good performance despite higher-than-expected foreign exchange pressure related to the strong dollar. Alliance Healthcare continued to have resilient volume trends that were in line or better than expectations, demonstrating the strong fundamentals of its pharmaceutical-centric business.  At World Courier, we had better-than-expected performance driven by increased weight per shipment. The World Courier team also ensured that we are getting good value for the incredibly important logistics service we offer for these high-priority shipments.  I will also note that in early June, as expected, we closed on our sale of the Profarma specialty business. This business contributed approximately $0.05 to EPS for the international healthcare Solutions segment for the first 8 months of fiscal 2022. This completes the review of our segment level results.  Now I will turn to our updated fiscal 2022 guidance. We are raising our fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS guidance from a range of $10.80 to $11.05 and to a new guidance range of $10.90 to $11.10 representing growth of approximately 18% to 20% from the prior fiscal year. The increased guidance reflects stronger-than-expected performance in several businesses and a lower-than-expected average diluted share count.  Turning now to operating income. There is no change in our expectation for consolidated operating income growth, which we expect to be at least in the high teens percent range. In our U.S. healthcare solutions segment we are raising the lower end of our operating income guidance. We now expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income to be in the range of $2.44 billion to $2.48 billion, representing growth of 8% to 10%. The guidance range reflects the strong performance the segment has shown to date, and continued strength in execution in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we had elevated operating expenses as we made investments in our talent and growth initiatives. This impacts the year-over-year comparison for the segment in the quarter as we benefit from lapping those prior year expenses.  Turning now to international healthcare solutions. There is no change in our full year guidance but I would like to discuss the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the segment. The international healthcare solutions segment has faced significant foreign exchange headwinds as a result of the strong dollar. Since our second quarter earnings call in May, the dollar has continued to strengthen, increasing the expected foreign exchange impact on our actual dollar results for the fiscal year to approximately $130 million versus constant currency up from our prior estimate of $80 million. Despite this headwind, our businesses have been performing well, and we are impressed with our team's strong execution.  While the strong dollar has been a translation headwind for our reported results, there are some items that mitigate the impact. In May, I called out the larger-than-normal annual manufacturer price adjustment in the March quarter in a developing market that offset the negative impact of the decline in value of its local currency. Now given the continued depreciation of that country's local currency and unusual second price adjustment was announced in July, which will offset currency pressure in our fourth quarter, as I said in May, these price adjustments have historically been on an annual basis, but now given the significant decline in the value of the local currency, a second unexpected price adjustment occurred, which will support our full year results.  Turning now to share count. We now expect average diluted shares outstanding for the fiscal year to be in the range of $211 million to $211.5 million down from approximately $212 million as a result of the resumption of our share repurchase program in May. In the June quarter, we repurchased $249 million of our shares and have approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our current board approved share repurchase authorizations. Lastly, we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and have raised the lower end of the previous range of $2 billion as we continue to have good cash flow trends in the business.  That concludes the updates to our fiscal 2022 guidance. While we are in the middle of our planning process for fiscal 2023, I want to repeat the earlier commentary that I gave at our Investor Day in June about our expected organic consolidated adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS growth for fiscal 2023. If you exclude the contribution from COVID treatment distribution, our operating income growth should be in the 5% range and EPS growth in the 8% range, again, x COVID.  As it relates to the potential COVID contribution, trends and treatment utilization remain difficult to predict too far out but we continue to believe the contribution from COVID treatment distribution in 2023 could easily be less than half of the approximately $0.70 contribution included in our 2022 guidance. Our segment level COVID contribution expectations remain unchanged for fiscal 2022. As a reminder, we expect about $0.60 of contribution in the U.S. segment and around $0.10 in the international segment. As usual, we will provide our full detailed fiscal 2023 guidance that is fully informed by our comprehensive planning process when we announce our fourth quarter results.  Before I conclude my prepared remarks today, I would like to provide a brief update on our ESG efforts in progress. In June, AmerisourceBergen was honored to be invited to the White House as signatories of the administration's health sector climate pledge alongside many of our peers in the health care industry. Signatories of the pledge commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while producing detailed plans to prepare their facilities and communities for climate impacts. These commitments align with our ESG strategy with one of the core pillars of our strategy being resilient and sustainable operations. Other related efforts include our commitment to a set of science-based emissions reduction target, and in May, we submitted our draft target to the science-based targets initiative for official validation.  As I mentioned last quarter, we've also conducted fiscal risk assessments of our top 100 locations to inform our business strategy and continuity planning process. By having strong business resiliency plans and reducing our emissions footprint, we can help mitigate the impact of climate change and advanced health equity, particularly in communities most vulnerable to climate change. While my comments today focus on our environmental efforts, AmerisourceBergen embraces all aspects of ESG. And in doing so, we live our purpose and help create healthier futures.  To close, AmerisourceBergen has proven its ability to deliver strong results throughout each phase of the pandemic driven by the talent and execution of our 42,000 team members, the resilience of our pharmaceutical-centric businesses and supported by the strength of our balance sheet. As we look ahead in the complex economic environment globally, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned strategically, operationally and financially to continue to deliver sustainable earnings, strong cash flow and long-term value for all our stakeholders. Thank you all for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. And now I will turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A. Operator?
Operator: . And our first question comes from Elizabeth Anderson at Evercore.
Elizabeth Anderson: And thanks for all the details on the back half guidance. I was wondering, given all the puts and takes that you've been talking about and sort of trying to establish, as you said, sort of like phase we are in the pandemics like run rate trends, can you talk about the underlying volume growth assumptions in not only your -- what happened in the third quarter and then sort of underlying your guidance in the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to sort of parse out like where you're seeing strength in those and relative areas of weakness in both the sort of visits and sort of core retail scripts versus maybe some of the mail acceleration that you talked about in both the U.S. and Europe.
James Cleary: Yes. So thanks a lot for that question, Elizabeth. And I'd say overall, what we're seeing across our business is resilience and strength. And of course, those are words we used a lot in the prepared remarks. But getting kind of a little bit more into the detail, we are seeing strong underlying fundamentals. We're seeing good utilization trends, and we're seeing good volumes both in the U.S. and international, and I described this as being in line or somewhat ahead of our expectations. We're definitely aided by our leadership in specialty distribution, and that's allowed us to capture the strong trends there, the benefits of the strong specialty utilization trends which we would expect to continue. And so that's one area where we've seen strong trends, and you did comment, as we did in our prepared remarks, that we did see some increased volumes in mail also during the quarter.  But overall, I think that we've just continued to demonstrate resilience and strength in the various phases of the pandemic as we look over the last 2.25 years or so, the fundamentals and the utilization trends have really been quite good. And we're seeing really the same thing in the various phases of the economic cycle. We're continuing to see strong fundamentals and utilization trends really across our businesses in the U.S. and international, which is largely due, of course, to the pharmaceutical-centric nature of our businesses
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill at JPMorgan.
Lisa Gill: First, I just want to start, Jim, with your comments initially around 2023 and just get your thoughts on how you're thinking about foreign exchange. You talked about the dollar being stronger, and you didn't specifically call that out as we think about 2023. So that would be my first question. And then second, more broadly speaking, just given your position on how strong you are in the specialty side and given what we're seeing on the biosimilar side, can you talk about was there any impact in the quarter from biosimilars? And how do you think about biosimilars over the next couple of years as we have a number of drugs that will lose patent protection?
James Cleary: Okay. Well, I'll start out and talk about 2023. And importantly, there's really no change from what we indicated during our Investor Day. On a consolidated basis, what we'd expect is organic operating income growth of 5% and then an incremental 3% from capital deployment, whether that be share repurchases or M&A. So we'd expect EPS growth of 8% on a consolidated basis. Of course, that's x COVID. So you'd have to start by taking '22 and subtracting out the $0.70 expected benefit from COVID and then grow 8% from there and then add back in whatever the assumption would be for COVID in 2023.  And we're seeing a lot of the drivers in 2022 continue to be drivers in 2023, continued strength in our U.S. businesses. Clearly, our leadership in specialty will continue to benefit us. And then when it comes to international, as I said, we're seeing the business is performing well with good fundamentals. Now 2 things that we are monitoring in international: of course, our FX, which you've mentioned; and inflation also. And both those things will impact fiscal year '23. And there have been some offsets to FX in fiscal year '22, including the price adjustments that we saw in the developing country, Turkey, which have helped to offset some of the impacts in fiscal year '22.  And when we report fiscal year '23 results, and when we're discussing international, we'll discuss it on a constant currency basis in addition to a as-reported basis. But overall, we feel very good about '23 as where we've done doing our planning. We're going through a detailed planning process now, and we feel very good about '23 and feel very good about the fundamentals in the business. And as I said before, there's really kind of no change to our initial thinking that we talked about at Investor Day, x COVID operating income, organic growth of 5% and an incremental 3% from capital deployment or EPS growth of 8%.
Steven Collis: Yes. Lisa, on the biosimilars, we continue to see positive trends in biosimilars. In fact, there was a recent announcement in the ophthalmology space, which is our sweet spot the Part B side, and we'll see how that goes. We'll certainly keep you updated. Therapeutic comparability and good contracting support are helping enable physician utilization and taking cost out of the system, which will make more room for innovation. And we are very encouraged by the biosimilar. We don't specifically call it out, but it's part of the general growth of our strong specialty position in health systems and in physician practices, including oncology. But as we just had noted in ophthalmology, we're going to see an important launch as well.  So we also are noting regulatory enhancements, including interchangeability, on some of the molecules. So this is a very dynamic space in which AmerisourceBergen was clearly an early adopter, and we expect to strongly participate in the system in the launch of these drugs, particularly on the Part B side. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher at Nephron Research.
Eric Percher: I'd like to drill into Turkey just a little bit more. And I know that operators that you have, have long experience in international. So question one would be what you're seeing in Turkey with hyperinflation and the price adjustment, have you seen this in other countries before? And maybe I'll ask you if you can just once more help us on the mechanics on the P&L.  And then on the balance sheet, am I right in seeing the adjustment this quarter as completely related to the balance sheet, the $28 million? And is that a revaluation owing to the hyperinflation?
James Cleary: Yes, sure. I'd be happy to take that question, and thank you for asking it. And first of all, I think you're absolutely right. We've been very pleased with the management team at Alliance. And of course, they have a lot of experience in their markets and really have just shown a lot of expertise in managing the business.  With regard to your question on the Turkey high inflation accounting, which was covered in our press release today, very importantly, there's no change in how we translate the P&L of Alliance Healthcare's Turkish subsidiary in our adjusted results. The -- just as you were saying, and when you asked the question, the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments relate to the accounting impact of remeasuring various components of their balance sheet. And of course, on a consolidated basis, Turkey is a very small part of our overall results, but I will get into a little bit more detail here.  The GAAP accounting items driven by Turkey becoming a highly inflationary economy is fine under U.S. GAAP. And the result is remeasurement of lira-denominated assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date using the U.S. dollar exchange rate then in effect, and that impacts recorded in our P&L. And previously, that translation was recorded as an adjustment to their -- to equity on our balance sheet.  And there is a detailed discussion of this in our 10-Q, but I think very importantly, there's no change in how we translate the P&L of Alliance's Turkish subsidiary and our adjusted results.
Eric Percher: And with respect to the P&L, it sounds like the adjustment being made by the manufacturer, it's in their interest to make that adjustment given hyperinflation. You don't really have a bearing on that, but it helps offset. Is that the right way to think of it?
James Cleary: Yes. And so the way that it works there is due to the due to the currency devaluation that's happened, there's an annual price increase that happens. And that annual price increase is based on the value of the Turkish lira versus a basket of currencies, and that price increase happens every year. And this year, that price increase was particularly large, and there's actually been 2 of them because the devaluation has been higher than typical.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee at Cowen.
Charles Rhyee: I just wanted to follow up on international a little bit more and maybe fold into what Eric was asking, but -- so you maintain the full year alliance EBIT guide, right, 6 85 to 7 15. And I think, Jim, you said last quarter, because of the currency headwind, you expect to kind of come in towards the lower end, it sounds like now you're saying that currency has gone even worse. We're maintaining the guidance. So clearly, it kind of suggests that underlying operating performance has been better.  I guess 2 questions has been -- when we think about the modeling fiscal '23, should we be -- and assuming currency stays flat, are we actually -- should be modeling on a constant currency basis, let's say, an EBIT profile that's higher than the 6 85 to 7 15 range? And then secondly, or is some of this -- how much of the benefit that keeps us in the range is coming from maybe something like Turkey?
James Cleary: Yes, sure. And so there are really 2 things that keep us in the range. One is the second price increase in Turkey that we talked about. And then really the other thing is just very strong performance out of World Courier. We're seeing just a particularly strong performance there World Courier has had a long history of growth and good margins. And what we've seen in the most recent quarter is higher weights of World Courier shipments and also World Courier of receiving good value from manufacturers for the services that we provide. And so those are really the 2 things that are enabling us to maintain our guidance for the international business and fully offset what we've seen from an FX standpoint.  And like I said, when we talked about fiscal year '23 and report fiscal year '23, we'll do that and talk about it on both a constant currency basis and an as-reported basis.
Charles Rhyee: Great. And just a follow-up on World Courier. Obviously, you've been highlighting how strong it's been performing. When you look at some of the CROs that have been reporting, some have talked about potential slowdown in R&D just kind of delays or cancellations, others seem to have reported fine results. Just maybe what you're seeing in sort of the clinical trial space as it relates to World Courier.
Steven Collis: So thanks. We did have a strong quarter with World Courier as we've got a bunch of higher weight shipments, and the team is driving value on incremental services we provide, including our home direct patient services, which are important for in-home trials, and there's certainly been a development out of the pandemic. But World Courier's expertise and reputation in helping customers navigate the complexity of global logistics is very well established. We've owned the business for coming on 10 years now. And I'm proud of the investment we have made in allowing World Courier to deliver best-in-class solutions while seeing a rapid growth. And there's been a really long history of growth and good margins. which we expect to continue into Q4 and hopefully into next year and the future as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Valiquette at Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: So just a couple of interrelated questions on generic drug pricing. Yes. Just for some of the third-party data that's tracked by investors, there was a bit of an inflection in recent months on some moderation of generic drug price deflation. I guess I'm just wondering if you're also seeing any changes from your new point of the market? And then also tie it into this, is there any early view that generic drug manufacturers are maybe looking to raise prices to offset some of the inflation that they're seeing in their own higher cost of generic drug manufacturing?
James Cleary: Yes. So with regard to your question on generic deflation, it's been in line with the past few years. It's been in line with our expectations. Supply and demand remain in balance. And as we talked about before, our business is not as reliant on generic pricing as it has been in the past. Our teams have done a very good job of rebalancing contracts and ensuring that we receive fair compensation across brand, generic and specialty, which is important, especially as more specialty goes through mail and retail.  And with regard to potential generic inflation, there certainly are higher input costs for manufacturers and it remains to be seen if they'll be able to pass on the higher cost. We're not currently expecting generic inflation. But if that does occur, of course, it would be a tailwind for our business. But as a reminder, as I said due to our contract rebalancing our business model isn't as reliant on generic pricing as it once was. Thank you for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.
Kevin Caliendo: First, I guess, on the Animal Health segment and MWI, on a year-over-year basis, was the contribution better or worse? What's happening with that business in terms of growth and margin on a year-over-year basis? And then as a follow-up, you mentioned that ophthalmology, you're seeing encouraging signs in the ophthalmology business. What exactly do you mean by that? Is that biosimilar possibilities? Or is that just straight supply/demand?
Steven Collis: I can start with the ophthalmology business, and then we'll let Jim who's the expert, of course, on MWI, talk about it. Our specialty physician services business. We have talked a lot about increasing our services to other physicians. As the formulary increases as there's more products available in the administration area, and probably ophthalmology is our second largest area after oncology. That's been an area where we've been very involved particularly with the launch of  many years ago was really what got us into that business. And we continue to develop services.  And as they are biosimilars and as there are more therapies available for in-office administration and physicians have, for over a decade, become used to administering products, there's more relevance for what we call our IPN network and our basic medical distribution, which are fundamental parts of our SBS business. So we see growth there and we see a high market share, which we've always enjoyed in that segment, consistent with or even higher than our oncology market share rate. So it's just a robust area for us. And particularly, we look forward to the opportunity to assist physicians in adopting biosimilars. So that's really -- Jim, hand over to you on MWI.
James Cleary: Yes. So during the quarter, MWI had growth during the quarter, had revenue growth during the quarter, but that -- but the growth rate was lower than it had been in fiscal year '20 or '21. And of course, as you well know, there are a lot of pet adoptions during the pandemic and really good growth in the companion animal business, in particular, during the first part of the pandemic. And so some of the comps were a little bit tougher now for MWI. But it still had growth in that. And it's a very strong business, and we have kind of very good confidence in the long-term prospects of both the animal health market and our MWI business.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hill at Deutsche Bank.
George Hill: And I hopped on a little bit late, so I apologize if you guys covered this. But Jim, maybe could you talk about the outlook for COVID therapies as it looks like the COVID market is going to prove to be a little bit more durable than we might have thought 3 or 5 months ago. So maybe kind of the contribution of COVID therapy is the evolution and how you guys are thinking about durability.
James Cleary: Yes, I'll start out here. We've been really transparent about our contribution from COVID therapies. And in Q3, our contribution from COVID therapies was $0.14 on an -- for EPS versus $0.03 in the same quarter last year as we -- we're shifting volumes of the government-owned emergency-use authorization pills. And that's -- and we're kind of keeping our guidance for the full year in the U.S. of $0.60 and, on a consolidated basis, $0.70 including international.  And so if we -- compared to what we would have thought a year ago, it's certainly been a lot more durable than we would have thought. And it is something that is hard to predict and estimate. And so that's why when we talk about our guidance for fiscal year '23, we say we'll do our guidance x COVID and that 8% EPS growth rate -- the x COVID back out COVID grow 8% and then make an assumption for COVID and add that on top.
Steven Collis: Yes. One other point, we were pleased to see the FDA update to EUA for Paxlovid, making it easier for patients to access treatments at pharmacies. And we're really proud of the increased role that pharmacists will be playing in patient care. And I think that, that's -- as I said in my prepared remarks, that's a tremendous access to consumers and patients as they look to access these treatments conveniently.  So when we think about living our purpose during the pandemic, there's nothing more there's nothing that embodies it more than the work we've done with these EUA products, and AmerisourceBergen and our associates are tremendously proud of it. So this is definitely something that has been distinguishing us in the last couple of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice at Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: I might just take a second and ask you about the capital priorities and any updated thoughts on that. I know you've called out that you continue to pay down debt that you took on associated with clients, and you also highlighted continued availability for share repurchases. Maybe just updated thoughts on priorities looking out over the next 6 to 12 months and anything else that will be a major consumption or outlay point for capital deployment.
James Cleary: Yes. So yes. So our capital deployment approach, of course, remains similar to what it's been for quite some time, of course, investing in the business where we have great returns, strategic M&A, share repurchases, of course, having a reasonable dividend on our stock, and we've steadily increased the dividend that we paid. We have been paying down debt, and we will meet or beat our time frame for paying down 2/3 of the Alliance acquisition debt. And also, we started repurchasing shares earlier than we anticipated. We started repurchasing shares. In the month of May, we saw a good opportunity to do that. We've repurchased about 250 million during the quarter. And as a Board meeting after that, our Board increased our share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. So we have about $1.1 billion in total authorizations now, and we would look forward to any share repurchase opportunities in fiscal year '23.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn over to CEO, Steve Collis, for any final remarks.
Steven Collis: Thank you, everyone, for your attention on this busy Wednesday morning. AmerisourceBergen and Jim and I and Bennett are pleased and proud to have delivered another strong quarter and another guidance raise. Our business, our talent and our capabilities we have been on show throughout this quarter and throughout the pandemic and, historically, throughout various economic cycles, AmerisourceBergen has demonstrated tremendous resilience. We are well positioned strategically with a strong track record of execution to continue to deliver long-term value for all of our stakeholders. This concludes our remarks. Thank you for your time.
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-05-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning or good afternoon all. Welcome to the AmerisourceBergen Corporation Fiscal 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Rajam , and I’ll be your operator today. . I will now hand over to your host, Bennett Murphy, Head of Investor Relations to begin. So, Bennett please go ahead when you’re ready.
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen’s Fiscal 2022 Second Quarter Results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today’s call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today’s press release which is available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. We’ve also posted a slide presentation to accompany today’s press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including but not limited, to EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today’s press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the express permission of the company. You’ll have an opportunity to ask questions after today’s remarks by management. We ask that you limit your question to one per participant in order to for us to get through as many participants as possible within the hour. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on opioid-related litigation. As previously disclosed on April 2, the comprehensive settlement agreement to settle a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities became effective. 46 of 49 eligible states as one of the district of Colombia and all the eligible territories as well as over 98% of eligible subdivisions in the states agreed to participate in the settlement. Additionally, we have reached an agreement for a settlement with the state of Washington that is consistent with the state's allocations under the comprehensive settlement agreement. That brings the total number of states settling opioid-related claims to 47 or 49 eligible states. We are encouraged by this progress and we look forward to providing further updates as they become available. Turning now to our second quarter of fiscal 2022. I am excited to discuss our results and the continued progress we are making on our strategic imperatives. During the quarter, revenue was up 17% over the prior year to $58 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by 30% and adjusted EPS grew by 27%. Our exceptional results reflect continuous positive momentum across our business as we delivered high levels of execution and capitalize on the strength of our differentiated value proposition, including our broad set of leading capabilities, deep customer relationships innovative manufacturer solutions and expanded global footprint. In the US, our leadership in specialty continues to differentiate our own best distribution capabilities, portfolio of preeminent customers and integration of innovative solutions allows us to serve both manufacturers and providers, meeting the unique needs while providing a vital connection to help improve patient outcomes and access. To beneficiate manufacturers and providers, we recently launched an enhanced digital dashboard offering, a new world-class three-way digital portal that streamlined core specialty GPO processes, improved data accuracy and availability and enhances transparency. With real-time data at their fingertips, manufacturers gain visibility into market trends, and providers are better able to streamline their operations. This is yet another example of how our teams are embracing their intellectual confidence and leveraging our data and analytics capabilities to move the industry forward, building upon our strong legacy upgrade solutions and services that meet the unique needs of our partners. In addition to our continued efforts to enhance our solutions portfolio, our manufacturer services teams have been realigned to streamline our contracting and engagement with biopharmaceutical manufacturers with the goal of forming broader and more robust relationships. With our ability to offer a full suite of market-leading capabilities from market access and distribution to patient access and adherence, we are uniquely positioned to be a key partner for biopharmaceutical manufacturers and providers. Our prominence and market presence have uniquely positioned AmerisourceBegen to leverage our platform and capabilities to support the global response to the pandemic, and we are proud to have played a simple role in supporting pandemic efforts globally. Our contributions have included providing specialized logistics services, facilitating access to testing and distributing millions of doses of vaccines in over 30 countries across four continents. In the US, we have worked with government and manufacturer partners to distribute COVID-19 antibody and antiviral therapies, including the oral COVID treatments. We have also supported services that pharmacies have provided to their communities throughout the pandemic, including education, testing and vaccinations. In fact, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network recently allocated its five million COVID-19 dose as part of the Federal Retail pharmacy program for COVID-19 vaccination. Since February of 2021, Good Neighbor Pharmacy has helped more than 1,600 independent community pharmacies in 45 states, Puerto Rico and Guam to participate in this federal program. We actively support continued patient access to care provided by pharmacies, including pandemic related services that have helped to keep communities safe and advocate for expanded provider status to keep communities healthy over the long-term. Increasingly important providers of family and community care are those who care for our pets. In our Animal Health business, we are similarly building on our relationship with veterinarians to help them access the pharmaceuticals, health care products and suppliers, they need to serve their patients. We work side-by-side with veterinary practices to automate and streamline processes to improve their efficiency, enabling them to maximize time spent with patients and improve outcomes. Our MWI Easy Care program, for example, helps veterinary practices improve access and adherence to their patients' preventative care plans while introducing automation to remove the burden of administrative and marketing processes. By offering standard-setting technology solutions in both the companion animal and production animal health markets, such as inventory management, life beating technology and enhanced tracking capabilities, we are uniquely able to capture the growth opportunities ahead as the human-pet connection continues to strengthen and as the global demand for protein continues to grow. Turning to our International business segment. We delivered another quarter of growth as we maintained our strong momentum. Our best-in-class global specialty logistics services business remain focused on supporting manufacturers with global clinical trials and on ensuring temperature-sensitive shipments arrived on time and at the right temperature. Our specialty supply chain services team supported partners across the healthcare landscape by providing end-to-end transport solutions that enhance supply chain efficiently and allow customers to focus on bringing life-changing treatments to patients around the world. Our team at Alliance Healthcare provided high levels of execution and leverage their local expertise to further deepen customer relationships, provide innovative solutions to customers and partners and support the global pharmaceutical supply chain to improve patient access and outcomes. As we continue to work to integrate systems and teams, we expect to find more opportunities to work together and capitalize on the full power of our combined platform to provide value-added solutions to stakeholders and capture the substantial growth opportunities we see ahead. As we move into the second half of 2022, we remain focused on carrying this momentum forward and building on our core strength by advancing our strategic imperatives of leading with market leaders, leveraging our infrastructure to increase efficiency access and the customer experience, investing in innovation to further drive our differentiation, expanding on our leadership in specialty and contributing to healthier outcomes around the world Our global base of key anchor customers and our strategic partnership model allows us to integrate ourselves into our customers' operations and deepen our relationship with market leaders across the healthcare supply chain. With our portfolio of innovative solutions, extensive industry knowledge, world-class teams and a forward-thinking innovative mindset, we are able to form long-term relationships as we help our customers navigate the healthcare challenges of today and anticipate the opportunities of tomorrow. Our strong customer relationships are supported by expansive and market-leading infrastructure, which helps us facilitate patient access wherever a prescription is needed and to improve efficiency across the pharmaceutical supply chain. Since the onset of COVID, we have demonstrated the value of our different operating model and our vital role connecting key stakeholders across the healthcare system. From supporting government preparedness for current and future potential pharmaceutical needs to ensuring health equity and vaccine access globally, I remain inspired by the way our team members have adapted, collaborated and innovative to support patient needs. Innovation remains an important element in our ability to respond to the rapidly changing health care environment and to support the advancement of our customers' businesses. In keeping with our commitment to innovation, we recently established a venture capital fund through, which we will support old ideas globally in areas such as the future of pharmacy and distribution, clinical development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and practice solutions for health care providers and veterinarians. We are excited to formalize the process of leveraging our deep expertise and broad networks of relationships to support forward-thinking companies as they identify innovative solutions that can benefit AmerisourceBegen partners and the patients they serve. The venture capital fund is another example of our continued efforts to enhance and grow our platforms across health care channels. Sometimes that conduit is best served by partnering with smaller entrepreneurial companies to help them reach their full potential. Importantly, our venture capital fund will invest in companies that amplified innovation themes I have been discussing today. Pharmaceutical innovation is advancing at an exceptionally rapid pace, particularly in the specialty and sell and deed market, where we continue to differentiate ourselves as the market leader. During the quarter, we, along with our partner, TrakCel, the leading innovator of cellular orchestration solutions unveiled an integrated technology platform designed to accelerate patient access to prescribe cell and gene therapies and to deliver complete visibility throughout the treatment journey. The platform increases connectivity between the sub-patient services and providers, resulting in a seamless and timely exchange of benefits and eligibility information that expedites patient enrollment and support, ultimately, helping patients start on therapy sooner. This partnership is an example of how we are leveraging the full breadth of our strength in specialty to create innovative solutions for patient access to promising new therapies. By offering differentiated solutions for pharmaceutical innovators, we further our position as a key pillar supporting global pharmaceutical innovation. As a global health care solutions leader, we leverage our expanded footprint, our expertise in all phases of pharmaceutical development and our investments across the pharmaceutical supply chain to contribute to positive pharmaceutical driven outcome. This work is caused our purpose and who we are as a company. As an organization, we are 42,000 purpose-driven team members, uniting our responsibility to create healthier futures. Our team members perform inspiring work every day, and we are focused on supporting the continued growth and development within AmerisourceBegen. We know that to empower our team, we must operate with transparency and greater culture that values diversity, inclusivity and belonging. Our recent disclosures reflect our focus on transparency. We provide enhanced human capital disclosures in our most recent 10-K, and we have separately disclosed our EEO-1 report. In our most recent global sustainability report, we disclosed our gender pay debt in the United States, which revealed that for every dollar made employees are paid, female employees in AmerisourceBergen are paid $0.994, we are proud of this statistic that demonstrate what we believe are by our culture and the way we respect and value our team members is being validated by more extensive data insights. As a further reflection on both my personal dedication and AmerisourceBegen's united commitment to advancing equal gender rights and opportunities, I was honored to sign the CEO statement of support for the United States Nations Women's Empowerment Principles in March. We believe management and our Board's commitment to diverse exclusive and equitable culture is working and look forward to continuing to share our progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. One of the ways we have identified to further our progress is in assisting credible efforts to improve health equity in our communities. For example, the AmerisourceBergen Foundation has been a long-standing partner to the National Association of School Nurses to optimize student health and learning by advancing the practices of school nursing. Recently, we expanded upon our support for education by sponsoring a supply chain elective course at Xavier University of Louisiana's College of Pharmacy, a top-ranked historically black University and a top educator of black pharmacists in the country. By investing in tomorrow's diverse healthcare leaders, we are making a meaningful impact in promoting inclusivity and equity in our communities. We invite you to visit our Global Sustainability microsite and ESG Reporting Index to view the data, strategies and stories, representative of our diverse and inclusion journey. As a purpose-driven global organization, we are also closely tracking global events and their impact on the communities where we live and work. The conflict in Ukraine is a solely continuation of the challenges of the past few years, and I think their view of our colleagues who are based there. Teams within our business in our global business resilience organization are in active communication to do everything possible to ensure the safety of our colleagues on the ground in Ukraine. Our associated systems fund, which supports team members facing financial hardship due to events outside their control, has provided financial assistance to the Ukraine-based team members as well as team members around the world while supporting immediate families in the conflict zone. Team members from 29 countries and counting are stepping up to provide financial support to help address the humanitarian crisis in and around Ukraine through our matching gift program. Additionally, the AmerisourceBegen Foundation has provided financial donations and our business globally is providing product donations to support both human and animal health in the region. We join organizations from around the world in our hope for a timely and peaceful end to the conflict. At the same time, I find strength and confidence and the fact that our organization has never been better positioned to positively impact our communities and that we are living our purpose. As we continue to be united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, we are building on our strong momentum across our business and delivering on our strategic priorities to further strengthen our relationship with our customers, advanced global pharmaceutical innovation and enhance our differentiated value proposition. I'm thankful and grateful for the commitment and performance of our 42,000 purpose-driven team members who helped our partners and customers navigate the increasingly complex and evolving global health care landscape. AmerisourceBergen is a global health care solutions leader that is focused and executing to advance pharmaceutical innovation and access to create a positive impact on the health of people and communities around the world. We move into the second half of our fiscal work with significant momentum and are well-positioned to continue creating significant long-term value for our shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to Jim for a quarter 2022 results and to discuss our updated financial guidance. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Thank you, Steve, and thank you all for joining us on today's call. Before I turn to our results, as usual, my comments will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year March quarter. For more details on our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release. AmerisourceBergen delivered exceptional results in our second quarter, as our pharmaceutical-centric strategy continued to drive strong performance across our business. Our long-term leadership in specialty and commitment to delivering innovative solutions for our partners continue to be key differentiators in our fundamental long-term strategic imperatives. Our purpose-driven team members have worked diligently to support our stakeholders, which has driven our strong results. Turning now to our second quarter results. AmerisourceBergen finished the quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22, a 27% increase with strong operating income growth in both our US Healthcare Solutions segment and International Healthcare Solutions segment. Our consolidated revenue grew 17% to $57.7 billion, driven by revenue growth in both segments. Consolidated gross profit increased 47% to $2.2 billion as a result of increases in gross profit in both segments. Gross profit margin grew by 76 basis points to 3.84% driven by the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and the increase in the US Healthcare Solutions segment. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.3 billion, up from $806 million as a result of higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses and depreciation expense primarily due to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Consolidated operating income was $917 million, up 30%. The increase was driven by operating income growth in both segments, which I will touch on in more detail when discussing segment level results. Turning now to interest expense and the income tax rate. Net interest expense was $53 million in the quarter, an increase of 53% due to an increase in debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Our effective income tax rate was 21% compared to 21.9% in the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count increased 2.3% to 212 million shares as a result of dilution related to employee compensation and the June 2021 issuance of 2 million shares to Walgreens Boots Alliance in connection with our acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, adjusted free cash flow was $951 million for the first half of fiscal 2022. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash, including $500 million of restricted cash on our balance sheet. In the quarter, we repaid our $250 million term loan prior to its maturity date in line with our commitment to the rating agencies to pay down two-thirds of the debt issued to acquire Alliance Healthcare. As a reminder, we committed to pay down $2 billion in debt within two years of closing the acquisition, and we are well on track to achieve this debt paydown by March 2023, ahead of schedule. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our second quarter segment level results. Starting with our US Healthcare Solutions segment. Segment revenue increased by 5.8% to approximately $51 billion, driven by a broad increase in sales across our portfolio, including growth in sales to specialty physician practices, offsetting an over $300 million decline in sales of commercial COVID-19 therapies. Revenue from US Human Health was $49.8 billion, representing growth of 5.8%. Revenue from our animal health business was $1.2 billion, up 3.9% year-over-year as many veterinary practices were closed or had limited hours in January, carrying into February due to COVID-related staffing issues. The animal health market continues to have good fundamentals supported by high levels of pet ownership and spending and increasing global demand for protein, which we expect to be enduring trends in the coming years. Segment operating income was $730 million, representing growth of 11.4% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by the important work we are doing to distribute COVID treatments and good performance across our businesses. Our Manufacture Solutions businesses rebounded during the quarter, in line with my commentary from last quarter's earnings call. Our human health distribution businesses continued to benefit from prescription growth across the market, underscoring the resilience and importance of our industry. The segment also benefited from our important work supporting COVID therapy distribution across the country, which meaningfully contributed to our strong growth and margin expansion. US Healthcare Solutions segment operating income margin increased 7 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to fees earned relating to the distribution of government-owned COVID treatments. As it relates to the COVID therapy impact on the quarter, the contribution was higher than previously expected for the quarter and contributed $0.22 to EPS, resulting in a $0.15 tailwind over the prior year quarter. We view this higher than expected contribution in the second quarter as a pull-forward. Our full year expectations for COVID contribution are generally unchanged. For fiscal 2022, we are estimating the contribution from coated treatments in the US to be around $0.60 for the full year. We are working closely with a variety of stakeholders to ensure the treatments reach areas where they are most needed and are encouraged by efforts to make them more accessible, especially as supply improves. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $6.8 billion, including $5.6 billion in revenue from Alliance Healthcare and high-teens growth for the balance of International Healthcare Solutions segment. Segment operating income for the second quarter was $187 million, up 261% on a reported basis. Alliance Healthcare has continued its strong performance and like the rest of AmerisourceBergen, the pharmaceutical centric nature of the business positions it well to continue delivering solid operating performance. A strong team at Alliance Healthcare continues to impress with their ability to operate through challenges in the region. In addition to the solid performance and execution, the collaboration between our teams globally continues to impress and positions us well to capitalize on long-term synergy opportunities going to market with differentiated global solutions. The strong results in the quarter for the International segment in the face of significant foreign exchange pressure, as well as supply chain cost pressure are a testament to the resilience of the business and underscore the importance of our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. This completes the review of our segment level results. Now I will turn to our updated fiscal 2022 guidance. As a result of our strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year and to reflect continued momentum in the second half, we are raising our fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS guidance from a range of $10.60 to $10.90 to a new guidance range of $10.80 to $11.05, reflecting growth of 17% to 19% from the prior fiscal year, resulting from the increase in our expectations for full year consolidated operating income. In the US Healthcare Solutions segment, we are increasing operating income guidance to be in the range of $2.42 billion to $2.48 billion, representing growth of 7% to 10%. As I said earlier, the US Healthcare Solutions segment operating income includes around a $0.60 full year contribution from COVID-19 treatment distribution, which is generally in line with the COVID treatment expectation we had embedded in last quarter's guidance. The increased guidance for this segment is a result of the continued operating strength and resilience of businesses in the segment, which has been on full display throughout the pandemic. Turning now to international health care solutions. There is no change in our full year guidance for this segment despite the significant foreign exchange pressure caused by the relative strength of the US dollar. Let me take a moment to highlight a few of the key items that impact the comparison between the first and second half. First, our guidance contemplates that the dollar remains strong in the second half of our fiscal year. Our International Healthcare segment's businesses are performing well including Alliance Healthcare, which is performing above expectations at our original budgeted foreign exchange rates; assuming exchange rates in the month of April continue for the second half of the fiscal year, the foreign exchange impact on our actual dollar results for the full year would be north of $80 million when comparing expectations versus constant currency, meaning using the prior year exchange rates. And with April exchange rates, we would expect to finish closer to the bottom of our segment guidance range. Second, while the dollar has been a headwind, favorable manufacturer price adjustments this quarter in one of our developing market countries have more than offset the negative impact of the decline in value of local currency. These annual price adjustments are generally in line with local levels of inflation, but were higher in the current year as a result of the significant decline in value of local currency. Third, the vaccination support work being done by Innomar in Canada and Alliance Healthcare in Europe is expected to contribute around $0.10 to our fiscal 2022, with almost all of it having already incurred in the first half of the fiscal year. Innomar's partnership with FedEx to support Canadian vaccination efforts has been important work and represents a small portion of that $0.10. Alliance Healthcare has played a significant role in the European COVID response across its footprint, distributing vaccines and COVID test to pharmacies and other sites of care throughout Europe. We expect the contribution from this activity to largely subside in the second half as COVID-19 moves away from the emergency phase of the pandemic. The contribution from this important work has largely offset supply chain cost pressure in the first half. Finally, we received regulatory approval on our sale of Profarma specialty in Brazil, which we called out on the November earnings call. The business contributed over $0.04 to the International segment in the first half of fiscal 2022. Overall, in the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we believe it is impressive that we are able to reiterate the full year actual dollar contribution from the segment in spite of the substantial foreign exchange pressure. Without the negative impact of foreign exchange, we would be raising our full year guidance for International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income. As a result of the increase in our US Healthcare Solutions operating income guidance and results in the International Healthcare Solutions segment largely mitigating the foreign exchange headwind, we are raising our expectations for consolidated operating income growth to be at least in the high teens percent range, up from growth in the high teens percent range. This includes approximately $0.70 of consolidated benefit related to our work supporting COVID-19 treatment and vaccine distribution across our footprint. Before I conclude my prepared remarks today, I would like to briefly touch on one of our ESG initiatives. The importance of business resiliency has become more clear than ever as the world around us continues to change and become more complex. Maintaining resilient and stable operations is a key focus as we navigate environmental challenges and to fill our vital social role. To ensure the safety and the stability of the delay of the pharmaceutical supply chain, we maintain robust business continuity practices that include monitoring for potential threats that could impact our business, such as climate related and geopolitical events. This work supported by the outputs of the physical risk assessment of our top locations, enables strong continuity plans to support our critical role of delivering life-saving medications every day. In closing, I have been and continue to be inspired by the strength and resilience of our business and the value created by our team members, robust partnerships, innovative solutions and pharmaceutical-centric strategy. We are well-positioned to continue driving sustainable long-term growth and to deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. And I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A. Operator?
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question today comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question and all the color on the quarter. I guess in terms of -- I heard what you said about the contribution from COVID therapies in the quarter and the unchanged expectations for the full year and you're seeing that as a pull-forward. Can you maybe in a little bit more detail, talk us through the other puts and takes as you see things progressing in the back half of the year? Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Yeah, sure. Thanks a lot for that question. And I'll start out by saying that we're really pleased that we're able to increase full year guidance of three key metrics: consolidated operating income, and US Healthcare Solutions segment operating income and EPS. And also note, as I said that we would be increasing our operating income guidance for the International Healthcare Solutions segment, if not for the negative impact of foreign exchange. And the reasons for the increase in guidance were the stronger-than-expected performance in several businesses. And as I said, the increase in FY 2022 guidance is not due to the important COVID treatment distribution work that we're doing. It's -- that contribution from COVID products distribution was higher than expected in the second quarter, but we view that as a pull-forward and our full year expectations from COVID product distribution are largely unchanged around $0.60 in the US and $0.10 internationally. So $0.70 on a consolidated basis, which was about what we were expecting three months ago when we provided guidance a few months ago. And so what we're seeing in the US Healthcare Solutions segment is increasing guide due to broad-based performance across several businesses, and we expect that to continue. Notably, specialty physician services, prescription growth across our businesses and the recovery in manufacturer solutions. So those are three key components that enabled us to increase guidance and we'd expect strong performance to continue there. In International Healthcare Solutions, there are a number of moving pieces that I mentioned that impact guidance. Importantly, we talked about the impact of FX and the strong dollar, and we sized that at north of $80 million on a constant currency basis. Our guidance assumes that the April FX rates hold for the balance of the year. And so that's a moving piece. I noted hat we benefited from a manufacturer price adjustment in a developing country. And for the full year, that price increase fully offsets the decline in value of that local currency. In International, as I mentioned, we have $0.10 of COVID product benefit, most of which occurred in the first half of the year. And then also one thing impacting our International guidance is the sale of Profarma Specialty in Brazil, which contributed $0.04 in the first half of 2022. And I think talking about International, a key point to make about our International segment is that it's performing better than expected at the initially budgeted FX rates. And finally, you mentioned COVID contribution. And I think we've been very transparent about the COVID treatment contribution. And so we'll continue to be transparent with that. It contributed about $0.22 in the second quarter, $0.32 in the first half and $0.60 for the full year is our expectation all these sensor for the US. And kind of the way that we come up with that estimate is for each product, we estimate the full year volume, calculate the full year contribution, there's significant volume from government-owned antivirals. And we assume that most are distributed. We're not factoring in all the volume that we expect to receive by the end of September, but we assume that we distribute most of that by the end of September. So those are some of the key assumptions that go into our guidance, some of the key moving pieces, and we'll continue to be transparent both in the US and internationally in terms of the contribution from COVID products. But I think the most important takeaway is that overall, we feel very good about our momentum and guidance increase, which is driven by stronger-than-expected performance across several businesses.
Operator: The next question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Lisa, please go ahead. Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Lisa Gill: Good morning. Thanks for all the detail Jim. I just want to go in a little bit deeper on a couple of things that you talked about. One, when you talked about specialties to the physician office, are you seeing uptake in biosimilars? And is that helping to drive the profitability? Secondly, we've heard some rumblings around some product shortages on the generic side. Clearly, China shut down once again, are you seeing any type of inflationary environment on the generic side that's helping to drive the numbers at all? And then just lastly, when you call out the $0.70, how do you think about that for 2023? Are you calling that out for us? So -- do you think it repeats itself in years going forward, or should we think about that as a one-time here in 2022?
Jim Cleary: Okay. So there are, I think, three things there. Biosimilars and then I think drug pricing and then kind of the $0.70 on COVID therapies and what we would expect for the for the future. So on biosimilars, it's clearly -- it's been benefiting us in our specialty businesses and particularly our specialty physician services businesses, and we expect there to be continued growth and benefit there.  Biosimilars, as we've mentioned, particularly in that part of the business are profitable part of the business for us with strong margins. And so the trends and benefits that we're seeing there are quite positive and we'd expect it to be enduring. With regard to drug pricing overall, and I think your question was mostly around generics is there's really nothing new to call out. Overall, the deflation rates are relatively in line with the last couple of years. We expect that to continue throughout our fiscal year from a supply and demand standpoint, supply and demand dynamics remain generally in balance. And as we talked about, a really important point is that our business model is not as reliant on generic pricing as it once it was in the past, our leadership team has done a very good job of rebalancing contracts to have balanced profitability process portfolio of pharmaceuticals, including brand, generics and specialty to make sure we receive fair compensation in all those areas. So really nothing new to call out on the pricing side. And then with regard to the $0.70 benefit from COVID products. Of course, $0.60 of that is COVID treatments in the US and $0.10 of that for this fiscal year is international vaccines and other products. We just wanted to be really transparent to call that out and we'll be -- and we'll continue to be transparent in future quarters in 2022, and I would expect in 2023, calling out what our COVID treatment benefits are. And it's something that, as you can imagine, is to a large extent, beyond our control. And so it's hard to predict what the volumes are going to be next year. And so that's one of the reasons, Lisa, why we continue to be transparent in giving the specific numbers.
Operator: The next question is from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Charles, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Charles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. If I could just follow-up, Jim, on the COVID, at least in US Health, if we think about the remainder of the $0.60, I think you did about $0.10 in the first quarter. We're talking about the $0.22 here. Should we -- are you -- is that more weighted here into the June quarter, or are you thinking about it more evenly through the rest of the year? And was the benefit mostly in January, I think Omicron really peaked in January and then really tailed off. What are you seeing here? And how is that demand given that when you look, testing volumes have been falling even though as cases rise a bit, there's not as much people finding out whether they have COVID or not. How does that impact how you get treatments out to folks? Thanks.
Jim Cleary: Yeah. Great questions. So you're absolutely right in the numbers. We've made $0.32 in the US from COVID treatments in the first half of the year, which was $0.22 in the most recent quarter and $0.10 in the first quarter, and our expectation is $0.60 for the year. As we look at volumes in the back half of the year, a significant amount of the volume is the government-owned antivirals, which have become increasingly available. And yeah, we did see good volume. You asked about the month of January. We did see good volume during the month of January during omicron, but as the antivirals have increasingly become available, and there's actions that increase access for those products, we would expect to see sales throughout the year. And our current estimates are that -- it's not like it's weighted towards the third quarter or the fourth quarter. It's roughly equal in both the quarters. And I think Steve has a couple of comments he wants to make.
Steve Collis: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So as has been well-documented, COVID case counts have fallen since the winter when there was a high number of cases and very limited supply of oral treatments. AmerisourceBergen stands ready to distribute treatments with our most needed. Pharmacies and other care providers have recognized the value of stocking these oral products and their long shelf lives and effectiveness against new variants has been helpful in driving demand and awareness for the products. And we are encouraged by efforts announced by the administration to make it easier for patients to access these treatments, including expanding test and treatment initiatives at pharmacies. And Good Neighbor Pharmacy has been very helpful in assisting their pharmacists and the critical roles in the community. So -- we -- as we said, we've credited to many of our members, and we are very enthusiastic about the role for community pharmacy in combating the next phase of the pandemic. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Steven, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks, good morning. So just regarding the success over the past year or two of your physician-related GPO operations. Is there any update on the -- or change on the percent share of the per unit economics that are flowing to ABC from the – that specialty drug procurement you're doing for your physician customers, or is it status quo on the profit algorithm? And also has that contribution still growing meaningfully year-over-year? Just want to get a little more color around that. Thanks.
Steve Collis: Yes. Steve, we're kind of all scratching our heads here. No. So there's definitely -- there's more oral products, of course, there's more cell and gene therapy treatments. There's, of course, personalized medicine treatments coming in, into oncology. But our proposition for physicians remains very consistent. Our market share, we are with a lot of the leading companies. We have tremendous presence with a lot of these aggregator companies. We've been working with AmerisourceBergen. Often before they became aggregates a formative platform oncology practices have been, in many cases, our customers for a long time or one or two cases came back to us as they really entered into extensive growth plans. We should not -- we should definitely mention biosimilars, which has been helpful for our customers' mix, our mix and our important creative headwind -- headroom for new products to come to market. And certainly have been very influential. ION has been very influential in helping physicians adopt in and patient adoption of those products. So we also are expecting our Part B business to keep growing. It's not only in oncology but in our veterinary medical, which does a non-oncology physician-administered products. There's strong growth trends in all those segments. Jim, anything you'd add?
Jim Cleary: I think that covers it well, Steve.
Steve Collis: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Eric, your line is open.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I want to expand on the question relative to COVID ongoing benefits. And so I appreciate that you're giving us exact detail on the impact. Are you getting that in part because the expectation is that the impact going forward is likely to head towards zero, or what are your thoughts on post an emergency period, if we see products perhaps that you represented moving back into the channel and vaccines becoming part of the channel. Is the -- that is the COVID impact potentially material moving forward?
Jim Cleary: Yeah. And so let me take a first crack at that. The reason why we're being so transparent, Eric, is because to a large extent, it's beyond our control. Of course, we play a really important part in the supply chain and doing the logistics and providing the access, that's certainly under our control. But in terms of the operating income contribution, it's something that is more difficult to predict than many aspects of our business that we've been planning for years. And so we provided the $0.70 benefit, $0.60 of which is the treatments in the US, specifically because it is a number that is harder to predict for next year. And so we want to be very specific in calling it out. I would expect that in all aspects of -- on COVID, it's going to be something that has an impact and we're going to be playing an important role for many years to come, but it's just a little bit difficult to predict what the profitability is going to be from it, for instance, in fiscal year 2023.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Eric, please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell: Thank you very much. My question, I feel like I'm already going to stumble over it before I start. There's a fair number of moving pieces with international. But I just want to confirm, you have a incremental $80 million profit headwind from international due to FX. You're going to sell Profarma, which will have an additional modest headwind to profit at some point in the second half. At the same time, there was a onetime favorable manufacturer adjustment that partially offset those headwinds. And overall, you're maintaining guidance. What I'm trying to get to is what is the net EBIT headwind you're eating between the three items; FX, manufacturer price increase, one-timer and Profarma sell, what is the net headwind you're eating to maintain the annual guidance for the full year?
Steve Collis: So again, let me give you some of the component parts. As I've said, our assumption in guidance is that the April FX rates hold for the balance of the year. And that's -- if we look at that on a constant currency basis, it would have an impact that’s north of $80 million on a constant currency basis. And so that causes us to indicate that while we're maintaining guidance range that causes us to be at the low end of our guidance range. The manufacturer price increase, which is in Turkey, the impact that that has for the full year is that that price adjustment fully offsets the decline in the value of the local currency. And then specifically, with regard to Profarma, that contributed about $0.04 in the first half of fiscal year 2022, and we'd expect that transaction to close this month, Eric. And so those are some of the component pieces. As I said, if we're not for FX, we would be increasing guidance in our International segment and that the International segment is performing better than – better than initially budgeted expectations at initially budgeted FX rates.
Operator: The next question is from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. George, your line is open. Please go ahead.
George Hill: Good morning, guys. I'm going to follow up Eric's question on another question on international. I guess, particularly in manufacturer solutions, could you talk about what specifically is driving growth in international manufacturer solutions? And I'd be interested if you could comment on how the profit mix has changed, between the core regular wholesaling business in Europe, which we think continues to be under pressure versus profit streams that are derived from providing services to manufacturers. Thank you
Jim Cleary: Yes, sure. So the -- that's one of the things that really attracted us to Alliance is the high margin, higher growth businesses. For instance, the Alloga business is a very strong 3PL business in many parts of Europe. And so just like AmerisourceBergen kind of our largest business is the wholesale distribution, but it's and we have market leadership there, but it's really strengthened by these higher-margin, higher-growth businesses. And also in international, of course, we have the World Courier business, which is a very strong business, doing logistics for drug trials. So we do see very good opportunities, and that's one of the kind of synergy work streams that we're actively working on. As for instance, World Courier and Alloga and things we can do together to make our offering even stronger. So I guess, probably kind of the key point to make is the higher-margin higher-growth manufacture solutions businesses and they are a key part of our international strategy and something that we would expect to continue to grow. And that's one of the things that if you look at our recent performance, as we've been focusing on that and after we've made the Alliance acquisition, it's one of the things that's been enhancing our gross profit margin and our operating income margin.
Steve Collis: And just generally, I would add that Alliance Healthcare is performing well. We continue to be very impressed and I think are very compatible culturally with their management team. And we're getting to know all the countries well. We're slowly getting to visit all the countries or at least meet with the management teams. So -- and as Jim mentioned, some of the greater synergy opportunities we have are looking at the manufacturer services area. Obviously, AmerisourceBergen has a lot of interest in health systems and specialty products -- so -- and also, I think in Europe, you're going to see some changes in where products get administered and sometimes we can help facilitate that change. You'll also see us be very involved in lobbying, looking at advancing the role of community pharmacy and advancing the role of wholesalers like Alliance Healthcare, in the communities where we're serving in the countries where we're serving. So it's been a great add from -- for our overall portfolio. I think a lot of the staff, people that you don't get to speak to on these sort of calls other than Jim and myself, are tremendously engaged in the cultural integration and looking at all sorts of benefits to streamline and make the business even stronger within AmerisourceBergen, which is already a strong business, as I said.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Michael, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael Cherny: Good morning, and thanks for the questions. I know you had touch base or are there some questions around the pricing dynamic. You mentioned the comments relative to drugs and inflation. I'm curious what you're seeing on some of the cost sides on inflation, whether it's your own wage employees, or in particular, some of the dynamics on the shipping side and freight, is there anything either that you saw in the quarter baked into the guidance outside the norm of expectations relative to wage inflation, wage pressure, logistics pricing, inflation pressure. Anything that you can point out to us?
Jim Cleary: Yeah. And what I'll say is that higher labor and transportation costs, they continue to be embedded in our guidance, and they have been embedded in our results the last couple of quarters. AmerisourceBegen is impacted by higher labor and transportation costs, but less so than most businesses because of the value density of our products. And so we are certainly seeing it and experiencing it as all businesses do now, but it's something that we're able to manage, and it's fully reflected in our guidance. And I think that our teams are doing a terrific job of managing these costs.
Steve Collis: So then I'll wrap up our Q&A for today. We are very proud to reflect these results -- to report these results, which reflect our strong momentum as we finish half of our fiscal year 2022. AmerisourceBergen is really relishing our role as a global health care solutions leader that is clearly leveraging our commercial strength and intellectual confidence to continue to deliver on our promise and on our purpose, and to continue to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your attention today, and we look forward to further discussions with many of you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-02-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the AmerisourceBergen First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Alex, and I’ll be your call operator for today.  I will now hand over to your host, Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Over to you, Bennett.
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen’s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today’s call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today’s press release which is available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. We’ve also posted a slide presentation to accompany today’s press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today’s press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed provision of the company.  With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Collis: Thank you, Bennett. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Before we begin our results for the quarter, I want to take a moment to comment on the status of the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of state and political subdivisions. Since we announced last September that the proposed settlement agreement would move to the next phase, several more states have announced their intent to sign on to the agreement, increasing the number of participating states to 46. We are encouraged by this progress. And over the next few weeks, we will review the level of participation by subdivisions and determine whether to proceed with the final settlement. We look forward to providing an update once a decision has been made. AmerisourceBergen continues to work diligently with our partners to combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve. Turning now to discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and continued progress on strategic imperatives. AmerisourceBergen began the fiscal year with solid financial performance. Revenue grew 13% over the prior year to $59 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by 21% and adjusted EPS grew by 18%. Our growth reflected the benefit of our Alliance Healthcare acquisition and solid performances across our businesses. Our results continue to demonstrate the value of our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, strong customer relationships, leadership in specialty and unparalleled global commercialization services. These differentiating factors are key drivers of our long-term growth and enable AmerisourceBergen to create significant value for all our stakeholders as a global health care leader. Our solution-oriented culture and the agility of our teams has allowed us to strengthen our relationships with partners as we help them navigate the increased complexity and challenges that the evolving pandemic presents. AmerisourceBergen’s focus on leading with market leaders continues to position our company for success. Recently, we renewed our relationship with Express Scripts by extending our supply agreement through 2026. This extension reflects our focus on long-term lasting partnerships with anchor customers that enable us to continue to support patient access wherever a prescription is needed. Patient access is more vital than ever as we enter the third year of our fight against COVID-19. As I’ve said over the past year, we are proud to be a part of the solution to support the government response to the pandemic in the U.S. Through our work with the government and manufacturer partners, we are distributing COVID-19 antibody and antiviral treatments to providers across the country. As pharmaceutical innovation continues to expand treatment resources to respond to the pandemic, we are playing an even greater role to leverage our infrastructure and expertise to support efficient access to COVID-19 therapies in partnership with the federal government. The newly authorized oral COVID treatments are a milestone in the efforts to curb the impact of the virus, and we are supporting their distribution to sites of care across the U.S. Our robust public-private partnerships with pharma manufacturers and the U.S. government demonstrate the value of AmerisourceBergen’s intellectual confidence as we have utilized our commercial strength and ability to collaborate effectively to quickly create solutions in the health care system. Outside the U.S., AmerisourceBergen’s network of global businesses Alliance Healthcare, World Courier and Innomar in Canada are playing a pivotal role in supporting the COVID-19 vaccination efforts across 30-plus countries. The collective distribution support spans four continents and includes a wide range of services from third-party logistics to temperature-controlled packaging, storage and transport. Alliance Healthcare continues to deliver strong results while supporting the COVID-19 response in multiple countries from vaccination to testing, including in the UK, where the team is supporting the distribution of vaccines and serving as the sole distributor of the rapid lateral flow COVID-19 testing kits to pharmacies. Alliance Healthcare’s performance underscores why we were so excited to bring this business into the AmerisourceBergen family and how this acquisition enables us to advance our role as a key pillar of pharmaceutical innovation and access globally. Our teams are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure the integration continues to progress successfully. Alliance Healthcare’s foundation in wholesale distribution and the International segment’s significant footprint in complementary value-added services and solutions parallel AmerisourceBergen’s U.S. capabilities and provide us with a strong global platform for sustainable, long-term growth and value creation in service to our global biopharmaceutical manufacturer partners. Creating value for all our stakeholders is paramount for AmerisourceBergen. And as we look at our networks of community providers across the globe, we remain focused on supporting this critical component in the health care system. Community practitioners from veterinarians to independent pharmacies and community special physicians played a vital role in supporting local health care needs. Community pharmacies are key to facilitating health equity and access, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Through our independent pharmacy network, Good Neighbor Pharmacy, or GNP, in the U.S. and Alliance’s Alphega network in Europe, we have continued to strengthen our relationship with these providers and support their ability to expand access to critical health care solutions. Our GNP network has played an important role in helping communities address the pandemic. In partnership with the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, GNP has helped to support allocation of four million COVID-19 vaccine doses to more than 1,600 pharmacies nationwide. These allocations are helping reach communities where help is needed most. Nearly 50% of the individuals vaccinated by pharmacies in our GNP network live in zip codes with a high social vulnerability index as defined by the CDC. The value of this initiative continues to grow for our communities, and we are pleased to be working with the federal government to support the distribution of N95 masks from the Strategic National Stockpile to our GNP customers currently enrolled in the program. In our Alliance Healthcare business, we are also seeing significant growth in Alphega’s membership as independent pharmacies recognize the value of working with Alliance and the services we offer. As a leading European network of independent pharmacists, Alphega pharmacy members continue to deliver on their mission of helping to improve the quality of health in their communities. Alphega pharmacy members throughout the pandemic have gone above and beyond to deliver care to their patients. These extraordinary efforts have garnered numerous accolades from around the industry. We are excited to share best practices between Alphega and GNP to further the support we provide community pharmacists, both in the U.S. and Europe. As we continue to build on our strengths, we are focused on expanding on our leadership in specialty. The growth in biosimilars has helped improve access to effective therapies while mitigating overall health care spending to make room for continued pharmaceutical innovation, including the introduction of new therapeutics and additional indications for existing therapies to improve the standards of care. Our leadership in specialty continues to provide us with the scale, partnerships and expertise to create significant value for our stakeholders. AmerisourceBergen’s global scale and strong partnerships upstream and down make us a key partner in connecting manufacturers and physicians. We continue to look at new ways to apply our existing capabilities and expertise to create further value through this linkage, particularly as the shift to value-based care accelerates. By leveraging our distribution infrastructure, expertise in outcome and reimbursement and our investments in the physician practices services space, we are well positioned to contribute to pharmaceutical-driven outcomes and support the long-term success of this transition. Access and commercial solutions become increasingly important as we look to the future with a strong pipeline of pharmaceutical innovation, particularly in specialty pharmaceuticals. More than half of the pipeline of new treatments are coming from small and midsized biotech and pharma companies. AmerisourceBergen’s vast distribution reach and global commercialization services position us to be a partner of choice for these manufacturers. Our expanded platform of manufacturer services allows us to deliver a range of logistics and supply chain services, market access and innovative solutions to help improve patient care with global reach and local expertise. AmerisourceBergen and Alliance teams are working collaboratively to leverage our complementary capabilities to create differentiated solutions for our upstream partners and help them expand access to care for patients around the world. One example of how we are supporting access in the U.S. is our recently launched AB Disparities and Cancer Care Initiative. This initiative is focused on improving access to all components of cancer care from expanding access to clinical trials and community practices to bringing awareness of health disparities to legislators. Using our trusted role as a partner to community practitioners and pharmaceutical manufacturers alike, we believe this program will help bring down certain barriers to high-quality cancer care for patients in local communities we serve. This is an example of how our teams live our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures every day. Being guided by our purpose ensures we are contributing to improving the well-being of human and animal populations by expanding access to quality health care, operating sustainably and upholding the highest standards of safety and quality. To help achieve this vision, we are focused on investing in our people, culture and commitment to ESG. A healthier future is also a more sustainable one. We recently published our sixth Annual Global Sustainability Report, which highlights the progress we made in fiscal 2021 on our environmental, social and governance initiatives and provide significant transparency into our business. AmerisourceBergen’s continued progress and commitment to advancing ESG initiatives is reflected by the company’s inclusion in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2022, one of the most comprehensive publications providing in-depth analysis on corporate sustainability. AmerisourceBergen is also committed to building a more diverse, equitable, inclusive and engaged workforce. Throughout this coming year and beyond, we will continue to focus on our people, our culture and our community as the first three pillars of the DEI work. This year, we added an important pillar, our progress, that will more closely link DEI with our purpose of creating healthier futures through expanding access to quality health care globally and promote health equity. We are honored that our work in ESG is gaining recognition. Last month, Newsweek magazine included AmerisourceBergen on its 2022 list of most responsible companies. Newsweek’s most responsible companies list is a well-regarded ranking of corporate ESG performance, and this recognition further underscores our progress on our objectives to improve access and equity in health care, create more resilient and sustainable operations across the supply chain and inspire our team members to achieve their potential. Our commitment to ESG is fundamental to our long-term sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders, and we are focused on continuing to build on our ESG platform to support our team, partners and community. We are pleased with our performance thus far in fiscal 2022 and the progress we continue to make against our strategic priorities to enhance our differentiated value proposition, strengthen our relationship with customers, drive innovation and build on our strong momentum. I remain inspired by the commitment and performance of our 42,000 team members who truly embody our purpose in helping our partners navigate the ever more complex and evolving global health care landscape. As a global health care solutions leader, AmerisourceBergen is creating differentiated capabilities to help advance pharmaceutical innovation and access. Now, I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our first quarter 2022 results and to discuss our updated financial guidance. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Thank you, Steve, and thank you all for joining us on today’s call. Before I turn to our results, as usual, my comments will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter. For more details on our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release. AmerisourceBergen delivered another quarter of solid financial results as our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, strong underlying business fundamentals and the contribution from Alliance Healthcare continued to help drive our company forward. Our differentiated value proposition continues to position us well to create long-term stakeholder value and is supported by our investment in our talent and commitment to ESG and our business practices. Turning now to our results. AmerisourceBergen finished the quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.58, an 18% increase with operating income growth in both our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and our International Healthcare Solutions segment. Our consolidated revenue grew about 14% to $59.6 billion driven by revenue growth in both segments. Consolidated gross profit increased 41% to $2 billion driven by increases in gross profit in both segments. Gross profit margin grew by 66 basis points to 3.38% driven by the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.3 billion up from $810 million as a result of higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses and depreciation expense primarily due to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Consolidated operating income was $749 million, up 21%. The increase was driven by operating income growth in both segments, which I will touch on in more detail when discussing the segment level results. Turning now to interest expense and tax rate. Net interest expense was $53 million in the quarter, an increase of 59% due to an increase in debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. We now expect full year net interest expense to be in the range of $210 million to $215 million, representing similar quarterly net interest expense for the balance of the year. Our effective income tax rate was 21.3% in line with our full year guidance range for tax rate compared to 22% in the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count increased 2% to 211.2 million shares as a result of dilution related to employee compensation and the June 2021 issuance of 2 million shares to Walgreens Boots Alliance as part of our acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, adjusted free cash flow was $809 million, and we remain on track to achieve our adjusted free cash flow guidance of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the fiscal year. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash with approximately $670 million held outside the United States. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now, I’ll turn to our first quarter segment level results. Starting with our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. Segment revenue increased by 2.7% to $53 billion driven by an increase in sales to one of our larger customers and growth in our specialty physician services and MWI Animal Health businesses, offsetting a $1.1 billion decline in sales of the commercial COVID-19 therapy. Revenue from U.S. Human Health was $51.8 billion, representing growth of 2.6%, and revenue from U.S. Animal Health was $1.2 billion up 6.9% year-over-year. Segment operating income was $569 million representing growth of 0.6% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2021. As it relates to the COVID therapy impact on the quarter, the headwind for the quarter was $0.04, which was a smaller headwind than previously expected. Sales of the commercial COVID therapy in November and December were higher than previously expected, and also there was better-than-expected contribution to operating income from other COVID therapies. This smaller year-over-year headwind helped offset a slow start from our manufacturer services group, which is expected to normalize in the second half. As we look at our full year expectations, we continue to see good performance and trends for our businesses across the segment. Given our nationwide role in supporting COVID-19 therapy distribution, including newly authorized oral therapies, we now expect COVID therapies to be a tailwind for the full year. As a result of our updated expectations for the operating income impact of COVID therapies, we are raising our fiscal 2022 U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income guidance to a range of $2.375 billion to $2.45 billion representing growth of 5% to 9%. This increase also leads us to raise our total AmerisourceBergen consolidated operating income guidance range to high teens percent growth – up from mid-to-high teens percent growth. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $6.6 billion reflecting $5.6 billion in revenue from the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and revenue growth of over 15% for the balance of the International Healthcare Solutions segment. Segment operating income was strong for the first quarter at $180 million, up 253% on a reported basis and 268% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to foreign exchange, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar in the month of December had a negative impact on the segment, and we will continue to monitor the impact of currency translation on the dollar value of segment results. As Steve mentioned, Alliance Healthcare has been performing well since we completed the acquisition in June. Alliance Healthcare’s important work to support the COVID response in a number of countries is inspiring and clearly shows the importance of our capabilities. The contribution from these activities is offsetting higher labor and supply chain cost pressures for the Alliance Healthcare business. Our teams are working closely on IT infrastructure initiatives at Alliance but the ramp of IT spending in the first quarter was slower than expected, benefiting our Q1 segment operating income. In subsequent quarters, expenses in the segment will increase as we continue to work towards modernizing Alliance Healthcare’s business technology, operability and infrastructure. The segment came in above expectations for the first quarter. But normalizing for the lower-than-expected IT expense in the quarter and a one-time discrete country level expense benefit offset in part by the unfavorable foreign exchange, the segment operating income would have been in line with our initial expectations. The Alliance Healthcare team continues to impress and the business continues to deliver on our expectations. This completes the review of our segment level results. So, I will now turn to our updated fiscal 2022 guidance. We are raising our fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range from $10.50 to $10.80 to a new guidance range of $10.60 to $10.90. The new guidance range reflects the updated full year expectations for COVID therapies offset partially by higher interest expense. And as you’ll remember, Q2 of fiscal 2021 had a $0.07 contribution from the commercial COVID therapy. With that in mind, as you look at updating your fiscal 2022 models, it is important to keep in mind that the increased contribution from the newly authorized COVID therapies will be primarily in the back half of our fiscal year as supply becomes available. Before I conclude my remarks today, I would like to briefly highlight some of our ESG initiatives. Yesterday, we published our sixth Annual Global Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report that is presented on its own micro site, which I would encourage you to visit at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. The report aligns with many leading global sustainability frameworks, including SASB, GRI, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and TCFD. The report details our progress and initiatives in a number of areas, including our global ESG commitments as we became a signatory of the United Nations’ Global Compact committed to the science-based target initiative and aligned our ESG strategy to include the expanded footprint of Alliance Healthcare. Additionally, as we work to more deeply embed diversity, equity and inclusion and ESG principles into our business, we will look forward to providing updates on our progress in these important areas. In closing, I continue to be impressed with how our teams use our commercial strengths and expertise to find ways to help public and private partners navigate the current complexities and challenges across the health care system. This important work aligns with our purpose and creates value for all our stakeholders, including our shareholders. The proven resilience and strength of our business and results gives us great confidence in our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and our ability to create long-term sustainable growth. To deliver this growth, we will continue to focus on expanding on our leadership in specialty, leading with market leaders, supporting community providers and facilitating global pharmaceutical access and opportunity. We remain steadfast in our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, and we believe our purpose-driven culture and focus on developing our talent will help further our value creation. Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. And now I will turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A. Operator?
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question for today comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Charles, your line is now open.
Bennett Murphy: Okay, operator. I think Charles is in mute.
Operator: My apologies. Our next question for today comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Ricky, your line is now open.
Ricky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good morning. So with Europe becoming a bigger part of the story in earnings, we’re hearing a lot about sort of wage inflation in Europe that’s been picking up. What have you seen ex-U.S. environment in terms of cost structure since you provided the November guidance and sort of what’s included in current guidance?
Jim Cleary: Yes. And so let me talk about inflation overall. And then let me talk about what we’re seeing with regard to inflation in Europe, Ricky. And so we are seeing higher labor and transportation costs. And let me say that they were embedded in our guidance. So they were included in our guidance, and they’re also included in our last couple of quarters’ actual results. One thing about AmerisourceBergen overall – and we certainly are impacted by higher labor and transportation costs, but less so than most businesses. Pharmaceuticals, as you know, are very value dense, which mitigates freight costs, and then our distribution centers are highly automated, which mitigates labor costs. As we look at some of our businesses, and I’ll use MWI, as an example, and MWI is performing very well and it has very good results. But it’s a little bit more impacted by inflation because it has a broader array of products, including med-surg and nutritional supplements and less automation in the distribution centers. But overall, inflation, it’s included in our guidance, and we’re managing through it very well. We are seeing inflation also in the Alliance business and there are higher labor and freight costs there also. And Alliance is really fully offsetting that by the important work that we’re doing there on COVID therapies, which is benefiting Alliance from an operating income standpoint.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Eric, your line is now open.
Eric Coldwell: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we could get some more details on the role you’re playing with the new COVID antivirals. We’re seeing some states like Georgia, I think Texas and others highlight your role as a network administrator for the HHS COVID-19 therapeutic dispensing program. We saw Merck highlight you as a distributor. But I was hoping, overall, we could get more details on the kind of the back story on what you’re doing, how you’re doing it? Perhaps your role with Pfizer on Paxlovid as well. Just any additional details would be fantastic. Thanks so much.
Steve Collis: Hi, Eric. I’ll start off and let Jim comment. We’ve made the comment that never has our purpose become clearer than during the pandemic of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. And the role that we’ve done with in COVID therapies distributing over 100 million vaccines worldwide by doing all the lateral flow tests in the UK – well Korea getting early vaccines out in some difficult areas in Europe, but also probably, most pivotally, the role we play in the U.S. with the antiviral therapies and the tremendous data and relationships that we’ve developed, working with the U.S. government and the state and counties to get these therapies out. We also have always been a very upstream centric company as well and have been honored to be selected as a distributor with so many of these critical therapies. It’s a moving target. Supply is often – is really often ramping up – and then you also have different disease rates in various states. And so we – AmerisourceBergen has shown tremendous adaptability, resilience and also incredible informatics and strong relationship skills, which have enabled us to really be the distributor for these important therapies. Jim, I know you have some other comments as well.
Jim Cleary: Yes, sure. I’ll comment a little bit about it from the financial perspective. And as we indicated in our prepared remarks, the guidance raise is related to updated outlook for COVID therapy contribution. And in particular, within U.S. Healthcare Solutions, we increased the operating income guidance by $50 million at both the low end and the high end of the range, and that’s due to higher COVID-19 therapy sales than we had originally expected. In our initial guidance that we put out a few months ago, COVID therapies were expected to be a headwind to maybe breakeven at the top end of the range, but now we expect them to be a tailwind for fiscal year 2022. And you asked about the different products including the oral pills. And I think one thing that is important to note is you guys do your modeling that the therapy contribution includes both the commercial products that we own and we recognize revenue line and the government-owned therapies that are authorized under emergency use authorizations where we don’t own the product, and we earn a fee. And so COVID therapies, we’re expecting to be a tailwind in the fiscal year from an operating income standpoint. But as you do your modeling, there will be headwind from a revenue standpoint. And I think one thing I’d really like to finish with because there will be a lot of questions on COVID therapies as they are a reason for are increasing our guidance. But overall, the business, even without COVID therapies, is performing as expected with really good outlook, strong fundamentals and continued execution. So, we have a high degree of confidence in our businesses and the way that they’re executing now, Eric.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Lisa, your line is now open.
Lisa Gill: Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. Steve and Jim, I just want to go back to your comments around specialty, and you talked about new therapies. You talked about the focus on specialty and biosimilars. I know you don’t break out specialty specifically anymore, but can you give us an idea of how specialty is growing and the contribution you are seeing from biosimilars, new therapies? And how do we think about that component of your business?
Steve Collis: Lisa the reason – I mean, it’s literally becoming possible to break out, especially because essentially, our brand business has become a specialty business, and we probably think about new areas like precision medicine, cell and gene therapy as the new sort of niche businesses. It would have been almost impossible to conceive just how fundamental specialty products would become to pharmaceutical care as we looked a couple of decades ago when we got started with the specialty businesses. So perhaps I can just give you some comments. Our specialty physician services business, which is a lot of our legacy well-known specialty businesses, including Besse Medical, Oncology Supply and ION are performing extremely well. We’re really proud of the positioning. Like in all our businesses, we focus on long-term partnerships. ION, I left the specialty group about 11 years or 12 years ago. I mean, in terms of closely running it, and we really just had three or four manufacturer contracts. They have several dozen now and continue to grow in the role being the close adviser to the physicians, the practices and the manufacturers. Besse Medical is getting more and more involved in several other physician specialties. They have a key role in ophthalmology. And Oncology Supply is an exemplary business in terms of customer service. I also could not mention what is our legacy. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention what is our legacy hospital specialty business, our ASD business, which continues to really have been the forerunner for a lot of the COVID work we’re doing, a lot of the antiviral therapies because of the limited distribution, the data expertise and the concentrator distribution programs that we’ve learned to do somewhere in ASD. So a little bit of a long answer, but such important work for us. I’m going to just comment on biosimilars, and then I’ll hand over to Jim. So biosimilars has become very important to ourselves, to our customers. The sweet spot for us is Part B drugs. We’ve been encouraged by trends. I think the acceptance of biosimilars is certainly increasing all the time from all elements of the stakeholder system, and we’ve noticed recent interchangeability approvals. Next year will be tremendously interesting from a Part D perspective, which is also important for the system. But for us, the sweet spot is the Part B therapeutic compatibility and the contracting abilities we have through organizations like ION and IPN. Jim?
Jim Cleary: Well, it’s tough to follow up, Steve, on specialty since he founded that part of our business. But I’ll just say quickly and generally from a financial standpoint, specialty physician services is performing as expected, which is really good because we had high expectations, and we’re seeing very good trends in the business and continue to see good financial trends with biosimilars. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Eric, your line is now open.
Eric Percher: Thank you. I want to return to the antivirals. And I think the commercial comment helps us understand the revenue step-down versus strong gross profit. For the – you’ve increased guidance by $50 million, but your comment was that you expect a larger net contribution versus last year. I believe you disclosed $0.18. So is it fair to assume that we’re looking at something above the $0.18 or roughly $80 million for the year and that much of that may come without the full revenue benefit, but more of a gross margin benefit?
Jim Cleary: Yes. Let me provide some more information there that I think will be helpful. And I think we’ve had a high degree of transparency with regard to impact of the COVID therapies on our bottom line, and we’ll plan to continue to do that. So last year, we – the contribution to the bottom line from COVID therapies was $0.30, and we kind of indicated on a quarterly basis, it was $0.14 in the first quarter, $0.07 in the second quarter, $0.03 in the third and $0.06 in the fourth quarter. What we saw in the first quarter this year was a $0.10 contribution. So it was a $0.04 headwind. What we’d expect to see in the second quarter would be a few cent tailwind, so we made a contribution of $0.07 in the second quarter last year, and we’d expect a few cent tailwind on and then a more substantial tailwind in the back half of the fiscal year as supplies of the product become more available.  And so when we originally guided a few months ago, as I said, we were expecting a headwind to maybe breakeven at the high end from COVID therapies. And we increased the guidance as a result of COVID therapies for U.S. health care solutions by $50 million at the low end and the high end of the range. So, I think that gives you a lot to work with there in terms of modeling.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jailendra Singh from Credit Suisse. Jailendra, your line is now open.
Jailendra Singh: Thank you, and good morning everyone. Now that we are over a month into 2022, I was hoping if you could provide an update on the drug pricing environment and how that has been trending compared to your expectations, both on brand drugs inflation as well as like generic market overall?
Jim Cleary: Sure. I’ll give you thoughts on drug pricing. And it is in line with our expectations. And we’ll say on brand inflation and I’ll start there, that it’s less important for AmerisourceBergen. We’ve talked about this and that over 95% of our brand buy-side dollars are fee-for-service. But I will say that the initial pricing changes in 2022 have been in line with expectations. And then on generic deflation, there’s nothing major to call out. Overall, deflation rates are relatively in line with the last couple of years. And we’d expect that to continue throughout our fiscal year. Supply and demand dynamics remain generally in balance. And again, this is something that we’ve talked about before, but it’s important that our business model is not as reliant on generic pricing as it once was in the past because several years ago, our business leaders recognize the need to have a more balanced profitability across the portfolio of pharmaceuticals. And so we rebalanced to ensure that we receive fair compensation for the value we provide across brand generics and specialty. And of course, the market continues to shift more towards specialty. But in response to your specific question, it’s what we’re seeing both in brand and generic pricing is in line with our expectations.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. George, your line is now open.
George Hill: Yes, good morning guys, and thanks for taking the question. Jim or Steve, I’d ask a quick one on the Express Scripts renewal. I guess any meaningful changes to pricing or economics? Or maybe could you comment on the competitive environment? Because I feel like we haven’t seen one of these big contracts switch hands in a while. And Steve, my quick follow-up would be is, I haven’t heard the train whistle a little while on the earnings call. What have you guys thought about that?
Steve Collis: Hi, George. I always remember your little train – could comment after our 20 – little engine that – after our 23  call, so our 13 announcement. So Jim just answered the question about pricing trends. And when you deal with a sophisticated customer like Express Scripts, they understand the business trends as well as we do. And we do a really good job of servicing large customers like that and focus on the long-term relationships. We’re proud because we were a legacy distributor to Medco and went through the Express Scripts transition with Medco and became the distributor for Express Scripts and now of course, are working with the new Cigna management team. So it’s a tremendous example of our focus on long-term partnership with anchor customers. And again, with the understanding and the fact that we reflect the competitive environment that we’re in, there’s no headwind to call out at all. On the train whistle, we are proud to be in new headquarters, which are not as affected by the train whistle, which Jim and I are currently working out of. And we hope that our associates will return to in the next couple of months as things improve.
Operator: Our next question – my apology.
Steve Collis: Sorry, I just wanted to also say, George, that there’s really no headwind to call out at all on the Express Scripts renewal. So, we’d pleased to afford that. Thank you, Operator.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Steven, your line is now open.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning guys. So, I also just had a quick follow-up on Express Scripts as well. As time passes, I forgot just the approximate level of penetration of the generic distribution with Express and whether this is primarily a brand-only contract. Or have you had pretty strong penetration on distributing the generics to them as well. And then also, was there any change in their level of involvement in WBAD with the renewal? Thanks.
Steve Collis: Yes. Nothing on WBAD that we can report. This is primarily a brand and specialty contract, as you do recall, Steve. And so I think – Jim, anything else you’d add in Express Scripts? I think we covered it .
Jim Cleary: Yes.
Bennett Murphy: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open.
Michael Cherny: Good morning. Jim, I wanted to go back to the comments you made about the manufacturer services business. I appreciate all the color, especially on the antivirals, and how that flows through the year. You made some quick comment about how we’re off, I think you said a slow start to the year. Can you dive a little bit into what drives that and especially now that manufacturer services post Alliance is a much bigger piece of your business? How should we think about leading indicators to support a return towards the robust growth rate that you’re looking for?
Jim Cleary: Yes. Yes. Thank you for the question. We do expect the manufacturer services business to normalize in the fiscal year and to have a good fiscal year. I mean these businesses are important differentiators for us, and they are very valued by the manufactures and we build, we have, several strong manufacture services businesses. We have realigned the organization to provide better end-to-end solutions for our customers, and there are opportunities for increased cross-functional collaboration between our manufacturer services businesses. And it’s actually an area with the Alliance acquisition, where there’s opportunities to have offerings of our manufacturer services on a more global scale. And there are also good synergy opportunities between our manufacturer services businesses and the Alliance value-added businesses. And so I do expect the businesses to have a good fiscal year and to be on plan. And that was just one of the things that we called out as one of the many puts and takes during the quarter, but we have good long-term confidence in the businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin, your line is now open.
Kevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks. So, I’m still a little confused by the guidance changes. I guess trying to understand, where we are now versus where we were before with the addition of the Pfizer contract. Is there any change at all to the way you’re guiding the base business? Because the increase in the COVID therapy seems to be more than the guidance range – raise. And I’m just wondering if there’s any change to core earnings or if there’s anything below the line interest expense or anything that’s offsetting some of the benefit. Can you just take us through how you bridge it in a way that’s easier for me to understand?
Jim Cleary: Yes. Yes. Thank you for asking that question. That is a great question, and I think a few things. First of all, and most importantly, the business is performing as expected. The outlook is very good, strong fundamentals, continued execution. We have confidence in the businesses and the guidance.  Now to answer your question, the guidance range at the U.S. Healthcare Solutions of $50 million at the low end and the high end of the operating income guidance range. And then the raise at the low end and the high end for EPS was $0.10. And really, the thing to understand there is the raise is related to an updated outlook for COVID therapy contribution, more operating income contribution from COVID therapies, and that’s partially offset by higher interest expense and a stronger dollar. And so the stronger dollar versus what we had in our original guidance, that is part of the bridge. And then the other part of the bridge is higher interest expense that’s related to local country debt, for and Alliance Healthcare non-wholly owned subsidiary. And so those are the two things to bridge. But really kind of the most important thing is that the operating businesses are performing as expected, very, very well, and we’re very pleased by that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. Elizabeth, your line is now open.
Elizabeth Anderson: Thank you so much for the question guys. Just a follow up maybe from Kevin’s question. Can you sort of talk us through your expectations around not biosimilar, new biosimilars, but new generic or oral sales this year. Seems like there’s a pretty significant step-up versus prior years. And so I just wanted to understand what was embedded in your expectations from the generic conversion perspective? Thanks.
Steve Collis: No, honestly, nothing important to call out from our vantage point. This has really become much less of an area of differentiation. In terms of the way our earnings momentum rolls out, it’s just the whole way that generics have rolled out, it’s much more wider industry participation than just the wholesalers. So I really don’t think there’s anything important to call out, and Jim agrees. So...
Jim Cleary: Yes.
Bennett Murphy: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Charles, your line is now open.
Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks. Can you hear me guys?
Jim Cleary: Yes. We can hear you well.
Charles Rhyee: Okay. It’s great. Okay, sorry about that earlier. I just wanted to – I know you’ve talked about the antivirals a number of times already. But maybe – I think you mentioned briefly about your role there in Europe. Do you guys have any kind of formal agreements similar to the U.S. for distribution in Europe through Alliance? And then secondly, just on these antivirals, I think there’s a very short time window to get some of these oral therapies to patients for them to really be effective. Does that – I guess, what can you do to really speed these products to get to the patients? And then really part of that is does that kind of limit really the potential of these therapies being contributors long term? Thanks.
Steve Collis: Let me just deal with the U.S. part of the question first. We do a tremendous job of working with constrained inventory – of an inventory as it sits coming out of production and is procured and sent to our distribution centers to get it out. In many cases, as is with the oral pills right now, there’s incredible demand way beyond, what – the supplies available. And these products are operating under an emergency use authorization. So AmerisourceBergen, I can assure you, is not a bottleneck in getting these products out as fastly and as efficiently and economically as possible. I think that’s why we’ve continued to be selected as the distributor for almost all these therapies. So, I would say that. But I also will say that we’re always open to new areas of cooperation, both with the manufacturers and the patients that we ultimately serve through their provider models, be it the retail pharmacy or acute care models, infusion centers. Whatever the prescription base that care treatment is we will be there. In Europe, we do various things. Our Spanish business does different things. But there’s nothing that’s really as comparable to the concerted effort and the launches for the therapies that we’ve seen in the U.S. and the government role. It’s – I’d say that it’s – it’s a pretty unique model and the materiality and extent of it. So, we haven’t seen anything comparable in Europe. I have mentioned that we’ve done over 100 million vaccines we’ve distributed. And a large part of that is in Europe where we do about half of the NHS in the UK. We’ve done a lot in Spain, well Korea has done distribution in several countries. We also do the lateral flow test. So, we have a very pivotal role in COVID therapies throughout other countries we serve. And we could not be more proud to do that. So anything, Jim?
Jim Cleary: Yes, Steve. I would add that in the U.S. for the government-owned emergency use authorization products, the process will be that the government will allocate to the states and then the states will allocate to the providers.
Steve Collis: And Jim, I’m going to do some closing comments now as we end our first quarter of fiscal year 2022 call. We felt like this was very strong results, and we’re off to a good start. AmerisourceBergen is, as we often like to say, well positioned with our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. We believe pharmaceuticals are the most efficient source of care, as shown by recent overall health care spending analysis, despite frequent misrepresentation of the public forums in terms of the inflation rates that we experienced. We know at the net pricing level, we are almost flat. We are very proud to be playing such an integral part in this community. As a corporation, I feel like we’ve made tremendous strides to deliver the purpose that we’ve selected. We leverage our own capabilities for the benefit of all the stakeholder sets we serve. We’ve made a strong contribution to our people culture. Our expertise continues to grow. We like to talk a lot about our intellectual confidence. We feel like we’ve made leaps and bounds during the last few years, and we are focused, as always, on creating long-term stakeholder value. Thank you for your time and attention today.
Operator: Thank you for joining today’s call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-11-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the AmerisourceBergen Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year '21 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].
 Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Bennett Murphy: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss AmerisourceBergen's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
 Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO.
 On today's call, we'll be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investors.amerisourcebergen.com. We've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. 
 During the conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. 
 For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. You'll have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask that you limit your question to 1 per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. 
Steven Collis: Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, we will focus our remarks on the exceptional progress that AmerisourceBergen team has made on our strategic priorities during fiscal 2021, and how we will capitalize on that momentum to continue executing and innovating in fiscal 2022.
 Before I begin, I want to take a moment to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of U.S. State Attorney Generals and political scout divisions in participating states. Throughout the litigation process, we have been consistent in stating our desire to addressing the enormity of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table. 
 If the industry's proposed agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States with substantial financial support. Clearly, the process is in an advanced stage, and we will not comment deeply at this time. We take our role in the supply chain seriously and continue to work closely with stakeholders concerning these complex matters. AmerisourceBergen will continue to work diligently and alongside partners to combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve.  
 In fiscal 2021, AmerisourceBergen advanced its role as a key pillar of pharmaceutical innovation and access, as we look at our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures by supporting our partners, customers and our own team members through challenging times. As the pandemic persists, the importance of our purpose in an evolving environment and an efficient global pharmaceutical supply chain is being felt by all our stakeholders. We are proud to be able to offer our expertise, capabilities and infrastructure as part of the solution on facilitating the national distribution of COVID-19 therapies, to supporting the distribution of more than 75 million vaccines to patients in over 30 countries through our expanded global footprint. 
 Our business has leveraged its position of market strength to become an increasingly vital partner of choice through differentiated solutions for our upstream and downstream customers. Our continuous investments and ongoing focus on being a strategic partner for our customers have deepened our relationships with all our stakeholders during this time of increased focus on the pharmaceutical supply chain, enhancing our position as a provider of key solutions for our customers, both big and small. We also leverage our core capabilities as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution and a differentiated provider of unique solutions for manufacturers globally and health care providers locally. 
 In the U.S., we are a key partner for our community pharmacies, veterinarians and physician practices. In community pharmacy, we are particularly proud to support our Good Neighbor Pharmacy members trusted role through our innovative tools and programs that allow independent pharmacists to optimize their operations and spend the most possible time serving their patients and communities. 
 In July, for the fifth year in a row and for the tenth year of the past 12 years, Good Neighbor Pharmacy network was ranked highest amongst brick-and-mortar chain drug store pharmacies by J.D. Power. 
 In our Animal Health business, we support veterinarian practices in similar ways to help them manage their practices as they continue to experience increased demand for its services due to growth in pet ownership. The cherished role of pets within families and increased importance based on ensuring health and well-being of all family members. We also continue to differentiate ourselves as the leader in specialty distribution and commercialization services. This fiscal year, we launched a variety of new services and solutions, bolting upon our historic investments to further drive our leadership in specialty with our customers and orders. 
 For example, through our ION and other value-added solutions, we form new partnerships that offer industry-leading technologies to specialty physician services customer practices, enabling them to be even more efficient on enhancing their ability to improve the patient experience and ultimately, outcomes.
 We are also pleased to continue to support the growing adoption of biosimilar products in physician offices and community hospitals and health systems, facilitating patient access to important treatment choices, to improve their health and well-being. Internationally, we remain a leading provider of global pharmaceutical distribution services and differentiated solutions in key markets across the globe. 
 Earlier, I mentioned the distribution of tens of millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccines to patients in more than 30 countries. Through our market-leading manufacturer solutions, including our global specialty logistics and commercialization offerings, we're also facilitating direct-to-patient clinical trials and helping manufacturers around the world navigate the ever-increasing complexities of global logistics. 
 Furthermore, we are leveraging our now expanded portfolio of international relationships, partnerships and solutions to facilitate patient access to the rapidly evolving landscape of new pharmaceutical technologies. As we continue to differentiate our business, we remain focused on being strategic partners with our customers as we help them achieve operational efficiencies and support growth in their businesses with innovative solutions.
 In fiscal 2021, we completed a significant technology investment by bringing the specialty distribution business onto the SAP platform, which will help improve efficiency, increase flexibility and support continuity. As a global health care company, we understand and appreciate the importance of ensuring our businesses have the technology they need to support their operations and enhance their capabilities. Importantly, an increasingly critical part of our global role and responsibility is being strong corporate stewards, that is ensuring our financial health, investing in our people culture and ensuring long-term and sustainable value creation. 
 In terms of our financial health, we continue to take a thoughtful and strategic approach to capital deployment that focuses on value creation and maintaining financial strength. This includes our focus on maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings, and we remain on track to delivering on our commitments to the rating agencies. 
 Notably, our financial and strategic position has enabled the continued enhancement of our health care capabilities, including the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, which we completed in June. Since then, our culturally-aligned teams have worked diligently to integrate our teams and businesses, conducting deep dive into strategically optimizing our operational and business development synergies to exploring ways to enhance the value we grade to our partners. As we are seeing through financial results and expectations, our new team members are talented, and I thank the combined AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare teams for the ongoing support of our integration efforts. 
 Our financial strength also enables us to continue to invest in our people and culture. At AmerisourceBergen, we know our team members are our most valuable asset, and we are committed to inspiring them to achieve their fullest potential. Our efforts go well beyond the table space of offering market align pay, and we understand the long-term advantage of being a fair and equitable employer, who offers competitive wages at all levels. We have surveyed our team members to find out what's most valuable to them and have invested in attractive benefit programs, such as increased paid parental leave, child and dependent care, and enhanced mental health and wellness programs. 
 Our team members also value a culture of flexibility, and we responded with a thoughtfully designed, new way of working that provides options for flexibility while balancing the need for in-person connection and innovation. On ensuring the safety of themselves and their loved ones during the pandemic to investing in world-class learning technology and models, we understand that it is absolutely critical that our talent is cultivated and empowered to help drive our long-term growth. Our efforts have been recognized, and we have once again been certified as a great place to work company and named a best place to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign. Meaningful value can also be unlocked when individuals are empowered to bring their whole selves to work, and we embrace our collective differences. 
 This year, we furthered our diversity, equity inclusion efforts with the rollout of new employee resource groups and new diverse candidate slate objectives. To further align our people strategy with our business strategy, we also introduced a new leadership competency model that will be embedded throughout all of our talent programs. 
 Based on the collective feedback from team members across AmerisourceBergen, the new model focuses on developing the initial competencies aligned to 4 key business and cultural poles, diversity, equity and inclusion, collaboration, innovation and executional excellence and purpose. As a foundation for how we will recruit, engage and develop our people, this new model and the principles behind them will enable us to create value now and for the long term. 
 Another aspect of our culture, one which helps ensure sustainable value creation, is our dedication to operating in a sustainable and responsible manner and to supporting healthy and resilient communities, where we live and work. During the quarter, we are proud to have become a participant of the UN Global Compact, the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. We also held our third annual AmerisourceBergen Foundation Conference, which helps Foundation grantees connect and learn from each other and the Foundation team to help them become even more effective in their work to positively impact local communities around the world. Our continued progress in areas like ESG, diversity, equity inclusion and strategic planning are made possible by the expert oversight and guidance to our board as well as the ability of our management team to drive execution and operational excellence.
 Looking ahead, our key growth pillars enable us to maintain our leading market position and to solidify our differentiated value proposition in fiscal '22 and beyond. First, we are focused on our customers. Through our unique partnership model, we formed long-term lasting relationships and integrate us operationally and enable us to provide value-added solutions that help further strengthen our ability to lead with market leaders. 
 Second, we are focused on expanding on our leadership in specialty by leveraging our global reach, market-leading capabilities and ability to support rapidly accelerating and global pharmaceutical innovation, we strengthened our capabilities to support both upstream partners and downstream customers. 
 Third, we are focused on execution excellence. This includes continuously investing in our business, which increases our flexibility, expands our suite of capabilities and enhances our customer experience. 
 Fourth, we are focused on supporting pharmaceutical innovation around the world. With a global manufacturer services platform, we aim to be the strategic partner of choice to global manufacturers as we help them innovate, solve the complex challenges of global logistics and market access, and capture the opportunities of rapidly accelerating pharmaceutical innovation. 
 Downstream, we provide data-driven insights, efficiency solutions and our unmatched scale to help optimize customer operations and support access for patients in the -- on the smallest to largest populations across all sites of care and across all classes of trade. 
 And finally, our growth is supported by investments in our people, culture and all dimensions at ESG. By investing in our people and culture, we advance our most important resource. By committing to ESG, we create healthier futures around the world and unlock the added value of being a responsible and impact for enterprise, which ultimately enables a strong and healthy financial position to achieve long-term sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders. 
 AmerisourceBergen has made exceptional progress on our strategic priorities, further enhancing our differentiated value proposition and driving consistent outperformance throughout the year as we continue to capitalize on our positive momentum into fiscal 2022. We remain driven by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Now powered by 42,000 team members globally, we remain confident in our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and capabilities as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution services and differentiated manufacturer solutions. 
 Thank you to all our team members for their inspiring dedication this year, and we look forward to a great year ahead. 
 Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and to discuss fiscal '22 guidance. Jim? 
James Cleary: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. For AmerisourceBergen, fiscal 2021 was a momentous year as we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Amerisource and Bergen Brunswick merger completed, both the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the extension of the Walgreens contract through 2029, and our teams delivered another year of strong performance, driven by our continued execution and strategic decisioning. Our pharmaceutical-centric business, robust customer relationships and leadership in specialty distribution and services position us to be a partner in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access on a global scale.
 Before I turn to our results, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year September quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. I will provide commentary in 3 main areas this morning: first, I will review our consolidated results and segment performance in fiscal 2021, and then we will discuss our new reporting segments beginning in fiscal 2022 and will conclude with fiscal 2022 guidance.  
 Beginning with our fourth quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39, an increase of 26.5%, which was driven by both a full quarter's worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the strong performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment. Our consolidated revenue was $58.9 million, up approximately 20%, reflecting growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and Other. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue would have been up 9% from the prior year quarter. 
 Consolidated gross profit was $2 billion, up 51%, driven by increases in gross profit in both Pharmaceutical Distribution and other, which benefited from the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. This quarter's gross profit margin of 3.4% is 71 basis points higher than the prior year quarter as we had a full quarter of Alliance Healthcare in our consolidated results. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.3 billion versus $795 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the addition of Alliance Healthcare as well as investments in our talent and initiatives to support the company's current and future growth. This quarter's operating expense margin of 2.23% is 61 basis points higher than the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the full quarter impact of Alliance Healthcare in our consolidated results. Also as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we had a bad debt reversal of $13 million that impacts the year-over-year comparison of operating expenses. 
 Turning now to consolidated operating income. Our operating income was $694 million, up 31% compared to the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by increases in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance. Operating income margin was 1.18%, an increase of 10 basis points as a result of the contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the continued benefit from some of our higher-margin businesses.
 Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was $55 million, up 57% due to debt related to Alliance Healthcare. Our effective income tax rate was 20.3% compared to 21.7% in the prior year quarter. The lower effective tax rate was due to a change in the mix of domestic and international income from the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count was 210.8 million shares, a 2.2% increase due to the impact of the issuance accumulated shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and dilution related to employee stock compensation. This completes the review of our consolidated results.  
 Now I'll turn to our segment results for the fourth quarter. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $51.2 billion, up 8% in the quarter, driven by increased sales of specialty products, strong execution across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses and overall positive prescription utilization trends. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income increased by 11% to $472 million. Operating income margin expanded by 2 basis points to 0.92% in the quarter. AmerisourceBergen's continued leadership in specialty distribution allowed us to capture the benefits of strong utilization trends during the quarter. 
 I will now turn to Other, which includes Alliance Healthcare, MWI, World Courier and AmerisourceBergen Consulting. In the quarter, Other revenue was $7.7 billion, up from $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by a full quarter's worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare as well as growth in the global commercialization services and Animal Health businesses. Other operating income was $223 million, up from $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. That concludes our fiscal fourth quarter discussion. 
 Now I will turn to a discussion of our full year fiscal 2021 results. Our consolidated revenue was $214 million, up 13%, driven by growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and Other, which includes 4 months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue was up 9% from the prior year. Consolidated operating income grew 20% for the year to $2.6 billion, driven by strong performance across our businesses and the 4-month contribution of Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated operating income increased by an exceptional 12% from the prior year, driven by growth in our higher-margin businesses, strong fundamentals across our business and the important work our team has done to support the COVID therapy distribution for hospitalized patients. 
 From a segment perspective, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services had operating income growth of 13% due to strong performance across our portfolio of businesses and customers. In fiscal 2021, we continue to capitalize on our leadership in specialty distribution, both in the physician space and health systems. We saw a significant contribution from health systems as our differentiated solution set was leveraged by manufacturers to meet their complex logistics for the distribution of COVID-19 antivirals and therapies to hospitals across the country. 
 Additionally, we continue to have strong performance in Specialty Division Services this fiscal year as the health care system has become more accustomed to operating in the current environment. This supported physician diagnosis and related testing and screening processes, resulting in more normal levels of new patient starts. 
 In Other, operating income grew 54% year-over-year to $615 million. Other meaningfully benefited from the 4 months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare results, while World Courier and MWI also delivered strong results. As global logistics continue to be challenged by the pandemic, World Courier provided its expertise and innovative solutions to manufacture partners around the world, facilitating the movement of temperature-sensitive and other high-priority shipments. World Courier's direct-to-patient in home clinical trials continue to be a differentiator as patients and manufacturers saw alternative lower acuity care sites. 
 MWI continued to experience strong performance in the companion animal market as pet parents maintain their focus on their pet health and the production animal market, the reopening of restaurants and return of travel boosted protein demand.
 Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 21.3% compared to 20.8% in the prior fiscal year, which has benefited from discrete tax items. 
 Turning now to EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% and $9.26, primarily due to strong growth and execution across our business, including continued leadership and outperformance in specialty and the 4-month contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion, which was better than our expectations due primarily to the timing of certain customer payments in September, a benefit that will reverse in the December quarter due to the higher supplier payables. There was also better-than-expected cash flow at Alliance Healthcare. If you normalize for the timing-related benefit, our adjusted free cash flow for the year would have been roughly $1.7 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, excluding restricted cash of approximately $500 million. That completes the review of our fiscal 2021 results.  
 I will now discuss updates to our segment reporting, which will go into effect in fiscal 2022. Following the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the subsequent change to the geography of our business, we undertook a strategic evaluation of how we report our segments in order to provide alignment with business operations. Following this review, which concluded in October, we will begin reporting our results in 2 new segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, U.S. Health Care Solutions and International Health Care Solutions. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment will consist of our legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, excluding Profarma Distribution plus the following businesses, which had previously been reported in Other, MWI Animal Health, Xcenda, Lash Group, and ICS 3PL. 
 The International Healthcare Solutions segment will consist of our non-U.S.-based Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services solutions, including Alliance Healthcare, World Courier, Innomar and Profarma Distribution and Profarma Specialty. As a reminder, we consolidate Profarma's results due to our ownership interest and governance of the publicly-traded entity. Profarma Specialty was previously reported in Other.  
 This morning, we are also filing a Form 8-K with 3 segmented financials for fiscal 2021 in order to help your quarterly modeling. Our new reporting segments, like AmerisourceBergen, are built on the foundation of leading in pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses offering value-added solutions in key markets.
 Turning now to discuss our fiscal 2022 guidance. And as a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. So all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. 
 Starting with revenue. We expect consolidated revenue to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. On a segment level, we expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue to be approximately $207 billion to $212 billion, representing growth of 2% to 5% year-over-year. In International Healthcare Solutions, we expect revenue of approximately $26 billion to $27 billion. 
 Moving on to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income to grow in the mid- to high teens percent range. On a segment level, we expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income to be between $2.325 billion and $2.4 billion, representing growth of 3% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. The only business that was included in Pharmaceutical Distribution services that is not going into U.S. Health Care Solutions is Profarma Distribution, which contributed less than 1% of revenues for Pharmaceutical Distribution Services in fiscal 2021 and roughly 1% of segment operating income. 
 As a reminder, as I said back in February and again in August, we had a significant tailwind in fiscal 2021 related to the financial contribution from sales of COVID-19 therapies. We did have higher-than-expected COVID therapy sales in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by sales in the month of August with a subsequent substantial decline in September. The final EPS benefit from COVID therapy sales for full year fiscal 2021 was $0.30, $0.14 of which was in the first quarter. If you estimate the first quarter of fiscal 2022 based on even lower October trends, the contribution from COVID therapy sales would be $0.03, which means the first quarter would have an $0.11 headwind for U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. While this reduces the segment's growth rate in the first fiscal quarter, we expect full year operating income growth of 3% to 6% in U.S. Health Care Solutions. 
 We expect International Healthcare Solutions have operating income between $685 million and $715 million. Alliance Healthcare represents a little over 2/3 of operating income in the segment, with World Courier making up the majority of the remainder of segment operating income. As you think about your first quarter models, we expect about 25% of the International segment's operating income to occur in the first quarter. 
 As you look at fiscal 2022 for the International segments, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, we have agreed to sell Profarma Specialty as we focus on our core operating assets. The transaction is under regulatory review and is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2022. Successful completion of the divestiture is factored into our guidance and represents a 2% headwind to our International Healthcare Solutions segment's operating income. 
 Second, in fiscal 2022, we will have a step up in expenses at Alliance Healthcare that was fully contemplated when we announced the acquisition and is generally related to IT modernization. As Steve said earlier, we view technology and systems as fundamental to our operations and business continuity, and this step-up in fiscal 2022 expense will help align Alliance Healthcare's business technology, operability and infrastructure with AmerisourceBergen. 
 Alliance Healthcare continues to deliver on our expectations for the business, and we expect Alliance to be high teens accretive to our standalone adjusted diluted EPS in fiscal 2022. Since closing the transaction, our teams have engaged both in person and virtually and have furthered our strong relationships. Most recently, we held a deep dive with leaders across AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare, focused on Alliance Healthcare's manufacturer services businesses. I continue to be impressed by the strong and efficient business and team at Alliance and appreciate the collective thoughtfulness around creating long-term value for stakeholders through our innovative solutions.
 Moving on to interest expense, tax rate and share count. We expect interest expense to grow in the mid-teens percent range as a result of debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2022, based on current tax rates in effect for fiscal 2022. Without the tax rate benefit from Alliance Healthcare's operations, our range would have been 1% higher on both the top and bottom end of the range. 
 Finally, we expect that our share count will increase to approximately 212 million shares as a result of the full year impact of the 2 million shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the closing of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and normal dilution from stock compensation expense. 
 As a reminder, as part of our commitment to maintain our strong investment grade credit rating, we are committed to paying down $2 billion in total debt over the next 2 years in lieu of share repurchases. We currently expect to pay down roughly half that amount toward the end of fiscal 2022. As a result of these expectations, reflecting the strength of our business, we are guiding for adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.50 to $10.80, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13% to 17%.  
 Turning now to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations. CapEx is expected to be in the range of $500 million as we continue to invest to further advance our business or to buy Alliance Healthcare's IT infrastructure and support additional growth opportunities. For adjusted free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which includes the benefit of Alliance Healthcare in our results for the entire fiscal year. 
 In closing, fiscal 2021 was another successful year for AmerisourceBergen as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities while the pandemic persisted. I am proud of our 42,000 team members, who worked tirelessly to support our customers, partners and patients and drove our strong financial results. Given the steps we took in 2021 to advance our business, I'm excited about our 2022 fiscal year as we continue to deliver stakeholder value. 
 As we continue to drive our business forward, we will maintain our focus on our differentiated capabilities supported by our dedicated team members. AmerisourceBergen is guided by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, built on a foundation of leadership in Pharmaceutical Distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses that leverage our pharmaceutical scale and expertise to create unparalleled value for our manufacturer partners and health care provider customers.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will be from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. 
Lisa Gill: Jim, I just want to go back to your comments around the U.S. drug distribution. I understand that there's a number of incremental businesses that are now within that segment, but you made a comment about COVID-19 therapies. So when we think about 2022, one, is there nothing built into your expectation around that? And two, just given the number of new therapies that are coming to market, for example, I think about the new Merck therapy that's just been announced, is it not reasonable to think that there's going to be some benefit as we go into 2022 for COVID therapies, would be my first question. And then secondly, can you just help us to understand the underlying trends? So for example, what are your expectations around utilization trends? What's your expectation around cough, cold, flu, acute scripts kind of coming back and people visiting the office -- the physician office again, et cetera. If you can just help us to better understand that, that would be great. 
James Cleary: Lisa, thank you. Great question. I'll answer that question from a financial perspective, and then I think Steve will want to add in and talk a little bit more about the business. But as you know, our guidance for this year for our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, revenue growth of 2% to 5% and adjusted operating income growth of 3% to 6%. And it's based on continued strong performance really across the business, where we continue to benefit from our differentiated position. 
 Now with regard to your question on COVID therapies, we don't expect to repeat the benefit that we had in fiscal year '21 from our exclusivity on the distribution of the main commercial COVID therapy. The benefit we got from COVID therapies in fiscal year '21, as I said in my prepared remarks, was $0.30. 
 And kind of let me give you some of the breakdown there. During the first quarter, it was $0.14, second quarter was $0.07, third quarter was $0.03 and fourth quarter was $0.06. So I'm sure that will help you in your modeling. And as we're looking at fiscal year '22, we expect the benefit that we get in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 to be $0.03. So we have an $0.11 headwind in the first quarter of fiscal year '22. And so we do expect to have lower operating income growth in U.S. Health Care Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal year '20, but we -- of course, as I said, expect 3% to 6% operating income growth for the full year, which includes, of course, Q1. 
 Now you asked about other COVID therapies. And of course, it's early, but we may very well get some benefit from other COVID therapies. And that's exactly why we have -- one of the reasons why we have a range, and we have a $0.30 range in our EPS between $10.50 and $10.80. We don't expect a lot of incremental benefit in the first quarter, but it could come later on in the year. 
 Now you also asked about utilization friends, which is a great question. And we are seeing strong utilization trends across our business, which has improved sequentially from the positive trends that we noted in our third fiscal quarter. And prescription trends are strong and have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. And we did see -- have seen strong utilization improvement trends across the business in the second half and expect that to continue to benefit us in fiscal year '22 across our businesses and customers.
 And I see that Steve would like to just add a couple of things on the overall business. 
Steven Collis: We're entering '22 with all of our businesses performing very well, Lisa, and benefiting from a somewhat normal environment, but it is the innovation factor that remains. And I saw that the Merck [indiscernible], while we're on the call, the Merck got approved in the U.K., an oral. So continued innovation and it's possible that we could be working with some therapies in the future, as we have in the past, particularly in the emergency use authorization phase is where we've been successful in working on an exclusive basis. So we're happy and very -- if I look back on '21, I think of it is a year that the last deal got done and the year that we responded so well to assisting with the need for corresponding to the COVID pandemic and including keeping our people safe. So that's what I think would be the highlights. But Jim, I think you gave an exhaustive answer. So we'll probably move on to the next question, please. 
Operator: The next question will come from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. 
Charles Rhyee: Jim, I just wanted to follow up on the guidance, particularly in the International Health Care segment here. You said, you were planning to sell the Profarma Specialty business and said there was a 2% headwind. That's 2% headwind to the full year operating income, but it's not going to sell until -- so it's really double that for the back half of fiscal '22. And did you give a revenue impact as well? 
James Cleary: Yes. No, we haven't given revenue impact, but you are right, it is a 2% headwind for the whole year. And we're assuming we're going to sell that business during the first half of the year. And of course, our International Healthcare Solutions segment is really driven by Alliance Healthcare being the largest part of the segment, and we feel very good about the performance of Alliance. It's operating at or above our deal model. And then the next biggest piece of the International Healthcare Solutions segment is, of course, our World Courier business, which is also performing well. 
Operator: And the next question will be from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. 
Steven J. Valiquette: Basically, a lot of the discussion points around freight costs, the ability for drug distributors to pass some of that through or have to absorb that. There's a lot of components to that. It can be higher labor costs. It could just be higher fuel costs, et cetera. But just curious to hear about how you guys are handling that? And whether there's any impact in your business one way or the other? Or can you fully either pass that through or just not have that be as a material impact to the company? 
James Cleary: Yes. I think really in the summary that it is fully reflected in our guidance. And in fiscal year '22, and we do expect to continue to have higher expenses associated with picking, packing, shipping. There are some offsets from certain other FY '21 expenses that are not planned to repeat in FY '22. But of course, we keep a close eye on economic trends that can impact our business, and we have seen wage and transportation inflation across our business. During the summer, we moved quickly to adjust wages to ensure that they remain competitive and market aligned, and that's reflected in our fourth quarter results. And these things, like higher labor and transportation costs, they're fully contemplated in our fiscal year '22 guidance, and we'll manage these expenses as we do each year and work with our partners and customers to ensure that we're diligent in maintaining our fair compensation for the services we provide. 
Operator: The next question is from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. 
Eric Percher: I want to take the other side of the U.S. question asked earlier. So this also includes MWI animal, Xcenda. Is it fair to assume that that's growing more than the 3% to 6% for the total segment? Are there any headwinds coming out of fiscal year '21 we should be aware of? And then relative to the resegmentation, when we look at 3% to 6%, is that apples and apples? Are there any changes in corporate expense now allocated to the EU segment or the global service entity in Switzerland that would impact the 3% to 6%? 
James Cleary: Yes. And so there aren't any changes in the corporate allocation, and when we add businesses like MWI Animal Health and the consulting businesses to U.S. Health Care Solutions, MWI has had a stronger growth rate, particularly in fiscal year '21, the Animal Health business really benefited from the pandemic and the increase in debt ownership. And so that has been a higher growth business in fiscal year '21, whereas the consulting business has been a lower growth business. And so I think that gives you a little bit of additional color there. And then one thing that we are doing today is, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are filing an 8-K where we'll show the segments. The 2 new segments will show that on a historical basis for fiscal year '21, and how they look in the fiscal year '21. And I think probably a key thing is that when we look at the U.S. segment for this upcoming year, we're expecting 3% to 6% growth, which is largely apples to apples because of the size of the legacy business that are going into the new segment. 
Operator: And the next question will be from Jailendra Singh from Credit Suisse. 
Jailendra Singh: I was wondering if you could comment on the potential impacts from the recent changes coming out of Washington around Medicare, negotiating drug prices, among other components. With your leading presence in specialty products, how do you think about the implications as Medicare ramps up a number of drugs it is negotiating? 
Steven Collis: Yes. Thank you for the question. So U.S. is -- I think somewhat over fixated on the cost of medications relative to overall health care spending. We've been very interested in benefit design, and we also prefer when the market creates their own solutions for problems, such as high copays for adherence products that are so detrimental to the system when a diabetic patient doesn't take the insulin. So we see some real strong benefits if we can remove some barriers that have been officially created on products like that. 
 On specialty, it's a little bit too early to tell. I think we've been through many changes in reimbursement, including the change to ASP, a tremendous growth in the hospital outpatient market for specialty drugs. And the wholesalers are very resilient, and we also do believe that [indiscernible] understand the health care, pharmaceuticals are the most efficient form of health care. So there's nothing that tremendously concerns us as a business. Our concern is always with preserving innovation and making sure that our providers have a stable reimbursement environment that they can get, continue to run their businesses and take care of patients. But definitely, I think we spend a lot of time, and I'm not very interested in. Thanks for the question. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. 
Kevin Caliendo: Just in terms of the -- in the guidance, I just want to understand the capital deployment expectations. You gave us the share count, we understand that. Should we just assume that the vast majority of the free cash flow then will be to pay down debt? Or how should we think about it? 
James Cleary: Yes. And so as we've said before, we do plan to take down about 2/3 of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition debt by the end of fiscal year '23. We've started that process, so it's about $2 billion that we'll be paying down during that time frame. We expect to pay down about half of that in fiscal year '22. And so that is kind of one of the key parts of our capital deployment. We'll also, of course, continue to invest in the business and invest in current future growth in fiscal year '22. 
Operator: And the next question is from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. 
Unknown Analyst: This is [ Eduardo ] on for Elizabeth. Just maybe given the Walgreens' new expansion toward becoming a provider of health care services, how do you envision your relationship within them evolving? And what can you do to support their new strategy? 
Steven Collis: Yes. Thank you. We're tremendously proud of the benefits we're getting from the recently announced Alliance transaction, including that we have a contract with Boots, who's become a very significant customer with -- of our Alliance division through 2031. And most importantly, we extended our Walgreens contract in the U.S. through 2029. And this is such a fundamental customer for us that helps us establish such a strong base of scale and efficiency. 
 And I think the teams are at a very good state where we're looking to how can we help with one and other priorities. We have these discussions with all our large customers and the need for the very large customers like Walgreens are very different than say, the independent veterinarians, the community pharmacists. But yes, for example, we're supporting WBA with their central fill initiatives, and we're looking to understand better how we can help with their strategies on the institutional side. So I just would say that the relationship is in a good place, and we still go back to that 2013 agreement as being very fundamental to the success of AmerisourceBergen over the last decade. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. 
Michael Cherny: So if I could just circle back a bit on the Americas growth in the U.S. Health Care segment. As you think about the moving pieces -- and I appreciate the color, Jim, you gave so far relative to the market improvement, but in terms of the upside, downside of the range, what are the macro factors have to look like to get to those numbers? And I'm more just curious because on an all-in basis, you have obviously been tracking higher than that and outpacing the rest of the market. And so whether -- antivirals are one component, but what else are the moving pieces that you think about in terms of what encapsulates the range on the U.S. segment? 
James Cleary: Sure. And so one of the key things is something that I've talked about in the prepared remarks and then also in an earlier answer, but I'll just quickly cover it again given the scale. And that's the impact that COVID therapies could have. So that really impacts the range. And again, it was a $0.30 of benefit in fiscal year '21 and $0.14 of that came in the first quarter of fiscal year '21, and we're expecting that the benefit will be significantly less in fiscal year '22. But Steve talked about some of the innovation that's occurring, it could be higher. And so that's something that certainly could impact the range, and that would be one of the larger things. 
 And then, of course, there's always a number of moving pieces in our businesses. We have very strong performing businesses, but they're moving pieces within the businesses in terms of growth rates. And then there's sorts of things that I've also mentioned, like some higher labor and transportation costs and how those trend. And so those are some of the things that impact us within the range. But I do want to say that we have a lot of confidence in the business, and we are expecting continued strong performance across the business because of our differentiated physician and our strength, both within Pharmaceutical Distribution and Manufacturer solutions. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steven Collis for any closing remarks. 
Steven Collis: Thank you, operator. It's truly been an honor to spend this hour with you, highlighting a very successful 2021, which the management team is extremely proud of. We're also really proud of and appreciate of the tremendous efforts of our associates. We enter fiscal year '22 with all of our businesses performing well, and we look forward to building on the success and momentum in fiscal year '22. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 16:47:12) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to CoreSite Realty Corporation Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kate Ruppe, Investor Relations for CoreSite Realty Corporation. Thank you. You may begin.
Kate Ruppe: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of our full earnings release, which can be found on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at coresite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for joining our earnings call. I will cover our third quarter and year-to-date highlights, and Steve and Jeff will discuss sales and financial matters in more detail. We delivered another strong quarter financial results including operating revenues of $164 million, resulting in 6.4% year-over-year growth, adjusted EBITDA of $86 million, resulting in growth of 5.2% year-over-year, and FFO per share of $1.39 or 4.5% year-over-year growth. We also reported strong operating performance, including cash rent mark-to-market year-to-date of 2.9%, churn year-to-date of 4.6%, in line with our expectations, and 5.0% year-over-year MRR per cabinet equivalent growth, driven by strong power and interconnection revenue growth. Today, we will discuss leasing results of $8.9 million comprised of third quarter leasing of $7.2 million in annualized GAAP rent, and a $1.7 million scale lease at SV7 signed on October 7. Demand continues to be positive for deployments and agile interconnection in our network and cloud-enabled data center campuses in major metropolitan edge markets. And we believe supply and demand are generally in balance. As Steve will mention, sales cycles are a bit longer due to other distractions for certain scale customers. But our sales funnel continues to be at a high level relative to our history. Turning to our property development, we executed pre leases for some of LA3 Phase 2 during the third quarter, and we completed construction of Phase 2 in October. The LA3 Phase 1 is now 93% leased, less than 12-months after placing the project into service, reflecting the strength of our position in the Los Angeles market, and continued solid sales activity. NY2 Phase 4A, a 4 megawatt computer room also remains on track for a Q1, 2022 delivery. And we continue to make good progress on the remaining pre-construction activities to bring SV9 to a shovel ready state. Completing demolition of the existing building and working with Silicon Valley Power to finalize power procurement by the end of the year. We are fortunate to have very strong customer ecosystems on our uniquely positioned network and cloud-enabled campuses, which drive diverse demand with good margins and attractive returns, reflecting the value customers can achieve in our environment. Our very capable team continues to add to our campuses, important customers with potential for future growth. And our purpose built power efficient and scalable data center campuses, differentiated by our flexible and diverse interconnection platform provide ideal environments for secure, high performance, multi and hybrid cloud solutions, that enterprises require in order to be cost effective, agile and forward thinking in their deployment of digital solutions. In summary, we are pleased with the progress made during the quarter, and see more opportunity ahead to participate in the ongoing migration to a hybrid cloud world with extensive interoperability among customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I'll review our sales results, and then talk about some notable wins. To begin, we had new and expansion sales of $8.9 million of annualized GAAP rent, comprised of $7.2 million signed during the third quarter, and a $1.7 million large scale lease at SV7 signed on October 7. We believe including the $1.7 million lease signed in early October for purposes of our discussion today is instructive, given the size and as this customer lease is backfilling a portion of the churn at SV7, which we have previously disclosed. The leasing metrics discussed in the rest of my prepared remarks are inclusive of the $1.7 million lease signed on October 7. Keep in mind, our reported new and expansion sales results only include the rental revenue component of the new leases. The $8.9 million of GAAP rent for new and expansion sales reflected 62,000 net rentable square feet at an average annualized GAAP rent of $143 per net rentable square foot, which was lower than the trailing 12-month average, due to lower than average densities for certain scale deployments. Our results also included 28 new logos or $1.9 million annualized GAAP rent. Our best quarter for new logos in terms of annualized GAAP rent since the third quarter of 2019. I will review a few specific new logo use cases in a moment. The $8.9 million of GAAP rent also includes a number of leases that signed SV7, which represents approximately $2.9 million of annualized GAAP rent. Turning to pricing, new and expansion pricing on a kilowatt basis this quarter was above the trailing 12-month average by mid-single digits, reflecting the mix of both size and location of leases signed. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets for signed leases were Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, and Northern Virginia, which combined represented 88% of our annualized GAAP rent signed. Looking at organic growth, existing customers continue to provide strong demand, which is an essential part of our strategy. Existing customer expansions accounted for 78% of annualized GAAP rent signed, as more businesses adopt digital solutions to meet today's evolving marketplace. Noteworthy expansions from existing customers included a scale deployment from a global online gaming platform, expanding their footprint into our Los Angeles campus, a multi-market expansion by a network service provider in Los Angeles, New York and Northern Virginia, and a large scale deployment from a subscription-based digital content streaming company in the Bay Area. Turning to a new customer wins, the $1.9 million of annualized GAAP rent represents approximately 22% of our sales. As I mentioned, it was our best quarter for new logo sales since the third quarter of 2019. Successfully attracting high-quality new customers that value the interoperability of our portfolio ecosystem, deepens CoreSite’s competitive moat, and helps drive future growth. Enterprises contributed to 55% of new logo annualized GAAP rent signed during the quarter, which included a leading data management and storage systems company in the Bay Area, and email and social networking and marketing firm in Northern Virginia, a cybersecurity company providing prevention and detection solutions signing the scale deployment in the Bay Area, and a well-known domain registrar and web hosting company joining our robust Los Angeles customer community. Lastly, total data center occupancy decreased slightly this quarter, primarily due to the previously forecasted single tenant lease expiration at SV7, which was also included in our third quarter churn. But the majority of this customer’s lease expiration now behind us, we have a clear path towards our targeted occupancy goal in the high 80s range. As we finish out the year, we are encouraged by our solid execution of our core business. However, we have noticed slower processing and response times for certain customers seemingly distracted by other issues, such as supply chains and staffing, which we're all aware. We have specifically revised practices to improve the process and timing of existing certain scale customers and keeping leasing on track, as demand for high performance edge use cases in strategic metropolitan markets continues to grow. Our diligence and discipline in attracting and winning deployments that value or add value to our ecosystem remains the primary focus. We are driven to provide continued profitable growth by attracting high-quality new logos, and delivering incremental value to our customers and shareholders through higher value lease up across our portfolio. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our third quarter and year-to-date results, discuss our balance sheet, liquidity and leverage and then touch on our 2021 capital expenditures guidance. Looking at our financial results for the quarter, operating revenues were $163.9 million, an increase of 6.4% year-over-year. Lease renewals of $18.7 million of annualized GAAP rent were completed during the quarter, resulting in cash rent mark-to-market of 2% and GAAP mark-to-market of 5.7%. We also reported churn of 2.5% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations and includes 160 basis points of churn related to the single tenant lease at SV7. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $7.1 million of annualized GAAP rent, our revenue backlog consists of $9.9 million of annualized GAAP rent, or $17.2 million on a cash basis for leases signed, but not yet commenced, inclusive of the $1.7 million scale lease signed at SV7 on October 7. We expect approximately 60% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the fourth quarter of 2021, and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence during the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was at $85.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 5.2% year-over-year. Net income was $0.50 per diluted share for the quarter, consistent year-over-year. And third quarter FFO per share was $1.39, an increase of $0.06 or 4.5% year-over-year. Turning to our financial results here year-to-date, total operating revenues were $483.6 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7%. Adjusted EBITDA of $259.1 million, increasing 7.2% year-over-year, and representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.6%. And FFO per share as adjusted of $4.20 increased 5.8% year-over-year. Each of the above items are in line with our goal to achieve mid to high single digit growth levels. Moving to our balance sheet, our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA increased to 5.2 times as of September 30, as expected. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio was 5.1 times. We ended the quarter with approximately $235.4 million of liquidity, providing us the ability to fully fund the remainder of our 2021 business plan. Looking at our 2021 capital expenditures guidance, we have spent about $103 million year-to-date, compared to the midpoint of our guidance at $205 million in total capital expenditures for 2021. We are continuing to work through the remaining pre-construction activities at SV9, and we anticipate breaking ground sometime in 2022. But timing is ultimately dependent on overall absorption in the Bay Area. As a result, we now expect to invest approximately $140 million to $150 million in total capital expenditures in 2021, which is reflected in our updated capital expenditure guidance. Refer to Page 21, of our supplemental for our full 2021 guidance. As it relates to 2022, we will provide detailed annual guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in early February. In closing, with the majority of the SV7, single tenant lease expiration now behind us, we have more visibility into increasing our occupancies which will achieve even greater flow through of revenue growth to margins, leading to margin expansion and value creation for shareholders. With that operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Jon Atkin: Thank you. So I had a couple of questions, the pricing on new leases signed looks like it was a multi-year row. And that doesn't include, obviously the impact of what you did in October, which was a restarting a second generation space. So given that dynamic around the backfill of SV7, and then what you posted on pricing during the 3Q, anything to kind of expect going forward around pricing?
Steve Smith: Hey, Jon, it’s Steve. Yeah, I think overall, as far as pricing is concerned, on a square footage basis it was down a bit this quarter, primarily just due to lower than average densities. So we have fluctuations in density based on the sales mix every quarter. But collectively, pricing remained strong, and I think you see that, if you look at it on a per kilowatt basis that reflects that.
Jon Atkin: Would that include second generation space as well? Or, could that drag down some of the recent trends that you've seen on a per kW basis?
Steve Smith: I think that holds true overall.
Paul Szurek: Jon, sorry, I would just point you back to Steve's comments in his prepared remarks about power pricing being actually higher on a per kilowatt basis -- pricing on a per kilowatt basis being higher than prior quarters.
Jon Atkin: Got it. And then, wondered if there was any trends that you're seeing in the federal vertical, whether it's government agencies or excise doing work for federal agencies, and if you've had some success with that past, anything around general demands that you are seeing which actually benefit from?
Steve Smith: Yeah, we are seeing more pipeline growth there, which is encouraging to see, and we have had some success there in the past. I would like to see more and I think there's a good opportunity to improve our results there. So it's good to see the pipeline improve there. We think there's a good opportunity.
Jon Atkin: And then lastly, on the new logo generation, what have you seen around cross-connects take up rates within your new logos and several use cases that you mentioned?
Steve Smith: Sure. Well, as I mentioned, this is one of our best quarters as far as overall revenue is concerned. And that's a big focus of my team, and our marketing, messaging and so forth is to ensure that enterprises and new logos see the value in CoreSite and the uniqueness it brings to helping them navigate the hybrid multi cloud environment that's out there. We feel like we got a very unique value proposition and the amount of networks and native onramps to those cloud providers that very, very few other providers have. And our messaging and our sales objectives are really to ensure that we attract and win more new logos as they become the basis for the overall growth of the company, which you saw in our typical results.
Jon Atkin: And then lastly, I wondered if you could give us a view on M&A and to what extent you feel like it might make sense at some point to become part of a larger platform, whether that's you acquiring somebody or the other way around?
Paul Szurek: You know, as we've said many, many times in the past, we have looked at many acquisitions, and they have to fit from -- there are potential acquisitions, they have to fit from the standpoint of strategy, pricing, value creation, and our particular model. And we don't expect any change in that kind of surveillance. As to the rest of your question, as we've also said frequently, our policy is not to comment on any sort of speculation around that type of activity.
Jon Atkin: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Are you seeing any impact from inflation on any current leasing negotiations? How do you think that will work? And then, can you give us a little bit more detail on some of the contractual obligations you've got with some of your facilities, from the suppliers or the length of those terms? And how well protected you're on that? Thanks.
Steve Smith: I think from a leasing perspective, I can give you that side of it, Frank. It's definitely interesting world out there for sure, I don't think it's necessarily impacted the leasing dynamic per se, but it does increase the importance of working closely with our vendors and how we coordinate not just the colocation aspect, but there's a lot of different moving parts to get customers deployed, whether it's servers, cage material, and whatever it might be to actually deploy that. So we've implemented additional measures with all of our teams to ensure that we're ahead of that. We're planning for any changes in pricing or supply chain and that kind of thing, and navigating that as closely as possible.
Paul Szurek: Frank, maybe I can just give you some additional color on some of those additional obligations. I would look at it from really two perspectives, one being the development side, which we've substantially locked in all the development we're doing today, just given when we started those projects. So we don't see any inflationary pressures on what we've got under development today, most of that was ordered well before we started development there. But on the operating perspective, we do look at and go out to contractually lock in some of those operating costs, usually out in periods of two to three years. And we generally roll those depending upon the type of service. Some of those are up and we're in the midst of bidding for some of that tier over the next couple of years. And then some have a couple of years before they roll off. My hat's off to our vendors, they've stayed with their contractual obligations on those obligations, even though we know they're getting some pressures. And we'll just have to monitor and see how this next round of contractual obligations go with what we've got out in the market today. We'll know those results probably over the next two to four months.
Frank Louthan: Alright, great. Thank you. And maybe I missed this. But did you guys discuss what's your exposures on power and what power costs, and whether you're hedged on that?
Jeff Finnin: Frank, no, we didn't touch on it yet. Just to give you some idea, when you look at our power utilization across our portfolio, we have about 30% of our power use that occurs inside our deregulated markets. I point you to that, because that's the area that near-term where we probably see the most impact. When you look at and factor in ultimately, what's in those deregulated markets, how much of that is really subject to cost increases, it's really our breakered power model, which certain mostly our retail customers pay us a fixed price, and that's probably where we've got the most exposure. When you go through the amounts there, we've got about -- if you assume about a 10% increase in power cost in those markets, it would have an impact of about $0.02 per share, assuming you don't pass any of those costs on to our customers. We do look at that on an annual basis and assess how much of that we're going to pass on to our customers. We do have that right inside our contractual rights and licenses with our customers.
Frank Louthan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you very much for the question. Around this time of every year, Jeff and Paul, you have historically given us some kind of color on what the CapEx trajectory looks like in the following year. Could you give us an idea on what that looks like just because your CapEx guidance is moving around now? And I have a follow-up.
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, you bet. Sami, I think you probably saw the notes and heard the commentary on the prepared remarks around the timing around SV9 and its impact on our 2021 CapEx. As you think about 2022, we will obviously give detailed guidance in early February. Here's how I would think about it. When you look at us over the past few years, we historically have had somewhere around $200 million of CapEx, in those years, when we're building out inside existing corn shell. So without including any type of ground up development. And so I would think about 2022 in the range of $200 million, and then it could be elevated when and if we start development that ground up development at SV9. And as we said in our prepared remarks that's going to be dependent on overall market absorption and as Paul alluded to finalizing our agreements with Silicon Valley Power. But that's why I think about it $200 million and then probably elevated from there, as and when we start development on SV9.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you. Now I do have a follow-up, it just slipped my mind completely. So you can hand it over to the next analyst. Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Yeah. No problem, Sami. Get back in the queue, when you can.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Erik Rasmussen: Yeah, thank you for taking the questions. Just circling back on the comment you made about customers slower response times and response to the supply chain. So just trying to -- is this just for scale or is it just enterprise, or is this all customers that you're talking about? Is this sort of the main reason why we haven't seen much scale business beyond sort of this early Q4 deal that you've looked at SV7?
Steve Smith: Yeah, I would say, it becomes more magnified with the size of the deal, just because the amount of the moving parts that are going on there, right. So it definitely becomes more complicated. But I would say, overall, as far as the scale pipeline is concerned and our overall pipeline, we have confidence in where it sits today and the opportunities that it presents for us going forward. Some of these larger deals do take more time, and have more components, as I mentioned. And if you think about the deal that we announced in this earnings call, that had a lot of moving parts to it, that we had to work very closely with the customer in order to get it across the line. But I think, the important factor to stay focused on is our main goal, which is maintaining and achieving mid to high single digit FFO growth, which is not just driven from top-line revenue, but more by pricing, interconnection and power margins that we remain focused on. So that's the main thing I think to stay focused around.
Erik Rasmussen: Great. Maybe just to follow up on that. And this speaks to sort of the lack of scale deals we've seen, but you had the 40 million leasing guideposts for the year. I think year-to-date you're around 24 million. Based on where we sit today, how realistic is it as you sort of looked to close the gap on this, or timing of this in these large scale deals is so lumpy, that maybe it's just the things sort of slide into the next year, and maybe there's a better set approve in next year?
Steve Smith: Well, we're absolutely striving to hit it. And as I mentioned, we're opportunistically encouraged by our funnel, and think that has an opportunity to get us there. At the same time, those are large deals that swing that number pretty significantly. I mean, if you look at our core business, we performed very well in that regard, which does drive the majority of our FFO growth. So, as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks, we're trying to remain disciplined and diligent around how we ensure we're driving returns for our shareholders, at the same time, not sacrificing top-line growth to do that. So, it's a balance, and we've got good opportunity to achieve both, and we strive to do that.
Erik Rasmussen: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Choe: I just wanted to follow-up on the new logos in the signings. You said they're lower density. But will that change over time as those customers mature? And can you remind us what the kind of normal process you see with signing new customers and how they take more space and power over time?
Steve Smith: I think, as far as new logos are concerned, I don't think we're saying that the new logos in themselves were lower density. I think overall, the bookings were of lower density. I'm not sure if we have the exact numbers on the density of the new logos at this point where we can get to that. But overall, I would say, collectively, densities continue to increase slightly, as customers become more efficient, and hardware becomes more efficient. So I think collectively, you just got to look at the trend line. One of the benefits of how we're structured in engineering, our data centers is to really manage that overall collective density across the portfolio. So you'll have some deployments that are lower dense, some that are higher dense, but our design allows us to accommodate that to ultimately meet the desired impact.
Jeff Finnin: Richard, the only thing I'd add on the second part of your question, typically when customers deploy and their subsequent growth inside our portfolio, I would tell you that for our retail customers, once they deploy, they will probably get to a stabilized power draw and cross-connect utilization column within 12-months, assuming they don't take additional space and power from us. On the scale of customers, it takes them a little bit longer, I would point you probably somewhere between 12 to 24-months, as they ramp up and deploy their gear. And so, much of what you see from some of those scale customers over that period of time is increases in the power consumption and utilization. And then they're continuing to connect on the interconnection side to those parties that they need to exchange into business will, again, for the larger ones takes about a 12 to 24-month time period, before we see them start to stabilize.
Richard Choe: Great. And the same store MRR per cabinet increased 5% year-over-year, and that's accelerating. Can you give us a sense of what's going on there and can it continue to grow at this rate?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah Richard, I mean, that is a reflection on very consistent with what I was stating on customers getting deployed. And what you're really seeing drive, I think Paul commented on that is really increases in our power revenue, and increases in interconnection revenue. Those are really the two components driving that, at least in the third quarter. At 5% on average, we generally see that MRR per cabi grow somewhere in the low to mid-single digit growth rates. And I think that that's where in large part we expect to be on a go forward basis. And it'll just depend on how quickly we see that based on customer installs, and overall utilization of their space and deployments.
Richard Choe: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Guarino with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
David Guarino: Maybe for Paul, a number of your public and private peers have seen really good success outside the U.S. So I wonder if you could just remind us of the reasons why CoreSite wouldn't want to bring with a pretty strong reputation and strong knowledge base outside of the U.S.?
Paul Szurek: Well, I wouldn't roll it out forever. But we've had plenty of good things to focus on here, and quite honestly, just building a better model and stronger campus ecosystems, and perfecting the playbook that we can take elsewhere. I think a lot of what you've seen, I don't have a detailed view into it as you probably do, but much of that has been hyperscale. And as you know, that's just not our bread and butter. But we do believe that down the road, maybe there's an opportunity to expand to additional markets, domestically or maybe abroad with the mousetrap that we're building, especially the improved connectivity products that we've been implementing over the last two years, to make interconnection more scalable, more flexible, more dynamic, more diverse, and more automated for customers, and therefore avoid the need for them to have extensive network engineering expertise within their own systems, within their own companies. And pairing that up with these very dense customer ecosystems that are dense with cloud onramps, networks and diverse enterprises. So it's a good playbook. It's a good program. And, we've gotten a lot better at it over the last few years.
David Guarino: Okay. It's good to hear that something's open minded to looking outside the U.S. And maybe just one unrelated follow-up, I wanted to ask about the stabilized yield targets. You guys are still holding to that 12% to 16%, even with the lower asking rents per square foot this quarter. So, are these still realistic return hurdles? Or, do you think there might be some downside risk to the midpoint in the near future?
Paul Szurek: So, let me take a stab at that, and then Jeff can jump in if he needs to. But, it's important not to focus on a single variable like price per square foot, because as Steve explained, that will move around quarter to quarter based upon the density and locations of our sales mix each quarter. On a per kilowatt basis, we're still seeing the same and even slightly stronger pricing. And meanwhile, we continue to see good margin increments from these deployments and use cases that drive additional margin from power, from interconnection, and even from a lesser amount of other services. So, between all of that, we haven't felt the need to change our guidance on what our return on invested capital will be. And I know some of your peers track that and they see how we continue to do relative to the rest of the industry. But I want you to remember that ROIC achievement is a derivative of the main focus, which is providing value to customers. The best way to provide value to customers is to create these campus ecosystems in the right markets, where companies need to interoperate, and where the most important data use cases for the future are likely to take place. And that makes them more magnetic, more sticky, and more sustainable in terms of growth, relative to other ways to deploy capital.
Jeff Finnin: David, the only thing I'd add to what Paul said is, I’d just point to our most recent experience with our most recent stabilized investment, which is SV8. At some point during earlier this year, that asset hit stabilization, which, as you know, we define an excess of 93% occupancy. The returns we saw at that point in time were just shy of that minimum, so somewhere in that mid-11 percentile. And also, as I was explaining earlier, it's still going to take another period of several quarters here before some of those customers stabilize their ultimate architecture, and therefore, deployments where they'll draw some additional power and cross-connects. We anticipate getting above that threshold on that asset here in the near future. But that gives us the most recent data set. So I think it's still hitting our underwriting. And we have two others that we've invested in, obviously, LA3, which is in currently sup, and then probably the most recent one before that is VA3. And we'll see how we do on those two, but we're optimistic with those thresholds. Time will tell whether or not that needs to be modified down the road, but based on the recent history, we're still comfortable with those thresholds.
David Guarino: Thanks for the color, Jeff. That's really helpful. I mean, given you guys don't have property level disclosure anymore, it's harder from our seats to figure that out. But to the extent you can provide some anecdotes like that, that's really helpful.
Jeff Finnin: Always happy to help, David.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks. I wanted to come back to the CapEx reduction for this year. I think what you said was that, essentially due to the slower leasing pay, presumably at SV7, essentially you're slow walking the development of SV9. So just a function market conditions there and short execution there. Is that summarizing that correctly?
Paul Szurek: No, Jordan. The development schedule on SV9 -- and I'm glad you asked a question because I do want to clarify that is driven more by the timing of permitting, and especially now, the last important pole in the tent is securing power from Silicon Valley Power, which we expect to achieve by the end of this year. We've done a significant amount of pre-construction work already, including demolition of the existing building, all the off-site work for connectivity and utilities, all of the design and everything. And we have some decision points that we have going forward as to other things we can do to shorten the pot once we aggressively go vertical. But now, we don't need the capacity immediately. But we've got about 7, 8 megawatts available in Silicon Valley. And we've been absorbing about 5 to 6 megawatts per year. So, that probably gives you some indication of what our decision trees look like. But we're not going to do anything obviously of significant magnitude, until we finish the power procurement process.
Jordan Sadler: And what's the timeline to finish that, Paul?
Paul Szurek: The power procurement process?
Jordan Sadler: Yeah.
Paul Szurek: I think I said earlier, I apologize if I wasn't clear. We expect that to be done by the end of this year. And understand, it's a process where you have to get agreement with the power company, which we have in principle, and then it has to go to City Council for approval. And then we can execute contract for it.
Jordan Sadler: And so, all that is planned -- or construction next year or essentially, you would rather wait until some of the 7 to 8 megawatts are more fully leased? How much do you want to have in place?
Paul Szurek: I mean, honestly, it really depends on what the funnel looks like, what pre-construction leasing negotiations look like. I can't give you a definitive formula right now. That's based solely on absorption.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. But the short answer is you won't necessarily start construction right away in 2022, if all goes according to plan with SV8?
Paul Szurek: Not necessarily, but it's also possible that we do.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then, on the power exposure, Jeff, that was helpful, a couple pennies exposure. But could you maybe -- I know it's 30% of power uses in deregulated markets. What percent is hedged in your deregulated markets?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, no, great question. Jordan, I should have included that in there. Our policy generally is to try and hedge about 50% of that power use in those markets, to give us some idea of balance and we used to go out two to three years.
Jordan Sadler: And then what's the policy on passing through power increases? How does that happen mechanically in your contracts?
Jeff Finnin: So, really look at it from two components, one, certain of our customers, about 45% of our portfolio wide revenue is on a metered basis. So those are just pure pass through, irrespective what's happening, right. So those customers just pay those costs. The other 55%, that's more on a breakered model, some of which is in our deregulated, obviously, some of it's in our regulated markets. Generally, we have the ability to pass through those costs to those customers. From a practical perspective, we've looked at it on an annual basis, because you just haven't seen power rates increase that significantly, that quickly, to where we'd have to do it more regular than that. If you start to see power price increases, spike significantly short amount of time, it would probably necessitate us looking at that a little bit more timely than on an annual basis. But generally, we'll look at that late in the year, like as we're talking today, and then put the process in place to address that early so that it's in place for early in the next fiscal year.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great. Maybe just a follow-up on those last questions. How much have you seen your power costs go up in those deregulated markets, maybe year-to-date, as you had mentioned, I guess for every 10% increase, it would be a $0.02 impact? And then secondly, the stock's down today. I presume it's mostly associated with the leasing number. Really, when you frame it against the 40 million number that you had initially stated in terms of the guidance for this year. I know you've kind of taken that down a little bit, or softened up a little bit. But I think that there was still an expectation that we'd see stronger demand, whether it was in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, in part based on what you said. And also taking into consideration that I think it's also perceived that Silicon Valley is a strong market. And it shouldn't, and not to be little the ability and how hard it is to get up. I mean, it shouldn't be that hard to get that done, just given what was perceived to be strong demand. Are you being just too picky in terms of the pricing you're looking for? Is there something else there? And I guess to that point, I mean, are you expecting the fourth quarter to be your strongest leasing quarter excluding the $1.7 million deal you just did? Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Colby, I’ll start and address your first question, then toss it over to Steve. In terms of what we've seen so far in 2021, our rate increases in those deregulated markets, it hasn't been all that significant, I'd say depending on the market somewhere around 3% to 6%. What we are seeing going forward in 2022, obviously, it's a lot of anticipation, and that's where we're continuing to watch closely. You're starting to see future somewhere around 5% to 10%, depending on the market. It remains to be seen if that ultimately materializes, but it is something we're watching. And as I said earlier, we really try to hedge roughly 50% of that exposure two to three years out. But that gives you some perspective of what we're seeing to-date. Steve?
Steve Smith: Yeah, as far as the 40 million is concerned, Colby, we are striving to hit that, as I mentioned earlier. And the pipeline is encouraging, there's some good opportunities for us in there. And I think if you look at our core sales year-to-date, they're strong in our core business. And to your point, what is not there as of yet anyway, is really hyperscale. I mean, that is really the difference in where you've seen some of those elevator results in prior years versus where we are this year, which are really binary and whether or not they happen. To get to your question around fourth quarter, probably can't comment necessarily around fourth quarter results, obviously. But we do have a strong pipeline, we're encouraged with where things are headed. And we're striving every day to hit that 40 million.
Colby Synesael: I mean, presumably, if you're still -- you're not talking down to 40 million, which, unless I'm misunderstanding, you're not, I mean, almost by definition, the fourth quarter should be the strongest quarter relative to the previous three, is that – am I misunderstanding?
Steve Smith: Well, I think the math is right that if we were to meet 40 million that would be the strongest quarter. Whether or not we can get there, as I mentioned, there is a lot of larger deals that can and could happen, but they are binary. And whether or not they do happen and whether or not they meet the parameters, as I mentioned earlier, it's not just chasing top-line bookings that we're after. And maybe you could call it being too picky. But, if you look at the returns on invested capital that Paul talked about earlier, and how we're driving the ecosystem, it's really about striking that balance between top-line bookings, and overall profitability, which includes not just rate, which typically can go down on those hyperscale deals, but also interconnection and power margin, which typically is less on a per square foot, and per kilowatt basis as you get bigger opportunities. So, it's a matter of managing pace with volume, and pricing, and all those kinds of things. And so we're trying to do the best we can do to thread that needle.
Colby Synesael: So one real quick follow-up on that, are those deals that you haven't logged yet, have you seen any of them going to competitors? Or, is it more function of they just haven't signed with anyone yet?
Steve Smith: In some cases, both. A lot of the pipeline, frankly, as I mentioned earlier, is just taking longer. It's a complex world out there, as you look around, there's a lot of impacts on a lot of different industries. And, the complexity around those just takes longer. And we'll see where they play out. I mean, it's a competitive landscape as well. So we've lost opportunities, there's no question about it. If we were winning every opportunity, then I would say we're probably being too aggressive on pricing. But we look to balance that every day and try to make sure that we're driving the most value to our shareholders, given the ultimate outcome.
Colby Synesael: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just to follow-up on SV7, it looks like you guys had some retail and small scale demand in the third quarter prior to the large scale lease in October. Do you have a preferred mix going forward? I know there is some back and forth on how you're looking to fill that capacity. And in terms of the large scale lease, are you reserving any additional space so that they can expand if they choose to do so?
Paul Szurek: Yeah, I guess as far as overall, SV7 is concerned, we did see some good leases. I think I mentioned, we had $2.9 million of leasing at SV7. So that continues to be good opportunity for us. And as we repurpose the single tenant space to multi-tenant, we've seen good lease up there as well. So as you look at that, and the diversity that it provides, as far as hedging any large churn events, we like the idea of that, and balancing that with, how fast we lease that up. As I mentioned, just talking with Colby, trying to balance the pricing versus the size of the opportunity versus the pipeline, and making sure that we get maximum utilization out of every floor and every datacenter is what it's all about. So, that's just kind of an overall approach, I guess. As it relates to reserving space for customers, in some cases, there's contractual obligations, but very few that we have out there. And typically, it's first come, first serve. And we're looking to maximize the density in every floor.
Brendan Lynch: Great. And just to follow-up, you clearly have some tech advantages and a lot of cloud onramps. I wonder how the value proposition of those cloud, onramps is evolving with customers’ ability to bring the cloud directly into the cabinet or even on-prem with the likes of an AWS, Outpost or a similar product. Just having that availability right in the cabinet, how does that change the value of the onramp itself?
Steve Smith: Awesome question. And I'd love to get more of those, because we feel like that is a great value for why customers would want to deploy in our data center. You mentioned outpost, Outpost is essentially a private cloud managed service that you can put into a data center that can be connected to AWS or other high speed onramps. And how they interoperate together is where you get the real value out of those types of appliances. But having it in a data center that is removed from those native on ramps makes it less rich than it otherwise would be, and the performance is somewhat diminished. So the perfect design around having an Outpost architecture is to have a customer deployment that is also inclusive of an Outpost or VMC on Dell type of environment that is then interconnected with an AWS Direct Connect, or a Microsoft Express Route or maybe both, where they can operate interactively and very low latency to provide just the most seamless and high performance solution available. It's where you start removing those things and separating them via IP networks and other remote type of interconnection, that you start diminishing that performance. So, in order to get the best possible outcome out of those appliances, you really need to be in a data center like ours.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Rollins: Thanks. First question was, if I think back, you used to provide a chart, and it would share your inventory in each major market, your absorption and extrapolate the years or months of inventory that you had on hand. And I'm just curious if you could provide an update overall, in the portfolio, where you see that relationship? And maybe for some of the major markets, where that relationship is, and where there could be some risks of bottlenecks, or constraints? And then, just separately, I want to go back to a question that you've discussed at a high level before, and that's segmenting retail versus scale performance. And just curious internally, are you just spending more time thinking through what that retail revenue growth rate is versus the scale growth rate? And, the total portfolio grew about 6% year-over-year, what would be the differential in terms of how much better was retail versus slower for scale? Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Michael, let me start off with your question on the inventory. And then I'll hand it off to Steve around the retail versus scale and come back to your last question. So, when you look at the portfolio today, from an aggregate basis, I think we've got 32 megawatts of capacity that is built and ready for moving. We've got another 10 megawatts that's under construction that those two components one in LA, and one in New York. If you look at our overall gross absorption, I'm going to give you some high level numbers. This isn't -- don't take these as black and white every year. But high level, we lease somewhere around 25 megawatts per year on a gross basis. With churn, net absorption is going to be somewhere around 18 to 21, 18 to 22 megawatts per year. That gives you some idea from a portfolio perspective. When you look at the call it 42 megawatts, where is it today and the relevance to that is obviously it's going to be in our top five markets. So you got about 7 to 8 megawatts in both the Bay Area and in Chicago that we have for lease up today. You've got another 4 or 5 megawatts, some of which is in Los Angeles and then the other market of New York and then Virginia. So call it 4 to 5 megawatts there. And then you've got about 3 megawatts in New York. So you look at the top five markets, that gives you an idea of where that capacity is. And that capacity is important, as Paul alluded to, when he was addressing the question around the Bay Area and overall, what is that annual absorption. And as we keep talking about hitting these high 80 percentile occupancy, that's key from our perspective to ensure you've got the available capacity to meet market needs, and ensuring you don't have too much capacity that we've invested capital, and it's just not earning us a good return and won't be for some period of time. So that's the balance we're trying to strike. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color around the inventory.
Steve Smith: I'm sorry, go ahead. Okay, all right. As it relates to retail and scale, I think it's important to look at those as it relates, especially as you move up the size to hyperscale and large scale, because as I mentioned, we typically get better pricing, we get more interconnection per square foot. And, it also gives us more diversity across our base. Collectively, as you look at our performance over time, retail has remained very consistent, and we continue to get more results out of kind of the scale environment. While size is important, and we need to manage that, it's also important to look at the customers that are actually deploying behind that, and looking at really kind of that mid to large enterprise, that it's really kind of rolling out of their legacy data, data centers, refreshing their IT infrastructure, adopting a hybrid multi cloud environment. And those are the customers that we're looking to target and the ones that we're actually winning. So those deployments that can be very large customers that may come in a retail environment, but then grow to a scale or even large scale environment over time, as they complete that migration over time. So, we look at the overall mix, because it does drive profitability in the short-term, but we also look at the growth opportunity long-term, and where that is likely to show up, and that's where we're targeted.
Paul Szurek: And Mike, just to remind you that 70% to 80% of our leasing is this organic growth of these primarily retail and smaller scale customers that continue to grow.
Michael Rollins: If I could just follow-up for one other question, there's a comment that was made, I think it was a couple of times on this call. And there is a connection between the exiting of the single tenant lease in SV7, and visibility into increasing occupancy. Given you knew the inventory was coming up, can you just help frame like, what was important about connecting those two things together, about improving the visibility for future leasing? Or is it just now that they're gone, you're closer to adding tenants walking through? Just kind of curious.
Steve Smith: Yeah, I think well, if nothing else, hopefully provides clarity and visibility for these calls, because I know we've got a lot of discussion around churn and what's churning and is that SV7 churning. So hopefully, that's behind us, which I think is where a lot of those comments came from. We've been working actively to profitably lease up that floor over time. And I think as we sit here today, we're about 20% through that lease up, and a good pipeline that's behind us. So we'll continue to do that.
Paul Szurek: And then let me just, again, I think what you're alluding to is what we said earlier in the call about 5 to 6 megawatts of absorption for us in Santa Clara, Silicon Valley over recent years. The SV7 space is just part of our available leasable capacity, because of the tenant that's now gone, it received a lot of attention. But the 5 to 6 megawatts per year of absorption in ways that strengthen our ecosystem, is probably the right way to look at that market and our capacity in that market.
Michael Rollins: Thanks. Appreciate the help with that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Srour: Hi, this is Michael Srour on for Nick. Thank you for taking my question. There's been some optimism regarding the prospects for higher pricing from hyperscale focused vendors, maybe just talking their bucks. Are you seeing anything to suggest that? And if so, might it open up new scale opportunities in Northern Virginia? And, how would you characterize the gap between market and what you're looking for as relates to scale pricing in that market?
Paul Szurek: I think, there's been firming of pricing over the last couple of years. It hasn't declined like it did three four years ago. Maybe it's come up a little bit but not discernibly. And thank you for this question, because, I guess we haven't really made it clear, there's a quite a big leap between the pricing and the ecosystem value and all these incremental revenues that we get from the deployments that we’re focused on, compared to what is available with the undifferentiated hyperscale in these markets. And it's not just about getting the right returns, it's about building the right ecosystems, and frankly, future proofing your ecosystems and your leasing significantly relative to churn and other events. I mean, in our past history, our unpleasant churn related to undifferentiated hyperscale type activities. So, yeah, maybe it takes a couple quarters, or less sometimes, but sometimes around that time to get to the right levels. But meanwhile, you're making up for it with better margins and incremental revenue, and building a much more valuable campus ecosystem for the long-term. Does that make sense?
Michael Srour: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. One follow-up, unrelated if I may. You increased your tenant improvement and recurring CapEx forecasts. Can you talk about the reasons there?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, Michael, two things on the Tis. A majority of our tenant improvement costs really come from the building out the customer deployments, as we're getting those customers deployed and ready in set up for their gear. So that's just a factor of the volume of infrastructure needed for those customer deployments. Nothing unusual there. To be honest, it's just, some of those take a little bit higher cost up front, depending on complexity and the power needs. As it relates to the recurrent CapEx, really two things going on. As you know, we were building out this chiller plant in Boston earlier this year, some of those dollars ultimately came in the final parts of, it came into Q3. And so some of that's impacting those numbers. And then secondly, we accelerated some recurring CapEx from future periods into the third quarter, as we were looking around trying to take care of a few areas that needed to be addressed. And so that's really what elevated that a little bit this year. As you think about Q4, and more importantly, even 2022, we would expect our recurring CapEx to come back down to those levels that we've seen historically, which over the past 10 to 20-years has been 2% to 4% of revenue. And that's what we expect to see. This year was unusual, just given the investment we made with very good returns on that Boston chiller facility.
Paul Szurek: And the office lease.
Jeff Finnin: And the office build out that we did in the Bay Area.
Michael Srour: Got it. Great. Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Dave Rodgers: Yeah, good morning out there. Thanks for taking the time. Jeff, just a couple of questions for you, I wanted to cover a couple things you said earlier and make sure I didn't miss them. I think you said you had about $235 million of availability. And I think you said something about $40 million of CapEx probably in the fourth quarter and $200 million next year for development and outlays. Is that what you did say, I don't want to put words in your mouth?
Jeff Finnin: No problem. You're right, we've got about $235 million of liquidity. And if you look at the midpoint of the CapEx guidance we gave for this year, it'd be about an incremental $40 million for 2021. And high level, what we gave for 2022 as you think about us, obviously, excluding SV9, a regular year for us building out inside existing core and shell is around $200 million.
Dave Rodgers: So, I guess I just wanted to follow that thought up with the idea that you're going to kind of tap into the remaining availability, as you look out over the next, say, 15-months or so. At your currently thing pace, you're probably adding another $80 million of availability. I guess the question there is with a $300 million development, like SV9 sitting out there, using up most of the remaining availability and getting really thin on what's left, what is your view on how thin on availability you're willing to go, and leverage specifically? And when you look to kind of raise some equity, either through asset sales, joint venture or straight up equity to kind of provide some cushion ahead of SV9?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah. Well, I think, high level from a leverage perspective, Dave, we're comfortable in those low ranges. Those ranges we've been talking about this year where we expect to be somewhere between 5.2 and 5.4 by the end of the year. If you think about us 5.5 times leverage, I think we're comfortable taking it to that level. So that gives you some perspective from a leverage. From a liquidity perspective, I will tell you that anytime we embark on a development, we want to make sure we've got complete liquidity to ensure that that development is built out in its entirety. And so, we're not going to embark on a development until we've got that liquidity to see it fully through. So, as a result of that, we were anticipating needing some additional liquidity before we go vertical on SV9, and that's something we're thinking about and looking at options to ensure we solve for that prior to the time that that'll be needed.
Dave Rodgers: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Szurek for any final comments.
Paul Szurek: Thank you. Excellent questions, as usual. Before we wrap up, I'd like to thank all my CoreSite colleagues. I've mentioned earlier in the call that they've been working very hard the last few years to build a better mousetrap. Our cloud and network and enterprise dense ecosystems are more valuable and sticky and magnetic than ever. And that is the result of tremendous effort all across the company, from operations to technology to network engineering to sales, and to construction to keep up with and provide the capacity to do so. So, I'd like to thank all my colleagues, and thank all of you for your interest. And we look forward to future discussions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to CoreSite Realty's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kate Ruppe, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kate Ruppe: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC.
Paul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover the quarter's highlights, and Steve and Jeff will discuss sales and financial results in more detail. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, including operating revenues of $162 million, resulting in 7.7% year-over-year growth and FFO per share as adjusted of $1.42, which is year-over-year growth of 5.2%, excluding the impact of a onetime benefit of $0.06 per share that Jeff will discuss later. Second quarter sales results included new and expansion leases of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent, which consisted of $7 million of retail colocation and small scale leasing, above the trailing 12 month average and $0.8 million of large-scale leasing. We are pleased with our retail and small-scale leasing so far this year. And as Steve will discuss, we expect more volume in large-scale leases in future months as the funnel of these longer cycle opportunities should bear fruit. Our sales trends confirm the findings in the 2021 state of the Data Center Survey that International Data Group recently published, which shows colocation emerging as a key element for modern IT enterprises, bridging multiple cloud and service providers to provide a robust foundation for driving innovation. The full survey is available on our Web site. Turning to our property development. The LA3 Phase 2 construction project remains on track for Q4 2021 delivery, and we completed a pre-lease for a scale deployment this quarter to an existing customer. We also achieved a lease percentage of 89% at LA3 Phase 1, reflecting the strength of our position in the Los Angeles market and solid sales activity. In addition, we placed a new 4-megawatt computer room at NY2 under development with an estimated Q1 2022 delivery date. We continue to see strong demand in the New York market, particularly in the financial services industry. The new Boston chiller plant project has been completed. We expect the chiller to provide a positive return on investment through improved power efficiency and utilization. As you know from our 2020 sustainability report, energy efficiency is a key focus for CoreSite.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I will start by recapping our second quarter sales results and then discuss some key themes and notable wins. As Paul mentioned, we delivered new and expansion sales of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, which included $3.4 million annualized GAAP rent from retail colocation leases and $4.4 million of GAAP rent from scale leases. Our new and expansion sales were comprised of 33,000 net rentable square feet, reflecting an average annualized GAAP rate of $235 per square foot, as well as 26 new logos that were added to our customer ecosystem with opportunities for future growth. I will highlight a few specific use cases from these new logos in a moment. New and expansion pricing on a kilowatt basis this quarter was above the trailing 12 month average by low to mid-teens, reflecting the unique use cases and mix of both size and location of leases signed this quarter. Contributing to this, our new and expansion sales of retail and small scale leasing was also above the trailing 12 month average. These leasing categories are a primary focus as they often represent performance sensitive applications requiring high interoperability and hybrid cloud architectures. These deployments also typically drive incremental power margin in interconnection revenues, improving profitability while enhancing the ecosystem. To supplement the retail and small scale sales results, our team is working hard to deliver more value add, large scale and hyperscale leasing throughout the second half of 2021, although, actual timing can be affected by the complexities and longer sales cycles of these larger deployments.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our second quarter financial results, balance sheet, leverage and liquidity, and then review our financial outlook and updated 2021 guidance. We achieved another strong quarter of financial results. Operating revenues were $162.1 million, an increase of 7.7% year-over-year. Year-to-date through Q2, the three components of data center revenues, rents, power and interconnection revenues, increased year-over-year at 6%, 10% and 9% respectively. As a reminder, our reported new and expansion sales results only include the rental revenue component of the new leases. Lease renewals equaling $20.4 million of annualized GAAP rent were finalized during the quarter, resulting in cash rent mark-to-market of 4.2% and GAAP mark-to-market of 7.1%. Year-to-date, our cash rent mark-to-market equals 3.4%, exceeding our initial guidance range. We also incurred churn of 1.3% for the quarter within our more normal historical range as we expected. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $8.4 million of annualized GAAP rent, revenue backlog consisting of $8.1 million of annualized GAAP rent or $15.6 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced. The difference between the GAAP and cash backlog is primarily driven by a handful of scale leases with power ramps in the early portion of their lease terms. We expect approximately 70% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the third quarter of 2021 and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence during the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $87.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 7.1% year-over-year. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 8.2%, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.3%, also an improvement over the guidance provided at the beginning of the year. Net income was $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of $0.07 year-over-year and $0.08 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.48. I recommend you look at the FFO per share results on an adjusted basis of $1.42 per share, which removes the impact of a onetime benefit of $3.1 million or $0.06 per share, resulting from the release of a tax liability that we no longer expect to be incurred. FFO per share as adjusted of $1.42 is an increase of $0.07 or 5.2% year-over-year. Year-to-date, FFO per share as adjusted increased 6.8%. Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA decreased to 5 times as of June 30th. We saw organic deleveraging again this quarter as we continue to lease the capacity we developed over the last few years and realize the corresponding adjusted EBITDA growth. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 4.9 times. We ended the quarter with approximately $264.3 million of liquidity and therefore, the capital to fully fund our 2021 business plan. Turning to 2021 guidance. We are increasing our guidance related to net income attributable to common diluted shares to our new range of $1.99 to $2.07 per share. In addition, our guidance related to 2021 FFO per share as adjusted has been increased from our previous range of $5.42 to $5.52 per share to our new guidance range of $5.52 to $5.6 per share. The increase of $0.09 at the midpoint or approximately 1.6% is largely driven by an increase in operating revenues, improved adjusted EBITDA margins and to a lesser extent by lower than anticipated interest expense. We also increased our cash rent mark-to-market guidance to a range of 2% to 4% from our previous range of 0% to 2%.
Operator:  Your first question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.
Sami Badri: One thing that I really want to address is the cash renewal spreads and how you guys see those moving up. And what I really kind of want to understand is what is functionally happening at the customer level that's allowing CoreSite to push these price increases or kind of negotiate these price increases. I'm just trying to understand your structurally what is happening like in the demand environment and kind of like what the customers -- how they're reacting, how you guys are executing this? Just so we can understand the shift.
Jeff Finnin: Sami, let me just give you maybe something to keep in mind, and then I'll let Steve answer a little bit more color on the actual conversations and a little bit more in tune with what you're asking about. But I just think, in general, when you look at the past several years as a public company our mark-to-market -- our rent growth has historically been somewhere between that 2% to 5%. And last year, we were lower than that and we started out the year expecting it to be a little bit lower and obviously, have been able to execute higher than what we anticipated headed into the year. So overall, I think that that 2% to 5% range is something to think about as we continue to execute on those renewals, but Steve can give you a little bit more color and commentary specific to your question.
Steve Smith: Yes, I think the 2% to 5% spread is the right thing to focus on. And there are some variables that come into play in any given quarter. Obviously, our goal is to remain market -- make sure that we're in line with what the market supports out there, what customers value and that's what we strive for. What we also strive for is creating unique value for our customers that they're willing to pay for. So it's striking that balance of where we are with our customer, where their history is coming from as far as where they're coming off of their leases, and it's that overall mix that plays into that spread. But I think it's more important to just stay focused on the spread that Jeff mentioned.
Sami Badri: And maybe just customer level conversations. I mean, we started off the year with a much different cash rent growth profile. And I hear you guys on the typical spread. But I think like what I'm really trying to understand is, has something functionally changed in the industry and the supply demand dynamic that enabled this revision and outlook.
Steve Smith: No, I don't think so. I don't think anything has changed dramatically as far as supply demand or anything like that. I do think that our market and our model, and how we really try to provide more embedded services around interconnection and the stickiness of that helps overall. So as much as we can differentiate our portfolio from others, I think that provides additional value and stickiness and ability to hopefully have that be reflected in the rate. But it's also important for us to maintain that win-win scenario with our customers and make sure that we're being here with the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Frank Louthan: Can you talk to us a little bit about the impacts of inflation, both on how you're looking at current jobs you're bidding for currently and how you've maybe protected yourself on the backlog and so forth, and how you're viewing that over the next 12 or 18 months?
Paul Szurek: I'll talk about construction and then pass it over to Jeff to cover the rest of the question, Frank, and thanks for it. I mean, I think we're, like all the other data center builders and builders in general that we are expecting increases in prices on future projects. SV9 would probably be the first major one where we would deal with that. All of our current projects were already bought out and we don't see any issues there. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be, because some things are, as Chairman Powell says, transitory and others may not be, but I know that our construction team will work hard to manage those cost increases down. And I expect that all of our peers will be facing the same and that may have some impact on market pricing as well. So there's a lot of variables and we'll just try to manage our way through it as best we can.
Jeff Finnin: And Frank, the only other thing I would add is maybe just three real quick items, in addition to the construction side that Paul alluded to. Obviously, we watch closely on the impact to our cost structure, salaries and related costs and it's something we're continuing to watch. And we obviously work with our HR team and advisers as to what we need to do there. Secondly, customers, we got to be aware of what it does from a customer standpoint. Our typical lease three to four years, it does give us that opportunity to renegotiate where those economics are fairly -- in a fairly near-term basis. So I don't see a significant impact from that perspective. And then third, the other area that we're obviously watching and paying attention to is the extent that we do start seeing that inflation on a consistent basis, what does that do to interest rates and then how does that impact our overall timing associated with our capital needs and plans there.
Paul Szurek: The only other thing I'd add is that as it relates to the buildings that we've already built, a lot of the inflation risk is taken out as we just need to build out additional floors and computer rooms.
Operator: Your next question, Nate Crossett with Berenberg.
Nate Crossett: I just wanted to go back to the re-leasing spread question again. I get the 2% to 5% is what you've historically done. But if I'm looking at kind of the expiration schedule over the next few years, it kind of looks like the rates that are expiring are pretty similar to what you've done year to date. So I'm just curious, after this year, what are you kind of thinking for what renewal spreads could look like?
Jeff Finnin: Nate, let me try and address that as best as I can. But I think the best way to think of it is in line with what Steve talked about from an analytical perspective. I think our best data point is how we've been able to execute in the past. The thing that will impact that positively and/or negatively ultimately is the types of customer and leases that we're renewing, i.e. is it more of our retail and scale versus large scale and hyperscale. Those do play some impact. And then the geographical dispersion of where those leases are being renewed, how is the supply and demand look in each of those markets and how hard is it really to lift and shift some of this deployment. So those are other things that enter into and factor into how we're able to execute there. Hard to say where that's going to head here over the next couple of years, but obviously, we'll provide additional details as we get closer to next year.
Nate Crossett: I think in the prepared remarks, there was kind of an allusion to larger deals maybe in the back half. I'm just curious if any of those looking at SV7, what's the update there? And then I think it sounded like there was a move forward of the SV9 after a council meeting. So I'm just wondering what exactly are the next steps for that project?
Steve Smith: Just to give you some color on SV7. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're excited to see where SV8 has come and reaching 98% occupancy. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, I think it's important to take a look at the campus overall as to how we manage space and try to drive efficient use of that, and maximizing shareholder value throughout the campus. So as we have now filled up really all of SV8, we now turn to the remaining larger spaces that are available, including SV7 and look to populate that with customer demand. So the pipeline still is encouraging in the Santa Clara market. And without saying too much, I think we're well positioned. So that's where I just believe SV7 and I guess as far as SV9 is concerned, Paul, I don't know if you wanted to mention anything that's on SV9?
Paul Szurek: So we were very glad to receive the unanimous approval of the Santa Clara City Council. And that's probably the biggest step in the process but there are a couple of other steps. We've got to complete the detailed permitting, finalizing the power station plan. But meanwhile, with this zoning entitlement, we can do a lot of pre-construction work that will shorten the put once we start construction. When that start will occur will depend upon market conditions, so i.e., supply and demand in the market, what our absorption rate and funnel looks like in the Santa Clara market, as well as what kind of pre-construction commitments we can achieve to accelerate that. So I can't really predict when we'll start construction, but we'll have a lot more optionality around that with this zoning approval behind us.
Jeff Finnin: Nate, one more thing I should also address with you, specific to your questions on lease spreads, as I'm thinking more about your question. In this quarter, we did sign and renew a power shale customer inside one of our locations. That did bring that rate down, as you know, power shale rates are lower than our typical turnkey. So just so you're aware, as you think about that $1.49 for this quarter, you exclude that one power shale deal, those rates would be much more in line with what we've done over the last several quarters. So just to give you some additional insight there and thinking about for the next couple of years.
Nate Crossett: And just on the deals for the end of the year. Is part of that funnel for kind of immediate take-up of space or could some of that kind of be funneled toward an eventual SV9?
Steve Smith: Our goal is to maximize the space that we have before we start building new. We obviously don't want to go dark in a market but we've got good runway. And if you look at the historical absorption that we've seen in that market, we typically sold roughly 6 megawatts in a year in Santa Clara and we've got room to run there. So we'll sell the capacity that we have while we work on building SV9.
Operator: The next question, Jon Atkin with RBC.
Jon Atkin: So I was interested in asking you kind of just more broadly about the inventory -- the start of the year, you talked about 40 megawatts to sell still where are we on that and are you confident just selling -- are you confident of kind of selling the 40 million, I guess? And then as you look across the markets where you've got some substantial capacity, whether it's West Coast, Chicago or Virginia, where do you feel kind of most positive about the supply demand dynamics?
Jeff Finnin: Jon, just to answer your first part of your question, we ended the quarter with 37 megawatts of capacity we can sell into the marketplace. That includes the 4 megawatts that will be vacated here at the end of the third quarter/early fourth quarter from SV7. And when you look at the distribution of those 37 megawatts, it is in large part in our top five markets. So think about the Bay Area, where I think we've got about 12 megawatts. LA, Chicago, New York and Virginia each have somewhere between 4 to 6, just depending on the market.
Steve Smith: And ironically, as I look to the overall supply demand and overall customer’s requirements in each of those markets, I would say that is a good position to be in, because we've seen good growth in each of those markets, a good opportunity, I would say. As you look at New York, we've seen good growth in the financial sector there and continue to see good momentum there and have good capacity to build additional growth there. Santa Clara between SV7 and SV9, we've got good capacity there and the market continues to support that. We saw good growth out of LA in additional phases there. So I think across the board, we've got good capacity where we built out and where the customer demand is. And overall, I think the supply and demand dynamics remain in balance. So Virginia also remains, I think, a good opportunity for us. So collectively, I think we're in a better position than we have been in the past where we've really had just kind of spotty capacity in certain markets and now we're able to address that in multiple markets, which is a nice place to be.
Jon Atkin: And then as you talked about the sales pipeline, any way to qualitatively give a little bit more color at historically the upper end of the range or record levels, near record levels, or kind of on par with historical levels as you think about late stage sales pipeline?
Steve Smith: I think the overall size of the pipeline has remained fairly consistent over the last several quarters. I think the quality of the pipeline has actually gotten better. And as you look at our retail and small scale leasing being above the 12 month trail, I think that's a representation of that. And as I already mentioned, I think as we go forward, we look to build on that and then also execute opportunistically around that large-scale and hyperscale opportunity as they present themselves and either contribute value to the ecosystem or value what we bring to them. So we'll play that out as it goes.
Operator: Next question, Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: So I just wanted to follow-up. So Jeff, I think on maybe the fourth quarter call, we talked a little bit about commencements and the potential for you guys to be or see something north of $40 million in this year in commencements. So you're sitting at $14 million or so year-to-date. Is that still on the table?
Jeff Finnin: Jordan, I'm not sure if we mentioned commencements or more specific, I think it was just to our sales targets for the year that Steve just alluded to. So I think that's what…
Jordan Sadler: Sales execution, right. Yes.
Steve Smith: I'll just give you a little comment there, Jordan. I mean, as you look to where we pay so far, I think we're we're pacing towards that. And we expect some lumps as we go through the second half of the year. I think the $40 million is a general target and that can be north of that or slightly less of that depending upon the mix of opportunities and the profitability and the flow through. So as you saw in some of the pricing and the smaller scale and retail sales that have been generated, we'll see how that overall mix plays out. But so far, we're still targeting that $40 million.
Jordan Sadler: And then coming back to the lease spreads in the quarter, obviously, a good number historically when you've seen something unusual you flagged it. But was this plus 4%, plus 7% on the cash and GAAP renewals, was that broad based on the 330 leases or was there a big lease or two that kind of drove the upside?
Paul Szurek: Jordan, it was fairly dispersed across all of our markets, nothing in which we would point out that was unusually high or low in the market or in the quarter. So overall, it was pretty well dispersed throughout all the renewals we did this quarter.
Jordan Sadler: And then lastly, maybe, Jeff, while I have you, the chiller replacement, I'm trying to better understand this. Is this maintenance CapEx or is it revenue or return generating Capex? And maybe you can walk us through the ROIC math on this chiller plant, total cost versus savings?
Jeff Finnin: No, that investment we made is included in our recurring CapEx dollars. So that overall investment is inside there and some of it is in expansion, just to give you some idea. Since the chiller will facilitate cooling in the entire data center, the portion that replaces current cooling infrastructure is going through maintenance capital, anything for new infrastructure is going through our expansion capital. But we've got about, in total, through several quarters here over the last three quarters, about $15 million going through recurring. Overall investment, I think, was somewhere right around $25 million. And returns are expected, Paul could clarify, but it's somewhere in the mid to upper teens overall once it gets up and running.
Paul Szurek: And just to add to what Jeff said. When we did this chiller replacement, we actually replaced some chillers that were quite at end of life, but it just made a whole lot more sense to replace them now, build a chiller with tremendously greater economies of scale and efficiency. And it's the energy savings that primarily drives return but it also enables us to better utilize the power throughout the data center, because of the cooling capacity it provides. And on top of everything else, it tremendously strengthens the resiliency of that facility, especially from a cooling perspective because the new chiller plant is dramatically more effective in that regard than what we had before. So I mean these are small projects. I hate to sound overly excited about them but they make a big difference. I love it when we get one of these done.
Operator: Next question, Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins: A couple of questions, first is, if you were to take the bookings and results from the retail and the small scale and look at the revenue that, that creates from rent, power, interconnection. What is that revenue stream growing at within your overall portfolio revenue versus the large and hyperscale? And just a second one, if I could, just with regards to the topic on pricing. Are there any significant leases that you may have or groups of leases at some point down the road where we just need to be mindful that for whatever the reason, those rents got to be significantly above market?
Jeff Finnin: Michael, the answer to your first question, here's probably the best way to think about it. When you look at the rent component of our sales during the quarter, as Steve alluded to, $7.8 million and focus just on those smaller two components, the retail and small scale, on average, our rent makes up about 55% of our overall revenue associated with those deals. So the other 45% is going to be comprised of power, generally around 25% to 30% and then the rest of it is going to be interconnection. The important thing then to understand is the overall economics that flow down to the bottom line, obviously, as we refer to it as RPX, which is rent, power margin and cross connect revenue. And those are the deals where we get better power margins on them, because most of those deals are not on a metered power model. So they are, overall, as Steve alluded to, better economics for us. In terms of overall growth, I have to get back on a specific number but that gives you some idea how to gauge the math around each of those deals. In terms of your other question around leases longer term on pricing, nothing we would highlight today. The only other thing I would add is, as you think about our business, maybe relative to some of our peers, where there's been some concern on some rent roll downs. Keep in mind, our business being much different. We've only got 12 hyperscale leases in the entire portfolio. And that's the area that I think has received most of that commentary out to the marketplace. And it's just a different business model. Obviously, as you saw, we've increased our rent growth guidance for this year, as Steve and his team continue to execute on those lease renewals coming up through the rest of the year. But just keep that in mind as you think about us relative to what else you might be hearing in the industry.
Operator: Next question, Erik Rasmussen with Stifel.
Erik Rasmussen: It sounds like with SV8 near full capacity, you have a good opportunity to focus on SV7. Can we expect to hear of an update soon regarding sort of backfilling this space? And at this point, are you still expecting to do that with smaller retail leases rather than scale type deals?
Steve Smith: I mean, overall, that is the space, the larger space that we have to sell on the campus at this point. So it can be anywhere from 6 to 9 megawatts, depending upon the mix and the density. But that is the space that we're selling into today. So you can expect to see some leasing in that space and it will be likely multi-tenant. So that's probably the best color I can give you.
Paul Szurek: The only thing I'd add, though, is that we haven't in the past said it would be focused on retail. We've said multi-tenant and we do expect some of that to be scale.
Erik Rasmussen: And then maybe just my follow-up. So it's been addressed, the large-scale has been sort of challenged the last couple of quarters. Any hurdles to winning this business, or is it we now at a point where there's enough momentum and it's more of just a timing issue based on some of the sales funnel commentary that you've talked about?
Steve Smith: It's really more of a timing issue and a fit issue more than anything else. As you look at the trailing two years really around our leasing trend, you pull out the three hyperscale deals that we've done over the past two years and the sales results are actually up, I think, 5% or so. So they are lumpy. Those three deals make the difference in the averages. And we do expect more lumps as we go forward, but the timing of those and how they fit our portfolio, and as I mentioned, bring either more value to our ecosystem or value the ecosystem we've already built that is not -- every hyperscale deal that's out there, so we won't compete on all of them, but the ones that do meet that criteria, we expect to win and they are out there. So we're actively pursuing several of those and we'll see how they play out.
Operator: Next question, Colby Synesael with Cowen.
Colby Synesael: Two questions. One, for Silicon Valley 9, great to see the the local board approval. But one of the things that we've heard of is just there's the power constraints, particularly Silicon Valley power. Is that a real concern for you? Do you think that when you finally get to that point, you will be allocated power or is that potentially a long pole in the tent that could delay the project by a pretty material amount of time, months, if not quarters? And then secondly, you mentioned the word edge a few times. I'm just curious if you could be a little bit more descriptive in terms of what you mean by you're seeing edge deployments and how these might be different than what you've historically seen from these types of customers?
Paul Szurek: I'll let Steve handle the second part of that question. Colby, good question about power. We've obviously been working with the local utility extensively through the process. We won't start the construction, as you implied, until we have secure power for the facility. Our discussions are going well from what we've seen of their path to providing the power. It looks very reasonable and achievable. The I's need to be dotted and the T's crossed. But so far, the time line for that should not lead to a significant delay. But as you know, in that market you can be surprised.
Steve Smith: As far as the edge piece is concerned, Colby, as you've heard from us and I think you're seeing broad base across the market. The hybrid multi-cloud edge use cases continue to grow and become more commonplace with enterprises and with them become more demand for close proximity of cloud adjacent types of services. So we're seeing more build out and more demand around that. They may not be hyperscale type of deployments but they are more resident in the campus where customers can gain close access to them and in many cases, on ramps. You may have seen some of the press releases earlier this quarter around GCI having their native deployments, both in Chicago and the Bay Area. And we also had Express Route from Microsoft be delivered in Chicago as well. So having those two on-ramps being native in our Chicago campus, we feel like really bolsters those edge type of deployments and the overall ecosystem there.
Operator: Next question David Guarino with Green Street.
David Guarino: Going back to the chiller plant project in Boston and I think you did one in LA a couple of years ago. How much of that maintenance CapEx is being driven by CoreSite's desires versus tenants desires? And have you had any conversations with some of your larger customers that are pushing you towards upgrading equipment in order to meet some of their environmental goals?
Paul Szurek: Honestly, we pushed these two projects and they weren't responsive to customer requests. But if you look at our ESG report on our Web site, you'll see that energy efficiency is one of our big focuses. And I think we stack up pretty well compared to the rest of the industry and what we've achieved and how we've improved over the last few years. There is a lot of customer desire for their vendors to continue to work on improved energy efficiency and other elements of the environmental matrix and we continue to move forward on those, as well as wanting to make sure that facilities are resilient and have the right infrastructure and are operated well. And we continue to -- I think our team does a great job in that respect. And meanwhile, we continue to look for where we need to invest to make it easier for them to do that job.
David Guarino: And do you anticipate a trend, I guess, of maybe customers pushing more towards upgrading data centers? Is that something you guys are thinking about over the next few years?
Paul Szurek: Honestly, we're not hearing it significantly from most customers, and it's something that we're already doing and focused on anyway. So I don't know that we would feel the pressure as much as others would.
David Guarino: And then maybe just one last one. Following up on those comments you made, I think you might have been -- Jeff on re-leasing rates holding up better for CoreSite's portfolio relative to some of the hyperscale focused portfolios. Is that a similar trend across the entire retail colocation market or is your portfolio just outperforming? And I guess, how do those customer negotiations work? Do they come to the table with some data points and say, here's what market rents are that we see and this is what we want and you guys push back. It would be great to just kind of hear some color on how those negotiations work.
Jeff Finnin: David, I would just say, obviously, we try to watch what our peers are doing in this space, especially those that are more aligned with some of the retail colocation that we offer at the same time, I do think you're -- it's not going to be complete to apples-to-apples, just given the differences in our assets and some of the network dense and kind of the cloud enabled data centers that we have. So it's not going to be completely apples to apple but something we clearly watch. I really can't tell you, at least for the private ones, how they're doing. But we feel very comfortable and confident in our ability to get paid for the value that has been built in our differentiating platform. But Steve can give you some additional color on those conversations.
Steve Smith: As far as the conversations are concerned, it's really customer-by-customer and what their deployment looks like, what their use case is, how long they've been with us, their historical rent role and how that is relative to market. So all of that comes into play in each customer conversation and they're all different. So we manage those accordingly based off of the market dynamics and the customer situation, and that's probably the best, I guess, color I can give you as to how those conversations go.
Operator: Next question, Richard Choe with JPMorgan.
Richard Choe: The retail business has been pretty steady but the small-scale business has kind of ramped from under $2 million a quarter to well over that. Can you let us know what's going on there in terms of the strength? And then also, is that return profile any different than the retail, small scale versus retail?
Steve Smith: It really depends on the deployment. But overall, we kind of lump those into similar buckets, I would say. And it's good to look at those individually. The use cases can be similar. So most of our leasing, as I mentioned earlier, especially the new leasing was around enterprise sales and that's the primary focus of the team is driving new logos in that are enterprise and that are contributing or valuing the ecosystem. So I don't know if there's any radical trends there other than you're seeing, I think, more enterprises kind of go towards that hybrid multi-cloud environment where they establish their own footprint in our data center and then leverage cloud on-ramps in order to kind of build out that overall cloud architecture. So I don't think there's any massive shift there other than just -- we're executing better against the enterprise. And I think the enterprise is continuing to kind of rationalize that cloud versus on-prem model.
Richard Choe: And it seems like overall strength has been pretty good, if not better than expected. Does that kind of -- I know churn guidance hasn't changed, but it seems like that might put less pressure on churn overall. Any comments there?
Steve Smith: No, I don't think so. Our guidance is our guidance because it's the best estimate that we have. So we'll continue to monitor it. And as I mentioned earlier, our goal is to sell unique value that customers want to come and stay. And once they do build out their architecture, it is a bit more complex than a single network connection that makes it easier to leave. So if we can provide more value that makes them want to stay longer then hopefully, that reduces the churn risk long term, but we'll see how that plays out.
Operator: The next question, Brendan Lynch with Barclays.
Brendan Lynch: It sounded like you had about 26 new logos in the quarter and six with multi metro deployments. If you can just put this in the context of what has been your traditional historical run rate?
Steve Smith: As far as the number of logos at 26, it's a little bit lower than the trail. Typically, we're in the roughly 30-ish range is probably the best way to think of the numbers. But if you look at the dollars that are contributing from those logos, it's actually one of our higher quarters in terms of true dollars. So the size has come up a bit. I think the quality has come up a bit. The actual numbers was a little lower but not outside the trail.
Brendan Lynch: I think some of your peers have suggested that they're starting to see more new logos kind of emerging post pandemic. Is that something you're seeing as well that these customers have kind of been on the sidelines, but they're coming back more aggressively at this point?
Steve Smith: Overall, the pipeline is strong, as I mentioned earlier. It's been strong for the last year and half, I would say, as we entered the pandemic, it really highlighted those enterprises that were challenged with distributed work, how they manage their supply chain, how they sell remotely. So it's been at the forefront for a lot of enterprises. And now that they're kind of coming out of it, we'll see how the latest dynamics play out. But they're really trying to figure out how they rationalize that for their long-term strategy. And all of the trends that we see, the analysts that we talk to, point towards this hybrid multi-cloud environment, which we think we're well positioned for. So yes, we're encouraged with where things are headed.
Operator: Next question, Nick del Deo with MoffetNathanson.
Nick del Deo: I guess, first, there's obviously been a lot of noise regarding new regulations on Chinese tech companies and the kind of general friction between the US and China. I was wondering if you could update us on your exposure to to China based companies, whether they've contributed all to leasing in recent periods? And whether you've observed any shift in tone or commentary regarding their intentions to remain in the US or exit the market?
Paul Szurek: Obviously, there has been some noise and we watch it closely as well. I would just point you to some information we had put into one of our investor presentations in early 2020. I want to say maybe second quarter 2020. Kate's shaking her head. So I think that's it. Whereby we quantified what that exposure is from some of our Chinese or I should say, our customers domiciled in China and that was 7% at that time. It has not materially changed from that point in time. Obviously, something we continue to watch closely.
Nick del Deo: Any qualitative commentary regarding how customer intentions may have changed since then or nothing to update on?
Steve Smith: Nick, I would say that as far as overall demand is concerned, I think that has a bit muted over the last year, I would say, maybe a bit longer. Some of that gets absorbed by other partners that we have that also support that market. So collectively, that helps us in that regard. But I think some of the larger players, the hyperscale providers, that's not really the market that we played in, in many cases anyway. So I think we're a bit removed from direct impact of what that might be anyway.
Nick del Deo: And then, Steve, maybe to follow-up on one comment you made earlier in the call. You noted that the quality of your scale funnel, you thought had improved over time, even though the size was roughly the same. How do you define quality? Is it the quality of the customers? Is it their potential contribution to your ecosystem, is it the likelihood of the deal closing or some other measure?
Steve Smith: I think it's all of that. I think you summed it up well. I mean there's a lot of larger opportunities and frankly, even smaller opportunities that just are not a good fit that are looking for the lowest cost provider out there with a network connection. And we're probably not a great fit for them. For those customers that are looking for high resiliency, high performance, interconnection, to multi-cloud types of architectures and multi markets that they can connect to, were a better fit for us. So that does not hold true for every single opportunity that's out there. But those that do value us, that's what we're really striving for. So I think our messaging is better on how we attract those. Our funnel is, I think, cleaner and better quality. And you're seeing some of that show up, I think. So we'll see how it all plays out but we're encouraged by it so far.
Operator: Next question, Michael Funk with Bank of America.
Michael Funk: First, on interconnection, I think last year, maybe third quarter, you mentioned that you thought maybe some demand got pulled forward into 2020 and we did see a sequential deceleration in the rate of growth there this quarter. Is that part of what you're seeing? And if not, do you expect that growth rate to pick back up exiting 2021?
Jeff Finnin: Michael, I think as we came into 2021 what we anticipated, I should say, what we've seen historically is roughly two thirds of that. Revenue growth was really just coming from pure increase in volumes but the other third increases in rates around renewals, people migrating from a lower priced product to a higher priced product, et cetera. We felt as though that second portion, that one third contribution would be more muted this year as we headed into 2021 just given some of the activity we've seen over the last couple of years. I think it has trended towards that direction, probably not as quickly as we anticipated. And so we're still getting about 85% of our revenue growth coming from pure increase in volumes. The other roughly 15% is coming from those customers who are migrating to higher priced products as they expand their business or price increases on renewals with some of our customers, et cetera. I don't think about going forward  your second part of your question, as you think about going forward. I don't know how that plays out for 2022 yet. We're still evaluating what that looks like based on behavior of the rest of the year and the types of deployments we have. But we'll give some further clarification on it as we get a little bit closer.
Michael Funk: And then on churn, the churn dynamics. Are you seeing different drivers of customer churn today versus a couple of years ago? Meaning either more customers remain in your facility but handing back some space or more customers that are fully vacating. Has there been a shift in the driver of churn or is that pretty consistent with where it has been historically?
Jeff Finnin: The only thing I would add and maybe comment on, and we may have talked about this earlier, is that a couple of years ago we just saw some of that elevated churn resulting from those business models that we felt were a little bit more compromised from the cloud than others. And that is largely left our portfolio at this point. I think we got about 1% out. And what I'm talking about are some of those resellers and managed service providers, many of which we used to have in our portfolio. That's the only thing I would point to in terms of changing. I don't think the behavior themselves have changed. Customers are always looking to either grow or maybe shrink their portfolio based on what's going on with their individual applications. But I think that's been going on for years. I don't think that, that dynamic has changed, unless Steve has anything else to add there.
Steve Smith: No, I don't think so either. And I think we've often been asked, I think, less often now. Is cloud friend or foe? And I think the the answer at this point is yes. But overall, I would say it's friend. And as you look at just the overall adoption of technology across any business that technology ends up in a data center somewhere, even those resellers or cloud providers, they end up in a data center and many times our data center. So the use cases may change, how they deploy them may change but the overall pie continues to grow. And so we think we're well positioned to capture that.
Operator: Thank you. I will turn the call back to Paul Szurek for a few closing comments. Please go ahead.
Paul Szurek: Well, thank you all for your time and your interest in CoreSite. We're really glad for this quarter and we're looking forward to the future. Our business is built on the concept that in our data centers, enterprises doing hybrid and multi-cloud architectures can realize significant performance and agility improvements and overall cost savings by taking advantage of our campus ecosystems, as well as the fact that our network dense data centers provide a tremendous location for servicing the customers in our major edge markets. I'm really grateful for the colleagues that I work with, that we all work with. They do a tremendous job and they're the reason that we're able to continue to perform, and I expect them to enable us to continue to perform well going forward. So thank you very much, and have a great rest of your day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kate Ruppe, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kate Ruppe: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer.
Paul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover the quarter's highlights, and Steve and Jeff will discuss sales and financial results in more detail. We delivered strong first quarter financial results, including operating revenues of $157.6 million resulting in 7% year-over-year growth and FFO per share of $1.40, a year-over-year increase of 8.5%. First quarter sales results included new and expansion leases of $7 million of annualized GAAP rent, which consisted of $6.2 million of retail colocation and small-scale leasing, slightly below the trailing 12-month average and $0.8 million of large-scale leasing. We remain encouraged by our funnel and ongoing customer discussions, coupled with extensive available capacity which makes us more competitive for a wider range of large contiguous deployments. As a result, we expect more large-scale and hyperscale leasing in future quarters, the timing of which is always hard to predict. We will continue to bring together on our campuses, retail and scale customers of various sizes, along with selective hyperscale deployments, in order to both benefit from and to continue to grow the value of our diverse customer ecosystems. Turning to our property development. The LA3 Phase 2 construction project is on track for its estimated Q4 2021 delivery, and we signed a $0.8 million large-scale lease on April 1, not included in the Q1 results, which brings LA3 Phase 1 leasing to 89% just 6 months after being placed into service. We also continue to labor through permitting and power procurement for SV9 and hope to start the site work preceding vertical construction sometime this summer.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I will recap our first quarter sales results and discuss the key drivers. We delivered new and expansion sales of $7 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, which included $3.6 million of annualized GAAP rent from retail colocation leases, $2.6 million of GAAP rent from small-scale leases and $0.8 million of GAAP rent from large-scale leases.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our balance sheet, including leverage and liquidity. As Paul mentioned, we started off the year with strong financial results. Operating revenues of $157.6 million represents 7% growth year-over-year and 1.7% sequentially, including growth in interconnection revenue of 10.3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, driven primarily by growth in volume of fiber cross-connects. Customer lease renewals, equaling $15.9 million of annualized GAAP rent, which represents a cash rent mark-to-market of 2.3% and GAAP mark-to-market of 6.1%. And we reported churn of 0.8% for the quarter, which marks our lowest level of quarterly churn in more than 3 years, in line with our expectations. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $5.9 million of annualized GAAP rent, revenue backlog consisting of $9.6 million of annualized GAAP rent or $19.3 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced, which is inclusive of the large-scale lease at LA3 Phase 1 sign on April 1. We expect approximately 70% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the second quarter of 2021 and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence during the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $86.1 million for the quarter, an increase of 9.4% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.6%. Looking at the trailing 12 months, adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.8%, up 10 basis points from the previous trailing 12-month average. As I've stated previously, the near-term expansion of our margins is dependent on us increasing our overall occupancy to our goal of a high 80s leased percentage and leasing capacity in Phases 2 and 3 of our ground-up developments like LA3, CH2 and VA3, where we generally achieve higher revenue growth flow through, enabling us to scale our operations. Net income was $0.51 per diluted share, an increase of $0.03 year-over-year and $0.05 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.40, an increase of $0.11 or 8.5% year-over-year and $0.06 or 4.5% sequentially. Our Q1 financial results reflect an approximately $0.02 per share onetime benefit, resulting from certain compensation and benefits related accrual true-ups.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, we do apologize. There were some technical difficulties. However, at this time, we will go ahead and continue and conduct our question-and-answer session.  Our first question is with Sami Badri with Crédit Suisse.
Sami Badri: Just to kick things off. I wanted to just talk about your cash renewals. And they were probably a bit higher than your annual rate. And I just wanted -- so I hope you guys could break down strength by market. Where are you guys seeing some strength? Where are some markets slightly weaker on the renewable side?
Steve Smith: Hey Sami, this is Steve. First of all, I apologize to the whole audience for the delay there. Obviously, some technical issues, but we appreciate you hanging in there. As it relates to renewals, we were a little bit positive to the trend this quarter. And I think you can expect that as we go through the year, there'll be some lumps and some peaks and valleys as we go, depending upon, to your point, market, as well as size of the opportunity, how long they've been with us and the strategic importance of each of those opportunities. So I think that just really speaks to more of the variability of it. But as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks, our overall guidance remains unchanged at this point, given that we just do not update guidance typically after our first quarter. As it relates to overall markets, you can see strength, primarily in the Bay Area as well as LA. Virginia as overall stabilized, as we've seen over the last several quarters. And New York is pretty stable as well. So overall, as you look at our pricing trends, you'll see pretty stable results over the trail.
Operator: And our next question is from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jon Atkin: Steve, you had talked indirectly about other opportunities in the pipeline. And I wondered if you could talk a little bit about later stage, larger deals. And kind of the environment that you're seeing in, say, Santa Clara, Los Angeles or elsewhere, where would you look to see the bigger deals of -- given where you have large chunks of space for sale? And then the MRR on Slide 13, the MRR metric jumped up a bit. I wondered what drove that. And does it kind of stay at that level, or continues to grind higher?
Steve Smith: Sure. Well, maybe I could answer the first question regarding the pipeline and what that looks like, and then I'll turn it over to Jeff for the MRR commentary. As far as the pipeline is concerned, in more of the large-scale or hyperscale opportunities, I think it's in the typical areas that you would expect, primarily in the Bay Area and Virginia. But also seeing more scale and larger scale opportunities in the New York area as well. So as Paul mentioned in his earlier remarks, we do have a good opportunity going forward with over 40 megawatts of capacity that we can sell to that are spread out across all of our markets. So in general, I would say that the opportunity is pretty consistently building across each of those markets. Ultimately, we need to convert some of those larger scale and hyperscale opportunities as we go through the remainder of the year. But those will be based off of how they fit within our portfolio, how they value or contribute to our ecosystem, and that remains to be seen. So more to come there, but we're optimistic about where things look for the future.
Jeff Finnin: Hey John, on the second part of the question regarding MRR per cabi, just a quick reminder. Obviously, the first quarter, we're always going to restate our new same-store pool, and so -- at the beginning of every year. So that obviously happened here, just so everybody's aware. In terms of the increase, it was largely driven by growth in our interconnections, consistent with what you're seeing on the overall growth of the company. It was the largest contributor to the growth of that MRR per cabi. As you look forward, I would see that year-over-year growth percentage being at that 2.7%, and trending slightly higher, maybe up to the mid-single digit growth rate. So call it, 2.5% to 5% is what we would expect going through the rest of this year.
Jon Atkin: And then on SV9, there was an item in the press about just some delays. And I think the Planning Commission kicked it over to the City Council, and there's some -- a little bit of a delay around the permitting. And the underlying issue, I guess, relates to some environmental topics and emissions around the generators. Is that something that is new or kind of something that comes up sporadically and are there other markets where you're seeing that as a possible area of discussion going forward?
Steve Smith: Jon, thanks for the question. I mean I think we're seeing the normal vicissitudes around zoning and entitlements in California. We got very fortunate with SV8. It went through a much faster than average pace. I think what we're experiencing with SV9 is more typical. And there have been some changeovers in the people that hold the seats on City Council and Planning Commission, and you see that a lot. But I think in Santa Clara and other markets like perhaps Loudoun County and others, you're seeing growing concern about how much increased data center capacity there is. On the other hand, there's a lot of support for the data center industry, because it's very positive for municipal finances and the economy and the local economy, especially the tech and innovation economy. At the Planning Commission level, the majority of the people that could actually vote, and there were 2 spots that couldn't vote, supported the proposition, and now it goes to City Council, and we're still optimistic that we'll get cleared there. But it is, as I said in my prepared remarks, it has taken longer than what we expected. And hopefully, we'll be through the permitting in the next 2 to 3 months.
Operator: And our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: So just wanted to come back to the hyperscale discussion and sort of final, specifically, as it relates to the backfilling SV7. I feel like that's something we've talked about in the past, I'm not sure if I missed any detail on that. But I feel like we're a little bit past the point of when we would have expected to hear something there. And I'm just curious if there's anything in particular that you'd cite as sort of obstacles in getting something done there? Is it competition, pricing, scale or complexity of the deal? Anything that sort of, would shed some light on what's going on?
Steve Smith: Hey Jordan, this is Steve. I guess the first, to just directly answer your question, no, there is no obstacles to fill that space. And as you look at our results coming out of the first quarter, it was primarily around retail and small-scale opportunities. And as I mentioned on prior calls, one of the benefits of having a campus is our ability to really kind of maximize how customers fit into individual spaces throughout that campus in order to drive the best possible utilization and therefore yield of each of those facilities. So that's really where we've been focused. And as we look to the remainder of the year, we do expect to sell more scale and hopefully some hyperscale that fits the criteria, the space that we have and specifically to that SV7 space. So we're still very optimistic on where that's going to land. And I know that there was some discussion and whispers on the street around some potential hyperscale opportunities within that SV7 space. And those things come and go. And right now, we're looking to continue to pursue those opportunities as they represented themselves, but it may be more beneficial for us to make that multi-tenant than single customer going forward. So we'll just see how the pipeline plays out, but we're still very optimistic about how that plays into our 2021 sales and our 2021 results as far as revenue is concerned.
Jordan Sadler: So you no longer expect that to necessarily be a single-tenant backfill?
Steve Smith: It remains to be seen, but we're exploring all of our options and not just banking on a single opportunity.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then, Steve, maybe for you again, last quarter, we talked about the elongated leasing process and some of the challenges. How would you characterize the trend in your win ratio, on customer proposals?
Steve Smith: Yes. Our win ratio is one thing that we do track very closely and look at the various reasons for it and so forth. And we have been trending better in that regard over time. So we look at it by market, by vertical and so forth and try to analyze what the underlying reasons are. There's always a drive to try to improve at that. But at the same time, winning every deal at the expense of earnings is not the best place to land either. So we try to balance all of those things to make sure that we're doing the right thing by our customers, but also by our shareholders. So overall, I would say our win rate is actually improving, and we're just trying to balance that out with the overall pricing yields that come along with it.
Operator: Our next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company.
Colby Synesael: Just following up on that. I believe the 2021 guidance assumes some level of backfill for SV7 in the back half of this year. And I believe the presumption had been that you would lease that to 1 or 2 bigger customers who kind of get a decent slug of revenue in the door at the same time. I guess, based on where we are in the calendar year, is that becoming in jeopardy, and I guess, to respond to Jordan's question, if you are looking to now maybe do that multi-tenant, is that also going to make it more difficult to achieve what's already been presumed in the guide? And then just quickly, the $0.02 onetime benefit that Jeff referenced, just curious if that had been assumed when you gave your guidance for 2021?
Paul Szurek: Hey Colby, just let me start with the second question first. The $0.02 had not been incorporated into the guidance. More broadly, to your other question around SV7 and its impact on guidance, I just think it's fair to keep in mind, there's always going to be some puts and some takes in all of our results relative to what we expected as we head into the year. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we had a strong start to the year. We're optimistic as we look to the rest of 2021. And I would just say, add some additional commentary specific around guidance more broadly, and that is that our -- over the last years, our -- over the last few years, our cadence has been to provide annual guidance in February with our Q4 call. And then we update that if and as necessary in connection with our Q2 earnings call. Just keep in mind, our expectations relative to the midpoint of our guidance may have changed. But we're just following the practice of many other public companies, whereby we only update when there has been a material change. Just keep that in mind, and I think it's helpful as everyone looks at our results and the guidance for the rest of the year. So I just wanted to make sure I added that additional commentary.
Steve Smith: One, and Colby, just to give you a bit more color around single-tenant revenue contribution for the year versus multi-tenant. Actually, as you look at the single-tenant scenario, as Jeff has mentioned in prior quarters, the likelihood of that impacting the very tail end of the year is really what was planned for. But I would also tell you that whether we go single-tenant or multi-tenant, in the case of multi-tenant, it actually opens us up for shorter-term revenue contribution than longer-term revenue contribution. So we can deploy customers much quicker, if we -- in a multi-tent scenario and therefore, drive more shorter-term revenue and likely at better returns. So we're just evaluating all of those various possibilities, but just to give you a bit more color there.
Colby Synesael: So I mean, just to kind of sum it up then, it sounds like then the way that you guys are describing it is, the first quarter was a solid quarter. You're trending above the midpoint. And while, even if you don't put in a single-tenant into SV7 in the combination of the strength from the first quarter plus potentially bringing on multi-tenant customers earlier would arguably more than offset that potential risk?
Steve Smith: I think you said it well.
Operator: And our next question is from Mike Funk with Bank of America.
Mike Funk: So first on interconnection, if I could. I think last quarter, you said there were a number of puts and takes with volume as well as transition showed relatively solid growth in first quarter, I think of around 10% year-over-year. So did that fall in line with your commentary from last quarter's call? Or were you tracking ahead of growth in first quarter?
Jeff Finnin: Hey Michael, it's Jeff. Yes, specific around interconnection, as you just highlighted, our first quarter growth came in at about 10.3%. When you look at our interconnection revenue growth over the past several years, what has contributed to that growth on a quarterly basis as you've seen roughly 2/3 of it being driven by increases in just pure volume of our interconnection products. And then the other 1/3 really coming from increases in pricing or certain customers migrating to higher priced products. Now when you look at that ratio for the first quarter, that ratio was really driven 80% by volume growth, the other 20% by pricing and customers migrating to higher priced products. So it took a step in the direction we anticipated, and it remains to be seen whether or not it settles in at that ratio or whether the pure volume continues to increase to drive that revenue growth. But that's what we've seen so far year-to-date, but it did step in the direction we anticipated and we'll see how the rest of the year plays out.
Mike Funk: Great. And then a higher-level question, if I could. I know you discussed in the past, the need or not having need for having scale outside of the U.S. and then across more markets. Just love to get your updated thoughts on that, and whether or not you're losing deals due to smaller scale versus some competitors who are not having seen kind of geographic reach, love to hear your thoughts there.
Paul Szurek: Thanks, Mike. I think our thoughts on that are similar to what we've said in the past, with a focus on building the density and scale of the campus ecosystems in our major metro markets. We see plenty of opportunity and plenty of opportunity, more importantly, to sell the value of that ecosystem, which enables us to get ultimately better results. Our better yields are not our target. They're a derivative of creating and selling value in these campus ecosystems in major metros. As I said in the past, there clearly are probably some, I think, in aggregate, smaller opportunities, that, where people were prospects or their service provider just insist on a global footprint. But there are and have been increasing numbers of customers who are deploying globally through cloud and other service providers whom they can access with direct interconnection in our ecosystems. So we continue to feel very strongly about the -- that our strategy has more strengths than the offsets and it continues to perform for us, and we are optimistic about how it's going to perform this year.
Mike Funk: And I guess one more, if I could. It's the opposite direction with that. Your thoughts about recycling assets. You've seen very strong demand for data center assets, CBRE showed a 60% increase in data center revenue this quarter. Is there opportunity for some financial alchemy here, to maybe divest some noncore assets and take advantage of those evaluations?
Paul Szurek: I don't think to any material extent in our portfolio right now. 90-plus percent of our buildings are actively contributing to the value of a campus ecosystem in a major metro area.
Operator: Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Frank Louthan: What is the pace of new logo adds this year versus last year? And where do you think that can end up? And then secondly, where are you as far as the sales force headcount for the year? And how many do you think you'll be able to grow that by, by the end of the year?
Steve Smith: Yes, Frank, this is Steve. As we came out of Q1 there, we closed 32 new logos, and that's pretty much on pace with where we've been in the trail. I think you can expect that to grow slightly over time. And as we look at the overall mix of those logos, we do look to them to be more kind of larger scale opportunities as we go forward, but that remains to be seen. But I think that's probably a fairly rational number. We've been anywhere in the 30 to mid-40s, I guess, over time. And I think that number will remain consistent, although the mix may shift a little bit. As far as headcount is concerned, we've been able to solve for the sales requirements in each of our markets with the current headcount, which is roughly 28 to 30 salespeople that we have out there, with additional support teams that overlay them between sales, engineering, solution architects, channel resources and so forth. And we feel like that's really the right number that we need to meet the business plan as it exists today. We have modified where some of those resources sit and how they report in order to try to get better efficiencies out of those. And we continue to monitor that and make adjustments accordingly.
Operator: And our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins: Just curious, if you go to the new disclosures over the last couple of quarters, on how you segment deployment size, retail colo, small scale, large scale, hyperscale. And if you look at that relative to the annual rental churn rate guidance range of 6.5% to 8.5%, how does each of these buckets perform or are expected to perform on churn as you look out over the next 12 months or over time?
Jeff Finnin: Mike, it's a good question. I think in addition to the buckets you reference, I think the best way to think about it is the -- our lease distribution table that shows up on Page 14 of our supplemental. And when you take a look at that, you can see that while we have an overwhelming majority of the number of leases sitting in our retail bucket, if you will, the revenue contribution from each of those buckets is actually pretty well distributed, 20% on the low end up to about 27% on the high end. And so as you look at the overall contribution from a churn perspective, it is relatively representative in close proximity to what you see here is the overall composition of that distribution.
Michael Rollins: And so the churn rate, therefore, is kind of similar in each of these buckets? Or is one significantly lower and one percentage rate significantly higher just because of the velocity of the business?
Jeff Finnin: Now, you're going to get some variability on a quarter-by-quarter basis just based on the mix of when those customers are leaving. But when you look at it on a more -- on a longer period of time, over a 12-month, 18-month period of time, it's going to be fairly representative of the actual composition and equally distributed among those 4 buckets.
Michael Rollins: And just back to the hyperscale leasing question. How strategic, in the same figure you're referencing, that you have 12 leases with the hyperscale? How strategic are these hyperscale deployments on your campuses to bring in other customers across your different customer verticals? And have you thought about the kind of the cost benefit of becoming more aggressive on pricing to get share of these hyperscale customers?
Paul Szurek: Mike, thanks for the question. I mean, not all hyperscale is the same. Some hyperscale for edge cloud use cases and especially what we're seeing that we expect will support 5G and other edge use cases in the future, just drive a lot more cross-connect activity and attract and utilize other customers more significantly. Some hyperscale has very low ratios of cross-connect. And so I don't think it's as simple as going out and being more aggressive just to get more hyperscale. I think Steve and his team have done a good job of focusing on getting hyperscale where it's in a market where the value of that hyperscale to the customer is very high. And primarily focusing on hyperscale use cases that dramatically improve our ecosystem.
Michael Rollins: And just one other quick one, if I could. On the CapEx side, the development schedule doesn't really have a lot in there in terms of actively -- active data centers being built, but the CapEx guidance is significantly larger than that. Are there anything -- any items or any developments that we should just be mindful of on the CapEx side as you move through the year?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Mike, just keep in mind also, we've got obviously, LA3 Phase 2 that you're referencing is obviously under development. We will be spending CapEx as we roll through the year for that. We also have our deferred expansion dollars that we will incur as we work through the rest of the year. That's really spent throughout each of our markets, small dollars at each of our facilities as we need to add power capabilities or cooling capacity as customers deploy gear, et cetera. So some of that will be embedded into the CapEx guidance as well. I think further, as we work our way through the year and as we have better visibility in terms of where we need more capacity, will bring some additional developments online. And once we have better determination of where exactly that needs to be.
Operator:  Our next question is from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel.
Erik Rasmussen: This more in lines with the hyperscale conversation we've had. But it seems like large-scale has been challenged the past few couple of quarters. And I know you mentioned contiguous space is sort of one of the hurdles there. But are there any other sort of challenges for you to win some of the business from that side of the -- those types of customers?
Steve Smith: Hey Erik, it's Steve. No, there really isn't. I mean, it really does come down to fit and timing and how we align in the various markets. If you look at the results coming out of Q1, the very solid results as we -- as you look at the trailing 12 quarters, it's right in line with 6 of the past 12 quarters. So without some of those larger lumps in hyperscale or large scale, which we do expect to see some of those throughout the remainder of the year. It's just a matter of aligning those workloads, as Paul mentioned earlier, not all scale and hyperscale is created equal and how they both value our ecosystem or bring value to our ecosystem plays a lot into how that fit manifests itself. So we do have a promising pipeline, as I mentioned earlier, and we look to execute against that. And we got to deliver those results as we go through the rest of the year.
Erik Rasmussen: Okay. Great. And then maybe, just as it relates to your retail business, are you seeing any lingering extension of the sales cycle and push out of projects? Or is this narrative sort of switch to things picking up in activity? And if so, how sustainable is this as we sort of progress through the year?
Steve Smith: Yes. I think the complexity remains. IT is not getting less complex. And as you think about hybrid multi-cloud environments, having them interoperate seamlessly is complex. We feel like we bring a unique value to making that easier for customers, both in the services that we have on our campus, the low latency that we provide and make those things happen, that is unique for us compared to other data center providers. But it is a challenging construct for customers to work through. And that does elongate sales cycles. I think that's not unsurprising, and we've seen it over time, but customers are getting better at navigating that. As far as the overall projects and their likelihood of moving forward, I think, especially as the economy continues to rebound, I think, we're bullish about where things sit as far as customers willing to invest in technology and the reliance of that technology to run their business. So I think that bodes well for our position.
Operator: And our next question is from David Guarino with Green Street.
David Guarino: Could you remind us of the time frame it takes you to reach that stabilized yield target of 12% to 16%? And if that's changed at all over the past year?
Jeff Finnin: Hey, David. Keep in mind that, that yield, that 12% to 16% is achieved once we work our way through each -- of all the phases of our development. So at LA3, for instance, you're going -- you're not going to hit those returns until you get through Phase 3 substantially stabilized. Our underwriting, just so you're aware, basically has our leased percentage at 93%, and which we basically utilize for our stabilization computations.
David Guarino: It sounds like it's dependent on demand in the market and how quickly you lease the project. But I guess, is there kind of a frame of reference you could add? Is it 3 years on average? Is it 5 or 10 years on average?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. No, my apologies. I didn't answer that part of your question. I would say, it is very dependent on overall absorption and size of the market. I would say, in general, based on our markets, and the overall absorption there is it's probably a 3 to 6 time frame, 3- to 6-year time frame.
David Guarino: Okay, that's helpful. And then just real one quick one on LA3 Phase 2. It looks like the estimated development cost declined by about 25% from last quarter. So was that just a change in design with the facility or a different strategy at the data center?
Jeff Finnin: David, what happened there is, any time we're putting up some development assets, it's really just an example of how we try to be very disciplined around our capital deployment. So some -- about $9 million of that reduction really relates to deferred capital. So that's capital that we may end up spending, but we won't know exactly how much of it until we finish the data center, customers start to deploy, we can see what type of density each of those customers has as well as power utilization. And so that will be spent, some portion of it down the road as we get better visibility into all of that. It just helps with our overall returns earlier and trying to be very disciplined around deploying that capital.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.
Nick Del Deo: First, in the past, I think you've talked about getting growth kind of sustainably into the high single-digit range. Do you feel like you're still on track to get there over the hoped for time frame? And then second one for Jeff. Rent expense ticked down noticeably, sequentially. Was that just from LA4 going away or other factors at work?
Jeff Finnin: Let me address the rent expansion, and then Paul can add some commentary on the growth rates here. Now the rent expense declined in the first quarter, largely because we had about $1 million CAM charge come through late last year from one of our landlords. And so it's a bit of a, a little bit of a surprise to us given the timing in which that came through. That's really largely the result of that expense drop. I do want to touch on LA4 because I think it's another good topic. LA4, as you know, we're working with our customers there to migrate many of them over to LA2, and we're in the process of doing that, and we'll continue that effort through the rest of this year. However, because of our decision to shutter in that after the end of this year, we are accruing all of our rent expense that we would have incurred over the next 2 years in this year. So just so as you guys are aware, we are being burdened with that to some extent in 2021. That should drop off by the end of this year. And then Paul, anything on the 
Paul Szurek: You know, Nick, we've been saying for, I think, many quarters that we believe the sustainable growth rate is mid- to high single digits annually. And all the building blocks for doing that appear to be in place, and we're generally executing on them. The big, big difference maker is going to be how well we execute on sales quarter in, quarter out, and how well we support that with the right connectivity products, and other service products to enhance the sales opportunities and the stickiness of our customers and the churn related to that. So far, all of that seems to be progressing as we expected. We continue to make improvements and changes across the board, and we feel pretty good about it.
Operator: Our next question is from Richard Choe with JPMorgan.
Richard Choe: Just a follow-up on that. What kind of signings would you need each quarter to reach that mid- to high single-digit growth rate?
Paul Szurek: I mean, I think it really depends on what the value achieved with the level of signings is. But I don't think we would have to meaningfully change from our historical sales rate over the last year or so to -- in order to achieve that. The difference is, are you going to hit mid-single digits or high single digits.
Richard Choe: And I guess along with that, part of it is churn and it was a lot lower this quarter. Is this because something in the economy? Or is it the customer base is of kind of higher value one now, and you're kind of through -- after the last portion of later this year of SV7, is churn going to, kind of naturally trend down for you? Or was this just kind of a good quarter for it?
Jeff Finnin: Hey, Richard. Yes, as you noted, our churn, and as I said in my prepared remarks, was the lowest we've seen in 3 years, that reduction in churn this quarter is right in line with what we had anticipated. And obviously is in line with the guidance for churn that we laid out for the year. So as Paul alluded to, it's a great start to the year. I think it helps provide some additional confirmation of where we expected it to be and to come back down to our historical amounts. But there was nothing specific out of it. Obviously, you're going to have some variability on a quarter-by-quarter basis when you have a large hyperscale churn out as you saw in Q4, and that will elevate it. But that decrease is right in line with our expectations for this year.
Operator: And our next question is from Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho.
Omotayo Okusanya: So quick question specifically on Chicago. There's some data we're tracking, just around kind of absorption trends, vacancy trends and kind of ongoing development trends. I mean just to us, that Chicago has a decent amount of vacancy, fair amount of ongoing development and kind of so, so absorption. So I guess, against that backdrop, again, first of all, I'm not sure if you kind of agree with that. But second of all, against that backdrop, I mean, how do you kind of think about lease-ups for your recent deliveries in that market?
Steve Smith: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll give you some color and then Paul, if you want to fill in any gaps, that would be great. But overall, we're excited to have our CH2 facility online. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, to get our first scale lease in there. So with any facility, it's breaking the ice with that first meaningful sale is exciting. And the pipeline actually looks pretty promising for Chicago at this point. There is a fair amount of capacity and development in the Chicago greater area. I think we do have a unique position there, giving proximity of our CH2 facility to the downtown area, the fact that it's connected to our CH1 facility and all of the robust network and connectivity options that are available there. So while there is a lot of options in Chicago, there's very few that have the value proposition that we feel like we bring to the market. And we're seeing the pipeline increase and are still optimistic about the future of that site.
Paul Szurek: I don't really have anything to add. I think Steve hit the key points on our view of the Chicago market.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. And then are there any market assets where we kind of feel like kind of underperforming relative to your internal expectations and markets that are outperforming?
Paul Szurek: It's good question, Tayo. I think it -- consistent with what we've said in prior quarters. Virginia is a good market, but supply and demand there is more on the supply side and has been for a few years, although pricing there has stabilized. But it's -- we had -- it was one of our top 3 markets, as Steve said. But it's still a very competitive market. The New Jersey market has improved, primarily, I think, because of the financials and moving out of enterprise data centers. And frankly, we're seeing sort of the same thing in Chicago, with more enterprises looking to move out of their data centers, so. And L.A. and Santa Clara continue to be strong markets for us as well.
Operator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And again, I would like to apologize for the technical difficulties. Therefore, I will now turn the call back to Paul Szurek for a few closing comments. Please go ahead.
Paul Szurek: So I think we saw, midway through this call, the importance of 100% uptime. And so I'd like to close the call once again by thanking our really great data center and network personnel who keep our uptime so high and keep our customers getting moved in on-time and able to execute their digital transformation quickly. I appreciate the strong efforts of our sales teams and our sales support team for the solid start to the year and building a base for a good year for sales. I'm encouraged. I continue to be encouraged by the opportunities that we see at CoreSite. We have a lot we need to execute on, but we have a great team to do it with. So that's why I'm optimistic. And I appreciate all of your participation in the call today and your interest in CoreSite. Thanks, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for joining us today. You may now disconnect your lines. Thanks, have a good day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-04 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your Investor Relations host, Kate Ruppe. Please go ahead.
Kate Ruppe: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer.
Paul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover our 2020 highlights and discuss our 2021 priorities. I'll be followed by Steve and Jeff's more in depth discussion of sales and financial matters. Our 2020 highlights include new and expansion sales of $37.6 million of annualized GAAP rent, which marks a record year for retail and small scale leasing. Operating revenues of $606.8 million, representing 6% year-over-year growth. FFO per share of $5.31, representing a year-over-year increase of $0.21 per share or 4.1%. Delivery of 192,000 net rentable square feet or 22 megawatts of total new capacity, including the opening of two new data centers and seven-nines of power and cooling uptime. These achievements enabled us to execute on our 2020 goals of developing more capacity and completing projects on time, translating new and vacant capacity into sales, attracting quality new logos that value our campus ecosystems, thoughtfully expanding our products to assist enterprises with their hybrid and multi cloud needs and maintaining high levels of facility performance and customer service. Overall, I am pleased with the team's ability to successfully execute these priorities amidst the backdrop of the global pandemic. We delivered SV8 Phase 3, NY2 Phase 3 and the first phases of new data centers at CH2 and LA3. As a result, we finished 2020 with 40 megawatts of available capacity to sell compared to 23 megawatts at the end of 2019. Examples of translating new capacity into higher sales included leasing 75% of SV8 Phase 3 and 80% of LA3 Phase 1 and accelerating leasing in Northern Virginia, our best year in terms of annualized GAAP rent in that market since 2015. While sales cycles for enterprises were elongated probably due to the economic and other uncertainties related to the virus, we continue to attract high quality new logos, especially in the financial services industry at NY2. We also expanded our connectivity options during the year, including adding Google Partner Interconnect and Oracle Cloud infrastructure to the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange, increasing bandwidth for AWS hosted connections on the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange in our Chicago campus; adding multimarket peering to our enhanced NE2 exchange; and as recently announced, adding access to Google Cloud using dedicated interconnect in Northern Virginia.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter sales results and then talk further about some of our key 2020 successes and drivers. Turning to our quarterly sales results. We delivered new and expansion sales of $9.7 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter. Please note that as of this earnings report and going forward, we have modified our reporting of new and expansion leases signed by deployment size included on Page 14 of our supplemental information. This revision reports our signed leases per period based on leased kilowatts rather than net rentable square feet. The change more closely aligns with how we manage sales activity internally and it is intended to provide greater visibility. New and expansion sales for the quarter included $4.4 million of annualized GAAP rent from retail leases, $3.7 million of GAAP rent from small scale leases and $1.5 million of GAAP rent from large scale leases. Our new and expansion sales were comprised of 54,000 net rentable square feet, reflecting an average annual GAAP rate of $180 per square foot and included an impressive 45 new logos, all with opportunities for future growth, our highest count since the first quarter of 2018. Looking more closely at new logos, the 45 new logos represents $0.8 million of annualized GAAP rent or approximately 8.5% of our total annualized GAAP rents signed during the quarter and were strongest in the enterprise vertical. Enhancing the ecosystem while diversifying the customer base through attracting and winning new customers remains a key area of focus, and it's great to see 45 new brands become part of that story.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results, discuss our balance sheet, including leverage and liquidity and conclude with our financial outlook and guidance for 2021. Looking at our financial results. For the full year, operating revenues grew to $606.8 million, a 6% year-over-year increase, including interconnection revenue of $84.1 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $324.5 million, an increase of 5.3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.5%, consistent with the trailing 12 month average. FFO per share was $5.31, which represents 4.1% year-over-year growth. And we declared dividends of $4.89 per share, representing an increase of 2.7%.
Operator:  Our first question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Crédit Suisse.
SamiBadri: First question for Paul, maybe for Steve, I want to talk about the elongated sales cycles. And we know we could see and draw the connection between elongated sales cycles and the effects of the pandemic. But are you starting to see changes or any kind of behavioral movements that are happening that can better explain what you think might happen in 2021 as far as how enterprises age, the outsourced data center industry from where we are today?
PaulSzurek: I do think we're starting to see some movement and it's hard to generalize because it's idiosyncratic to so many customers and even some regions like, for example, I think in New York, in New Jersey, we would have had better performance if it were for the uncertainty about the proposed transaction tax and some other industries things were moving along and then suddenly some additional acquisitions were taking place. And so the opportunity had to be resized. But for a lot of the customers, it's just them working through what their economic future looks like. There are growth opportunities. For some, it's accelerated digital transformation. For others that's accelerated the process of outlining and planning for digital transformation, but not quite gotten to the point where they're ready to pull the trigger. I do think with 2021, started off a little bit -- it wasn't exactly like the calendar turned and everything turned rosy and there were some bumps nationally and economically in the first month or so. But there appears to be some strong economic optimism going forward. And I think that, that will have a positive impact on sales cycles. Steve, anything you'd add?
SteveSmith: No, I think you covered it well, Paul. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, we feel like we're well positioned for the overall market trends, and that is really, any enterprise out there has become more interested in how they leverage technology to run their business. And the hybrid multi cloud environment is becoming more and more commonplace for a lot of enterprises. It is complex as to how they navigate that and we're working to try to make that as simple for them as possible, but that's part of what drives that elongated cycle. So it's all the things that Paul mentioned as well as just the overall complexity of how they manage that migration. So overall, I think customers are getting used to whatever the new normal is and working through those complications, but we feel like we're well positioned to support that.
SamiBadri: I want to just shift to Jeff. Jeff, you talked about the backlog and the backlog commencement. I think if I heard you right, 1Q and 2Q 2021 should see the current backlog to commence. Now just to kind of triangulate the commencement schedule with the full year guidance. Does the full year guidance also called for relatively strong productivity in the sales force to bring in deals and do inter-quarter execution and deployment, or the full year guidance says very little on incremental execution and sales with productivity as we go through the year?
JeffFinnin: Sami, yes, just to confirm, you heard correctly in regards to the commencement of the backlog. So again, 60% Q1, about 40% in Q2. And in terms of sales execution, I think is what you were gearing your question around. We would clearly believe that kind of, as Paul alluded to, that we would have good execution throughout the year. The only thing that I would add is we'll see some benefits from an expense perspective. If you just see the percentages we're guiding to, I think we'll see some decreases in our overall sales as a percentage of revenue during the year. I don't know if that's directly addressing your question, Sami or was there something else we could add?
SamiBadri: Just if you think about how much incremental leasing that you guys imagine you need to make that guidance. Are you guys expecting meaningful incremental leasing activity to take place to make that guidance number, or are you relatively well rounded out as existing  backlog?
JeffFinnin: No, it's going to require some meaningful sales execution just as every year requires it. And I think when you look at where we ended the year this past year at just below $40 million, I think realistically, we would expect and anticipate somewhere being north of that $40 million as we think about this year, just to give you some idea. Obviously, I don't want to get into too many specifics because we don't generally guide to that. But that gives you some sense for what we're thinking about as we head into 2021.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
JonathanAtkin: I was interested in the interconnect business, and if you don't mind drilling down a little bit on the drivers or pressures you're seeing in that segment. You've got a lot of different products that you offer. There's bilateral cross connects as well and then you've got the cloud operators and the on ramps and the carriers and the enterprises and then partners as well on the SDN side. And I just wondered, is there anything that kind of jumps out in terms of what's going particularly well, or where the growth rate might be slowing a little bit in that area?
JeffFinnin: Let me give you a little bit of color, Jon, and then I'll ask Steve just to add any incremental color he sees obviously on the front lines. But when you look at 2020 and from a volume perspective, overall volume increases was about 7.7% for 2020. And as you saw on the revenue, overall revenue increases year-over-year was 11%. So those percentages are fairly consistent with generally what drives that revenue increases, which is about two thirds coming from volume increases, about another third of it coming from customers migrating from lower priced to higher-priced products and some price increases as customers roll or just general price increases. So that relationship has stayed fairly consistent in 2020. We saw really good growth in the fiber cross connects last year as well as our Open Cloud Exchange. And I think some of that may have been spawned on by the pandemic that we walked through and lived through in 2020. Obviously, when you look at our guide for this year, we're guiding to growth of about 7%. And so I think it's unclear at this point whether we're going to see that continued level of volume increases for 2021, it's something we're going to watch closely. But at this point, we think it will moderate slightly just given where we've guided the street to at this point in time. Steve, anything else?
SteveSmith: I guess, I'd just add as far as trending and where we're seeing customer adoption and so forth. I mean, we're fortunate in that we were one of the -- in fact, I think, the first public data center provider to offer an OCX type of offering and Open Cloud Exchange, where it's basically an Ethernet backbone that allows customers to virtually connect to many different services on that backbone. We've made significant enhancements to that over the last several years. That's positioned us well for really where we see the trend going in the future, which is really kind of that end to end serviceability over SDN like network. So I think you'll continue to see more adoption of that and more services come available on that same platform, and that's part of what we're driving towards our product development.
JonathanAtkin: And then secondly, on M&A and just noticed that there's a lot of activity kind of at the asset level in this sector, including in markets where you don't really have a presence. And I wonder to what extent -- if you can maybe just remind us of the sorts of things that you look at when you think about maybe entering a new kind of core data center, Internet gateway type market that you're not in because there were recently some opportunities. And I just wondered, are you looking to partner with people as you enter those markets? Is that entirely on balance sheet? Is it just not of interest, relative to maybe deploying capital where you already are? Maybe just kind of refresh us on your thinking there.
PaulSzurek: We look at a lot of things, as we've said in the past, and our guidance is strategic fit, which really means what type of revenue synergies can we generate an above standard growth, if we do make the investment and then return on invested capital. Does it benefit our shareholders in the intermediate and long term, and hopefully, the short-term as well or does it not? We're not averse to partnering if that makes sense and the opportunity is there. But generally, that can be more complicated than it sounds at first glance. Again, we've looked at a lot of things. And when those criteria are met, we'll do something. When they're not, we won't.
JonathanAtkin: And then lastly, is there any kind of an update on the Stender campus in Santa Clara, SV9 seems like that's ready to break ground, and there's been obviously some increased occupancy at SV8. And maybe just kind of give us some color on the demand pipeline that you think the market is seeing and what's happening with kind of overall absorption. There's been, I think, a lot of activity in that market away from you. And I wondered to what extent you might think Santa Clara might drive some of your growth this year?
PaulSzurek: So I'll let Steve address supply and demand in that market. Although I will tell you, I feel good about it. SV9, as we said last quarter, we are targeting having our permits and everything by the end of the first quarter. So far, the processes are trending that way. But in that market, and Jon, you probably know the dynamics of permitting and power there as well as anybody. You can't really say it's done until it's done. So we still have a couple more things we've got to finish up. And hopefully, we'll get those finished up and have it shovel ready by the end of this quarter.
SteveSmith: And I would just add, as far as the overall supply demand dynamics are concerned, we continue to see strong demand in the market. And so we're bullish on where we're heading with those investments, where we sit with our overall capacity and pipeline in that space. So overall, we're confident with where we sit today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg.
NateCrossett: More of a big picture question. How are you guys thinking about the edge, is it a risk to your business at all? And have you guys done any analysis in terms of whether workloads that are currently in your campuses could move closer to the edge over time?
PaulSzurek: We have. I don't think anyone can say right now that with certainty, they know exactly what's going to evolve. But our expectation is that there's minimal exposure for us of workloads that are currently in our data centers going to the edge exclusively. And there's probably a good opportunity for our data centers as core peering places in the central markets to benefit it through the increased products and services that are offered at the further edge through 5G, IoT, things like that, just because of -- the beautiful thing about data is that it works when there's a lot of it pooled together, and you'll see a lot of that necessary for those applications. So that's our high-level view of it. We continue to monitor it closely and evaluate potential product help in those areas and partners to work with. But at a high level, we think it will be ultimately beneficial.
SteveSmith: And I guess the last thing I would just add there is the edge can be defined by a lot of different people in a lot of different ways. And we feel like we're well positioned in a lot of edge markets. I mean, if you look at the key metro areas that we're in, where there's a lot of eyeballs, a lot of enterprises that are in very low latency proximity to our data center campuses. In many definitions, that is edge because we're right next to where those eyeballs and enterprises locate.
Nate Crossett: And then I just had one question on pricing. The renewal guidance is 0% to 2% and if you're looking forward, kind of the next four years, it looks like the lease expirations are at a higher rate than what you did in 2020. So I'm just kind of wondering, should we expect kind of pressure on pricing going forward? Can that 0% to 2% range, even go negative?
JeffFinnin: Nate, I'll just offer a little bit there. Obviously, the pricing in full you're looking at is on a per square foot basis. And on the renewal pricing, when you look at what we did this year, the dollars per square foot were compressed largely due to the density inside those deployments. So the density really plays into the fact and when we're obviously competing and having those conversations with customers, pricing is going to be on a kilowatt basis. And so I wouldn't read too much into that on a per square foot basis. There's just a lot of variables, density being the largest in terms of what's going to ultimately resolve in that pricing. But obviously, as we head into 2021, you saw where we ended 2020 right about in the middle of our guidance for our mark to market at 0.8%, and we expect to be somewhere in between that 0% and 2% as we work our way through this year. And then obviously, we'll continue to watch it beyond that and give you additional color as needed.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
JordanSadler: So I wanted to just follow-up on sort of the pipeline and Santa Clara. It felt previously like you guys were pretty constructive and optimistic about the ability to backfill the outbound tenant there. What are your sort of most current thoughts there?
PaulSzurek: Jordan, current thoughts haven't changed. We're still optimistic about backfilling that space in SV7.
JordanSadler: Is that kind of to do list for the front half of '21 or could that take longer?
PaulSzurek: I mean, we typically don't give previews of when like something might be signed. But when it is signed, we'll announce it.
JordanSadler: And then in terms of the churn, Jeff, you did talk about maybe pull forward from 1Q. Can you maybe talk about what the source, the types of tenants that you would drop the reacceleration of churn up to? And did they have anything to do with the decisions around what you're doing with the US colo space in LA1, LA4?
JeffFinnin: As it relates to the churn in the fourth quarter, we had about 60 to 70 basis points incremental churn in the fourth quarter that really moved essentially from January of '21 when we anticipated up to December here in the fourth quarter of this last year. So not a real big economic impact. It really is just a shift in the timing. Again, that was about 60 to 70 basis points. And it was really with three customers, one of them happened to be in probably the largest percentage. It was just another reseller that was in our portfolio that we had anticipated to move out and did it roughly 30 days prior to when we anticipated. And so hopefully, that gives you some additional color. And then what was the second half of the question, Jordan?
PaulSzurek: Whether LA4…
Jeff Finnin: No, it's as it relates to LA4, I appreciate you picking up on that in some of the disclosures there. Obviously, that LA4 is a location that's in close proximity to LA1 and LA2 and LA3. And obviously, our objective is to drive business into our owned assets and there's just much better longer term, better assets to drive business to. And we're currently in process migrating over all those businesses that we can from LA4 into LA2. And so we've already done some of that. And our team in LA is working on getting the lion's share of that completed here this year. But that churn that I commented earlier had nothing to do with LA4. At this point, that's still in process and we'll work through that in 2021.
JordanSadler: And then as you look through to the 2021 guide on churn, I noticed that came down 50 basis points or so at the midpoint, 100 at the low end, I assume due to this pull forward. Is there anything else to potentially be worried about, and what are you guys doing to sort of get your arms around this guide?
JeffFinnin: Well, as you think about it, obviously, as we've pointed out, we've got about 200 of that coming from the single customer at SV7, that will occur in the second half of this year. And in terms of what are we doing to get our arms around it, I can tell you that between my team and Steve's team, it's something that we address on a weekly basis, trying to continue to look as far forward as we can, both through conversations and relationships we're having as well as looking at incremental data around each of those deployments to better understand ultimately what that information is telling us on customer behavior to help give us a point on which direction those are ultimately going to go. And from a customer service perspective, it's always been a very high part of our business, and I would say we're continuing to even elevate it to a higher level under the guide of our operations team, and it's something we're continuing to get out in front of. We want to make sure we retain those customers every time we can and when it makes sense. And hopefully, avoid any of the surprises like we had in the past. But based on where we sit today and what we know today, we think that 6.5% to 8.5% for 2021 is a good number and is in right in line with what we anticipated.
PaulSzurek: Jordan, the only thing I'd add to what Jeff said is that the categories of customers that drove churn over the last couple of years are now a very, very small percentage of our portfolio, and those are business models that have been especially disrupted by cloud.
JordanSadler: Yes, I mean the reason I ask, obviously, this has been a little bit of a sort of a thorn on your side. I think the churn number over the past couple of years, and you've got 29% of your annual rent expiring in '21, and 1,277 different leases a lot. And so I kind of -- I guess it doesn't seem outside of the one known move out, the larger move out, you have a ton of wiggle room in the 7.5%, because that's the nonmove out, you're basically looking at, I don't know, 1.25% churn on a normalized basis. So outside of the nonmove out, that seems like a low number relative to at least the last four quarters. And I don't know why it would be particularly low next year or this year?
PaulSzurek: I mean, we've had numbers that low or even lower in prior years. And again, it relates to the cyclicality of some of these business models or actually, I should say, the secular changes that affect some of these business models. Again, that's our guidance. We wouldn't put it out there if we didn't feel that it was the right range to put out there.
SteveSmith: And the other thing, I guess, I would just add is roughly 30% of our base renewing in the year is not a normal. It's very typical for us actually. And if you look at the average length of our leases of roughly three to four years, that's what you can expect, I think.
JordanSadler: No, and I appreciate that. I didn't mean to insinuate that it was sort of outside of the ordinary. I just feel like it's a big number and maybe the churn number of 5.5 outside of the nonmove out was a little bit low relative to history. Is that unfair?
PaulSzurek: Well, I mean, it depends on which history. And as I said, we certainly have numbers that low in previous years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.
DaveRodgers: I think Jordan hit the renewal side of the equation. Maybe I wanted to go back to the idea of sales cycle elongated. But Jeff, in your comments, you also said you expect leasing to accelerate. So maybe I'd ask you, Steve, to talk more about what's in the funnel. Last year, you guys were pretty positive about the funnel as well. Can you talk about lease touring activity, any of those kind of early indicators that are going to give us that confidence that we'll see this acceleration in leasing this year that's behind the themes that you have already mentioned?
SteveSmith: Well, I think it starts with kind of the fundamentals of our platform really, as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks around available capacity. And it's not just the amount of capacity, it's the fact that we have it consistently across really all of our top markets. So historically, we've had some capacity, but it's really been in a couple of markets and to make sure that we're really accelerating were in that specific market. So now we have more opportunity, I think, across the portfolio to have better sales. And then as I look at the pipeline, the pipeline has been consistently strong, heading into the pandemic, but holding that strength and continuing even through the end of the year. So it's hard to foretell exactly what that pipeline will result in. Jeff has mentioned our guidance already. So I think I'll let that speak for itself. But we feel like between the volume of the pipeline, customers getting more, I think familiar, as I mentioned earlier with how they make these business decisions and navigate the complexities of hybrid multi cloud that the combination of all those things bodes well for the overall sales forecast for the year.
DaveRodgers: Is there any evidence in there that you're losing more customers or winning more of those deals that you're pursuing? It sounds like the funnel is bigger, which is great. But some of those win versus loss metrics that you might track?
SteveSmith: We track the win loss ratios very closely and try to manage beneath the numbers to find out where we can improve on that. There's a balance between, in some cases, winning too many versus obviously losing too many. If you're winning too many then maybe you're giving away pricing or doing something wrong. But we try to make sure we are targeting, first of all, the right customers to value our platform and then ensure that we are getting the most return for our shareholders at the same time, providing valuable service to our customers. So it's that balance of all three of those things that we're working towards. And overall, I would say that the sales team has gotten better and better over time as they've now got better in their skill set, but we've continued to try to, as I call it, deepen the moat on our competitiveness and what makes us unique compared to our peers out there. So I think that all adds up into us being more competitive and being able to win the right opportunities that truly do value our ecosystem. I don't know if that answers your question, but I guess the short answer is yes.
DaveRodgers: Jeff, maybe on you. I think 12 of your leases make up is 26% of the revenues and 15% of square feet, that's kind of what you call that hyperscale. As we look out, either this year as part of the larger expirations or into the next year or two, do we see any of those at risk or any of those expiring?
JeffFinnin: Yes. Obviously, it's a big percentage from a square foot perspective as you look at the number of leases there being the 12, as you pointed out. And as I sit here today, I don't think there's a significant risk given where they are on each of those. And it's just something we're going to have to watch closely as we work our way through the year. Obviously, one of those is included in our churn guidance for this year. So take that one out of the equation, the remaining 11 are the ones that I would refer to. And obviously, something that we'll continue to watch closely. I think we've always had a history of any time we see something on the horizon that is sizable like one of those, we'll try and give you guys some heads up on that if and when that becomes clearer. But at this point in time, we don't see anything that we need to raise at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.
ColbySynesael: As it relates to SV7, do you feel that you can backfill that with just one or two customers, or is your current expectation to use that space more for retail deployments? And then as part of that, what have you actually assumed in your guidance as it relates to the potential backfill opportunity with SV7? In other words, does guidance assume zero revenue from that through the course of the year? Have you assumed that maybe by the midpoint of the year, you backfilled it? Just any color so we can get a sense of what the baseline assumption is in the guidance would be helpful. And then my second question has to do with margins. Margins are expected to be down about 80 basis points year-over-year 2021 versus 2020. Can you just give us a little bit of color of what's the primary driver of that and whether or not that might start to reverse as we move to the back half of this year and then into next year? Thank you.
PaulSzurek: Our current plan is to backfill SV7 with one or two customers, and Jeff can confirm. But I believe there is some revenue from that in the guidance, but I know we don't give specifics about individual leases, and Jeff can confirm this as well. But margins are simply -- the good news is we got 40 megawatts of capacity that we can lease. But that has a margin impact, because with baking capacity, you're still paying all the expenses but without offsetting revenue. So there is definitely an opportunity to expand margins as we lease up that 40 megawatts.
JeffFinnin: Colby, just to confirm, Paul has confirmed, we do have some level of revenue associated with SV7 in our guidance. And I would point you to it, it's probably in the back half of this year versus the first half. And then in terms of those margins, we do have some drag, especially here in the first half as we go through the lease-up of, for instance, CH2 where we're obviously incurring those expenses and not only operating expenses, but the additional property tax insurance expenses associated with bringing those on. And until we get those two, call it, roughly 35% lease is probably about the breakeven point for us. There's going to be some drag as we work through the bottom level of that J curve. And so we would expect those to improve over time as that asset and others lease up.
PaulSzurek: It gives us an opportunity to accelerate our growth rate in the back half of the year if we're successful with our sales.
ColbySynesael: Would the margins also then subsequently go up in the back half of the year?
PaulSzurek: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citigroup.
MichaelRollins: So just to follow-on that. Are those extra carrying expenses partly in the G&A line? Because I noticed in the guidance that the growth, I believe, of G&A was like 11%, I think at the midpoint. And just separately, different topic on the balance sheet, was curious if you could just provide a little bit more color of what the guidance infers for net debt leverage over the course of the year? Are you still trying to get below 5 times leverage net debt to EBITDA over time and over what time frame do you see that happening? Thanks.
JeffFinnin: Mike, in terms of the carry cost that are impacting those margins, most of those carry costs are going to be up in our operating expenses line item, that's where our data center teams get aggregated in terms of the expense recognition. In terms of the G&A growth of 11%, basically, most of that is being driven by some noncash compensation increases. And then some of that's being driven by expected increases in our travel and entertainment, as we expect to get back to, I guess, some normal sense of the level of whatever that looks like in 2021. And just to give you some sense, we anticipate the first quarter to continue to be at some very low levels of travel. But as we work our way through the year, anticipating some of that to start coming back and being introduced into the business, and we'll just see how things perform is and whether or not things open up to that extent. But that gives you some idea of what's driving the G&A. In terms of leverage, we finished the year at 5.2 times. And if you think about 2021, based on our anticipated capital needs and the timing of that capital deployment, I would imagine we would oscillate somewhere between 5.2 and 5.4 times during 2021, as we work our way through the year. And so obviously, a topic we always talk with our Board about and us here at the management team as well as our Board, we're comfortable continuing to let that reside in those levels here in the near term. So that's kind of what we expect for 2021.
MichaelRollins: If you wrap these kind of two questions together on the margin front with the balance sheet front, and you're looking at the FFO per share growth rate that's been below revenue for the last couple of years. When does that reverse in total? When you take into account what you're trying to do with the balance sheet with the operating business? When can FFO per share show the underlying operating and financial leverage that's typically built into the data center business model?
PaulSzurek: I may be wrong about this, and Jeff can correct me. But I think because of the capital intensity of the data center business and you either have to issue shares or stock, that once you get to a certain level of maturity and occupancy, you're always going to see lower FFO per share growth, then you see an FFO growth, then you see revenue growth, because you've got to cover the cost of financing the capital expansion. We've certainly seen that as we've looked across the industry generally. But I do think, I mean, getting back to your point, Mike, it's a good one. And I'd circle back to the 40 megawatts versus 23 megawatts. We've just got more occupancy that we have the opportunity to fulfill. As we do that will have a positive impact on our margins and our growth rate and our flow through to FFO.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.
NickDelDeo: First, just a follow-up on that leverage question. It sounds like you expect the leverage ratio to kind of remain in the same zone as it is today over the course of 2021. Now as we look out a little further and kind of bake in the potential cost of SV9, is there any potential for equity issuances or do you feel comfortable that, that would not be required?
JeffFinnin: Nick, obviously, in 2021, it's not currently in our business plan just based upon capital needs and where our leverage is. Obviously, beyond that, it remains to be seen. But as Paul alluded to, we sit at 81.9% occupancy here at year end. And as we work to drive that north, call it, to somewhere in the mid to upper 80%, that EBITDA growth can drive not only a lot of value inside this organization but obviously, will help us with that leverage. And then as we continue to look out in terms of when we're going to need capital, whether it's for SV9 or some incremental computer rooms. But near term, most of our capital is going to be directed towards those second and third phases of some of the new builds we've just completed and the EBITDA growth relative to capital deployed in those scenarios are much, much higher EBITDA growth, resulting just because of the low levels of capital needed to bring that capacity to the market, since we've spent roughly 50% of it already. So I think that's where we are in the cycle. And we'll continue to disclose what we can as we get closer to the need for bringing on more capacity. So that's kind of how we're viewing things near term.
NickDelDeo: And then maybe one more on Northern Virginia. I think you guys mentioned that leasing in that market was the best since -- I believe you said 2015. Can you comment on how you feel about the sustainability of that performance and how the return attributes of the deals you've been signing there have been trending since that's something you've noted has presented some challenges in the past?
SteveSmith: Nick, yes, we're pleased with how 2020 ended up in Virginia. We had some strong leasing there. And if you look at the leasing, none of it is hyperscale. It's all retail and scale leasing, which is really the core of our business and where we've been focused over time. So really to execute well against that core piece of the business is great to see, given that that market is very much measured and oftentimes by hyperscale leasing. So we still have the ability to take down some of those larger leases if they fit the profile that we've discussed earlier, as far as those that add to the ecosystem and value the ecosystem. But overall, it seems like that market is stabilizing and we feel like we're in a good position to continue to execute on that retail scale, but also well positioned for the right types of larger leases that may come along.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.
TimLong: Two, if I could. First one is a quick one. Just talk a little bit about the maintenance CapEx. It looks like it's spiking next year. Is that just some catch up or is there something else going on there? And then second, I just want to touch again on the connectivity focus. You mentioned a lot of initiatives that you guys have gone through. Could you just let us know kind of what other type of areas are there opportunities for CoreSite to expand those offerings? And in the areas where you have invested in better connectivity, what has that meant for you as far as churns, or churn, or win rates, or pricing, or anything -- any color you can give us on the benefits of that, that would be great. Thank you.
JeffFinnin: Tim, let me just address the question on the maintenance CapEx, first of all. Yes, we are anticipating elevated maintenance CapEx for 2021. And what's really driving that inside the data center business is we're replacing a chiller facility in Boston that has hit the end of life. And so we're replacing and then enhancing that to handle the entire facility there, which should drive us some very good savings as we bring that on. And that will all occur here in the first half of 2021. Secondly, I just want to point out, there is some additional recurring CapEx that we've anticipated in our office business. Not something we talk about often here at CoreSite, but we have signed an office lease at SV1 in Downtown San Jose, which we are going to spend some dollars to bring that space up to what's needed before that tenant commences its lease here in the first half of 2021 as well. Steve?
SteveSmith: As far as the connectivity solutions are concerned, Paul mentioned a little bit about this in his opening remarks as to some of the, I think, milestones that we've made during 2020 in attracting additional cloud providers, some of the enhancements to our peering exchange, higher speeds that we're able to accommodate customers, for example, on AWS Direct Connect in Chicago. Those are just some examples of what we've done already but I mean, as you mentioned, your question around win rates or churn and those kind of things. Last year, we announced that we implemented our Inter-Site Connectivity, which really connects all of our markets together. And we've seen some strong uptake from that, in some cases where we won opportunities because we had that service. So we continue to look at those types of services and how we can continue to enhance the OCX, for example, to provide more end to end provisioning of customers and the trade-offs of demand versus the cost to enhance some of those features. Those type of things, I think, are continuing to be top of mind for us and our customers. We announced earlier this year that we rolled out our DCI visibility to give customers visibility on as to what's going on in their environment over the portal, and that's been very well received. So it's all of those kind of things. It's really kind of easing the path for customers to become customers and making that interoperability a lot more seamless for them.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets.
AriKlein: And maybe just going back to the churn and , it seems like if we adjust for some of the moving parts this year, it will be somewhere in the range of 5% to 7%. Is that kind of the right way to think about it moving forward beyond this year as far as churn?
JeffFinnin: Ari, I think as you look at several of the years, since we basically come public in 2010, I mean, you saw churn ranging from, I think, one year, we were down at 5.5% and then, obviously, this year would have been high at 11.6%. But when you look at and take away some of the highs and lows, on average, we were somewhere right around 7.5% to 8% on a regular basis. And so that's the way I'd probably think of it, somewhere around 1% to 2% per quarter is really what we would classify as fairly typical for us. As you think about 2021, to give you some sense for where we see that, I would anticipate our churn being somewhere between 1% and 1.5% in each of the first and second quarters, and then it would be a little bit elevated in the back half, probably 2% to 2.5% in the back half of the year, as we have the one customer moving out and some in September and some in October. Just to give you some sense for how we think the year will shape up for 2021.
AriKlein: And then maybe just on the capacity front, you seem to be in a much better position today than you were maybe last year. But how are you thinking about the need, or how much capacity kind of do you want to have on hand moving forward? A lot of it will obviously be dictated by the leasing that's done, but is there a right amount of capacity that you consistently want to have on hand and available?
PaulSzurek: It's a good question, Ari. I think it's more looked at by market but I would say we're a little bit over what we would ideally want right now. And primarily, that's because we haven't been as successful out of the gate with CH2 as we would have liked to. We've gone into the reasons for that in the past. But we're still very happy with that asset and we think it's going to perform well, and it has a good enterprise pipeline. But so far it's been a little bit slower than we expected. Ideally, we'd lease up at a faster pace this year. And I think somewhere in the 25 to 30 megawatts of capacity plus the ability to expand in existing data centers with new computer rooms and ready to develop land so that we have the optionality to expand capacity, that's probably the right way to think about the business model for our current size.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JP Morgan.
RichardChoe: A lot of the business last year came from existing customers. For guidance this year, are you still expecting most of the business to come from existing, or is that mix going to change a little bit and how should we think about it going through the year?
SteveSmith: As we mentioned on the call, I think we had 89% come from existing customers in the last Q. And that's not unnatural for us, I mean, which is really part of the reason why there's such a focus for me and my team on driving new logos, because as we win those new logos and they come in, the likelihood of them landing and expanding becomes much greater. So not relying on just the base to continue to expand over and over and over again. So the ratios are probably fairly consistent, although, we look to try to overweight more in that new logo category. But as you look over time, I think anywhere from 70% to 90% in expansion is not uncommon.
RichardChoe: And then in terms of the small scale and retail, is there any difference on how quickly those signings turn to revenue, or are they both about the same time frame?
SteveSmith: I would say they're both pretty similar, as you get to the higher end of the scale, those can be a bit more complex in private cages that take a little bit more time to deploy. But they're all relatively in the same time period.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
FrankLouthan: I wanted to circle back again on the sales cycle a little bit. Can you give us a little more insight here. Is it a function of customers and how they're reacting broadly, or do you think it's something more specific to how you're trying to sell them? Are you trying to engage with larger initial deals, or workloads, or applications that are generally taking longer than the traditional mix that you've had with enterprise customers? Or is it just something about the market in general, are you seeing the sales cycles lengthen?
SteveSmith: I'll just start, I guess, with the simple answer of yes. It's all of that. I will tell you that we are trying to get into sales cycles earlier, which is part of the reason they become protractive because we're in earlier. So therefore, we're in them longer. But they're also more complex, as I mentioned earlier. So as we look to really try to communicate our overall value and messaging to the marketplace around not just the nuts and bolts of the data center but the value that they can extract from the data center and the ecosystem that is embedded within it, that will hopefully allow us to position ourselves better with those enterprises earlier that may actually elongate those sales cycles as we've seen but hopefully, better position us for more opportunities and give us a better position at the table as they make those decisions.
FrankLouthan: I mean had you identified where maybe you were missing out on this in the past, and at what point does this sort of normalize and result in maybe higher growth going forward?
SteveSmith: Well, I think it continues to normalize. I mean, it's hard to know what normal is in today's environment. But I think the process, as I mentioned earlier, has become more normalized. It's still a long process. And frankly, we still have more work to do with our sales team to get better and better at this and get better at our messaging. And as I mentioned earlier, try to deepen our moat on our value. So I don't think it's a static thing that we ever say mission accomplished. It's always trying to get better at trying to get in more deals and work them more efficiently. So it's hard to say that you can expect the status quo going forward because I don't think there ever will be in the high tech sector.
PaulSzurek: I would only add that some of our most valuable customers that Steve and his team have brought in and added, which have these some of the longer sales cycles are the ones who are going to come in, and they're going to use multiple clouds, multiple networks, probably some of the cloud adjacent storage and other cloud adjacent utilities and they're moving typically out of a traditional kind of on premises environment. So there's just a lot more moving parts for them and a lot more work with solution partners and our solution architects to make sure we get their initial deployment and setup right, so that they can have the ability to expand and add new features as they grow into their hybrid multi cloud architecture.
FrankLouthan: And have you seen any incremental activity or interest from any of the Chinese hyperscalers since November?
SteveSmith: Nothing that's abnormal, I would say, pretty consistent.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Guarino with Green Street.
DavidGuarino: I noticed CoreSite stopped providing property level disclosure, and they now show market level disclosure in the supplemental. Can you just talk about why the company thinks providing investors with less disclosures is fine in the portfolio? Is it the best way to communicate the story?
JeffFinnin: Every year we go through a process of looking at the information we disclose and how it's being received and how it's being utilized. And we're always looking for ways to enhance the message by giving good and many times more transparency in certain situations like this one. We felt summarizing the information just felt and gave, and tried to simplify the message. We did the same thing in our debt disclosure table. But the debt, you can go to our 10-K and get all the nitty gritty details that you need. And as Steve pointed out, adding some additional disclosures around how we're managing the business from a sales perspective, we think helps with transparency and aligns it much better. So we're always looking for ways to improve upon it. Specific to your question, trying to simplify it, David. And if there's something in there that's meaningful and is causing some real issues, let me know what it is, and we'll see if we can help you out.
DavidGuarino: Okay, that's great. And maybe we can talk offline about that. And just a second question on the Chicago market, we didn't touch a lot on that, but still limited activity there again this quarter. But it looks like there were two pretty large leases signed by some private data center operators during Q4. So could you maybe give us an idea, I guess, of how you view the supply and demand dynamics in that market and then just kind of your expectations surrounding when that space might be leased in CH2?
PaulSzurek: So we're positive on the market. It was in 2020, much more almost entirely a hyperscaler market. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, both of those two leases you mentioned were with one hyperscale customer. But it's traditionally been a very strong enterprise market. We actually had good leasing in that market. Our leasing in Chicago was our best since 2016. It was 19% ahead of 2019 levels. We brought our occupancy in CH1 up from 81% to 87%. And we have a good funnel of enterprises with larger scale requirements that hopefully will start bearing fruit this year in 2021. Steve, anything you'd add?
SteveSmith: No, just minor correction. It was 13% over 2019, but in the ballpark, to be accurate. But yes, it was a good year. We'd like to do more. I mean, I would like to see more. We've got a beautiful building there that now we can extend all the value that we've had, our 427 LaSalle location and we're optimistic about the opportunity there. But as Paul mentioned, we did have good leasing and we expect that to accelerate as we go into 2021.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho Securities.
OmotayoOkusanya: In your earlier comments, you discussed the proposed New Jersey tax on financial service transactions kind of causing some delay or some uncertainty in the New Jersey, New York market. Could you talk a little bit about, one, what the latest is with that proposed tax? And then two, if you've seen any other kind of major markets thinking of doing something like that as all these municipalities are all trying to shore up their revenues post the pandemic?
PaulSzurek: So we don't have any real updated information. It almost seems like there's a little bit of pause. The proposal has been reduced but hasn't gone away completely and who knows it may be tied to bigger fiscal things going on relative to Washington and the COVID Relief/Stimulus Bill, but honestly I don't have very good tea leaves into the political situation tale. So I can't really address that. We haven't seen anything similar in other markets. I recall vaguely three, four years ago, Chicago floated something like that. And then when they saw what the impact would be on business in their state and their community, they shut it down. So I mean, I think all these municipalities are focused on the fact that, that business and that activity is portable to other jurisdictions. And so they have to make a judgment as to whether they're cutting off the nose to spite their face, if they implement a tax like that.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Michael Funk with Bank of America.
MichaelFunk: Quickly, circling back interconnection of your comments earlier, hoping you can pull apart on what's in your guidance for 2021. You mentioned that a number of moving pieces there, volume growth helped in 2020, migration to higher capacity, price increases. So does your '21 guidance, does that assume lower volume growth, lower level of migration, pruning by customers or less ability to increase pricing?
JeffFinnin: Michael, in terms of 2021 guidance, as I mentioned earlier, our overall volume increases in 2020 were 7.7%. We actually expect volume increases for 2021 to be around 7%, which is right in line with where our revenue growth is guided to at this point in time. So what we're not certain of and haven't baked into the guidance is how much incremental revenue growth we would receive from customers as they're rolling over on their new lease terms or any migration to those higher priced products. We saw a lot of that activity in 2020 and at this point, have expected that to be fairly muted for 2021. And we'll just see how that rolls out as we go through the year.
MichaelFunk: And then one more, if I could, on capital allocation. You slowed the dividend growth recently. You gave a target for leverage for 2021. What does it take to get back to the historic level of dividend growth?
JeffFinnin: Well, I would simply say we continue to target that AFFO payout ratio of somewhere around 90%, 92%. And you can see we're just a little bit higher than that currently over the last trailing 12 months. But I don't anticipate that payout ratio increasing, that's the level we're comfortable with at this point in time. And so dividend increases are going to be very highly correlated to cash flow growth. So I would say look closely at the AFFO growth and that's really going to give you a better indication on what that dividend growth is going to look like longer term.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Paul Szurek for any closing comments.
Paul Szurek: Thank you. Thank you all for your interest and your time and learning more about CoreSite today. I'll tell you I learned many good things about our team during the challenges of 2021. My colleagues have an increased appreciation for how conscientious, agile and innovative they are, not only to make the adjustments necessary to succeed in 2020, but to continue to build a better platform for how we go forward. They make me very optimistic that we can perform well with our strong business model and the abundant capacity that we have coming into this year. So I look forward to 2021 and hope you all have a great rest of your day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-29 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to CoreSite Realty's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.  As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your Investor Relations host Kate Ruppe. Please go ahead.
Kate Ruppe: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to CoreSite's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of our full earnings release which can be found on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. With that I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for joining us. I will cover our third quarter highlights followed by Steve and Jeff's more in-depth discussions of sales and financial matters. Our Q3 highlights include new and expansion sales of $12.5 million of annualized GAAP rent. Operating revenue of $154 million representing year-over-year growth of 6.3%; FFO per share of $1.33 a year-over-year increase of $0.05 per share or 3.9%; power and cooling uptime of 100% for the quarter thereby sustaining 79 of uptime year-to-date. Completion in October of LA3 Phase one and commencement of our previously announced 4.5 megawatt pre-lease and issuance of our third annual corporate sustainability report. The state of the economy in recent months appears to be leading more enterprises to raise the priority of their digital transformation initiatives. This dynamic seem to help our new and expansion sales execution during the third quarter leading to good new and expansion sales and good progress in building a robust sales pipeline for future quarters. Our sales customer support and data center operations teams have been extremely agile helping our customers navigate these challenging times and plug into the value of our ecosystems as part of their hybrid cloud architectures. As discussed last quarter, we continue to see some elongated sales cycles for traditional enterprises due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the overall size of our sales pipeline seems to compensate for this challenge. However we ultimately have to execute on those opportunities and convert them into successful sales. Some activities are returning to normal. We resumed in person data center tours making sure they follow COVID-19 safety protocols. We have also seen more customers taking comfort in these protocols which support the safety of our on-site staff and customers leading to more normal volumes of customer visits in our data centers. At the same time we continue to see increased remote hands activity and use of our customer portal. As I mentioned earlier we recently published our third annual corporate sustainability report. Sustainability is an important ongoing goal for CoreSite as we focus holistically on a broad range of success measures that take into account all of our stakeholders. The report summarizes our continued commitment to our customers, colleagues and communities including providing our customers with reliable and energy-efficient data centers, building a culture of fair and equal treatment respect, responsibility, transparency, innovation and operational excellence and fostering communities of customers that work synergistically with each other. Turning to our property development. LA3 is our first ground up data center in Los Angeles so we are pleased to complete Phase one on time in October and equally pleased to commence our 4.5 megawatt pre-lease with much runway to expand on the success of our Los Angeles campus. We also completed the NY2 power infrastructure project adding an incremental 4 megawatts of power to support our existing space. The completion of LA3 Phase one fulfills our multiyear plan commenced in 2017 to add 4 ground up enterprise-class data centers to our portfolio with the goal of restocking contiguous capacity to strategically support the expansion of our campuses and our existing customers and to bring new customers to join these communities. We realized some of the fruits of this plan this quarter through our ability to opportunistically win a modest and fast-moving hyperscale deployment. As important, we are making good progress on the permitting and entitlements for SV9 our next new data center on our Santa Clara campus. We continue to see a strong sales funnel for our new CH2 data center in Chicago, however it primarily consists of enterprises with longer and less predictable decision time lines. And recently we executed our Illinois memorandum of understanding providing our participating customers with sales tax savings. Our increased capacity is crucial to meeting the customer demand we continue to see for edge capacity and edge cloud deployments in our major metro markets, especially for enterprises seeking the highest performance, cost-effective secure and reliable co-location solutions for multi and hybrid cloud IT architectures. In closing, our increased capacity is providing increased sales opportunities, driving our strong Q3 sales and our network cloud and enterprise dense campuses in major metro markets are well positioned to benefit further from the secular tailwinds for data center space. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul, and hello everyone. I'll start by reviewing our quarterly sales results and then talk more about some notable wins. As Paul shared, we delivered new and expansion sales of $12.5 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter, up approximately 35% compared to the trailing 12-month average, which included $5.6 million of core retail co-location sales, $6.9 million of scale leasing and an impressive 37 new logo wins with opportunities for future growth. Our new and expansion sales were comprised of 72,000 net rentable square feet reflecting an average annual GAAP rate of $173 per square foot. We continue to see elongated sales cycles, but we benefited from a strong sales funnel and the hard work of our sales team producing both good volume and some strategic wins for the quarter. Additionally, we continue to see elevated demand in the market supporting our efforts to build a robust pipeline for future sales. If our current pacing continues, 2020 will be our strongest year for creating new sales opportunity volumes. However, we ultimately need to convert these opportunities into successful sales transactions over the next several quarters. Looking at new logos. The 37 new logos represents $1.7 million of annualized GAAP rent, our best quarter since Q3 2019. New logos accounted for approximately 13% of our total annualized GAAP rent sign in during the quarter and were strongest in the enterprise vertical. We are excited about the quality of these new logos and believe they will drive future growth as their IT needs evolve. Notable new logos included a global markets company that is one of the world's largest financial derivative exchanges, which signed and commenced during the quarter. A mobile marketing platform that fuels many popular mobile games through its studio and marketing technology and in a major participant in the investment industry. Attracting and winning new customers that value our platform remains a key area of focus and it's great to see it continue to bear fruit. Our sales results were further supported by strategic wins from existing customers, which enhances the attractiveness of our data centers and connectivity platform. As Paul mentioned, having the capacity to provide flexibility for our customers to scale their deployments, while benefiting from native cloud on-ramps and robust interconnection collectively delivers unique value to support today's it requirements that few others can match. Customer demand realizing this value to support their hybrid and multi-cloud needs continues to be evident through some of our Q3 existing customer expansions. Two of our most notable wins across verticals and business sectors this quarter were the signing of a communications cloud-based technology company that provides video and collaboration services and the high-tech financial services and mobile payment processing enterprise. In summary, the strength of our third quarter sales results reflects our initiatives to improve retail scale and new logo sales that further enhance the value of the ecosystem effect on our campuses. We remain optimistic about our opportunities going forward as our pipeline for the fourth quarter and 2021 remains strong and we continue to focus on translating our pipeline and capacity into new sales and revenue. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our third quarter financial results, discuss our balance sheet including liquidity and leverage and conclude with some items to consider for the fourth quarter and 2021. Looking at our financial results. For the quarter, operating revenues were $154 million, which represents 6.3% growth year-over-year and 2.3% sequentially, including growth in interconnection revenue of 10.8% year-over-year and 1.2% sequentially. Customer lease renewals equaling $20.7 million of annualized GAAP rent, which represents a cash rent mark-to-market of 2.9% and we reported churn of 1.9%. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $7.2 million of annualized GAAP rent. Our sales backlog as of September 30 consisted of $17.8 million of annualized GAAP rent or $23.6 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced. We expect approximately 60% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the fourth quarter and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence first quarter of 2021. Net income was $0.50 per diluted share, an increase of $0.03 year-over-year and a decrease of $0.02 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.33, an increase of $0.05 per share or 3.9% year-over-year and a decrease of $0.02 sequentially or 1.5%. Adjusted EBITDA was $81.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 4.5% year-over-year and consistent with the previous quarter sequentially. Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA increased slightly as expected and was 5.2 times at quarter end. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 4.9 times. We expect to finish the year with leverage slightly higher than the current quarter at approximately 5.3 times. We ended the quarter with $326.8 million of liquidity, which provides us the ability to fully fund our 2021 business plan. Turning to our work ahead. We have accomplished a great deal in the first nine months and we are focused on continuing that momentum. In regards to the fourth quarter, we still anticipate elevated churn as a result of the first of two move-outs associated with the customer in the Bay Area that we have discussed the past several quarters and expect churn to recede to our historical levels of 7.5% to 8.5% in 2021, inclusive of the 200 basis points related to that specific Bay Area customer during the second half of the year. Turning to 2020 guidance. We increased our 2020 guidance related to net income attributable to common diluted shares to our new range of $1.92 to $1.96 per share from our previous guidance range which was $1.81 to $1.91 per share. In addition, we increased our 2020 FFO guidance to our new guidance range of $5.26 to $5.30 per share from our previous range of $5.15 to $5.25 per share. And we increased our 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $323 million at the midpoint from $321 million previously. The increase of $0.08 per share at the midpoint of FFO or 1.5% is largely driven by approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share in net COVID-related savings, such as travel, entertainment and conferences and $0.05 per share attributable to lower-than-anticipated property taxes, insurance and other operating expense savings. As it relates to 2021, we will provide detailed annual guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in early February. However, I'd like to leave you with a few thoughts. We have brought a significant amount of capacity to the market with four ground up data center developments over the last three years, which supports our leasing efforts, as our sales team has more contiguous capacity to meet a broader range of customer requirements. Keep in mind, the operating expenses related to the recently completed and pre-stabilized projects are higher at the completion of Phase one than subsequent phases and therefore typically negatively weigh on investment returns. As we look forward to 2021, we have the ability to bring consistent amounts of capacity to the market through incremental computer rooms and infrastructure development within our existing data centers. This enables us to bring capacity online more quickly and invest lower levels of capital per incremental computer room compared to the requirements for the initial phases of each new development like VA3, CH2, LA3 and SV8, all delivered in the past 12 to 18 months, ultimately culminating in higher returns on the incremental capital as compared to capital invested in building the core and Shell during the initial phase. The expected capital investment in 2021 is currently estimated to be approximately $185 million to $225 million and continues to be dependent upon sales activity through the end of the year and the anticipated timing related to additional capacity requirements. In closing, we have ample liquidity to fully fund our 2021 business plan. Our balance sheet is strong with no near-term debt maturities. Our business fundamentals are strong and we believe we are well positioned for the long term. With that operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session  Our first questions come from the line of John Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Atkin: Thanks. So a number of markets where you've delivered multiple megawatts as you mentioned Jeff towards the tail end of your remarks. And I wondered if you could maybe talk across the kind of the competitive environment, pricing, expected yields, demands, environment across each of the four to just give us a flavor for how you view things commercially at present? 
Paul Szurek: John, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. I'll try to answer that and Steve and Jeff can jump in if I leave something out. I mean, obviously, the biggest markets in terms of volume for us as Jeff pointed out were Santa Clara in Los Angeles and New York. And -- but we also see good volume and good opportunities in Virginia and Chicago. Chicago is a bit behind for the reasons I mentioned, but the pipeline there looks good. We've got to execute on it. It didn't help. It came up in the early stages of COVID, which slowed some things down.  I would say that our pricing comments would be consistent with what they've been in prior quarters. In most of our markets, supply and demand is pretty much in balance. Pricing is solid. It may vary in a particular market depending upon the density and the deployments that are won in that market in any given quarter. But quarter-over-quarter they seem pretty stable. Virginia still is the most challenging market from the standpoint of pricing, but it hasn't changed. It hasn't gotten any worse in the last couple of quarters and may have even improved a little bit.  We continue to target and believe we can achieve on average our historical yield targets. Those haven't changed. And at this point in time with the development that we've completed and the inherent expansion capacity that we have within our existing portfolio. The main determinant of our future is going to be how well we can translate these sales funnels into sales? How well we execute on that? And just to put the capacity in perspective because I know there was some -- appear to be some confusion in analyst notes coming out at least with a handful.  We currently have the ability to increase in existing buildings both with available space and computer rooms we can turn up quickly within six months, roughly 88 megawatts of capacity. And we have land that is either already entitled or in the entitlement processes like SV9 to turn up another 126 megawatts of development. So as our sales continue to succeed, we have a tremendous pipeline of developable capacity behind them to pursue those sales. Does that cover your question? 
John Atkin: Yes. Unless, Jeff was going to add more. 
Jeff Finnin: John, the only thing I would add just a little bit around pricing is there were some questions in terms of our pricing this quarter on the signed build on a per square foot which is simply stated. If you just look at the composition of our scale leasing this quarter versus our retail collocation, a much higher percentage this quarter in scale which compressed that pricing a little bit. 
John Atkin: And then as we think about SV7, I mean you had some success at SV8. Curious about SV8 signing was with the earlier customer that you had signed with SV8 last year. And then there has been quite a lot of demand in Santa Clara with a large build-to-suit project and kind of repeat demand from the cloud vertical. Curious your thoughts on filling SV7 with that type of demand or whether the build-to-suit commitments that have happened recently have kind of saturated that customer's appetite? 
Steve Smith: John, this is Steve. I can give you a little bit more color on the sales, the pipeline and how we're placing deals in seven, eight or otherwise. As you mentioned we have quite a few buildings in Santa Clara and as we build out our campuses which that's a great example of where we have multiple buildings within the campus. It really does give us a lot more flexibility on where we place customers based off of their unique requirements and our capacity within each of those buildings.  So as we went through Q3, the opportunity to really maximize the capacity within SV8 made a lot more sense than just deploying and breaking up space in SV7. And we do have a customer that we forecasted to churn out just turned out some of their space and we'll turn out the rest of it next year. So that's been forecasted for quite some time and we are encouraged with the pipeline that we see for the potential to backfill that potentially with the single tenant, but that remains to be seen. 
Paul Szurek: John, you did seem to ask if the expansion in SV8 was the existing customer in SV8 and it was not.
John Atkin: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Hi. Thank you for the question. And first one just for Jeff. Just having looked at this at the live transcript yet, but for churn in 2021 did you say 7.5% to 8.5% inclusive of the 200 basis points expected churn in the second half of 2021?
Jeff Finnin: That's correct, Sami.
Sami Badri: Okay. Okay. Thank you for that clarification. And then for -- just back on backfilling right? And this is kind of tied to pricing. Are you able to find customers willing to be paying that same hurdle rate or the same price point that you guys had a couple of years ago for that capacity that is now becoming vacant, or have you guys been engaged in situations where you need to be a little bit more lenient on pricing just to get the capacity signed and occupied?
Steve Smith: So are you talking specifically around Santa Clara?
Sami Badri: That's right.
Steve Smith: Yeah. I would say that the pricing it remains to be seen as to how we actually lease the backfill for the customer I think you're referring to. But I would say that the pricing that that customer had been paying is right in line with market. So depending upon densities and the overall dynamics of the pipeline and the customers that may take that space can vary of course. But overall the current pricing in the market is very close to what that customer had been paying.
Sami Badri: Got it. Got it. Thank you. Thatâs all I had.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Jon Peterson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Jon Petersen: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon guys or good morning. Your renewal spreads this quarter were pretty good on a cash basis. I think the strongest we've seen in over a year. I'm curious if I guess high level were you feeling more in boldness quarter in terms of pushing rents, or is that more just a function of the mix of what you were renewing this quarter?
Jeff Finnin: Hey, Jon, how are you? Yeah. A lot of what impacts those cash renewal spreads is largely dependent on the market in which we're renewing the lost customers. And then secondly, the types of deployments, i.e. retail colo versus scale. And so that has a big impact in terms of what we're doing from a mark-to-market perspective. But I think it's representative of what Paul alluded to earlier in terms of the markets being relatively balanced in supply and demand, which just allows us to continue to drive some reasonable economics and ultimately performed at a very good level this past quarter. I can't expect that every quarter, but we're very happy with the outcome for this most recent quarter and still expect to finish the year for 2020 inside our guidance range of 0% to 2%.
Jon Petersen: Okay, got it. And then you mentioned a lot of the demand came from I guess Santa Clara L.A. and New York, but what about Northern Virginia? How are the dynamics changing there? Is it opening back up in terms of demand, or is it still a tough market for you guys?
Steve Smith: Jon, this is Steve. Overall, I would say that the market still remains strong in Virginia. We've been a bit more opportunistic on more of the hyperscale that you see the bigger headlines from as to how they value our ecosystem and bring value to our campuses. But if you look at the results that we delivered even our first phase at Virginia, they've actually been pretty good and the rate that we've been able to acquire there has been quite strong in comparison to the overall market. So the larger hyperscale and scale opportunities are still pretty lumpy, but it appears to be picking up. And as Paul mentioned in his remarks, I think the -- overall the market is probably more in balance now than it has been.
Jon Petersen: Okay. All right, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you. My sense is that the company aspires to high single digits maybe even low double-digit type revenue growth. And when we look at the interconnect enterprise oriented demand, I guess non-scale that's a business that's growing in the mid-single digits. So really to get to those higher levels you need to do more hyperscale or scale deals. But that to your point has been fairly lumpy and maybe not as consistent as I think what investors or maybe what the company would want to see. Is there a thought about potentially lowering your hurdle rates taking the returns down recognizing that the market has changed and that you could be a lot more successful and also equally important that the market or investors might be accepting of those low returns, recognizing there's maybe a better appreciation for the business that you have today than maybe just a few years ago. And then secondly, I apologize I missed the first 10 minutes or so of your call, but can you repeat where the largest scale leasing was done in the quarter, and I guess to that point, what is the thoughts around New York and New Jersey in terms of what you're seeing from a scale demand perspective this days? Thank you.
Paul Szurek: So, Colby, let me start with your last question. We had three scale leases with three different customers; Santa Clara, Chicago and New York. In terms of â look, I think weâre pretty on top of our business model, and our pricing and what weâre going after and respect we may have different view on that. But we believe that we can deliver the right levels of sustainable growth and be better position to deliver that year-end and year-out by continuing to provide a higher level of value to customer to growing these customer ecosystem that enable them to save, a tremendous amount of money and effort by collocating with each together and with their network and cloud providers in major metro markets. And that higher value to customer translates into higher returns. And we believe that there is sufficient amounts of that, if we continue to execute to enable us as we've said in the past to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth in FFO per share on a sustainable basis. Especially, once we get through this recent churn episode that we've had and once we start leasing up some of these newer buildings that are fairly fresh and right now are a bit of a drag on our growth. But I think in the long run, what investors will appreciate is our ability to deliver more value on our capital, while delivering a very healthy and more sustainable growth rate and not pursue extensively lower yield deals that eventually mean you just have to do more and more development or spread investing every year. Just to keep to tread water as opposed to having a value-added business model that is more sustainable for growth year-over-year. Now maybe that means, we're sacrificing an opportunity for double-digit growth in a particular year or two, I don't know, maybe not. But I think as a sustainable business model that focuses on delivering value to customers that translates into value to shareholders it works pretty well and should continue to work well. Obviously, we just - we just have to keep executing.
Colby Synesael: And just one more quick follow-up. The three scale deals that you mentioned. Were they all relatively evenly balanced, or did one market have a notably bigger deal perhaps than the others?
Paul Szurek: The Santa Clara deal was bigger than the other deals, but they were all in the scale category.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.
Michael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Curious if you could talk a little bit about, how you think of investing in your platform and product development going forward? As you think about introducing additional managed services that you could provide for your customers or even conceptualizing your role as others and probably yourself explore the concept of the edge data center and getting infrastructure closer to where people are using the information and accessing the information? Thanks.
Steve Smith: Hey, Michael, this is Steve. I give you my response and Jeff and Paul can chime in as needed here. But I think, how you finish that question is really where we start which is providing that foundational high connectivity scalable data center that is at the edge. Each of our markets that we're in starts with a carrier hotel that is highly interconnected that's then tethered to a modernized scalable data center that allows for moderate workloads to be deployed there and leverage that low latency and that's within those downtown metro cities. So that's a unique offering that very few others can provide out there, as I mentioned in my remarks. So it starts with that and then how we've built that out to provide even more value to our customers over time. And in fact, just in the last year is really connect those together where now we have inter sight connectivity between those campuses to where customers can have diversity on how they deploy their architecture. They can have diversity as it relates to accessing different availability zones for different cloud providers. There's a lot of value that has been extended within each of those markets through that offering that we just rolled out about a year ago. That combined with our any two exchanges that really provide the peering that many of the service providers, cloud providers are looking to exchange traffic on. As you know, NY2 is the largest exchange in the whole West Coast. There's unique value there. So there's a lot of embedded value that really we've started with. And then, if you look at where enterprises are moving today and really migrating from their â many cases an existing data center that they may manage own themselves into more of a hybrid performance-oriented architecture where they are leveraging a data center like ours to connect to those other cloud providers they need help, right? So to your point around managed services and other surround edge cloud adjacent type services, we have worked very closely with those third-party providers that are very good at that and really develop the ecosystem for them to come in and thrive. And know, where we play and where we don't play, to where they can come in invest in our ecosystem know that that what the kind of the guidelines are around that ecosystem and how they make money, and how they deliver value to our customers. So we worked hard over the last several years to really educate our sales team, educate our partners on how we extend that overall value chain to our customers so that they can really have the full range of services and how they map out their overall IT architecture. So that's a bit different than how some of our competitors have rolled out some of their offerings where they've chosen to compete with their ecosystem. And we've been very diligent and thoughtful about how we ensure that we support and endorse that ecosystem and reward our sales team and those partners are coming into a vest.
Paul Szurek: Mike, I would just refer you back to my comments to Colby about the business model. Much of our success is driven by helping our customers succeed and Steve has described a number of the ways that we do that. And a big part of that is getting the right providers in our data center communities and making it easy for customers to work with each other so that it is a much more efficient and effective way for them to architect their it and their digitization over the near-term, but also to retain the optionality and to continue to explore better ways of doing things over the long-term without having to leave that data center.
Steve Smith: Yes. I think one of the biggest things just to kind of wrap-up on is that enterprise are looking for is flexibility and choice over time. As you outsource the data center it's not a trivial exercise and it's really a long-term bet. So the potential to be locked into either a single provider with single or limited access to networks or cloud providers or other services that are around there because they have chosen to get into that business themselves. I think we've proven out over the last 15 years of data center providers that's probably not a great model.
Michael Rollins: And just one follow-up on the sales cycle that you described being elongated. I know it's tough to predict in this environment what the future may hold, but have you learned the catalyst for decisions from your customers on balance? Are they looking to the results of the election to try to get in a position to make decisions? Are they waiting for just a larger part of their workforce to return to office or just having some stabilized strategy of how to manage through this? Are there some learnings that we should just be mindful of whereas if something evolves in the environment or for the macro economy that we could appreciate how that might help or slow that sales cycle for your customers?
Steve Smith: Yes I haven't seen the political climate come into play in any discussions that we're having at this point. I think a lot of customers are just navigating it individually as to their individual circumstances. As you can imagine, technology is more important than ever for enterprise -- and really any kind of enterprise and business to be operating at all today. So how they embed that technology into their success and their overall business strategy is different from one to another. We've had some adjustments that we've had to worked through over the last six months or so and how we help customers through that selection process, how it fits into their model how they evaluate alternatives virtual tours those kind of things. I think hopefully just on the results you've seen we're getting better at it. Customers are getting more debt at it. The elongated sales cycles as I mentioned in my prepared remarks are still there. I think it still takes more time for people to coordinate their internal resources, prioritize capital all those kind of things that you would imagine. But collectively the pipeline, as I mentioned is quite strong. And I think we're now catching up with a lot of those sales cycles. So it remains to be seen on how that ultimately translates longer term. But we're all navigating it together and I think we're getting better at it together as well.
Paul Szurek: Yes. We are really hoping that the Dodgers finally winning a world series of century would be a catalyst, but that remains to be seen.
Michael Rollins: Thought you'd be rooting for your Denver teams?
Steven Smith: You got to be realistic here.
Michael Rollins: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks. First on Steve just following up on the pipeline a little bit the robust pipeline you guys discussed. I caught in your comments you said that 2020 would be the strongest year for creating new sales opportunities or volumes and you've got to convert these. So how does that sort of translate into actual leasing production? Is that sort of 2021's business, or is that 4Q into 2021, or how do I sort of interpret that comment?
Steven Smith: Well if you just look at the overall pipeline robustness. it really as we've been managing this really every day, every quarter for ever since I've been here. But just monitoring and managing that as we came into COVID there was a lot of questions as to what the effects are going to be. And overall we've seen an increase in interest in our platform and therefore the pipeline that comes along with it. So that's encouraging and that has continued even up through Q3. The timing and conversion of that is still TBD as I mentioned some of those more immediate opportunities can close even in quarter. Our typical close cycle is typically 90 days to 120 days is kind of normal, but we're well into that pipeline that we've seen create. So it's -- we're incurred so far. But again we're in some uncharted territory here as well. 
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then in terms of -- I just want to clarify the scale leases. I wasn't sure. I heard I thought I heard Santa Clara L.A. in New York and then I heard Santa Clara Chicago and New York. Can you just clarify where were the three scale leases exactly?
Paul Szurek: It was Santa Clara, Chicago and New York.
Michael Rollins: Okay. And then the -- one for Jeff just on churn. So 6.2% year-to-date Jeff but your guide of 9% to 11% implies about another 3.8% of churn in 4Q. And we know about the $8.3 million in Santa Clara. But are there any other sizable known move outs or may you be tracking below the midpoint of that 10%?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. No there's -- if you look at the one item in the Bay Area that's going to by itself be about 260 basis points in Q4. And so that together with our typical quarterly churn, we would expect our churn in the fourth quarter to be north at/or above 4% for the quarter. It's going to be elevated as we've been talking about all year. So just keep that in mind related to not only the churn amounts, but obviously the Q4 quarterly results as well as you guys think about your models. But somewhere north of 4% is where we'll come in for the quarter.
Michael Rollins: Okay. And then one more follow-up. I just come back to Steve. Just sort of in terms of quarterly lease production last year was a pretty robust year, I think helped by some scale leads. I'm just -- as you look at quarterly production and sort of the bread and butter retail business, what are your thoughts around sort of the level of that core colo business? I mean where should we expect that to be now that you've got sort of ample availability of product? What are you targeting on a quarterly basis?
Steve Smith: I don't know if I could give you a specific. I don't know that we're going to break it down specifically to retail versus scale. But I will tell you that that is the core of our business and that's where we try to drive uniformity across the platform which is exciting to see us now have more capacity in more markets. Because it allows us to kind of raise that level over time to where we're not just so reliant on just a couple of stronger markets where we now have Chicago. We really have capacity in all of our markets now. So on balance that is where about I would say 80% of our overall sales efforts are really geared towards. It's kind of that retail enterprise kind of lower scale opportunities. So as you've seen our sales results in the past can be a bit lumpy. Most of those lumps are contributed to more of those larger scale -- hyperscale opportunities which is still part of our mix. It's part of our business strategy and how we've architected our campuses. But I think you can look at the trail and kind of see where those lumps come in and where they leave and that will give you a good indication where our retail and kind of core enterprise businesses.
Michael Rollins: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question has come from the line of Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Erik Rasmussen: Thanks for taking the questions. Just first on Northern Virginia you said you seeing some pricing stability and even some improvement in that market. So I guess with that what does that mean for you in terms of opportunity as you sort of think about that market going forward?
Steve Smith: Yes. We're encouraged with the market. Obviously we have a pretty big bet in Northern Virginia with our VA3 campus and are quickly moving through our first phase there. So overall the pipeline is good. The competitive dynamics are still that. They're competitive. And we continue to look for those right opportunities that value our campus. So all things in Virginia are not equal and those that value interconnection access to enterprises and cloud on ramps those are the ones that we really focus on. But there seems to be more and more of a preponderance of that. So we're encouraged with the outlook. 
Erik Rasmussen: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up. I know a lot of questions on the sales cycle, but we are hearing -- yourselves have talked about it as well an improvement on the enterprise side and the sales cycle maybe some improvement on that -- not seeing opportunities come through a little bit quicker. But are you saying that this could be more of a 2021 sort of story, or are we even seen that improvement carry into the fourth quarter as it relates to sort of you getting back to your historical levels?
Steve Smith: Well I think we continue to try to get better at it. We've seen some customers existing customers especially that may be deployed with us already that are really going through more of the virtual tour and making decisions on expanding with us without even physically seeing the space which a year ago that would likely never happen. So it's very customer dependent, but I think customers are getting more savvy about how they buy what they buy and really kind of going through that evaluation process more pragmatically than more of a physical getting on-site and really walking the space. So we'll see where that plays out. But we've seen some of that play out early whether or not that translates into longer-term opportunities and what happens with the current pandemic and so forth. There's just so much up in the air it's hard to predict.
Erik Rasmussen: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Nathanson, please proceed with your question.
Nick Del Deo: Hey. Good afternoon guys or good morning where you are. Obviously the majority of your business is in California. Can you dimension your exposure if proposition 15 passes?
Jeff Finnin: Hey, Nick we can. Obviously, it's an item we've been watching closely for a couple of years. And obviously it will play out here over the next couple of weeks. But, we have given some numbers historically. And just to summarize, what we've said. If you look at our overall property tax exposure, in California, specific to those leases where we are unable to pass-through any increases in property taxes in the current leases, it equals about $3.5 million. And that equals ballpark about 15% of our overall property tax expense for the company. And so, that's the area that -- where we have exposure. Just to give you some additional commentary there, when you look at the average remaining lease term for those leases, where we have that exposure, it's about 2.5 years. And so for that proposal I think, it's going into effect in 2022. We'll have opportunities to negotiate with customers over that period of time to minimize that impact. And we'll see how that all plays out, but that gives you some idea of the exposure today.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Jeff. And then, with your 2021 churn outlook, can you talk about your re-comfort in the context of the changes you've made to your churn forecasting methodology over the past year or two? And how you'd assess the risk that it falls outside of that band?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah. Nick, I give a lot of credit to the teams that have been working collaboratively over the last, 12 months to 18 months. A lot of resources on my team as well as Steve's and they've done a really good job of peeling back the onion, just to better understand, where we think that that is headed. We're comfortable with the numbers we gave earlier, which 7.5% to 8.5% gets us back to our typical range. including obviously the 200 basis points from the one customer. If you kind of set that aside, you'd say, we're probably down to lower levels of where we've been historically. It's not going to be perfect. We obviously do make some assumptions and provide -- and we always get better clarity the closer we are and after, we're going through conversations with customers. But I'd say, as we sit here today we're comfortable with what our expectations are for 2021. And so if we've got the numbers and we'll just see how we perform, against that as we get into 2021.
Paul Szurek: Nick the only thing I'd add to what Jeff said is that, we just have a declining -- significantly declined base of those types of customers, whose churn was initially harder to forecast, coming into 2019 and 2020. And so that -- just having that group, reduced significantly helps us have more confidence in our forecast.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. Got it. Thank you guys.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks Nick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Brendan Lynch: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on your commentary earlier about third-party technology that you have available in your data centers. You announced a partnership with the VMware Tech Alliance Partner program earlier this month. Maybe you can give us some color on what this enables for your clients. And whether this was specifically in response to current customer demand or rather, you're trying to open up to a new sub-segment of customers?
Steve Smith: Thank you, Brendan. This is Steve. I think the announcement with VMware and Dell is a great example of how we are looking to try to enable some of the tech leaders to invest in our platform and provide those services out to our customers. Probably can't get into the exact details. I would just kind of tease you a little bit and say stay tuned. And we will see a lot more detail around that. But the intent is for them to have their technology deployed to support those hybrid architectures and they have some technology that I know they're excited to deliver and excited delivering the platform. So -- but it's really around supporting the enterprise and those hybrid environments multi cloud environments where VMware is obviously very strong. And we're excited about the partnership.
Brendan Lynch: Great.
Paul Szurek: One of the keys to that though that Steve mentioned earlier. And I'm probably being redundant here. But it's working with companies like that to make it quick and easy for other customers to turn up their services in our data centers and significantly reducing the time and the lift associated with that.
Brendan Lynch: That makes sense.
Steve Smith: And you could see that across other technologies whether it's Amazon Outpost and others just trying to make those, kind of new technologies available. They know the landscape that they're coming into incentivize our team to work with them to do so. That's the core of the strategy that we're working towards.
Brendan Lynch: Sure. That makes sense. And then just one other quick one, one of the reasons you cited that you raised guidance was lower-than-anticipated property taxes for the remainder of the year. Would municipality struggling financially in the COVID environment? Do you anticipate material property tax increases in 2021?
Paul Szurek: Yes, it's a great question Brandon. I hate to give them any room to execute on that. I think the reality is when you look at the assessed values across each of our markets, they're reading the same information everybody else is in terms of the industry. And they've been I would say aggressive in terms of their valuations and it's just an ongoing effort. From our perspective to challenge those assessments and those values that they're utilizing. And I would tell you we do it frequently. And periodically, we're successful in them. Actually, I'd say frequently we're successful in them. And that's what you ultimately saw in the results this year. In terms of next year, there's always that incentive. And it's just something we're going to have to continue to watch and see what -- and how it ultimately plays out, but nothing I can predict today. But it is definitely an incentive form given some of the dynamic that's in play with lower revenues this year as a result of the COVID.
Brendan Lynch: Sure. Thanks for the color.
Paul Szurek: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of David Guarino with Green Street. Please proceed with your questions.
David Guarino: Hey. Guys thanks for the questions. Just a quick one from me. Without the interest you've seen from center and in the data center space, how much competition are you seeing in the colo space, or would you say most of the new competition is more geared towards the hyperscale data center side? Thanks.
Steve Smith: I'm sorry we couldn't hear the original part of your question. Who's coming into the data center space?
David Guarino: It feels like there's a lot more private competitors coming in, so whether it's infrastructure funds or just a whole host of credit investors coming in from the sidelines?
Steve Smith: Yes. Thanks for the question David. Going back to our overall capital allocation strategy, we try to stay out of the way of where it's easy for capital to get deployed and where it is in fact being deployed in creating a seller's market. So that's why we built our model around interconnection and cloud on-ramps in major metro markets where it's harder to turn up additional capacity. Nobody can be completely insulated when there's lots of new capital coming into an industry. And obviously, it's clearly made the hyperscale, especially the generic hyperscale much more competitive. It's probably raising asset prices in second and third tier markets and frankly every market. But that's one of the dynamics we factored into and why we focus on the strategy that we have focused on.
David Guarino: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Rob on for Frank. So what's been the pace of new logo growth for you guys versus 12 months ago? And then going off of that, what's been the nature of the applications that new customers are coming to you guys for? I know you -- that you also talked about digitization, but what exactly does that entail? And like what does that look like for you guys in terms of the applications that you're selling to customers?
Steve Smith: Yes. Thanks for the question. New leverage is obviously a key area that we've continued to focus on in this quarter. Being 37 new logos as far as the number is concerned is one of our highest that we've seen in I think the last five quarters. So that's -- it's good to see. Overall, I would say the numbers in general are pretty even overall. If you look at the mix of those logos that are coming in though the quality of them has improved over the last several years and that's been a big focus of my team is to not just sign new customers, but those customers that value the ecosystem that also have the opportunity for growth. So we look at both the quantity, the deployments and the revenue contribution obviously, but also the long-term likelihood of them to continue to stay customers. So less likelihood of churning out, but also more likelihood of continuing to grow. So that has the quality has continued to get better especially over the last I would say 2 years that's been a key focus.
Paul Szurek: Applications?
Steve Smith: Oh applications. As far as applications are concerned, as you see kind of the shift towards more of that kind of mid- to large enterprise, it's interesting to see how technology from the cloud providers has kind of trickle down more to be more available to some of those enterprises, where they can now take advantage of some of the same economies that a lot of the large cloud providers have been solely able to do. So whether it's hardware, virtualization, applications that they're running being able to load balance applications across various environments and into the cloud even allows them to really manage their environments within our data center differently. So what you're seeing is really customers architecting their design to where they can manage their kind of core workloads within our data center more effectively and more cost efficiently, while still leveraging cloud for those workloads that are better managed there and also give better diversity and redundancy. So it's -- it really becomes a mix of all of those things and how it comes together with SaaS or software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and then their core infrastructure. So that mix varies by customer, but we're seeing more of that consolidation of especially mid- to large enterprise where they are thinking their core applications. And they're kind of -- they're more steady state workloads and manage it themselves and managing peak loads and more around the world type applications that need to move from region to region and follow the sun through cloud-type providers.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you guys very much.
Paul Szurek: Thank you, for your interest in CoreSite Kate and Jeff and Steve and I appreciate it. We're also honestly very fortunate to work with a group of colleagues who have been tremendously agile and innovative throughout year whether it's figuring out how to get customers deployed quickly and interconnected very quickly to just getting all this new capacity built in an environment where safety is a much more difficult thing to achieve and regulations continue to change related to both construction and operations and to deliver such good uptime for our customers. You've heard a lot on this call about how strong our campuses are about, the customer ecosystems, about the major metro markets and how they've enabled us to drive value for our customers and translate that into shareholder value. But these colleagues that we have working around the country and all these facilities are really what makes it work and we're very great to form. Thank all of you for your time. Have a good and safe rest of your day.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to CoreSite Realty's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your Investor Relations host, Kate Ruppe. Please go ahead.
Kate Ruppe: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of our full earnings release, which can be found on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm going to cover our second quarter highlights, and Steve and Jeff will follow them with their more in-depth discussions of sales and financial matters. Our Q2 highlights include the completion of 2 key development projects, the first phase of our new CH2 building, the first purpose-built enterprise-class data center in downtown Chicago and the third and final phase of our SV8 data center expansion in Santa Clara. We also maintained momentum on construction of our new LA3 building, and we continue to be on track for construction completion in early Q4. We achieved power and cooling uptime of seven-nines year-to-date. Operating revenue was $150.5 million, representing growth of 5.3% year-over-year and funds from operations per share was $1.35, an increase of $0.08 per share year-over-year or 6.3%. The ongoing pandemic has presented many challenges, and we, like everyone else, are navigating the rapidly changing conditions in many of our markets while supporting our customers and vendors as they do the same. Coming off of a record quarter in Q1 for retail and scale sales, new and expansion sales were $3.5 million of annualized GAAP rent, lower than our trailing 12-month results, primarily due to a focus on retail and scale leases and long sales cycles influenced by the pandemic and related economic uncertainties. Steve will provide more detail on this quarter's results, the quality of the sales won and our confidence in the strong funnel for the quarters ahead. Pricing for retail and scale deployments and demand for interconnection were solid as our data center campuses and related connectivity services continue to meet the essential needs of high-performance data center deployments. Our customers have been able to operate in our data centers with significantly reduced physical visits. Utilization of our customer portal has nearly doubled since the beginning of the pandemic as customers use the portal to provision new space, power and cross connects, remote hands and monitor their temperature, humidity and power draw. We have moved in an agile manner to hosting virtual events and virtual data center tours for current and prospective customers, which have increased our sales funnel, and our sales team is hard at work to ultimately translate those opportunities into sales. We continued our COVID operating protocol so that the recent spike in cases and the related regulatory constraints have not affected our ability to remain fully operational. Turning to our property development. The completion of Phase 1 of CH2 is a significant milestone. CH2 is unique in downtown Chicago with its ability to support high-density cabinets with dark fiber campus cross-connects to our CH1 network node, with energy efficient and sustainability focused, construction features and in the downtown market. The addition of CH2 vastly strengthens the attractiveness to enterprises of our Chicago ecosystem, which already provides extensive network options, including leading network providers deployed natively at CH2 and the 40-plus domestic and international carriers as well as access to cloud on ramps at CH1. COVID has affected pre-leasing at CH2, but the enterprise sales funnel that exists today is exactly what we hope to attract with CH2, and we feel good about its future. In addition, we completed the final phase of our SV8 development, adding 52,000 net rentable square feet and 6 megawatts of capacity to our Silicon Valley campus. In total, this data center is 74% leased after only 9 months since the completion of Phase 1, which demonstrates the strong demand in the Santa Clara market and the strength of our campus ecosystem. The completion of these projects provide sufficient capacity to turn up services quickly. We expect Phase 1 of our LA3 ground-up development, which is 74% pre-leased to a hyperscale deployment to be delivered early in the fourth quarter. Completion remains dependent on the local jurisdictions and utility providers for workplace rules and final inspections and permitting as they operate in COVID conditions. In closing, we believe the sustained adaptability and strong execution of our team, the strategic nature of our diverse network and cloud-dense campuses and the interoperability we enable for a large and diverse customer ecosystem position us well to benefit further from the secular tailwinds for data center space and steady enterprise migration to powerful hybrid cloud solutions and colocation. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I'll start off reviewing our quarterly sales results and then discuss some key themes and drivers for the quarter. As Paul shared, we signed $3.5 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, comprised of 22,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $156 per square foot, lower than previous quarters due to lower than average densities, however, at a rate consistent with the trailing 12-month average on a kilowatt basis. Our sales for the quarter were comprised entirely of core retail colocation sales. While the second quarter results did not reflect the level of new and expansion sales that we targeted, our funnel continues to look good. And we saw encouraging trends in our sales to our cloud and network customers as well as new logos. As mentioned, we had some key network and cloud deployments during the quarter, including the completion of a natively deployed cloud on-ramp with a top-tier cloud service provider in L.A. Offsetting the momentum, we saw with our network, cloud and technology verticals was a slowdown in sales to enterprise customers. The ongoing pandemic has elongated the buying patterns for enterprises customers as they become more deliberate in assessing the impacts of current market conditions on their own business and focused on adapting their business operations during this time. We continue to believe that the long-term value of adding these companies to our ecosystem warrants the patience and persistence required to secure them as customers. The volume of our pipeline as of the end of the second quarter remains as strong as we have seen in recent years, which leads us to believe these challenges do not eliminate sales opportunities, but likely defer them to later periods. Given this, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2020, but we need to ultimately translate these opportunities and to close sales and the timing of which is still to be determined. We do continue to be successful in a number of key areas despite these challenges, including important expansions with several strategically existing customers, continued success in the digital media, gaming and streaming service sectors as well as education and collaboration companies, and winning some high-quality new logos that we expect to provide ongoing future opportunities. Turning to new logos. In the second quarter, we won 31 new logos, which accounted for approximately 32% of our annualized GAAP rent. These logos include many quality brands that enrich our ecosystem, including a technology services company providing Internet services to education, healthcare and government communities; an IT automation and security company offering next level network security services; and a well-known cloud-based software company that offers AI-enabled connections between businesses and their suppliers. We remain acutely focused on attracting high-quality new customers that value our platform and will help drive future growth as their IT needs evolve. Moving forward through the second half of 2020, we continue to see demand for high performance, hybrid cloud architectures, and we are focused on maintaining pricing discipline and enhancing the quality and vibrancy of our customer ecosystems. In order to translate our pipeline into sales, we continue to help enterprises navigate these challenging times and realizing the value of the CoreSite ecosystem with their digital transformation and future growth. We are working on attractive scale and selective hyperscale opportunities as they align with our campus value and our shareholder objectives. And as always, we remain focused on improving efficiency and effectiveness in all we do. Technology continues to play an increasingly important role in the success of every business. We believe our network-dense cloud-enabled and enterprise-rich campus ecosystems position us well to capture a strong share of high performance, hybrid cloud requirements and edge needs in our major metropolitan markets. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our second quarter results, discuss our balance sheet, including liquidity and leverage and review our financial outlook and 2020 guidance. Looking at our financial results. For the quarter, operating revenues were $150.5 million, which represents 5.3% growth year-over-year and 2.2% sequentially, including growth in interconnection revenue of 11.3% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our customer renewals included annualized GAAP rent of $25 million, which represents a cash rent reduction of 1.5% and churn of 1%, both in line with our expectations. The negative cash mark-to-market for the quarter was the result of 2 customer renewals in Virginia. Excluding these 2 renewals, mark-to-market for the quarter would have been an increase of 2.2%. Commencement of new and expansion leases consisted of $7.9 million of annualized GAAP rent during the quarter. And our sales backlog, as of June 30, consists of $13.3 million of annualized GAAP rent for signed, but not yet commenced leases, or $18.5 million on a cash basis. We expect roughly 40% of our GAAP backlog to commence in Q3 2020 and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence in Q4 2020. Net income was $0.52 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.01 year-over-year and an increase of $0.04 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.35, an increase of $0.08 per share or 6.3% year-over-year and $0.06 sequentially or 4.7%. Adjusted EBITDA was $81.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 6.5% year-over-year and 3.8% sequentially. As I shared last quarter, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have received request from a small number of customers related to some level of payment deferral or relief from current obligations. Since mid-May, we have seen a significant slowdown in the number of requests received with minimal additional requests coming from our customers in recent weeks. The financial impact is included in our 2020 guidance, which I will address shortly. Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 5x at quarter end, consistent with the previous quarter. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 4.8x. To recap and update our financing activities during the quarter and as mentioned on our last earnings call, on May 6, the company closed on a 7-year $150 million unsecured private placement of senior notes at 3.75%. $100 million was funded at closing and the remaining $50 million was funded on July 14. Proceeds from this issuance were used to pay down outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with $397.6 million of liquidity, which provides us the ability to fund our business plan beyond our remaining committed construction cost of $66 million related to current projects in development. Turning to 2020 guidance. We are increasing our 2020 guidance related to net income attributable to common diluted shares from our previous range of $1.74 to $1.84 per share to our new guidance range of $1.81 to $1.91 per share. In addition, our 2020 FFO per share guidance has been increased from our previous range of $5.10 to $5.20 per share to our new guidance range of $5.15 to $5.25 per share. The increase of $0.05 per share at the midpoint or approximately 1% is largely driven by interest expense savings, resulting from our financing activities earlier this year and lower rates expected through the rest of this year. Although the change is noted, our 2020 guidance and guidance drivers remain unchanged. In closing, as we move into the second half of 2020, we will be working to continue translating our new capacity into increased sales opportunities and ultimately executing on those opportunities. We have ample liquidity to fund our business plan through the end of 2021. Our balance sheet is strong with no near term debt maturities. Our business fundamentals are strong, and we believe we are well positioned for the long term. With that, operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Sorry about that, I was muted. Can you characterize the volume you're seeing in the pipeline a little bit more, Steve? Is it larger scale deals that are taking longer with enterprise customers or are they hyperscale? Just trying to understand the nature of sort of the delays, if it's just -- business moving away -- sorry, if it's bigger customers that are just taking longer to execute? Or if it's just a bunch of smaller customers who were taking longer to execute?
Steve Smith: Sure. Thanks, Jordan. Yes, let me first, as far as characterizing the pipeline, start with the new opportunities and the volume that we've seen of new opportunities coming into the pipeline through Q2. And even through the end of Q1 when COVID really started back in March, we've actually seen the number of opportunities increase since that time. And as mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's one of the robust new pipelines that we've seen in recent years. So that's encouraging to see. As far as the elongated sales cycles, actually, I think you're kind of referring to there. When you think about the current business environment that we're in today, those enterprise customers that are clearly seeing the value in digitizing their business in today's environment are seeing interest there. And that's where the pipeline is coming from. Where the challenge has been is then, first of all, grappling with their own challenges of operating in this environment as far as employee distance engagement, their customers, their supply chain, all of those things that are more complicated now along with kicking off the new IT project that needs to be evaluated in all the various aspects that go into that. So that just takes more time. Some of the challenges that go along with that have made that a bit longer than what we've seen in prior cycles.
Paul Szurek: And they do tend to be larger deals than what we've seen historically in our funnel, right?
Jordan Sadler: And is that -- so are those larger deals, also with enterprise customers, Paul? Or is...
Paul Szurek: Yes.
Jordan Sadler: Or is that -- okay. Okay. So is the mix sort of static -- sorry, status quo for you guys in terms of what you guys would ordinarily target?
Steve Smith: Say the question again there, Jordan?
Jordan Sadler: It's still a status quo in terms of mix of customers in the pipeline? Because I mean, the pipeline is bigger, I'm just trying to understand what's driving it, if it's a different type of customer, just bigger requirements?
Steve Smith: Sure. The pipeline is bigger. And it's bigger from an enterprise perspective. So that's good to see. It's also bigger from just the dollars and there's -- especially in the scale, size opportunities. The hyperscale come and go, and that's not necessarily an area that we're primarily focused on. But those enterprise scale opportunities, we've seen more of those. So that's encouraging to see, and we're optimistic about the second half of 2020.
Paul Szurek: Jordan, I would only add that the big driver here are the increasing number of companies that are moving towards a hybrid cloud, multi-cloud infrastructure and the subset of those companies that realize that their performance requirements, in other words, the amount of data that they will be transferring around from time to time between their own servers, their cloud servers between clouds, between cloud adjacent functions is growing. And we've had some private research commission and surveys done, and we think it's going to continue to grow. And our own historical research and, of course, performance strongly emphasizes the value of increasing these customers in our ecosystem in terms of the stickiness, growth and all the other organic growth attributes that you desire. So it's definitely a class of customer, very much worth pursuing, and we believe the opportunities. We're in the early stages of the good opportunities for the next few years to acquire these customers.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, are some of these folks targeted for or slotted for the Santa Clara backfill?
Steve Smith: You're talking about SV7?
Jordan Sadler: Yes.
Steve Smith: Yes. Well, as we mentioned on the prior calls, that is an option for us. And as we look at the various opportunities out there, one of the benefits that we have now in Santa Clara that we have across more and more of our portfolio is that the ability to leverage the campus and fitting customers into the right space at the right time. The SV7 lease is still under lease. And so as that rolls off and provides opportunity there, and we have SV8 now also to fit customers into, we just look at the balance of that and where the best place is to position that customer to get the best yield out of that space. So we'll continue to manage that as opportunities present themselves, and we feel optimistic about where that market sits today.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
Jonathan Atkin: I wanted to follow-up on maybe some questions that Steve or Paul could address. Just around enterprise, and it sounds like your confidence in the sales funnel, interested in any -- quarter-to-date -- any successes you've seen quarter-to-date now that the quarter is kind of 1/3 of the way done? And any changes around the close rate, right? I mean the funnel can get larger -- late-stage funnel stage can get larger, but if the close rate is getting the other way then maybe that's not so good. So just kind of comments or observations on those piece parts?
Steve Smith: Yes. Well, I'll start, and I guess there's -- clearly, I can't say a whole lot about what we're doing in Q3 thus far. I can say that we continue to try to improve on all fronts between pipeline and close rate and all those kind of things and helping customers really just navigate this new environment as they look to typically tour space and how we find pipeline, for example, really trying to be agile about how we approach finding new demand, which I think we've been more and more effective at, as you can see in just the numbers of new opportunities coming into the pipeline. But also in customers as they evaluate space and their alternatives and doing virtual tours and those kind of things that help them continue in their process of making selections and moving on in their IT projects. So that continues to -- we continue to get better and better at that as customers continue to get more and more efficient at it. So we feel like that's going to also start to stabilize, and customers are going to start moving forward more consistently in the future.
Jonathan Atkin: And, I guess, unless, Paul, that has anything more to add on that. I got you. Just maybe a question for Jeff on MRR per cabinet, and I know it's just a minor blip in terms of dollar contribution, but it is the first time that that chart has not been consistently up and to the right. And I wonder, John, did that have anything to do with renewal spreads? Or what are the contributors to that this quarter, that metric?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. Jon, it's really attributable to 2 items. First, when you look at our renewal spreads for the last 3 of the last 4 quarters have been negative. Ultimately, that's going to translate and put some pressure on to that MRR per cabi, which you're seeing. Some of that reflected this quarter. Secondly, there's a customer in SV7 that we've mentioned and talked about as it relates to our churn expectations going forward, but that customer has largely vacated the premises in over the last couple of quarters. And as a result, they are no longer drawing any power associated with that deployment. That also puts a negative impact on the MRR per cabi as well.
Jonathan Atkin: And finally, maybe if Paul wants to answer it, just competitive environment around pricing or competitive supply, there has been a lot of scale leasing in markets such as Northern Virginia, in Portland and elsewhere. But where you operate, are you seeing the amount of competitive supply kind of get absorbed? And what's happening with the pricing -- market pricing trends?
Paul Szurek: So I think it's really a tale of 2 cities, Jon. We -- our pricing has been pretty stable. We have lower density this quarter, but that's typical for a retail-driven quarter. But our per kilowatt pricing has been stable, and it's primarily because of the types of customers that we're winning and their need for the ecosystem that we have. We are in the market. We'll opportunistically add scale leasing for less differentiated components, but the pricing on that seems to have stayed down in markets like Santa Clara, New York, even Chicago to some extent. And so we're not going after that category business as aggressively.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
Colby Synesael: Sure. I guess I have a follow-up to some of the questions that have already been asked. But when I think of the retail colocation growth opportunity in the United States, it's probably around what your growth rate is. You look at what, for example, an Equinix is putting up in their Americas number. And even if you back out, for example, the hyperscale growth that you're seeing from a QTS or CyrusOne, you just look at their enterprise, you're going to see that mid-single-digit type growth. So it's really not a function of you guys not executing. It's just -- that's what the market is giving you. I guess with that said, is there an opportunity or should the company actually becoming more aggressive in looking for growth elsewhere, whether it is being more aggressive going after hyperscale, even at a lower return, which you've obviously seen some of your competitors do in the market where it's worse than poor or potentially even go outside the United States or is it simply that your content with the growth rates that you're seeing and we as investors or analyst should be as well? And then secondly, just more as a clarification on SV7. What have you assumed in your guidance for the remainder of 2020? So I think it's fairly understood that Uber is vacating 5 megawatts in October. It doesn't seem like you've filled that obviously just yet, so that could actually go dormant at least for November and December. Is it assumed in your guidance that there's 0 revenue coming from that deployment? And what does the pipeline look like to potentially fill that with another Paul Knopp 5-megawatt type customer or given the pricing that you're seeing out there, you're not even interested in doing that?
Paul Szurek: So on your first question, I think, if you were looking at traditional retail, you're probably right about the growth rates. But if you're looking at further up the scale category of enterprises going to hybrid cloud, I think that's a much more attractive growth picture and also a higher value picture. And while COVID has certainly, as Steve mentioned, for good reason, slowed down some of those sales cycles, it's still long-term worth pursuing. And while the next 5 to 10 years will tell the story about how aggressively -- how wise it is to aggressively go after the less differentiated deployments and accept lower yields. Our view is that the approach we're on will actually generate more value, create less risk of future churn and generate more organic growth within our data center campuses and will provide a good level of mid- to high single-digit growth in some years more than that and in a way that is more sustainable and lower risk. So obviously, we feel good about our strategy. We always have to continue to get better executing it, but that's how we see the landscape right now. In terms of SV7, we don't give -- Jeff will shake his head at me, if I try to give specific detail about what's in our guidance. But the market in Santa Clara, as you know, Colby, tends to be lumpy in terms of hyperscale opportunities. They come up periodically, and they move quickly, and there's not a whole lot of space in that market. And pricing in the market from what we've seen is pretty consistent with the rent that the current tenant is paying. So we don't see -- when we do lease that, we've got different ways to go about that depending on how quickly we lease-up the balance of SV8. We don't expect it to be a material difference from what we are currently receiving.
Steve Smith: Colby, the only thing I would add as far as the approach that we're taking and looking at retail, we can have a lot of different view, I think, as Paul's alluded to there. But what we're also building here is future value for these key markets in the U.S. and a lot of that involves not only the interconnection, which we've been focused on since the beginning and it's very difficult to replicate. So that's part of our differentiation, but also native cloud on-ramps and those native compute nodes that we're seeing more and more of that are lumpy in nature, but more in that scale, size of deployment that I think will further differentiate and drive not only more demand in the future, but also be able to garner better returns. So that's part of the broader picture, too.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg.
Nate Crossett: I just wanted to also ask on the SV7 backfill. Have you guys had customers come through recently to look at that specific space? I guess, I'm just trying to understand what the holdup is as to why there hasn't been any kind of traction? Is it -- do you have to really wait until the tenant moves out before you can show it or...
Steve Smith: Well, no, not getting into the specific customers and pipeline and so forth, the -- there's several different pieces of that customer's leaf, part of which rolls off later this year, part of which rolls out later next year and how we fill up that entire room is based off of the demand and the other characteristics we have within the campus. So there's a lot of different factors that play into whether or not we place a customer there. So I wouldn't say that there's no traction. That is not accurate. We actually see good demand out of that market. It's just a matter of where we place those various customers based off of all those different dynamics.
Nate Crossett: Okay. What about SV2? I think last quarter, there was some move out there. What's the latest on backfilling that space?
Steve Smith: Yes. I think that also just speaks to the overall options that we have in that general market. It's a different asset with different characteristics that are associated with it, and we have different pipeline demands that better align to that asset versus others. And we have current pipeline that is in conversation to take that space even today.
Nate Crossett: Okay. Would you guys ever consider sacrificing your return threshold surprised you to fill some of these sooner rather than later or...
Paul Szurek: Well, I mean, at the end of the day, you're always making a decision about where the market is, the value of the customer, the specific asset, and what you net from the rent. Even our overall ROIC is -- which has been high and continues to be high, has been driven by a mix of decisions all along the spectrum of pricing. So, yes, we can be flexible where we feel it's appropriate to be flexible and where we feel that we have the ability to claim more value, we do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erik Rasmussen with Stifel.
Erik Rasmussen: Just back to leasing, it seemed to take a little bit of a pause after a solid Q1. You didn't book any scale deals, but were there any deals that were pushed out? Or how should we think about then the balance of the year in terms of maybe regaining some momentum? And then I have a follow-up.
Steve Smith: Sure. Well, Erik, to your point, we did come off a record Q1 as far as retail and scale revenue was concerned. So that was exciting to see. And I'd be the first one to tell you that I would have liked to see more come out of Q2. That being said, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks some, a lot of those sales cycles were elongated. So I don't know if you want to call that a push necessarily into future quarters or not. As I mentioned, we got to ultimately translate those into sales. So we'll see how that plays out. But at the end of the day, the pipeline looks good. And we're -- we feel positive about the balance of the year and how we'll finish up 2020 as far as total sales are concerned.
Erik Rasmussen: Okay. Great. And then maybe just on the Silicon Valley. As a lot discussed on SV7, SV8, but what are your plans for SV9? Is that more of optionality at this point and the focus for the team is backfilling SV7 and then you have another 25% or so to fill on capacity in SV8, and it almost becomes a jigsaw puzzle in terms of how you want to fulfill that demand that you're seeing in the most efficient way. But how should we think about then SV9 in the context of all that?
Paul Szurek: Think about SV9, consistent with our previous descriptions of having a proactive shovel-ready development program. So getting through the permitting process, having it ready to go gives us the optionality to move quickly on it when we see the demand or the pre-lease opportunities to drive that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Frank Louthan: I want to circle back on a topic that was touched on a little bit earlier. So you have a product, you have demand, you're getting -- you're able to get pricing that you want, clearly, customers value it. I can appreciate where it's hard to replicate some very interconnection dense locations. But given sort of over time, we're going to see more compute nodes needed to be in new locations, potential population shifts post COVID, say things like that. Why wouldn't you be a little bit more aggressive in getting some land banks or some other property that you could do some future development on in some newer markets and try and replicate the product set that you have? And then I've got a follow-up.
Paul Szurek: Well, we look at those opportunities often time, Frank. What really drives our business is creating these customer ecosystems. We're operating within that environment. Customers can really save a ton of money, and they can also get much better operating performance off of their high bandwidth data applications. And as a result, their own staff operates more efficiently and effectively. Long term, we think that's the most resilient business to be in. We think there's enough of it as far as we can see to generate the type of growth opportunities we've talked about. And as we've looked at the wholesale business over the last 4 or 5 years, the returns have continued to diminish. And I think the longer term risk associated with some of the buildings in the technology space are just -- they're not what we want to buy into. So that's a great thing about American businesses that we all can have different opinions and views and strategies, but we feel pretty good about where we're focusing and committing our resources for the reasons I mentioned. Every time we can put a customer in our data center knowing that we're going to save them a lot of money and give them an environment where they can do their most powerful digital applications much more effectively, we know that's more valuable to them, and they'll pay us more for that. And they feel good about that because the net result is they're still saving money.
Frank Louthan: All right. Fair enough. And then you mentioned earlier in the call that the SV7 that account accelerating a little bit in COVID with some of the virtual selling and so forth that you're doing. Talk a little bit about that dynamic and what's kind of changed? And how customers adapt it from the more traditional come in and see the physical space and kick the tires kind of approach? How are you guys being successful without that dynamic?
Steve Smith: Sure. Well, Frank, it's Steve. I really starts with -- we started early in the process, when we saw that with there was going to be limited ability to do what we can consider traditional events and customer engagement, demand gen and really pivoted to more virtual events and trying to leverage technology ourselves into attracting new demand. So that has proved to be beneficial so far. As far as, as I mentioned earlier, it's the overall new opportunities coming into the pipeline. So that's kind of where it starts. As customers engage into the process, what would typically be a lot of in-person come out and view the site, go through and inspect the plant and all those different physical inspections. We also quickly adapted and recorded virtual tours that we can conduct with those customers to let them walk through and see that virtually and be able to talk to them as they do that. So that's been in place for a couple of months now, a few months now. But even more recently, we've been able to, with our staff that's on-site and followed all the protocols to ensure that they're safe and our customers are safe, be able to do even live videos and walk them through and do real conversations with them to make it even more personal and hopefully more effective. So that's a combination of all those things based off of how individual customers are navigating the environment on their own. And we've even seen some customers that are now wanting to come back and still work through our protocols and so forth to ensure that everyone is safe, but then actually come out, see the space, make sure that they know where their IT is going to be placed. And it is a long-term strategic decision for them. So we're helping them navigate that, however, it works best for them.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.
Nick Del Deo: First, Jeff, to what degree, if any, did factors like lower T&E expense or lower power prices help the bottom line?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Nick. How are you doing? Yes, a couple of things. Great question, similar to maybe what you've heard on maybe some of the calls. But as you look at our Q2 results, we had some benefit in the quarter, probably about $0.02 to $0.03 per share, and that was largely comprised of property tax accruals and adjustments we needed to make in our portfolio as well as some smaller amounts contributing from additional power margins. So as you think about Q2, keep that in mind, again, that was about a $0.02 to $0.03 benefit in the quarter. As you think about things going forward through the second half of this year, historically, we've always had some compression in our power margins in the third quarter, largely due to increased power cost and the highest demand needs throughout the year. And that's what we continue to anticipate, but it remains to be seen given this environment, whether or not that plays out similar to what it has done in the previous years. Just so you're aware, we've always had about $0.01 to $0.02 per share of additional expense in the third quarter. And one other thing to think about for the second half of this year, as those developments that we've completed some of this last quarter, obviously, in some of the first quarter, will continue to absorb more operating expenses associated with those developments. So property taxes, insurance, the additional interest expense, all that gets capitalized during development as well as the operating costs from our staff that had been hired to run those facilities like CH2. So just keep that in mind when you just think about the second half of this year.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. That's great detail. And regarding the change in rents on renewal, you noted that was attributable to a couple of leases in Reston. I feel like that may have happened to you at some point a couple of quarters ago in that market, maybe I'm mistaken. But even a more general sense, with prices down in that market, should we expect that there are more larger leases there that are going to price down in the coming quarters or coming years?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Nick, you're accurate. When you look at some of the negative mark-to-market over the last couple of quarters that we've experienced in ways, I would say, there's been some share, obviously, coming from Virginia as we saw this quarter. I think it remains to be seen in terms of pricing in that market and how we execute. But our pricing in Virginia has varied largely depending upon the types of deals we're signing in those given quarters. And obviously, what else plays into that are the length of those customer deployments as they come up for renewal. So to give you some more color on that. If you think about these 2 in Virginia, those were a couple of long-term customers inside our portfolio. And as their pricing continued to increase through their contractual provisions, they got well above market. And obviously, we had to address that in connection with their renewals this quarter. So some of those factors will play into things as we move through and continue to renew space in Virginia as well as other markets.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Richard Choe with JPMorgan.
Richard Choe: You talked about a pause in the business, is it from a specific business sector? Or is this more of a regional thing? And then I have a follow-up.
Paul Szurek: Let me, Richard, I think -- and Steve can jump in here. But what we -- when we talk about a pause, we talked about customers who have had to set aside their plans and their process for making a kind of a big move into cloud and hybrid cloud because they had to deal with setting up and accommodating a lot of remote work that they didn't have to do before. Or in some cases, they're going to sweat assets for a while, while they see how the economy plays out, how to fix their business. And I think that's probably global wide, not just affecting us in our markets. But on the -- by the same token, you have other customers who see even more the need to gain the efficiencies of a hybrid multi-cloud environment. And once they clear the decks, they're pursuing that more aggressively. So again, you got countervailing tides, but we like the opportunities that are in front of us right now.
Steve Smith: Yes. I don't have to add anything more there, Richard. So I think if unless there's something else you wanted to ask there. Go ahead.
Richard Choe: No, no. That's fine. And then the other point is, do you feel like you have enough space available to sell, and that's not an issue. It's just right now, the current business environment seems to be more of the issue than availability.
Paul Szurek: Yes. We've got as much space as I think we've ever had to accommodate growth, and frankly, across a broader set of markets to accommodate that. So from a capacity standpoint, we're in good shape. And if we can capitalize on the increased opportunities we have in our funnels, things will look very good.
Steve Smith: And the only thing I would add there is that if you think about all the work that's been done over the last couple of years to reestablish our capacity position, a lot of the ground-up work has been done. So we do have capacity both in place that we can absorb existing demand, but also quickly add more demand or more capacity rather into those shales that we've built very quickly.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: So my first was on Chicago at CH2. It looks like I was wondering what your funnel looked like in that market. We understand, at least, in the city proper, there's relatively limited supply relative to some of the suburbs of Chicago. So you kind of see a pipeline of enterprise deals or is there some potential for hyperscale activity in that market as well, particularly with the sales tax exemption that they passed last year? Could that maybe drive some additional demand into that market?
Steve Smith: Yes. We're happy to see CH2 come online. So that's a great feat for our engineering and construction team. So I appreciate all the work that went into that. As you know, it's not easy to do permit, much less build in some of these key metro cities. So that's -- it's great to have that done. It's a unique asset in Chicago. So we're excited about the opportunity there. And the proximity to our CH1 facility and having it connected with dark fiber, I think, it's not only give us the opportunity to sell into CH2, but it's also provided more value for CH1 and the ability to expand that ecosystem that Paul mentioned earlier. And also being in proximity to other key network hubs that are right downtown there as well. So the pipeline, we're encouraged with the pipeline. We've staffed up and more sales there, and we're excited about the opportunity that's ahead of us, both in terms of retail and scale opportunities, and in some cases, hyperscale.
Eric Luebchow: Okay. Great. And then just one more, if I could, more for Jeff. So I appreciate you're not giving guidance beyond 2020. But considering, as you mentioned, that you have a decent amount of supply to sell into right now and more new development will be, less on the ground-up and more filling data halls. So should we kind of expect capital intensity cadence to improve beyond this year? And then related to that, are you kind of comfortable operating at slightly north of 5x net leverage for a period of time or kind of alternative funding sources, including equity, something on the table as well?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. Eric, I think similar to maybe what we mentioned last call as we work through the rest of our development that's ongoing here through this year, I would expect that leverage to slightly go above the 5x. And as we complete and then get those customers that are currently in our backlog able to commence, I would anticipate it to start to receive back down close to the 5x. And I think that's where you'll see us operate in the near term. In terms of capital, as I think we mentioned earlier, you referenced to capital sources. We don't have anything in our plans this year for issuance of equity capital. But obviously, as we look towards our 2021 business plan, and we'll provide guidance in February around what that looks like. It's just one of those additional sources that we just got to keep in mind as we navigate capital needs and how much capital we really need to deploy in 2021. The only thing I'd -- the only thing else -- other thing I'd offer is that as you think about -- we -- as Paul mentioned, we've got plenty of capacity today. And the additional capacity that we'll be developing in '21 will require much less capital. So I would see our capital needs probably coming down in 2021 as compared to where they were this year and last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins: Just a follow-up on the capital allocation discussion. Can you remind us your average borrowing rate today that's in the balance sheet? And then if you were able to refinance the balance sheet at today's rates, just wave a magic wand, what rate would you estimate that you'd be able to get for the totality of the balance sheet? And then just second, a follow-up to the backlog disclosures earlier. I think you mentioned that the cash backlog was ahead of the GAAP were higher than the GAAP backlog. If you can maybe unpack what's happening within the backlog, that would be great.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Michael, let me give you some commentary on the backlog first, but that -- our GAAP backlog has historically always been just a little bit lower than our GAAP backlog. So that difference this quarter of about $5 million. It will range anywhere between $3 million and roughly $7 million. That's fairly common. That's largely just a difference due to a couple of larger deployments where they are ramping into their deployments over a period of time where they may get 2, 3, 4 or 5 months just to ramp into those deployments. And that's fairly typical for the larger tech deployments and so that's what caused that difference. In terms of our debt, inside our supplemental on Page 20, we always recap ultimately what our weighted average interest rate is. And we ended the quarter at 3.19% when you blend everything together. And to the latter part of that question, what could we reprice that at? We just did the most recent refinancing -- or I should say, debt issuance in May at 3.75%. I would say that, that was an environment that was a little interesting just given all that's going on with COVID. Obviously, we saw good demand for the debt issuance, but the spreads were wider than what we've done historically and, obviously, treasury rates were down lower -- the lowest we've probably seen at least in my career. And so it's a unique time to be issuing debt. I don't think that, that gives you a really good sense for where that would be repriced today. If I had to do it again today, I think we'd be inside that rate. I don't know where it'd be probably 2.75%, 3%, maybe a little bit lower, something like that, to give you some sense.
Operator: Next question is from the line of David Guarino with Green Street Advisors.
David Guarino: A question for you on Northern Virginia. The industry data that we looked at suggests that there's been a strong first half of the year. And maybe even the supply demand pendulum has kind of swung back to not being so oversupplied. And I know you also noted that market is still seeing some aggressive pricing. So what do you guys look internally to determine when you're going to add new capacity in Northern Virginia?
Paul Szurek: We're primarily looking at our scale and retail pipeline and select edge cloud opportunities that would drive that. The -- and mostly that's building in buildings that already exist at our existing campus. So we can spin up new capacity pretty nimbly. So we don't have to take a long-term swing at landfill development. That market has gotten better from a supply demand perspective. But I would agree with what you said, hyperscale pricing is still very competitive. And in that market, we -- I think everyone is learned to be a little bit and hopefully learned to be more careful at not just the volume of hyperscale transactions in any period, but also the composition of it because there are periods where like the first half of this year, I think, more than half of the take-up in Northern Virginia was just 1 customer. And does that customer continue to buy the same amount in future years? Historically, it hasn't happened that way. So I think people are right to continue to be careful about Northern Virginia.
David Guarino: That's helpful. And then maybe switching gears, obviously, in the public market, data center stocks have shown really strong performance year-to-date. But do you have any idea how that might translate into pricing in the private market for data centers? Have we seen any sort of cap rate compression in the sector? Or is it still too early to tell?
Paul Szurek: We -- as you know, we try to pay attention to what's going on out there. And I wouldn't say there's been any cap rate compression, but cap rates have held pretty steady in the private markets.
Operator: At this time, I will turn the call back to Paul Szurek for a few closing comments. Please go ahead.
Paul Szurek: Well, thank you very much for your interest in CoreSite and your questions today. And I'd like to thank all of my colleagues throughout the CoreSite system. They've been tremendous as we have worked through all these constantly changing challenges and new regulations. But most importantly, they've all been safe and they've kept each other safe and they've kept our customers safe and they've enabled our customers to operate seamlessly in our day centers and that's no small feat under these circumstances. So I'm grateful for what they've done. Look, we've had great questions on this call today. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify our strategy and our focus on growing the quality and the size and the organic growth potential of our ecosystems. I feel very good about the space we're in and the opportunities that it provides us. And I look forward to us continuing to perform going forward. Thank you very much, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions].I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Carole Jorgensen, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.
Carole Jorgensen: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's First Quarter 2020 earnings conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer.Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal security laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC.Also on this conference call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of our full earnings release, which can be found on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at coresite.com.With that I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm going to cover our first quarter highlights and Jeff and Steve will follow with their more in depth discussions of financial and sales matters.Our highlights for Q1 2020 include new and expansion sales of $12 million of annualized GAAP rent, a record quarter for our core non-hyperscale leasing. Operating revenue of $147.4 million, which grew 6.1% year-over-year, FFO per share of $1.29, which $0.04 year-over-year or 3.2%, power and cooling uptime for quarter of 100% and completing a new computer room in NY2 and keeping our major construction projects on track, while navigating COVID related changes to local regulations.Our strong performance cannot obscure the fact that recent weeks have been challenging for all of us due to this pandemic. I expect those listening to this call would like us to discuss the ways in which this situation affects CoreSite. First, we're fortunate to be in the data center space. Our data center campuses and related connectivity services meet essential needs of businesses, governments, healthcare and academia as they work through the challenges of this pandemic, along with their normal operations.We also host large customer ecosystems of networks, clouds and service providers, content providers and enterprises in major metropolitan U. S. markets where capacity continues to be in high demand. Some of these cloud network and content providers are experiencing increased demand at the network edge at this time for populations who are sheltering at home and working remotely driving online education, collaboration, data analysis, entertainment, gaming and similar use cases. Hence it appears the economic impacts of the pandemic have so far been more constructive for CoreSite than for most companies, and we experienced a pretty smooth transition to operating in a very unusual business environment.Our work in previous years to hire and cultivate great talent, address new technology platforms and develop extensive procedures and scenario training, shows value in making us more resilient in an extreme operating environment in which it was more important than ever to meet customer needs with great agility. In addition, our products and services made it easier for customers to operate effectively in our data centers with minimal and in some cases extremely rare physical visits. Customers can provision new space, power, cross connects, OC exports, redundant paths and remote hands via our customer portal through which they can also look at their temperature, humidity and power draw.Second, we have learned from successfully managing through the impacts of hurricanes, wildfires and other natural risks, as well as from regular business continuity planning drills to proactively source supplies, evaluate design safe operating environments, strategically and adequately staff our data centers to ensure business continuity and safely provide critical customer access. And third, we're thankful for our team and their innovation and dedication to constantly serve our customers with exceptional service, even in trying circumstances like those experienced in recent weeks. Most of these elements of strengthening our sales performance for some time and drove the excellent performance this quarter.During the property development, we have sufficient capacity to turn up services quickly, which was will support both existing and new customers across our markets this quarter. Our major construction is on track, enabling us to presell 11% of SBA phase three in Santa Clara, place in the service a 35,000 square foot computer room in NY2 in New Jersey, and continue to pursue preleasing opportunities for CH2 in Chicago. It's important to note that we still rely on local jurisdictions for final inspections and permitting as they deal with their own new work rules. That said, we still expect to deliver CH2, LA3 and SBA in line with planned completion dates.A few other data points will hopefully round out the picture. We believe customer satisfaction is high based on the higher than normal volume of feedback from them and their strong expansion demand, which made up 94% of our sales for the quarter. Customers have been able to decrease their visits to our data centers by approximately one-third compared to pre-crisis levels. Sales and pipeline growth were strong and most importantly, we kept critical access available to our customers as we focused on solutions to enable them to deploy and operate in our data centers safely and with confidence.While we cannot clearly predict all the ramifications of COVID-19 or their duration, we believe the increased demand from reliance on technology, connectivity and the data in today's economy will on balance approximate or exceed the reduction in data center demand due to a serious economic slowdown. Although, that likely will depend on the depth and duration of the slowdown. We expect to continue to provide excellent support to our customers and our communities, and we believe we will be even stronger as a company due to what we are learning and experiencing through this crisis.In closing, we believe the strength in our results this quarter reflect the adaptability and strong execution of our team, the strategic nature of our diverse network and cloud dense campuses and the interoperability we enable for a large and diverse customer ecosystem, which positions us well to benefit further from the secular tailwinds for data center space and demand for high performance hybrid cloud solutions.With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Paul. Today, I will review our first quarter results and provide an update on our liquidity, leverage expectations and 2020 guidance. Looking at our financial results. For the quarter, operating revenues were $147.4 million and grew 6.1% year-over-year and 0.9% sequentially, including growth in interconnection revenue of 9.1% year-over-year and 3.1% sequentially. Our customer lease renewals included annualized GAAP rent of $17.3 million that represented a rent increase of 1.4% on a cash basis and churn of 3.3%, both inline with expectations.Commencement of new and expansion leases of $9.7 million of annualized GAAP rent during the quarter, and our sales backlog as of March 31st consists of $17.6 million of annualized GAAP rent for signed but not yet commenced leases or $22.3 million on a cash basis. And we expect all of the GAAP backlog to commence fairly ratably in the next three quarters.Net income was $0.48 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.6 year-over-year and $0.3 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.29, an increase of $0.4 or 3.2% year-over-year and a decrease of $0.1 sequentially or 0.8%. Adjusted EBITDA was $78.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 5.6% year-over-year and a decrease of 0.5% sequentially. As a result of the current COVID-19 situation, we have received requests from a small number of customers, which currently represent approximately 2.5% of annualized revenues related to some level of payment deferral or relief from current obligations. We are addressing each customer requests on a case-by-case basis, and most are being resolved by providing an additional period of time to make due on outstanding amounts generally 30 to 60 days. While adjustments have been immaterial to-date, we can not predict whether these requests will increase overtime.Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA was 5 times at quarter end. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 4.7 times. Based on our current development pipeline and the related timing of capital deployment and commencements, it is likely we will temporarily trend higher than our target level of 5 times leverage in the first half of 2020, with the expectation of moderating leverage based on the timing of commencements related to our backlog and anticipated new sales.We continue to focus on optimizing our balance sheet, including reducing our cost of capital, maintaining adequate liquidity, minimizing volatility and continuing our disciplined capital investment. As part of that strategy, during the quarter, we executed $450 million in interest rate swap agreements at attractive rates, increasing our percentage of fixed rate debt from 71% at year end 2019 to approximately 95% at March 31st. This is a departure from our historical approach of maintaining a balanced position between fixed and variable price debt.However, given the flat yield curve and rates, it allowed us to capitalize on a market opportunity and reduce our variability to near-term interest cost. In addition, in April, the company priced a seven year $150 million unsecured private placement of notes at 3.75%. The notes are scheduled to close on May 6th with $100 million funding at closing and the remaining $50 million in mid July. The financing provides the company the flexibility to repay outstanding amounts on our revolving credit facility, as well as providing additional liquidity for our future development projects. The company's nearest debt maturity is April of 2022. While we expect the private placement to close as planned, please note that closing is still subject to customary closing conditions. We ended the quarter with about $292 million of total liquidity, bringing us to approximately $442 million of liquidity with this new financing, providing liquidity to fund well beyond our $124 million of remaining construction costs for our 2020 data center expansion plans.Turning to our guidance. At this point in the year and based on what we have seen so far of the COVID-19 impacts and trends, we are maintaining our 2020 guidance. And therefore, see no reason to depart from our normal cadence of revisiting guidance in connection with second quarter earnings. In closing, we're executing on our priorities to bring on capacity and translate it into increased sales opportunities. We continue to closely manage our operating costs with attention to the current market dynamics, while thoughtfully balancing and driving our capacity development and customer opportunities. We have plenty of liquidity. Our balance sheet is strong. We do not have any near-term debt maturities. And we believe we are well-positioned for the long-term. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Jeff and hello everyone. I'll start off reviewing our quarterly sales results and then discuss some key execution themes for the quarter. As Paul shared, we had a strong quarter of new and expansion sales. We delivered $12 million of annualized GAAP rent, primarily reflecting the strength of our core retail leasing, including $8.4 million of retail sales, our highest in three and half years, as well as $3.6 million of scale leasing.This quarter sales reflect success for many aspects, including important expansions with several strategic existing customers, winning in key verticals with network and cloud providers that included two new native cloud on ramps from tier one providers to our platform in Chicago and Virginia. Expanding services with enterprises whose businesses absolutely needs low latency for what they do, including media services, satellite and video streaming providers, as well as gaming, education and collaboration companies. We also saw success in moving quickly to meet the immediate demands of a modest amount of unexpected new requirements that emerged late in the quarter as a result of COVID induced changes to business and consumer behavior. Further, we saw solid sales traction in the governmental space.Turning to new logos. In the first quarter, we won 31 new logos. Three quarters of these logos were enterprise customers. While the initial revenue contribution of these new logos was lower than past quarters, we obtained some great new strategic names that we believe will provide ongoing future opportunities, including a well known video sharing network and service provider, a large consulting technology and outsourcing company, providing application outsourcing and cloud services, a leading healthcare software company offering hosted solutions and promising other accounts. As you know, winning new logos is a key tenant of our strategy and provides the seeds of future revenue growth as they expand services in our platform.Moving to pricing. Overall pricing in our markets was generally stable. We continue to see progress in Northern Virginia with strong first quarter sales and elevated pricing compared to the trailing 12 months, making it our highest contributing market for new and expansion sales in the quarter. Fundamentally, driving our first quarter results was our strong sales execution, as our team continued to find new and effective ways to reach and resonate our value to new prospects, and grow long term partnerships with existing customers.Added to and leverage the differentiating factors of the CoreSite campus ecosystem model, including the recent additions of the DK Experian Exchange and several other cloud providers to our SDN based open cloud exchange, engaged our solution architects and engineers to design creative cost effective solutions to solve customers' changing needs and continue to collaborate with channel partners to extend our reach in helping enterprises evaluate, address, hybrid and multi cloud architectures for the digital journey. All of which was amplified by the excellent service delivered by our customer service and data center operations personnel. Sales execution is always top of mind and embedded in all we do. We don't often talk specifically about it as we consider it a bedrock of being successful. I hope that additional insight helps you better understand how we approach it.To drive future growth, we continue to refine our processes, develop our team and provide them the necessary tools and solutions, like the ones Paul discussed earlier to allow our customers to be more successful and how they leverage technology to drive their businesses. There's no question that technology will play an increasingly important role in almost every business success. CoreSite is committed to providing the services and support that empower enterprises to navigate their path and pace of this new normal with flexibility, speed, security and performance. We believe focus and investment in these areas will enable us to continue to execute well over the long term. We look forward to further helping customers solve their IT challenges.With that, operator, we would now open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Jonathan Atkins from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Mr. Atkins, perhaps your phone is on mute. Mr, Atkins, if you can hear us, we cannot hear you. Please pick up your handset. Please return to the queue by pressing star one.Our next question today is coming from Colby Sinosoft from Cowen and Company. Your line is now live.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Michael on for Colby. Two questions if I may. You noted in the press release that construction remains on track, assuming that local jurisdictions are timely with inspections and permits. Are you currently seeing any delays in inspections and permitting? And my second question, given the recent enterprise strength or the retail strength in the quarter. Are you seeing any notable changes in enterprise buying patterns in this environment? Thank you.
Paul Szurek: Let me address the first, and I'll let Steve handle the second. In our major markets where we're doing ground up development, we have not yet seen any significant slowdown in permitting and inspections. But everyone is going through an evolving situations so we just got to watch that as we go forward. On smaller projects when you saw the push out of our NY2 infrastructure by quarter that did relate to permitting delays, and we have a small project in Boston that's held up by permitting moratorium for the time being in Boston. Steve?
Steve Smith: Second part of your question, I think it was regarding enterprise buying and any changes there, correct?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, that's correct.
Steve Smith: Well, it's been interesting because I think in many cases, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mean, I think the technology is even more important than ever for really any enterprise or any business out there, given the remote nature of how everyone is conducting their lives these days. So there's no question that a brighter light has been put on technology to help solve those issues and we're clearly at a great spot to help them through that. And over the past several years, we've really worked to try to address what was already in place as far as general demand for hybrid and multi-cloud solutions in our data center, and all the advantages that come to outsourcing in a data center where they can leverage our remote personnel and all of the functionality that we have in our portal and so forth, so they can really maintain and grow their IT systems without necessarily even having to disrupt at all.So that value has resonated well. For each enterprise, it's been different. In some cases, enterprises that are a bit more paralyzed and trying to just figure out how they work through this current pandemic, some projects may be put on hold but others have also accelerated, because of seeing the need and the opportunity to move in that direction. So on balance, I would say it's neutral to positive.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is now live.
Frank Louthan: So, I appreciate giving the guidance. Give us some thoughts on what you think about the general pace of business. Are you concerned on the enterprise side that some customer trends may slow? I mean understanding we've seen a quick bounce from lot of enterprise customers in the near-term, but from an economic weakness and so forth. What are your thoughts on being able to maintain the pace of business and could the back half come in a little lower?
Jeff Finnin: Well, let me just kind of quickly in the guidance, and then Steve and/or Paul can provide just commentary in terms of just the macro level of business. But Frank, I think I would just look at it from the standpoint that it's somewhat early innings in 2020. And as you've seen the last couple of years, we've just not modified our guidance in that first quarter and prefer to take another look at it as we get further along in the year. And that's what we plan on doing again this year. So that gives you some context in terms of the guidance. And Steve, anything…
Steve Smith: Yes, I can give you a little bit of, I guess more visibility on where things sit today anyway. As far as overall pipeline, which is probably the best indicator for where we see things so far, the pipeline continues to be solid and we still see new opportunities being created, new logos that are coming into the pipeline. So, we'll see how this plays out over the long-term. As Jeff mentioned in his remarks, but so far things seem to be holding up well. And I think one of the things that in general as you look at overall capital and trying to do more with less, technology is typically one of those areas that people tend to lean towards and trying to maximize their dollars versus other areas.
Frank Louthan: And any thoughts on any customers that are possibly pulling forward some demand from what would come in later in the year? Do you think there's any risk of that?
Steve Smith: We haven't seen necessarily any demand be pulled in per se. I think if anything, as I mentioned, I think that this is really just highlighted or reaffirmed opportunity, but it’s difficult I think in our business to have a lot of necessarily pull in as it relates to long-term leases and that sort of thing, it's not necessarily a knee jerk reaction. So, if anything I think it just reaffirms demand, it's out there. Well, there is some that has stalled a bit, because they're just trying to figure out their overall current situation.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Michael Rollins from Citi. Your line is now live.
Michael Rollins: So as you're having conversations with the customers, are there certain architectures and the way they use your facilities, the way they access the clouds that are showing to be really successful in absorbing all the shifts in demand right now in the IT loads? And at the same time, are there certain architectures or ways customers who've done business where you're learning that it really wasn't the right way to structure things? And then, if you have observations on either of those, what does that mean for your business going forward?
Paul Szurek: From what we've seen, there's a continuation of demand for high performance hybrid cloud architectures, which we specialize in. So it's not surprising that we would see a lot more of that than other things. On the second part of your question, I think all we're seeing so far is the continuation of trends that we've described in our churn forecast for several quarters, which is older business models that are not leveraging the public clouds that are not doing so in the hybrid high performance architecture continue to see kind of a steady burn off. That's pretty much what the data shows us.
Steve Smith: And I guess the only color that I would add to that is one of the benefits that we've seen of customers that are leveraging that model in our data centers. So, they'll have a hybrid environment that deployed in our data center, but also leveraging those native cloud on ramps of which as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, where we've had just added two more, those native on ramps really enable those customers to burst to the cloud much more quickly and economically than others. So, those cost savings that go along with that as well as your speed and capacity. These are right next to the backbone.
Michael Rollins: In case of view to quantify what percent of your revenue base today might be considered older architectures or at risk architectures, versus what you might view as strategic and ongoing?
Steve Smith: So, I think Jeff gave a good number on that last quarter, probably 5% to 6%.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, as of last quarter, it was 4% to 6%. And I think that's moderated slightly, Mike. I'd probably say about 3% to 5% as we sit here today.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel. Your life is now live.
Erik Rasmussen: Yes, thank you for taking the questions. Maybe just on sort of the churn again, you obviously have a SP7, the end of the year and in Q1 of next year, I think the timelines, I would think are still intact. But are you seeing now with this current environment COVID-19 customers who may have been on the periphery or that you thought might churn now sort of taking a better look at what their requirements might be and be able to potentially carve back some of those opportunities that you thought might be lost. And then maybe within that, can you just update us on what the plan is for that space that 9 megawatts of space that's going to be coming due?
Jeff Finnin: Hey it’s Jeff. Just one quick clarification just to make sure everybody's consistent in terms of the actual dates on that SP7 customer. So, 5 megawatts of the 9 will be turning out in October of this year and then the remaining 4 is essentially late Q3 call it September 30 of the following year. Okay, that gives you an idea of the timeframe.In terms of your question, as it relates to has anything really changed. As you can see from our guidance, we've not modified our guidance for churn as relates to this year, first quarter number of 3.3% came in towards the lower end of what our range was headed into the quarter. So, that was a positive having said that some of that just relates to timing. And so I think when you look at 2020, we still expect it to be in that 9% to 11%. And we do expect it to recede as we head into 2020, based on our current expectations of customer renewals and customer activity there. So, I would say to be honest, it's probably much of the same, we haven't seen a lot of changes or variances from what we or what we were about 90 days ago. I will tell you, we work hard and we're trying to get out in front of some of these to see if there are any of those we can retain it. But it's pretty much deployment by deployment specific in terms of events and let me add point it over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Just to relate your last point there, Jeff which is as we work through this and really as part of our normal practice, where we're always in communication with those customers, as to how we might be able to retain them and adopt new models, especially given the circumstances. So, as Jeff mentioned, is still case by case and early days, but we continue on that effort.
Erik Rasmussen: Great. And then maybe just my followup. Nova seems like it shows some progress, based on sort of conversations with customers and kind of sort of what you've seen now and what we hearing as the impacts of COVID-19 might be accelerating things there. Does that sort of change your outlook for that business because, I think you sort of pivoted to more of the enterprise or a smaller footprint type deals, but does that now with the current environment, do you see the opportunity for you guys to potentially start doing larger deals in that market? Thanks.
Steve Smith: Yes, I would say that we've never pivoted. I mean, our core retail and scale leasing has really been the bedrock of our business model from the beginning, and we've went after those larger or hyperscale opportunities as they made sense for the campus, how they brought value and also brought a good return for the shareholders. So, that's always been in place and that continues to be in place and it's good to see improved results in Virginia. So, we'll continue to monitor it. The pipeline is reasonable and we'll continue to take that same approach and trying to go over those opportunities as they fit that category.
Operator: Our next question is from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.
Sami Badri: Hi. Thank you. My question is for Jeff. Jeff you made a comment regarding 2.5% of revenues of customers requesting deferrals. First I just want to make sure that, that is just deferrals for payments for standard grants and then those are deferred out for 30 to 60 days. But then more specifically, I don't know 2.5%, how much of that is small and mid size businesses? How much of that is more established enterprise? So, can you give us some color on the mix of going on in that 2.5%?
Jeff Finnin: You bet, Sami. So you're right, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've had some conversations with customers reaching out and asking for some level of relief or deferral of payments. The 2.5% is really a percentage of our overall revenue. So, keep in mind, rent, power, margins in interconnection revenue. So, that gives you an idea of whole picture. In terms of where we are with those, we've made good progress. As you look at the customer requests, about 50% of them were resolved by basically just allowing customers to defer 30 to 60 days. Keep in mind, a lot of those were needed as customers and companies transitioned to this different work environment and they just needed to facilitate different processes in order to facilitate payments, and those were very simple. And I would say most of those to be honest were small and medium sized companies. So, those are the companies that probably had the biggest hurdle to get over as they transitioned to a work-from-home environment.And then of the remaining customer request, about a third of them were still in flight. We have a couple of them that are, I would classify as medium-sized businesses that we're working through and we'll get those resolved over near time, and then about the remaining about 17% actually were denied request. Again, we've got to take them on a case-by-case basis making sure that it's valid, that it's needed and that percentage was denied. So, hopefully that helps give you some color commentary on that Sami.
Sami Badri: Yes, absolutely. And then, this is more of like a hardware question in terms of what's going on in your data centers. Have you seen customers either opt into more fiber interconnectivity rather than the former copper interconnectivity? Or is there any kind of mix change going on because all of a sudden people need a lot more bandwidth, -- a lot more broadband. Any kind of like hardware transition you're seeing in the cost connect or you have a business as usual stuff?
Jeff Finnin: To be honest, I think if you look at the first quarter data, the volume increases in our cross connect side of the business was 6.1%. And the composition of that was fairly consistent across the different products we have. The only thing that we've noticed in this occurred late in the quarter as you can expect, as a result of the COVID-19, we did see some smaller celebration as we got into March. And we've seen that in April. Time will tell in terms of whether that continues. And then we've also seen some customers where we've seen really IP peering traffic increases, as a result of just overall increase in volume of traffic. But, I don't as you saw in our guidance, we maintain our guidance on air connection revenue. Those are small and they round out kind of the intersection product. But that's what we've seen so far today.
Operator: Next question is coming from Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now live.
Nick Del Deo: You're getting close to opening the new Chicago data center. Can you talk a little bit about the discussions you're having these customers there, particularly on the scale sizes, that's a new product for you in that market?
Steve Smith: It's Steve, I'll take that. As far as a pipeline and discussions with customers, we have ongoing customers and our ongoing pipeline and discussions going on with customers there to expand in that side, we've actually had some networks that have now pop that side are in the process of popping that site. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks we now have a new native on ramp with one of the top Tier 1 cloud providers. It's now part of that campus. So that really, I think, bolsters the value of that model and really validates that approach. So, overall things continue on pace, and we're continuing to build a pipe there. But overall, it's solid, it's probably the best guidance I’ll give you.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, that's helpful. And Steve also in your prepared remarks, and you've talked about this in the past as well. You alluded to the need for your salesforce to kind of work more closely with outside solutions providers. I imagine that getting even more important in today's environment. Can you expand a bit upon the progress you've made on that front, and where things stand with a relationship stand relative to where you want them to be?
Steve Smith: Now, I think there's been to progress. It's been encouraging to see some of the results come through both in terms of traditional channel partners that have given us reach into new customers that we otherwise might not have had access to. So that's part of the value of that overall ecosystem is that they have this existing relationships and providing other services that, that we may not, or may have a harder time in reaching. So the reaching part of it. The depth is the other side of it, which is just providing a more full solution beyond co-location, the other services we have in our data center and that also has shown some good results and how we have been partnering with enterprises to transition, first of all, evaluate transition, stand up their environment in our data center, and then manage it going forward. So, that entire lifecycle is pretty complex and how we work with different partners to achieve that is dynamic. But we've been, I would say where we are in that continuum is just continuing to get our sales team better and better and how we engage in that process, as well as refining the mix of partners that we work with to ensure that they meet the standard that we're looking for.
Operator: The next questions is coming from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.
Eric Luebchow: Do you see any slowdown kind of quarter to date or over the last month and a half on new logo acquisitions, given many of the travel restrictions that many of your customers have underway or is it more or less businesses usual more virtual tours relative to physical tours and just decision making pretty much continuing on at the same pace next?
Steve Smith: I'll tell you that the pipeline for new logos continues to be strong and consistent is probably the clearest view I can give you. So, overall things seem to be progressing well. I would say that kudos to our engineering and marketing teams for putting together ways for customers continuing their buying cycle, which as you mentioned part of that is virtual tours. So, we work quickly at the beginning of this pandemic to try to look through what steps customers need to look at in order to continue their IT journey and part of that is a physical tour. So, we work very closely with those teams to develop virtual tours so that they can really see the environment, they would go into all the detail of the technical aspects and continue in that buying process. So, it's still evolving as but so far they seem to be holding well.
Eric Luebchow: And just one follow up for Jeff, you mentioned that your leverage would kind of temporarily trend above five times. I know you just issued $150 million of debt but curious if you would consider looking at any alternative sources here. If leverage kind of stays around that five times range, particularly when equity or any other sources such as capital recycling or joint JVs have stabilize assets. Thanks,
Jeff Finnin: Obviously those are all arrows in the quiver that could be utilized. I would just say, as you think about 2020, we've got plenty of liquidity to fully fund our business plan today and issuing equity at least in this environment. As we look at 2020 years and in our plans, However, having said that we continue to watch and monitor our stock price, as well as our leverage in assessing our liquidity needs. But the joint ventures items like that are always something we watch closely to just better understand the overall cost of capital what the best next source will be. But for 2020, I think we're in good shape to fully fund the business plan through our continued leverage and you'll watch it slowly creep up above five and then should start to moderate as we get to the second half of the year, as customers start to commence what's in our backlog plus new sales expected.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.
Jordan Sadler: Wanted to just see if I can get a characterization. Steve, maybe from you or from you, Paul, in terms of your customer cadence, what are customers looking for in terms of their overall demand for space today as opposed to maybe during the first quarter. Are you seeing any changes that are that are sort of pointing to sort of a reaction to the crisis?
Steve Smith: Hey, Jordan, this is Steve. I think it really varies and probably not a great answer but I'll give you a little more detail. So, those companies that are in this business are pretty good at it. And they know what they're looking for and how they build it out and what the process looks like. So, as I mentioned in my remarks, those are like streaming providers, content providers, cloud companies, those kinds of have professional data center buyers there. They are in some cases they've moved up a little bit, but they know what they buy and what they're looking for. And, I would say that, that is fairly uninterrupted if nothing, just as I mentioned and just re-validated by some of the demand that they're seeing.As far as the enterprises are concerned, I would say, that's where you see more variability because some of those customers are kind of [paralyzed] and just trying to figure this out, while they knew this, the need for more technology or being able to leverage technology in their business was a given. This has really shown a brighter light on that to where they now need to figure that out in order to survive or thrive. So, depending upon where they are in that maturity cycle is where you just see a lot of variability as to their ability to go from a need to actual buy. And so, some of that's still being shaken out right now, but you see it across the board. Hopefully that make sense.
Jordan Sadler: Yes. It does. I think it's helpful. And I guess, I'm not sure if that's what I answered the question entirely in terms of does the overall demand outlook look a little stronger today than it does 90 days ago is really the quick and dirty question that I'm really trying to understand. And I think investors are trying to capture. I don't know if you've got a quick one there.
Steve Smith: Yes, I would just say, the overall pipeline volume continues to be consistent to strong or I would say maybe even in better. How that materializes into actual closed deals and therefore revenue? I think that's the big unknown that we are all working through as to how this all shakes out. But so far, things appear to be positive.
Jordan Sadler: And then in terms of maybe supply chain, Paul, I'm curious, do you feel like you have the raw material in terms of availability of data center space necessary to sort of provide your customers with what all they might need in 2020? Or have you put any thought into increasing the capital spend or increasing the development in 2020?
Paul Szurek: So for the steps that we have in place, Jordan, essentially all of our OFEs has already purchased on site or in confirm tranches. And in terms of the parts and supplies you need that on our side to implement customers, so far everything is in good shape. We have a very good procurement team that proactively goes out and checks things and sources things. There have been one or two factory shut downs that if they were to continue for an extended period of time, we would have to find some alternative sources, and we're already contingently provisioning those, but, the vendors have confirmed us that they expect those factories to reopen shortly and assuming that happens, things should be okay.So, I would say, so far, everything looks fine, but it is giving a tremendous amount of constant and elevated attention from our data center operation, construction and procurement teams.
Jordan Sadler: What about sort of overall availability in terms of product? Like relative to what you originally underwrote for this year? Do you want to bring on more data center capacity sooner or not yet?
Paul Szurek: I think we're in good shape. I mean, we enter 2020 with our highest amount of available and near-term capacity that we've had in years, a growth capacity of 25% roughly, in our top five markets. So, our timing was either good or lucky, we'll take either one, but we've got adequate capacity to take on more demand, and that's what we see.
Jeff Finnin: And Jordan, I just add that. I think if you look at what's available today, we ended the quarter just shy of about 400,000 square feet. And obviously you can see what's coming online here near-term. When you look at our commencements, and overall absorption over the past several quarters, that gives us about a 1.5 to maybe 1.75 years worth of absorption, absence, any massive acceleration in terms of absorption. So, something we watch closely, but I guess where we sit today, just to echo Paul's comments, I don't think, we don't see a need to increase capital spend in 2020 at this point time.
Jordan Sadler: It's sound like Jeff will have you wanted to come back to the 2.5% of the total revenue, just there a bad debt expense or reserves taken the quarter, could you quantify that?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, you bet. Historically, our bad debt expense has been anywhere from about 10 basis points to 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. That was elevated a little bit this quarter up to about 45 basis points, in magnitude of overall dollars it's not significant, it was an increase of about $350,000 over our historical norm.As we went through the quarter, we took a very measured and conservative approach to looking at our reserves, just given the conversations we were having, and what's going on in the macro state of the environment today. So, overall bad debt expense for the quarter this year was about $700,000.I think it's important also to maybe just provide this additional commentary. When you look at overall cash collections for the quarter 99 plus percent of cash collections, compared to what was billed to our customers, so overall looks pretty good, comparatively speaking for sure.
Jordan Sadler: What about April, so for in terms of cash collections?
Jeff Finnin: When you look at April, where we are today, we're actually slightly ahead of where we were in the first quarter, given the relative moment in time and how many business days we are through the month. And we're ahead of where we were a year ago at this point as well. So that trend hasn't -- actually hasn't moderated. We feel very good about where we are from a cash collections standpoint, and we watch it every day. So overall, knock on wood, it continues to be very strong.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Nate Crossett from Berenberg. Your line is now live.
Nate Crossett: Lots been asked already, but maybe one for Jeff on cash renewals. What would there have been if you had stripped out churn in the quarter, just trying to get a sense of normalized pricing
Jeff Finnin: Yes now that the 1.47 cash rent growth, Nate that does not have any of the churn factored into it. So, it's already stripped out when we give that percentage so that 1.4 just really represents those customers that did renew in the quarter, and that were retained by us.
Nate Crossett: Okay, and then maybe just a question on SP9. I know you haven't given any formal dates, but when did those office tenants vacate and when can you kind of expect that project to get started?
Paul Szurek: So, I believe we've given notice now for all the office tenants to be gone and in fact they probably are all gone by now. We're still in the process of design and permitting, review and environmental reviews which are probably a little bit harder to predict right now than theynormally are. I would suspect that if the demand were there in Santa Clara, that we could probably start construction there in the middle of the latter half part of next year if we saw thator maybe even early next year.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Marino from Green Street advisors. Your line is now live. [Operator instructions] Our next question is coming from Richard Choe from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Richard Choe: I just wanted to ask about your kind of larger scale core retail co-location, it's really ramped up from 2 million kind of quarter average to 4 and now 6. How much of that is the thousands by dozens [indiscernible]. How much of that is being driven by customers or focus from courses?
Steve Smith: I'm not sure I understand the questions being driven from...
Richard Choe: If customer is asking for more space or you focus more on selling it in terms of retail co-location besides the deals?
Steve Smith: Yes, well I mean, what I guess in general, just as far as the overall model is concerned, we do target a mix across all of our campus to get to the yield that we're looking for each building and the overall campus. So, there is a mix of retail versus scale versus some hyperscale included in all of that. As it relates to customers and what they're buying today, the majority of our focus from a sales organization is really on out there finding new customers, that's Paramount, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks to bring in those new seeds that will hopefully grow and bear more fruit later. But that fruit that we've seen a lot of in this last quarter, in fact representing 94% of the total sales in Q1 was from existing customers. So, it's pretty easy to translate that into the scale business as well. So, that's where you see a lot of the growth there, but we do see some new logos that come in and we'll take a fair amount of that space as well.
Richard Choe: And to follow-up on the earlier pricing question, it looks like cash rent on renewals is the better long gap are we through the kind of negative comps so to speak for I guess rent growth and now we could see a kind of trend in the right direction or is there something ahead of us?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Richard, just pointed to our guidance I think for the full year, we've said we expect it to besomewhere between 0% and 2%. Obviously, this quarter we were happy to see the 1.4%. I think the thing that to point you to is, any time you get larger, customer renewals that could tend to drive the ultimate behavior. And as we saw this back half of last year, we had a couple of those in that were long-term customers in a couple markets where pricing have been a little bit compressed that led to that negative. But, I think for the full year, we expect it to be 0% to 2%. And obviously on our way to hitting that based on the first quarter results.
Operator: Thanks. The next question is from Jordan Sadler from KeyBank. Your line is now live.
Jordan Sadler: Sorry. I had a couple of quick follow-ups. So, on the SV8 release, can you sort of walk us through maybe the decision to pre-lease SV8 to ahead of maybe back filling SV7 if that's sort of like a timing difference or what have you ever sort of a configuration difference? And then maybe could you characterize the rate of the SV8 lease price versus the outbound rate on SV7 for us?
Steve Smith: Hey, Jordan. This is Steve. I'll give you just some more color on the decision to pre-lease the third phase in SV8 versus SV7. One of the, I think the key benefits that, we're really realizing now, especially in Santa Clara as well as Virginia for that matter is, our full campus model and the fact that we have multiple buildings in this case are 8 building, and now we have plans for our 9 building to provide optionality for us as to how we place customers in order to get the best mix within that building. So, as we look at SV8 versus SV7 and the space that's currently under lease and when that might roll-off versus co-location opportunities in SV8, it just turned out to be a better decision to place at this point. So, that basically leads SV7 for larger scale, hyperscale opportunities as they present themselves.
Jordan Sadler: And what about rate? How's it compare the new pre-lease versus the outbound lease on SV7? Are they comparable?
Jeff Finnin: Jordan, I think I'd add is, just as Steve said in his prepared remarks, pricing for the quarter was consistent a slightly ahead of where we've been on the trail. We generally like not to get out a lot of specificity around customer pricing. So appreciate, but I would look at overall pricing was fairly consistent with where we've been on the trail.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Could you give us interconnection bookings in the quarter by the way? My sense is that, that sounds like it was strong. Just curious if you guys had like a record level of bookings or just what the tempo was like.
Jeff Finnin: Yes. I'd mentioned earlier the overall increase in volume was 6.1% and I'd say that's been fairly consistent with where we've been over the past couple of quarters. That's a blend of all of our products. Fiber is obviously the largest contributor to those overall increases in volumes, and the increase in volume on fiber alone was right at 9%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Guarino from Green Street Advisors. Your line is now live.
David Guarino: A question I think for Steve, really, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that pricing was stable. And if I just look at the gap rent per square foot on your new lease signing right around 200 bucks per square foot, it's pretty consistent with what we've seen the last few quarters, in last few years really, which, I guess I just kind of surprised me and given just a higher contribution from retail color signing. So I guess my question is, really, is it fair to say that there's maybe a lack of pricing power receiving from retail colo, or maybe just like a mixed issue this quarter?
Steve Smith: So I was going to just guide you towards, I mean, it really becomes a mix. It's a mix of between markets. So different markets are priced differently and as you have more volume in one market versus the other. In this case, we had good volume in Virginia, which is relative to other markets like Santa Clara, it's less expensive. That's part of the equation as well as density in those markets as well. So, collectively pricing was in line. But if you look at it, you really have to take those two factors in consideration as the volume each market and then the density.
David Guarino: Okay. That's it, and then just for clarification, when you say stable are we referring maybe a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year? Just kind of curious the timeframe you're referring to?
Steve Smith: Year-over-year.
Operator: We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. Let's turn the floor back over to Paul for any further closing comments.
Paul Szurek: Thank you all for being on the call. I know it's a busy day for you and I know that all of you like everybody else in the country have had so many redo the way that you approach your business and produce your product and appreciate the extra efforts you put in to stay on top of the industry.I just recap a very grateful for where we are, our business model, our strategy, our team, our market, our new capacity our new products. And importantly, our adaptability have been key to us prospering and staying on track this quarter, and I think put us in a good position to stay on track for the future. And that's our goal. I would be remiss if I didn't again. Think deeply all of our colleagues in CoreSite who really have done an amazing job in the last six, seven weeks, making rapid adjustments to these changes and executing exceptionally well. They've done a great job and we're lucky to have been and to be working with you. So thank you to everyone. Hope everyone does well and stays well. And appreciate your interest in CoreSite.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-07 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the CoreSite Realty's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Carole Jorgensen, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.
Carole Jorgensen: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to CoreSite's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer.Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal security laws including statements addressing projections plans and future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC.Also on this conference call we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the simple information that is part of our full earnings release which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at coresite.com.With that I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today I'm going to cover our 2019 financial highlights and recap our 2019 priorities and key accomplishments. Jeff and Steve will follow with their respective discussions of financial and sales matters.Our 2019 financial results included new and expansion sales of $55 million, a record which nearly doubled the $27.7 million of annualized GAAP rent signed in 2018, operating revenue of $572.7 million, which grew 5.2% over 2018 and FFO per share of $5.10, an increase of $0.04 year-over-year.A year ago, I shared four priorities for 2019 translating new construction into more abundant sales, acquiring additional new logos, bringing new connectivity products online to increase sales and delivering a great customer experience and ongoing operational efficiencies. I'll review each of these relative to our 2019 accomplishments.We executed well in our first priority of translating new construction into higher sales. In 2019, we placed 224,000 Square feet of data centre capacity into service, including a 108,000 square feet for the first two phases of FDA, our ground up development in Santa Clara and 116,000 square feet of campus expansions in Reston, Los Angeles and Boston.As a result, we restored our available and developable capacity to 25% in our top five markets at the end of 2019, compared to 16% at the end of 2018. And we used the new capacity to achieve a record leasing year, including leasing 100% of the first two phases of FDA and 74% of LA3 phase one a year in advance of its expected completion in late Q3 of 2020.Our 2020 development pipeline continues to be strong as we expect to deliver at least 196,000 square feet of new projects, including two grand up developments CH2 in Chicago and LA3 in Los Angeles, the final phase of SV8 in Santa Clara and the data centre expansion at NY2 in our New York market. Importantly, as we shift in the latter half of 2020 to delivering new computer rooms, instead of completely new buildings, our agility and development yields should also increase.Our second priority of acquiring new logos also generated strong results. For the year we acquired 145 new logos, our highest in three years. Attracted valuable new strategic accounts in multiple markets and grew annualize GAAP rent from new logos by 50% over 2018. Steve will provide more color on these new logos and their attraction to our hybrid cloud friendly ecosystems.Our third priority was to bring new connectivity products online to increase sales, which we also executed well on in 2019. We increase participation 44% in the SDN based open cloud exchange format we launched in late 2018. We added inter-site service for connectivity between markets providing route and site diversity to enterprises. And we continue to expand our relationships with and offerings from key cloud providers with additional on campus edge cloud products and availability zones.Our fourth priority was to deliver a great customer experience and ongoing operational efficiencies. We achieved several major accomplishments in 2019 that significantly benefit our customers. We achieved an exceptional Eight 9's of power and cooling uptime for 2019 across our portfolio of data centers. This level of uptime is well above our Six 9's target and even higher above the Five 9's industry standard. High uptime is key to minimizing customer disruption and to increasing loyalty and is especially important for high performance hybrid cloud deployments.In addition to our long-term record of customer compliance certifications, we added a new NIST assessment that helps customers meet certain compliance regulations relating to federal government deployments, which helped us win some of our new logos in 2019. We again improved our power utilization effectiveness this year by 4.8% on a same-store basis compared to 2018. Our commitment to ongoing power efficiency improvements helps our customers and us to maintain margins, while also making us all more environmentally sustainable.Finally, we deployed a new product in our customer portal, which gives customers ongoing visibility into their operating environment to streamline the management of their CoreSite deployments. Our 2019 achievements reflect a capable and committed team of colleagues and continuing strong demand across our markets. Even Northern Virginia, which was slow for most of 2019, saw good traction in Q4 leasing. We did encounter some unusual headwinds in 2019, which offset some of our accomplishments.Our churn was well above our typical range, with heavier lease expirations and terminations from customers with business and service models affected by competition from the public cloud. Importantly, we believe we have significantly reduced our exposure to these types of customers. Meanwhile, abundant supply in Northern Virginia extended the normal J-curve on our new developments in that market by making large scale and hyper scale leases and attractive, therefore driving us to focus our leasing efforts near term on retail customers to preserve longer term returns.As we move into 2020, our priorities are to build on our 2019 successes. Our primary goal this year include number one, completing on time our new data centre buildings in Chicago and Los Angeles and translating that new capacity into sales that build on our market leading customer ecosystem in LA and create critical mass for our ecosystem in Chicago. Number two, improving on our strong 2019 performance and attracting major new enterprises to our hybrid cloud ecosystem.Number three, thoughtfully expanding our products to help enterprises with their hybrid and multi cloud needs. And number four, maintaining high levels of facility performance and customer service while continuing to invest in PUE improvements and other sustainability focused opportunities.In closing, we believe our diverse network and cloud dense campuses and the interoperability we enable for customers through our ongoing capacity growth, new connectivity products, and superior customer experience, position us well to benefit from the secular tailwind for data centre space and the demand for high performance hybrid cloud solutions.With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Paul. Today I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial performance, discuss our balance sheet, including our liquidity and leverage expectations and review our financial outlook and guidance for 2020.Looking at our financial results, for the full year, operating revenues grew 5.2% year-over-year, reflecting increases in new and expansion lease commencements of 46.8%, growth in interconnection revenue in line with our expectations, offset by elevated churn we experienced in 2019.General and administrative costs were $43.8 million reflecting 7.6% of revenue in 2019 compared to 7.4% in 2018. Net income was $2.05 per diluted share, a decrease of 7.7%. FFO per share was $5.10, an increase of $0.04 over 2018 and adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.8%, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year.For the quarter, operating revenues grew 5% year-over-year and approximately 1% sequentially. We commenced new and expansion leases of 86,000 square feet during the quarter, reflecting $16.6 million of annualized GAAP rent. Our sales backlog as of December 31, included $15.6 million of annualized GAAP rent for signed, but not yet commenced to leases or $19.8 million on a cash basis.We expect about 40% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the first half of 2020 with the remaining 60% in the second half of the year, weighted to the fourth quarter with completion of LA3 phase one. Adjusted EBITDA was $79 million for the quarter and increased 6% year-over-year and 1.4% sequentially.Moving to our balance sheet, in November, we amended our credit agreement, extending our near term maturities. We also extended the maturity date of our revolving credit facility to November 2023, with a one year extension option, and we added an additional $100 million of liquidity.We ended the year with $386 million of total liquidity, providing plenty of liquidity to fund our 2020 estimated data centre expansion plans, which includes $179 million of remaining construction costs for properties currently under development.Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 4.7 times at year end. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 4.5 times. As previously stated, we are comfortable with increasing leverage to five times.Based on our current development pipeline, and the related timing of capital deployment and commencements, we may temporarily trend higher than five times leverage in 2020, with the expectation of moderating leverage based on our backlog, and timing of commencements.I would now like to address our 2020 guidance. Let me start with some perspective on our outlook for 2020. Our mission for the last couple of years has been to increase our development pipeline to provide more capacity in our markets. We invested significant amounts of capital and we made substantial progress in 2019 on that objective.As a follow on, we've had a record leasing year which was enabled by our new capacity, and supports our view that we continue to benefit from secular tailwinds for our strategic edge markets. At the same time, we experienced elevated churn in the last half of the year, which we attribute to customer business models that were not as strong as they were historically. And we estimate that there's a minimal churn exposure in our remaining customer base of annualized GAAP rent for these types of customer use cases.We will be delivering additional capacity in 2020 to provide greater contiguous space allowing us to further meet market demand. We expect the benefits from this new capacity will be mostly back end loaded to Q3 and Q4 2020 given construction timing, and we will be focused on achieving pre-leasing of this capacity, including LA3 phase one, which was 74% leased at year end.That brings me to our 2020 guidance, which reflects our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. I will cover the key highlights of our 2020 guidance, but point you to our complete guidance on page 23 of our fourth quarter supplemental information for further details.Operating revenue is estimated to be $600 million to $610 million. Based on the midpoint of guidance, this represents a 5.6% year-over-year revenue growth, which reflects the timing of our development pipeline. Our guidance also reflects the impacts of elevated churn, which we've estimated to be 9% to 11% for the year, based on our current expectations related to customer timing. About 250 basis points of this expected churn is from one customer in the Santa Clara market. And given the current market dynamics we are optimistic and actively working to backfill this capacity.In terms of timing, we anticipate elevated churn in the first and fourth quarters related to customer relocations. Additionally, we expect cash rent growth on data centre renewals will be fairly consistent with 2019 at 0% to 2% growth for the full year.Interconnection revenue is estimated to be $80 million to $86 million, representing 9.6% growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $318 million to $324 million, and at the midpoint represents a 53.1% adjusted EBITDA margin, and 4.2% year-over-year growth.FFO is estimated to be $5.10 to $5. 20 per diluted share in operating unit, at the midpoint, this reflects growth consistent with 2019 or approximately 1%. And capital expenditures are estimated to decline to $225 million to $275 5 million, decreasing as expected from the approximate $400 million of capital spent in 2019. This includes $215 million to $250 million for data centre expansions, primarily including the completion of the ground up development at CH2 and LA3.With our investments in 2018 and 2019 and the initial phases of ground up development at VA3, SV8 and the anticipated 2020 completions of CH2 and LA3, it provides us the flexibility to bring on data centre expansions quickly and at higher returns in the future as we build out new computer rooms as needed within the existing buildings.In closing, we remain optimistic related to business drivers and secular tailwinds for our services remains strong. We're executing on our priorities to bring on capacity and translating it into increased sales opportunities. We also now have the capacity to accommodate additional growth should demand exceed what is assumed in our guidance. Our balance sheet is strong and we continue to stay in tune to the markets, opportunistically pushing out maturities and improving our borrowing position. And we believe we are well positioned for the long-term.With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Jeff and hello, everyone. I'll start off reviewing our quarterly sales results, and then talk further about our sales successes for the year and key drivers. We had a solid quarter of new and expansion sales, we delivered $6.6 million of annualized GAAP rent, primarily reflecting core enterprise leasing, including 31,000 square feet with an average annualized GAAP rate of $216 per square foot.Included in those results was a sizable multi market hybrid lease, leveraging the unique capabilities of our campus platform to support their dense architecture and complex interconnection requirements. As a second example of how business continues to evolve and leverage low latency, high performance technology, we believe this and others, like this customer, will provide additional interconnection opportunities, as well as stickiness to our platform.Winning new logos has been a key driver for us throughout 2019 and more an important contribution to these quarterly results. In the fourth quarter, we won 36 new logos. Two thirds of these new logos were enterprise customers, which included some notable strategic accounts.Turning to pricing, overall pricing in our markets is fairly stable, except for Northern Virginia where pricing is softer, especially on larger deals, as we've been saying for the last three to four quarters. We were pleased with our fourth quarter sales in Northern Virginia, which outpaced each of the prior three quarters on a volume basis.Renewals are another key aspect of releasing focus. During the fourth quarter, our customer renewals included, annualized GAAP rent of $21.9 million. Our renewals represented rent that decreased about 1% on a cash basis. Similar to last quarter, we had a few customer renewals negatively impact our cash flow growth for the quarter. This includes five customers that went excluded our cash mark-to-market was a positive 3.4%. Churn was 2.9% for the quarter in line with our expectations.Next, I'll share some highlights of our sales wins and the related business drivers. Our 2019 sales set a new record for the company with $55 million of new and expansion sales in annualized GAAP rent, which was nearly double our leasing at $27.7 million in 2018 and included retail leasing of $23.2 million, a 19% increase over 2018 and scale leasing of $31.8 million, nearly four times higher than $8.2 million in 2018.Driving our new and expansion sales this year were several key factors, including ongoing strength in new logo sales, strategic scale leasing, contribution from our channel sales and the overall secular tailwinds driving customers with hybrid and multi cloud needs to our data centers, which enrich and broaden our ecosystem, deepen our communities of interest and in turn create a network effect as our vertical markets became more diverse, while also more interconnected. All of which we believe helps to enhance our competitive mode and further differentiates our data centers.Let me touch on these drivers. Our new logo annualized GAAP rent was the highest in three years, increasing 50% over 2018 and 172% over 2017, reflecting substantial progress on a goal we set two years ago to attract high quality new customers that value our platform, which can help drive future growth as their IT needs evolve. Strategic scale leasing in 2019 was an important part of our results, which helped us with pre-leasing at two ground up developments in 2019, including 100% of SV8 first two phases, as well as 74% of LA3 phase one.Our channel sales were also an important driver, which increased to nearly 12% of our annualized GAAP rent in 2019. Importantly, overall absolute production from our channel sales grew 136% over 2018. As a final thought on key drivers, despite higher 2019 churn and that expected for 2020, on balance more enterprises are buying from us as demonstrated from our new logo additions. We also believe our increased sales in 2019 more accurately reflect our market position and mid-term growth opportunities as we continue to take advantage of our growth capacity program to compete more effectively in the marketplace.In closing, here's a recap on why we win and what drove our 2019 results. We are located in strong edge markets which uniquely positioned assets to serve highly connected workload environments. Customers in every segment are looking for help in their ever changing IT journey as they interconnect their hybrid cloud and multi cloud needs into a seamless service for their end customers as they deal with increasing data growth, heavy reliance on technology to develop new products and serve new customers and high performance needs with no room for latency.We continue to focus on winning and growing with these customers as we help them solve their IT challenges to address the changing dynamic needs of their industry and their business. We're pleased with our execution in 2019 and we look forward to further helping customers solve their IT challenges.With that operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you. Power as a percentage of rental revenue came down in the second half of 2019. And your revenue guidance for 2020, I think was below Street expectations. I'm curious if any of this has to do with the customer who's moving out of SV7, I think they may have actually already moved out and that space might be vacant. And that's what I'm thinking is the explanation, but I'm hoping could fill that in and give us some color on what the expectation is for power in 2020, that might be I'm thinking the delta between what the Street was expecting and what you guided to. And then secondly, as it relates to CapEx, I'm just curious what you've assumed for additional land purchases? Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Good morning, Colby. It's Jeff. Let me see if I can take your first question. You are correct, that some of that decrease in power revenue is directly attributable to the customer at SV7. And so as you think about 2020, I'd probably put it in simplistic terms from the standpoint given the guidance we've given you can see we've guided to an increase of revenue of about $32 million at the midpoint. We've also guided to interconnection revenue growth of about $8 million at the midpoint. The remaining $24 million, I would allocate that pro rata to what our full year 2019 is, the relative portions between rent to power, which is about two third rent, one third power, as you think about modeling and those components for 2020.In terms of CapEx, we have – obviously, the projects that are under development at this point in time. And well obviously, as we work through 2020 will have the need, hopefully in the opportunity to add additional development projects that will disclose at that point in time. At this point in time, we don't have any incremental land purchases in our guidance, not to say we're not looking, not to say we won't execute it on it, but at this point, none of that is embedded into the guidance for CapEx for 2020.
Colby Synesael: Okay, thank you.
Jeff Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Hi, so I just wanted to come back to the churn. It seemed like you had the guidance for the full year laid out last year, and we ended up at 11.1 just above the high end of the range. I'm kind of curious – I feel like you ended up a little bit higher for some reason, was there something that was missing? Or something that happened during the quarter that you didn't anticipate 90 days ago, that caused sort of an increase in that churn that you could sort of speak to? And I guess sort of similar question for 2020. I feel like you discussed last quarter on the call the normalized level of 7.5% to 8% plus a little extra from this customer move out. But it even seems like this customer move out exposure in the fourth quarter of '20, it feels like the full exposure of the customer as opposed to half of the exposure that customer. I can clarify that if that doesn't make sense.
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, Jordan, let me let me see if I can address that and, and see if we can clarify some things. But let me just start with the 2020 turn and then I'll come back and talk about the fourth quarter. As it relates to 2020 churn, what we tried to communicate last quarter is that we expect our churn in 2020 to recede back to its normal levels of call it 7.5% to 8% with the exception of the fact that we have to add another, as we just said, on the call 250 basis points related to that specific customer. So all in, you're going to have churn somewhere around 10%, which is what our guidance is. We tried to communicate that last quarter, and I think it got lost a little bit in the translation. And so I just want to make sure we're clear on that. So we expect midpoint at 10%, inclusive of 250 basis points from that one customer.
Jordan Sadler: Is it 250 in 4Q of '20 and 250 4Q of '21, Jeff?
Jeff Finnin: It's 250 in 4Q of 2020 and it'll be less in the fourth quarter of 2021. Just to give you an idea, it's five megawatts this year, four megawatts next year, just to give you an idea how that deployment will, will mature.
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
Jeff Finnin: And then as it relates to the fourth quarter, Jordan, obviously, the full year churn came in slightly ahead of and higher than what our guidance was. And I would point to two things. As it relates to our churn in 2019 and in 2020, we had some of that churn that we expected to ultimately take place in the fourth quarter of this year, so a little bit earlier than we anticipated. And then as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect to also have our churn in the first quarter of 2020 to be elevated. The full year, we still expect it to be in line with what we anticipated. But the timing associated with it got moved into the first quarter where some customers are moving out sooner than what we expected. As a result of that we expect first quarter churn to be somewhere around 325 to 375 basis points. And those two elements of some of that moving sooner than we anticipated are obviously weighing in on some of the guidance we've given for 2020.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, and then I have a bigger picture question for you, Paul. Is a combination I guess of the elevated churn lower releasing spreads, lower CapEx, particularly relative to the size of the company today and higher leverage they all seem to point to slower growth profile for your domestic data centre portfolio. So even though demand does seem like it's going to persist longer term for data centre space, is it fair to say that we've passed the point of maximum valuation and/or maximum growth for data centers in the US?
Paul Szurek: No. Jordan, it's a good question. It may seem odd, even contradictory that we have, for example record sales and record churn in the same year. But it makes sense if you view them as two sides of the same technology coin. Our record sales reflect new data business models and use cases that seem to have significant tailwinds behind them, as reflected in our growing new logo sales and to edge in major metro cloud sales and continuing growth from customers acquired in recent years. The churn primarily reflects business models that are waning and as Jeff mentioned, have become a significantly smaller part of our portfolio, which means that the amount of that churn should wane, especially to the extended has been accelerated into 2019 and 2020. And the lower CapEx just relates back to what I said in my prepared remarks that we are shifting from the need to build out entirely new buildings, which for over the last year plus this year into a phase where we're building out new computer rooms in existing buildings which we can do more quickly and have higher returns.So I mean, look, we're like every company that has grown, you get bigger, your denominator gets bigger and the industry has matured some in terms of new capital coming into the industry. But we still feel really good about our business model and our markets. We actually have more markets that we can grow in that we practically had or had as a practical matter a few years ago because we used to be highly dependent on three markets. We didn't have scale in Chicago and New Jersey was more urban for a few years. But now we're building scale in Chicago and New Jersey has really picked up as a nice enterprise market. So in terms of being able to deliver, I think, above standard growth to compared to the rest of the reed industry, and serving an industry with significant tailwinds. I still feel very optimistic. But we are impacted last year and this coming year by this accelerated churn from these older business models.
Jeff Finnin: And I guess the only other thing I would add there, Jordan is just to kind of point you back to some of the prepared remarks there as well. And just the overall demand characteristics that we've seen over the especially the last year and new customers coming to the platform we had more customers that are contributing more revenue, significantly more revenue and the average size of those customers is also significantly up. So I think as you look at the overall demand currents of the business and those customers adopting CoreSite it's actually stronger than ever.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Gutman: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. So it looks like at the 30,000 square feet leased McWhorter about half that was mostly the Virginia, Northern Virginia, DC market and some Denver, where was – it's hard to discern where the other half of that was markets wise. And second question on renewal pricing, the week renewal pricing or the recurring sort of low renewal pricing in 2020 is it – can you characterize it a little more? Is it broad number of customers, concentrated customer and early, middle, end of the year?
Steve Smith: Yeah, just to give you some perspective on the strongest markets, which kind of implies where some of that larger leasing came from were LA, Northern Virginia and New York, so hopefully that gives you a little bit more color as to where those leases came from. And the second part, your question there?
Robert Gutman: Just some color on the on the sort of muted renewal pricing this year, is it a few customers or is it sort of widespread, is it can be an even pace through the years, is it concentrated with one customer in the second half? I mean, just trying to figure out why, again, the renewal pricing is kind of weak.
Steve Smith: Yeah and it's pretty indicative. As I pointed out in the prepared remarks around Q4 leasing where we had a few customers that drug down our mark-to-market to a negative 1% and when you exclude those five customers, we actually had a positive 3.4% cash basis. So as we look at some of those ageing customers, those specific customers side with us back typically in the 2015 or prior era, and as they've been – had annual escalations in their rent and some of the pricing in those markets has been stable or in some cases decreased. Now, we've obviously had to make some adjustments that have brought down the overall expectation there. So there's a little bit of that sprinkled throughout the entire guidance, but that's also baked into the overall assumptions in guidance for 2020.
Robert Gutman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkins with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkins: Thanks. I got a couple. I was interested on the demand side any markets you would call out has seen elevated levels of current demand compared to last year? And then wanted to get kind of an update on the SV7 backfill situation, if you could provide us a little bit more color than what you've provided in the script if that's possible. And then finally, the customer relocations in 1Q and 4Q, which markets is it occurring in and are these customers that are moving to the cloud or just downsizing the right G going through consolidation? Or what are the factors that are leading to this occurrence? Thank you.
Paul Szurek: Okay. I mean, the markets where we've seen pickup in demand as we mentioned, the comment I made earlier, New York has really improved. Santa Clara continues to be strong. We obviously had strong demand in LA last year and frankly as Steve mentioned in his sales comments Virginia picked up in the fourth quarter. So those are those are the primary markets that are plus on the demand side. In terms of –
Jonathan Atkins: Sorry, I asked about the current demand, so it sounds like – so what you called out was kind of backward looking at that and then continuing prospectively into this year [indiscernible] market in terms of elevators at the end.
Paul Szurek: Yeah, based on our sales funnel, they still seem to be to be good markets. The relocations, primarily, that's the SV7 lease that you talked about. And as we mentioned in the past, that's just a customer that realized that their applications were not performance sensitive, didn't need to be in Santa Clara moved it to a lower cost market. And to a certain extent, the other relocation is the same kind of thing and it's out of Milpitas and they are making the same kind of cost rationalization decision. No, I mean all I can really say about the SV7 situation and Jon you know as well as anybody how the scale and hyper scale leasing in Santa Clara tends to come in lumps and weighs although they tend to come quarter-by-quarter with very significant amplitude between quarters as opposed to year-by-year. But our sales team is out there, working with our customers and working the market for backfills for that space. The customer itself as you know has hired a brokerage firm which worked for the customer and we don't have any control over what they do. Time will tell if their efforts are a distraction or if they provide value to the customer and indirectly to us. But so there's a good coverage out in the market of all the opportunities that are potentially out there to backfill that space before the end of the year.
Jonathan Atkins: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, when you look across your entire book of business, not just lease that we’re doing in 2020. How do you feel about mark-to-market risk and particularly in Northern Virginia?
Paul Szurek: So you could see how we feel about it that's baked into the guidance Jeff provided. I think it's harder to look beyond that because it really depends upon how supply and demand evolves in each of our markets. But I do believe it's a little bit like the churn thing that some of that will go away as we go past certain vintages of past leasing.
Nick Del Deo: Alright, got it and then Steve, you noted pretty significant growth in deals that came through the channel [technical difficulty]. Do you expect additional growth in channel deals in 2020 and beyond? And how do you think about the cost of acquiring revenue via the channel versus in house and minimizing potential channel conflict?
Steve Smith: I'll start with the last part of that question and get into the first part. It definitely is a balance right. So I do see value in extending the channel and we have some efforts internally to continue that growth and actually look at some other channels to broaden our reach and deepen our reach into key customers. As we look at the market, I think there's a great opportunity out there for the mid to large enterprise that is really wrestling with how they evolve their IT challenges and much of that involves partners to help them with that evolution. So working with those partners to make sure that we're part of that conversation is definitely part of the strategy. But it is balanced because in some cases that does come with cost associated with it. I would say that in some cases as well, it actually brings more value and stronger pricing, so it just kind of depends on the channel and how we manage that mix.
Nick Del Deo: Got it, it seems like a number your peers are leaning harder into the channel as well. Do you think that's just kind of a natural function of new enterprises being potential customers going forward or is there a risk that people become too heavily reliant on the channel?
Steve Smith: I do think it is balanced, right. And it is important to manage that risk or that mix rather, but I do think that it is such a complex environment out there for enterprises that they need help in managing that evolution of their IT strategy. And so as they look to partners, collocation is part of that and their cloud on ramps and how they bring that into a seamless architecture for their customers and their employees. So they need help doing that. And partners of various flavors are a key part of that, whether it's system integrators, resellers and otherwise. So I think that's a good opportunity to help our enterprises come to our platform, as well as a good opportunity for us to leverage kind of off payroll resources to help us find demand.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, got it. Thanks Steve.
Steve Smith: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Rollins: Hi thanks and good afternoon. I guess two things if I could. First, can you help frame if you take a look at the signed leases in 2019 and the $55 million of annualized rent, can you frame for us what the total opportunity was that you were pursuing in dollars in 2019? It gives us a relative sense. And are you finding that you're – that there's just maybe less available in the market for certain areas that you may want to fill? Or are you purposely moving away from those because of price over churns or some other factors? And then the second thing is just – if you take a step back, are there things in the portfolio that CoreSite would benefit from overtime larger sales force, different systems, certain geographies, are there certain things that you're finding could be incremental to pursue the growth and the wallet share opportunities that you're looking to achieve? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: So Michael, typically we don't give out specific sales forecasts. And so we probably shouldn't retroactively give out comparisons to sales forecast. But obviously, we're very happy with having a record sales year last year and what it tells us about the market. In terms of the latter part of your question, it's a really good question and kind of balances between strategy and execution, what you're doing, what we're doing, strategy is obviously really important. And we and our board take it seriously and we evaluate it regularly. But there's a – if you'll pardon my use of the expression, there's no Polish proverb to the effect that execution eats strategies lunch. And we have consistent as you pointed out we have put more focus on execution in the last few years. And I think you see some of that showing up in our results already. Well, we're building faster, better and more cost effectively.And capacity is crucial for sales. We're selling more effectively, including the difficult transition to selling hybrid cloud data centre solutions to enterprises who are relatively new to collocation, which shows up in our rising new logo sales. We've made agile changes in our product offerings that we've talked about that are specifically targeted to facilitating the customer journey to the hybrid cloud while easing the transition to a collocation model. Every one of those products has a purpose, making it easier to switch from one cloud to another, making it easier to provision redundancy for both resiliency and cloud SLAs, making it easier for companies to flatten their wand networks and be able to save significantly on their overall network costs as they move to a hybrid cloud model, and even giving them the same visibility into their collocation environment in terms of temperature, humidity, power and other features that they would have if they were using on premises data centre facilities.Again, easing that transition in that comfort level and going into collocation. So it's been a big area of focus for us. And frankly, I don't want to underestimate the importance of operational effectiveness. That's reflected in our vastly improved uptime record or significantly better PUE, which by the way is a frequent comment from enterprise customers moving into collocation is how much they are saving in terms of power costs and energy efficiency by moving into this environment, as well as the improved operating efficiencies at the data centre level. Again, these customers that may have some discomfort moving from on-perm to collocation and are putting a lot of their digital transformation into this hybrid cloud model. They really take a lot of comfort in those operational improvements.So again, wrapping up, and as I mentioned earlier, I think we have more markets that we can grow in now relative to what we had historically. And I'll reiterate what I've said on other calls that pound per pound or share per share, I think we have a higher concentration of exposure to strong growth markets than probably any of our peers. So we feel good about where we are. We continue to look at and evaluate other opportunities. But we believe these ongoing improvements in execution coupled with the tailwinds, we believe will be strong for a few years. Plus our scale and strong ecosystems in key markets is what makes us optimistic going forward and I think what is showing up in our sales levels.
Michael Rollins: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you. Looking at your annualized rent mix by customer type and surprisingly cloud revenues keep growing as a percentage of mix now at 33% of annualized revenues as of 4Q 2019. But if I look at the total enterprise rent or the other enterprise mix that moved to 44.6% on an annualized basis, it was actually down slightly 4Q '19 and it was down a little bit more on a sequential basis in 3Q '19. So could you just give us more color on why this is happening and should the enterprise footprint in your facility on an annualized revenue basis continue to decline as a percentage of total mix or should it be stabilizing around this 33% of annualized rent level?
Paul Szurek: Well, I think what you're saying Sami is just another data manifestation of the churn versus the sales. I believe and Jeff will correct me if I'm wrong, that the vast majority of the churn that we have been experiencing this year and last year that relates to these older business models has been categorized in the enterprise bucket.
Jeff Finnin: That's correct, yeah.
Paul Szurek: So as that bucket – those enterprises have shrunk as a percentage of our portfolio and eventually that churn wanes because we just don't have that much more left there. Theoretically, that should see – that should drive up the percentage of our share of enterprise with the caveat that as we saw last year, we are seeing more edge cloud use cases and cloud demand for availability zones in these high performance markets. So that may counterbalance the growth in our enterprises.
Steve Smith: And Sami, just to give you a little bit more color around the new logos that are buying from us, about 78% of them are enterprise versus 20% on cloud and a few new networks as well. So this gives you a bit of color as to where the new logos are coming from. And I do think you'll see some big lumps in cloud as that's how they buy.
Sami Badri: Got it and then just as a follow up, as you look at your interconnection revenue that keeps outpacing rent growth on a year-on-year basis. What is – would you say some of these new data manifestations or what is driving some of the acceleration that interconnection growth? And if you were to pinpoint on customer types, cloud, network and the other enterprise category, do you think that this is – which customer type is driving this and do you think that this could accelerate given the change in the data manifestation business types.
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, Sami let me give you some information related to that and see if Steve has anything else to follow more broadly. But in terms of that interconnection revenue growth, historically, as we've said, you get about two thirds of that revenue growth that come from pure increase in just the volume of the cross connect products. And then you get your other one third of that growth – really comes from those customers moving from a lower price product into a higher price product, as well as customers renew you get some price increases from those conversations, as well as on occasion, we look at what our list prices are for our various products. So that's what captures that remaining one third. As you think about going forward and where we're seeing some of that growth. It's important to look at ultimately, who our customers are ordering connections to and where we're seeing outpaced growth as compared to overall, those customers connected to our cloud customers. And that has been consistent for the last couple years. It's probably two to three times higher from a percentage basis then the overall growth and that just leads to a lot of the ecosystem that Steve and Paul have commented on, but anything else to add there Steve?
Steve Smith: I think you spelled it out well there, Jeff. When you think about enterprises connecting their hybrid architecture, as we've mentioned before, it really does need to be well connected in low latency fashion and with some of the upgrades that we've made in our OCX platform, as well as adding new on ramps to our campuses, that's helped facilitate all of that as well as some of the newer products that we provided as far as inter site capabilities and so forth. So we've seen some good uptick in that product as well.
Sami Badri: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Louthan: Great, thank you. I want to go back to the churn and just get a little more detail. You did mention that you have customers impacted going to public cloud, you think this is going to kind of slow down. Give us some more color on what – so what is that based on? Is that customer feedback or is there a particular vertical that you have the exposure to and why you're confident that after these next couple of quarters, were you calling out the elevated churn that this situation you found yourself in is going to correct itself?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, Frank, this is Jeff. I'll just provide a little bit of additional color around and hope it I hope it helps. We've obviously spent a lot of time, energy and effort in 2019 just continuing to peel back the onion and better understand some of the contributors to the churn and specifically related to some of those business models. And some of what we found, just to give you some color around it are – as an example, some of the resellers in the marketplace are an example of some of those business models that are not as strong today as they were historically and you saw some of that impacting our 2019 churn, some of its impact in 2020. And then there's other business models that rely heavily on the need and desire for burst capacity various times during the year. Some of those customers rely on the cloud; other customers rely on us in terms of adding capacity. And when you look at that those are the areas that have some exposure to migrating some or part of those to the cloud or to just that may not be as strong and may migrate out of out of our data centre entirely. When you look at and quantify what remaining exposure we have, as I commented on its much lower today than it has been historically, worried about 4% to 6% of our annualized rent that's embedded in our base today. That's why we get comfort that as we look beyond 2020, we believe those churn levels will recede back to the historical levels of 7.5% to 8%. And that's what we're modeling and why we continue to be optimistic in – and in relationship to some of the comments we've provided today. So hopefully that helps.
Frank Louthan: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Funk with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Funk: Yeah, thank you for taking the questions. A couple if I could. Yeah, going back to your comments on SV7, maybe just quickly, can you let us know what the expiring rent is there relative to market rates? Then I've got a follow up question after that one.
Paul Szurek: We try to not talk about customer specifics. We have mentioned in the past that this lease was signed when market conditions were fairly tight in Santa Clara, but they seem to be fairly tight in Santa Clara today as well. So it's really hard to predict.
Mike Funk: Great and then second one, you mentioned the – part of the move driver is a performance centric application maybe not being as performance centric as the customers thought. If you look at some of your higher profile locations, how good of visibility do you have into the use cases of your customers in those facilities, and maybe risk of further churn as customers look at the need to be paying peak rents versus being say hundred miles away.
Paul Szurek: As we've said in the past, there's always a dynamic related to this, because some customers just don't have that type of visibility, especially when they start – when they're in the startup phase and are scaling up. Having said that, we don't have – we've got this one big chunk, I don't believe that we have anything comparably sized that would be subject to this dynamic elsewhere in the portfolio.
Mike Funk: And maybe just kind of comment on some other comments in the quarter. So I guess Cummings on their call mentioned they project 5% to 10% decline in power generation because they're seeing some slippage of construction from '20 into '21. I think Google said they expect to have more of their spending budget allocated towards servers over data centers. So I mean, certainly some mixed commentary out there just about the kind of the strength of the data centre market and demand in general. I'd love to get your thoughts or commentary on that.
Paul Szurek: So again, we have a hard time seeing what's going on outside our markets and our customer activity, but from what we see demand still seems to be strong. Having said that, if you just look broadly from what we can all see there are markets that have low barriers to entry, saw significant private capital going to development platforms over the last two years and probably got over built. To some extent we've mentioned that in Northern Virginia and the spec construction that took place in 2018 and 2019, which appears to have abated quite a bit. So that may be part of it. And I think you've got similar dynamics going on in markets like Phoenix and Dallas and maybe other markets that are less visible to all of us, but that may be a part of it of what you're seeing there Michael. I don't know that we see any slowdown. I mean, you look at the overall growth trends of the major CSPs and they still seem to be in absolute terms growing the same volume year-over-year.
Mike Funk: And your comments imply that maybe some of the speculative capital is pulling back out of those markets that are coming in the last two years. I mean, in the markets where you do compete, are you seeing any kind of specific changes in competitor behavior, maybe less aggressive or more aggressive, any kind of change in behavior?
Paul Szurek: I mean, the only one where we've really seen a significant amount of that has been that we're in has been Northern Virginia, and I believe we have absolutely seen a pullback in privately funded speculative development. And I don't know, it's three or four of those development platforms have explicitly announced that they're not going to go forward with the spec development they're trying to mutate into a build to suit model.
Mike Funk: And then one final one, I appreciate of the time here. Just to clarify, so what is your exposure if any to some of the second tier data centre providers, I guess even guys like Flexential, Cyxtera, Internap, do you have any exposure there as far as leasing space?
Paul Szurek: I think that's covered in Jeff's comment about how our exposure to that kind of sector in general has declined. That has been in some respects, some of our churn – at least with respect to one of those companies. But again, we don't have much of that left.
Mike Funk: Right, that's in the – that's in the low single digits that you called out, the 46% of the business, right?
Paul Szurek: Exactly.
Mike Funk: That's great. Thanks for clarification.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Rasmussen with Stifel. Please proceed you’re your question.
Erik Rasmussen: Yeah, thank you. So in terms of your 2020 guidance, how should we think about the range of your revenue guidance 600 to 610? What can drive that to the lower end of that range? And then what are your thoughts about the company's ability to return to low double digit growth in possibly 2021.
Jeff Finnin: Hey, Eric, it's Jeff. Let me just give you some feedback on your first question related to revenue. And I think, similar to what Paul alluded to in his prepared remarks, we've got the capacity today as compared to the last couple of years, where I think it gives us the agility to compete more effectively, where we can see some of that demand. As some of the demand continues, I just think it gives us the capabilities to compete more effectively especially for some of those scale deals that might in the marketplace, so I think we're optimistic about that. But we got to see ultimately how the market evolves and where those opportunities arise. And as we've said, historically, those tend to be fairly lumpy. In terms of your question longer term the ability to return to double digit growth. I would say that as I look near term and call it the next two to three years, I think we're optimistic to get back to those high single digit growth rates, assuming we continue to execute on some of the priorities Paul laid out and assuming that the churn received back to those levels we've seen historically, and I think we're optimistic about getting back to those high single digit growth levels in the near term.
Paul Szurek: And I'd just add – remind you the comments I made earlier that we're bigger cut made, the denominator is bigger, the industry is more mature and yet relative to other reach sectors I think our prospects for recurring annual growth over the intermediate term are better than probably all the other ones I can think of or at least most of them I can think of. And I think that's a good business model.
Erik Rasmussen: Great, thanks and then VA3 seem to make a nice progress despite no scale deals in the quarter. Are you starting to see any movement where leasing dynamics are improving where you would potentially participate in this market when it comes to larger deals?
Steve Smith: Yeah, I would just say you're exactly right. I mean, our fourth quarter was actually the best quarter we've had in two years. And if you look at the makeup of that as you look at the overall numbers, it's all retail type of business, good enterprise business that we've been selling there. So we've been able to really sell effectively into our first phase there and now into second phase. And we have seen good pipeline and good results there. So we're optimistic. And as the opportunities present themselves both in retail and scale there is scale opportunities out there that value that type of platform that we both now have the capacity for, as well as the interconnection for those low latency applications that exist out there. We just – as we've said, in the past, we are trying to be diligent and pragmatic about those opportunities and ensure that they add value to the platform and deliver the returns that we expect.
Erik Rasmussen: Thanks and maybe just last, just following on that theme. Obviously, last year was a great year for your scale colo business. I mean, I think it was up 4X of what it was a prior year. Is that at where we are today – is this sort of an achievable target for the company this year or it's still too early to tell when we're waiting on sort of some of these key markets to come back?
Steve Smith: Well, as Jeff mentioned, we're optimistic about the growth opportunities that we see ahead of us. So it was a record year for us. And as you can back into the math of our current guidance, we have not expected that same type of result in our current sales mix for 2020. But we're optimistic about –that opportunity for us, but those deals and that leaking is very lumpy as we've depicted in the past and so trying to forecast that type of growth is challenging.
Erik Rasmussen: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Nate Crossett: Thanks, guys. A lot’s been answered already. But what are you guys expecting for interconnected pricing going forward? So it looks like MMR per Cabinet, the growth rate has trended down I believe. What's kind of a stabilized long-term growth rate that we should be assuming for that?
Jeff Finnin: Hey, Nate as you look at that, MRR per Cabi and you look at the results for the fourth quarter, really what contributed to the – I think it's 4.1% overall growth rate year-over-year is the largest contributor to that was the interconnection revenue growth. And historically we've been in that mid-single digits for that MRR per Cabi growth, I would expect that as we think about 2020 to be probably low single to mid-single – low to mid-single digits for 2020 and largely just because of the guidance we've given around our mark-to-market on renewals being a little bit lower for this year. So that's how I would think about it as you head into 2020 given where we are today.
Nate Crossett: Okay, and then you just go on that cash renewals, what was the 2020 guidance and then if you stripped out some of the larger roll downs? Or is it just across the board roll downs everywhere? Just trying to get a sense of normalized kind of pricing?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, I think it's – I would look at it from the perspective of what we experienced the last two quarters, which is both in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, we had a handful of customers, where we had some roll downs and Steve alluded to it in his prepared remarks and that's dependent upon their size, is dependent upon the term of their leases and more specific into the market, which those renewals are. Once you strip those out, the pricing in both third and fourth quarter was positive. I think it was 3.4% last year – I'm sorry, in fourth quarter and I think it was 2.8% as my recollection the third quarter. So that's the dynamic you're seeing. And I think that dynamic will continue as we go through 2020.
Paul Szurek: Jeff, would it be helpful for him to understand for every hundred basis points of churn or combination of churn in mark-to-market what that means in terms of dollars for us? And that falls to the bottom line?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah and I think – Nate, specifically, I think what Paul is alluding to is if you just think about our 2020 guidance and forecast, when you look at our churn from 2019, into the year 11.1%, if you get that down to a more normal range where we have been historically, so just strip, four percentage points off that to make the math easy. That type of elevated turn in '19 and that four percentage points adds another $12 million or roughly $0.25 per share to our bottom line in 2020. And I think that gives you an indication of some of those headwinds we're face headed in 2020. And it makes it real when you start to quantify it from that perspective. Is that what you're looking for?
Nate Crossett: Yeah, I mean, that's helpful. Just completely different topic now, what do you guys doing on the ESG front in terms of commitment to clean energy? What are the targets you guys have put out? And then maybe can you speak to what the financial impact would be or could be by going, for example, 100% green?
Paul Szurek: So, first of all, I just refer you to the ESG report that we put out every year. Our primary focus quite honestly has been on energy efficiency dollar for dollar, that's the largest impact on our and our customers' greenness. And frankly, we're already providing a lot of that greenness to customers. We know one customer for example that is able to qualify their new compute environment as one of the 10 greenest in the world just by moving into our more power efficient data centers from their on-premises deployment. So that's where our most of our focus has been, as we said in the past, we will purchase renewable energy, where it is allowed by the local utility and where the cost is basically competitive i.e., will not adversely impact our customers. And that tends to be the focus of our customers and that is what we have been – that's what we've accomplished. We also quite honestly encourage our utilities to generate and allocate other low carbon or non-carbon sources of generation. But because we don't have control over the power mix in our more regulated markets, we don't have any specific targets, but we do advocate for non-carbon and renewable generation sources and we do as often as they allow us and we can do so competitively purchase and wheel in those sources of energy.
Nate Crossett: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Choe: Hi, I just wanted to clarify on the annualized cash rent growth, the five customers and you mentioned the 2015 vintage, is this something that's going to last just through 2020? Or is it going to last for a few years since it just started in the second half of last year, just want to get a sense of how long you might be facing some of these roll downs going forward.
Paul Szurek: Yeah. So Richard, as I said, I think in response to an earlier question, it's hard to predict beyond 2020 because you don't know what supply and demand will be in each market and what that will mean for market pricing in each market. But we do believe it's like a lot of – like even the churn that we're experiencing is that you do go through these vintages and then eventually the effects of a certain vintage are two go away. And so we don't really have visibility beyond 2020. But if history is any guide, we should see some improvement in these areas going forward past 2020.
Jeff Finnin: Hey, Richard the only thing I'd add is on page 15 of the supplemental, just take a look also at our lease expiration table, it'll give you an idea what those explorations are on a per square foot and compare that to our current pricing. And then just monitor that as we move forward. I think it gives you a better idea maybe where that's going to be longer term.
Richard Choe: Got it, thank you.
Jeff Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks. I was – just want to dial in a second on California for a second. Could you give what you think market pricing is for scale in Santa Clara these days?
Steve Smith: Don't know if you want to – I don't know if there's – it's difficult to disclose what market pricing is. There are so many factors that go into a price for a given customer, depending upon their density, the size of the deployment, as well as their interconnection requirements. So that's why the moment of silence there because it's really difficult to kind of quantify a given market price given all those different factors.
Jordan Sadler: Is it feasible for a scale requirement to be better than $250 per K Debt [ph]?
Steve Smith: All in is that you're talking about?
Jordan Sadler: Yeah. Yeah.
Steve Smith: I guess it's –again, it just depends on the deployment. And there's a lot of different ways to configure a pricing parameter around a different given customer based off of their power draw, their density levels, all those different factors. So it's just challenging for me to even give you a straight answer.
Paul Szurek: And honestly, we encounter different dynamics than other companies do because our ecosystem has a different value than campuses that don't have the same density and diversity of customers who are using all the various services and want to do it with the lowest latency or zero latency in essence highest bandwidth, highest security for exchanging data. And so there's – it's like saying in other forms real estate what's the market price for space in particular mixed use development. A lot of that depends on what the mixed use development is compared to what other alternatives are.
Steve Smith: The only other thing I would just kind of – my comments with this, as you build a contractual agreement with a customer, there's a lot of factors that go into that part of it as size and density and so forth, but also expected power draw from that customer and how you manage that in relation to the rest of the draw of that computer room and the building. So it really is very challenging, really impossible to give you just a market price without knowing the exact parameters of the customer.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, and then this is for – maybe for Jeff. Jeff, have you thought about the potential exposure to Prop 13 for CoreSite?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah Jordan, we have looked at it over the last couple years. And basically when you look at that portion of our property tax expense that's isolated to specifically California and then more specifically, to those leases, where we do not have the ability to pass through the cost increases. It's limited to about $3.5 million that sits inside our portfolio that's equal to about 15% of our total property tax expense. And so what's important also about that –
Jordan Sadler: Your direct exposure to California property taxes is 3.5 million.
Jeff Finnin: For that portion in which we cannot pass cost increases to customers.
Jordan Sadler: Right, right.
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, that's correct, so 3.5 million and just to give you some other data around that I think helps as we look at this, the leases associated with that $3.5 million, they're on average ever remaining lease term about two and a half years. So obviously, we'll have plenty of opportunities near term to have – continue to have conversations about maintaining them and pricing it accordingly. But we're watching that closely and continue to monitor the overall effects to our business.
Paul Szurek: Jordon I'd only add that these are estimates based on what we believe the impact on property tax valuations would be, obviously, if this thing passes and it gets implemented, latter part of 2021 into 2022, some of those things will be determined more specifically.
Jordan Sadler: Right, right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, thanks for sticking on. So I just want to go back on the churn just in terms of – as you discussed last year it caught you by surprise and you have spent a lot of time digging into it. Jeff you peeling back the onion to really understand things. What have you done from an organizational perspective in terms of changes, in terms of reporting lines? Maybe people who've left the organization, the people who've joined the organization, I guess other than just sucking it up and having a lot of churn last year and this year, what are you doing differently to get the Street comfortable that this won't be a recurring problem?
Paul Szurek: Well, obviously Jeff and his team, as you've mentioned have done a lot more digging and analytics around the customer base. But we have also made it a high priority with all of our general managers in each market, working collaboratively with the sales team to have specific responsibilities and reporting around churn, risk, expectations, what's being done with respect to each customer. We've laid out a new rubric for determining how to address customers, when they come in at renewal and want a pricing change or something like that. When do we give that when do we not? The main focus being at least not be surprised by it, but having said that, I think even had those efforts been in place a year to 18 months ago or those new processes in place a year to 18 months ago, I don't think it would have changed our experience that much because quite honestly, a significant part of the – probably almost all of the unexpected churn is churn that really wasn't to be expected based on lease terms. Customers turned out before their lease term was up or even customers that at one stage in the discussions were planning to renew and then somewhere late in the game changed their mind. So we should be able to have – and I think the biggest comfort, as you said for the Street is just the fact that a lot of these business models have significantly declined, as Jeff described as a percentage of our portfolio.
Michael Bilerman: So I guess there's an element of the leasing decisions initially, right? So in the banking world, we're all familiar with claw backs when something you do turns out to have not been the right thing. And so I wonder just on your initial leasing is there changes there that need to be made in terms of the types of customers you're bringing into the portfolio that may have a higher risk of churn in the future, right. So are you making better leasing decisions today? And also, it sounds like you're taking it a lot seriously, trying to manage the outgoing customers from churn.
Paul Szurek: So I think we're making good leasing decisions today. I can't really say that they're better because when you look at some of these customers that came in and some of them have been in place for seven, eight, nine years, had vibrant business models at the time. And I think neither they nor most people really expected the significant disruption from cloud that started occurring four, five years ago. So that's always a part of this business. It's why we stress the importance of constantly acquiring new logos. That's why we've tried to build great relationships for edge cloud use cases with the major CSPs who are good to work with and are obviously good credits. So yeah, I think that as we work through these churn episodes we come out with a stronger portfolio. But I think the company has always been pretty careful about its leasing decisions and that shows up in our very low bad debt expenses.
Michael Bilerman: Right and just specifically on the 10% for next year, so it sounds like 370 in the first quarter, 250 for a specific tenant in the fourth quarter, which leaves about 380 spread over the second, third and fourth, just from what I guess I would call normal, so 120 basis points a quarter. Is that – just to make sure I got the math right, is that right?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, I think that's close Michael. I would say 350 was our midpoint for the first quarter, so you were just a little bit high there. But that might leave you about 400 basis points for the rest of the last three quarters.
Michael Bilerman: And is that – I guess, just knowing that number, that enough, right. I mean, I guess I'd be conservative enough on the level of an anticipated churn that normally would occur outside of what you know today, right. And it's going to be really high in the first quarter. What's to say that it won't stay that an elevated level through the second, third and fourth quarter, right?
Jeff Finnin: Right, yeah. No, it's obviously something we look at as we're going through all of our renewals over the next call it 24 months and it's our expectations that it would be lower. Typically on a typical quarter for us it's usually 1% to 2% is what we've seen historically. So those numbers don't sound out of line with what the remaining portion is.
Paul Szurek: And Michael, just as Jeff mentioned earlier, the higher churn in the first quarter is basically one customer and the higher churn in the fourth quarter is another customer. And absent that, we don't see any other customers of significant magnitude – of similar magnitude that are in that category.
Steve Smith: Obviously, closer to those quarters we get better visibility right.
Michael Bilerman: Okay, alright, thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to Paul Szurek for closing remarks.
Paul Szurek: Thank you. Thank you all for your time and your interest today. Those were a lot of good questions. I just like to wrap up by thanking my colleagues throughout the company for all the progress they've made and proactively and efficiently building new capacity, expanding our sales to new enterprise customers, and supporting customers with new connectivity products and exceptional operations. I'm very fortunate to work with this group of people. And just to recap, we believe the ongoing benefits of these improvements along with the secular tailwinds for our campuses should lead to a resurgence of growth if we outpaced churn for our expectations. We look forward to working to achieve that future and we hope all of you have a great day. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to CoreSite Realty's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Carole Jorgensen Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.
Carole Jorgensen: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to CoreSite's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek President and CEO; Jeff Finnin Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Smith Chief Revenue Officer. Before we begin I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal security laws including statements addressing projections plans and future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons.We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also on this conference call we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the simple information that is part of our full earnings release which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at coresite.com.With that I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm going to briefly cover financial highlights and then focus most of my time on how our strategic initiatives are playing out in light of today's market and technological environment. Jeff and Steve will then follow with their respective discussions of financial matters and sales results and trends. financial results for the quarter included operating revenue growth 4.1% year over year, SFO of $1 28 per share an increase of 2.4% year over year, and another strong quarter of sales at $14.4 million of annualized gap brand signed, including strong new logo revenue.This puts on track to comfortably achieve a record year of sales. Moving on to our strategy fulfillment. Secular demand for data center space is strong and we forecast this strength to continue in the foreseeable future. Our strategy capitalizes on this trend by expanding our extensive customer communities of enterprises networks and clouds who interoperate with each other in our campuses to serve businesses and consumers in major U.S. metropolitan markets.We fulfill this mission by providing capacity and connectivity including numerous cloud on-ramps and reliability and the ease of use in serving our customers. Our strategy starts with data center capacity. We reinvigorated our construction and development activities beginning in like 2016. And these activities are now delivering plentiful sellable capacity at our campuses, while building a pipeline for sustainable and agile capacity additions in two to three years. With the delivery of FDA phase one at the beginning of September. We are on track to deliver 224,000 square feet of new capacity this year, including phase two of SB eight in the fourth quarter.We are also on track to deliver an additional hundred 96,000 square feet of new capacity next year. They some of the projects currently under development, and we have a sustainable pipeline for future years. In our existing buildings we can quickly deliver incremental computering capacity of 550000 square feet at projected higher margins compared to new ground-up development. In other words we are shifting over the next 12 months from primarily ground-up development to primarily in-building development.And we also have 1 million square feet of space we believe we can develop on existing owned land at SV9 in Santa Clara NY2 in Secaucus New Jersey and in our Reston campus expansion making it easier to be shovel-ready when demand is strong.As our sales results show this additional capacity is crucial to meeting the customer demand we continue to see for community expansion and edge capacity in our major metro markets especially for enterprises seeking the highest performance and most cost-effective and most secure and reliable colocation solutions for hybrid cloud IT architectures. An example of the type of demand our new capacity is addressing is our pre-lease of LA3 Phase 1 for 74% of the space a year in advance of construction completion.Although we are in early stages we are also seeing a positive impact on colocation sales related to the additional connectivity products we offer to customers. These products are designed to accomplish several objectives for enterprises including enabling more efficient provisioning of cloud access redundancy and enabling flatter optimized wide area networks to reduce customer operating costs while maintaining significant edge deployments. As mentioned last quarter current market conditions have some temporary headwinds.Although the growth of public cloud has been a strong positive for us due to significant leasing to cloud providers and to the enterprises seeking powerful hybrid cloud solutions to a much lesser extent the trend has affected other sources of demand. We have higher-than-normal churn this year as a few longtime customers have gone through bankruptcy or out of business. To a lesser extent some customer use cases are transitioning to the cloud much of this fortunately cloud edge products located within our data centers.The strong secular data use trends have also drawn additional capital into the sector. While most of our markets are fairly well protected by high barriers to entry and our network-dense business model Northern Virginia continues to be [indiscernible]. We believe our record sales would be even higher if supply and demand in Northern Virginia were more balanced. We have however existing and potential capacity in Northern Virginia for when the market there strengthens.And of course new multi-tenant development is generally a modest drag on earnings while pretty stabilized but the available capacity enables us to meet fast emerging customer needs and strengthen our campuses. On balance we continue to believe the long-term data center demand trends are very positive for our campuses and will generally reward us for staying abreast of capacity and product needs. Therefore we are confident that our major market network-dense proactive development and product optimization strategies will provide sustainable growth.With that I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks Paul and hello everyone. Turning to our financial results for the quarter. Total operating revenues increased 4.1% year-over-year and 1.4% sequentially primarily due to increased rental revenue related to new and expansion lease commencements and growth in interconnection revenue. We commenced 78000 square feet of new and expansion leases for $15.7 million of annualized GAAP rent at an annualized GAAP rate of $200 per square foot and our sales backlog as of September 30 included $25.3 million of annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases or $28.4 million on a cash basis.We expect a majority of the GAAP backlog to commence in the next 2 quarters and the remaining amount in Q4 2020 following completion of LA3 Phase 1. Total property operating expenses increased 2.9% year-over-year primarily as a result of increases in rent expense from recently completed developments in our L.A. and D.C. markets where we leased some of our facilities. These property operating expenses also increased 4.3% sequentially including the impact of increased rent expense I just mentioned and other increases resulting from seasonal power costs and other property operating expenses partially offset by a property tax refund.General and administrative costs for the quarter were relatively flat year-over-year and decreased sequentially. This included the impact of a successful outcome related to a trial in Q3 including a minimum expected legal expense recovery of approximately $3 million minimizing the negative impact from legal fees this quarter to $0.01 per share. Turning to adjusted EBITDA net income and FFO.Adjusted EBITDA was $77.9 million reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.6% and a 53.8% adjusted EBITDA margin. Net income per diluted common share was $0.47 per share and FFO was $1.28 per diluted share a $0.03 increase year-over-year and a $0.01 increase sequentially. Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $388 million in liquidity including $383 million available under the revolver and $5 million in cash. Leverage at quarter end was 4.4x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA.We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements including our anticipated development activity over the next 12 months primarily through utilization of our credit facility. We also anticipate addressing our 2020 and 2021 debt maturities before the end of this year by working with our lending partners and our credit facility to extend the maturity dates.Next I'll recap some highlights of our first nine months of 2019. As Paul mentioned we expect to bring more capacity to the market by adding 224000 square feet into service in 2019. This new capacity provides us an opportunity for leasing and revenue growth by providing larger contiguous space for our sales team to compete for a larger set of customers' needs. This expanded capacity has led to new leasing year-to-date of more than $48 million annualized GAAP rent. That's more than doubled the new leasing in the first nine months of 2018. And our sales team will continue working hard during the fourth quarter to maintain our momentum.Next, I'd like to address churn. Last quarter, we raised our guidance of annual revenue churn to a range of nine to 11% for 2019, which compares to our typical historical range of seven and a half to 8%. churn has resulted from various drivers over the years, primarily from integration related to m&a activities. Bankrupt These and end of life applications. Last quarter, we identified additional churn expected for the last half of 2019. Since our last call we used a cross-functional team to further analyze our customer portfolio looking for emerging trends vulnerabilities and areas to address.This review identified customer characteristics to better identify growth opportunities and risk of churn and was a valuable process that our sales and customer service teams will use to augment our existing practices. Based on our historical trends and characteristics of churn our remaining exposure to customer deployments with similar characteristics is not a meaningful percentage of our embedded base and we expect almost all categories of churn to abate next year. However we have sizable capacity relocating from the Bay Area market over the next two years and we are optimistic about our ability to release this capacity due to the strength of current market dynamics. Turning to our work ahead.We have accomplished a great deal in the first nine months and we are focused on continuing that momentum. Our scale pre-leasing executed at SV8 and LA3 in the second and third quarters respectively were key objectives for the organization and helps derisk our development activity. As Paul mentioned we've delivered strong leasing results without the contribution we expected in Northern Virginia and still expect a strong finish to the year. As it relates to 2020 we will provide a detailed annual guidance on our fourth quarter call.However I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. We feel good about the fundamentals of the business and our progress on our property development and pre-leasing. To provide some perspective as you update your models for 2020 and beyond our accomplishments and challenges versus one year ago includes some timing considerations. First our property development at SV8 was delivered as planned.However Phase 1 of LA3 and CH2 while also dressing well are behind our time line from a year ago due to issues like permitting and other impacts. Second as a result of these changes leasing of these properties also looks different from a year ago. We executed more pre-leasing than planned at SV8 pushed out the timing related to lease commencements at Phase 1 of LA3 and CH2 and scale leasing in Northern Virginia has been lower than expected. And lastly our churn from 2019 will have carryover impacts on 2020 as we work to release our data center capacity. Before I hand off to Steve I want to recap.We are executing on our previously discussed priorities related to bringing on capacity and increasing leasing. The business drivers and secular tailwinds from our services are strong and we believe we are well positioned for the long term.With that I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks Jeff. Today I'll start off with a summary of our quarterly sales results and then talk more about some sales wins and the business drivers behind them. Moving to our sales. We executed another very strong quarter of sales which is back-to-back with last quarter's highest sales quarter of the company. We delivered $14.4 million of annualized GAAP rent for new and expansion sales including $4.5 million of core retail colocation sales $9.9 million of scale leasing including a large pre-lease at LA3 as well as other scale leasing and some impressive new logo wins with opportunities for future growth.Turning to a few highlights of our sales. They included 73000 net rentable square feet reflecting an average annualized GAAP rate of $197 per square foot and core retail colocation sales included pricing on a per kilowatt basis in line with our trailing 12-month average. Looking at new logos we won 36 new logos that reflect total annualized GAAP rent approaching 3x our trailing 12-month average and include a weighted average contract term of 77 months versus the trailing 12-month average of 46 months. We're excited about the quality of these new logos and believe they will help drive future growth as their IT needs evolve. Attracting and winning new customers that value our platform remains a key area of focus and it's great to see it continuing to bear fruit.Renewals are another key aspect of our leasing focus. During the third quarter our customer renewals included annualized GAAP rent of $20.4 million reflecting growing base of business and strong customer relationships. Our renewals represented rent growth of 4.2% on a GAAP basis and a decrease of 2.2% on a cash basis which was impacted by the renewal of 3 long-term scale customers and excluding these 3 customers the remaining renewal volume reflected a positive 2.8% cash rent growth.Churn was 3.1% as anticipated. Next I'll share some highlights of our sales wins and the related business drivers. As Paul mentioned we are located in strong edge markets with uniquely positioned assets to serve highly connected workload environments. Customers in every segment are looking for help in their ever-changing IT journey as they interconnect their hybrid cloud and multi-cloud needs into seamless service for their end customers. Today's IT environment has greater innovation and less tolerance than ever for poor performance or latency with our applications.These factors seem to be only increasing in importance. Here's a glimpse of a few wins across sectors we signed this quarter: a multinational technology company specializing in cloud-related services that are latency-sensitive leasing space in our LA market 1 of the top connected data centers in the world; a global pharma organization further introducing and leveraging technology across their business units to serve their diverse corporate and R&D needs locating in our Santa Clara market; a multinational company with businesses in consumer professional electronics gaming entertainment and financial services in our L.A. market where performance is critical in supporting their gaming end users; and a large electronics company in our Boston market working to solve the needs of their multi-cloud environment.All of these customers are in different industries and deployed across various markets that are all leveraging the value of our interconnected platform to drive their business. Each are experiencing increasing data growth heavy reliance on technology to develop new products and serve new customers high-performance needs with no room for latency and all of them rely on or support a hybrid multi-cloud environment.Technology continues to move at a frenetic pace and we continue to focus on winning and growing with these customers as we help them solve their IT challenges to address the changing dynamic needs of their industry and their business. We're pleased with our execution for the quarter and we look forward to further helping customers solve their IT challenges.With that operator we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jonathan Atkin RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. So had a question about Jeff's comments with regard to Santa Clara. So the sublease capacity that's being marketed now at SV7 for 9 megawatts you refer to that as a relocation but is that going to be a customer that leaves your roles entirely? Or are they relocating to a different core site market? I'm assuming it's the former.
Paul Szurek: Jonathan let me answer that. First of all there's -- I don't think there's really any sublease capacity out there. There may be some misunderstanding in the local market. But as Jeff mentioned it is a tenant that is moving their operations to different areas not to our facilities. That lease expires partly toward the end of 2020 a little over half toward the end of 2020 and the rest toward the end of 2021. And as we've seen in similar situations in that market in prior years we like having the ramp to go and release that space and hopefully help the tenant out a little bit and get somebody in there earlier. But in that market we're glad to have that capacity.
Jonathan Atkin: Well the tenant is marketing at a subleased space. And so I guess maybe just semantics but this would be elevated churn for next year at least in that market.
Paul Szurek: So Jonathan I don't want to get into any misunderstandings out there but there is no right to remarket that space as sublease space.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay. But you mentioned the expirations some in '20 and some in '21 and I hear you about Santa Clara being a very strong market tight supply very strong pricing trends. But is it fair to say that you could see churn in the market over those two years? But your expectation is that you refill it and perhaps accretively. Is that a fair way to characterize it?
Paul Szurek: I think it's fair. Again pricing and the ultimate replacement deployments will need to be worked out and whether that is slightly accretive or not we'll work out. But you've got the gist of my comments correct which is it's a good data center it's good space. We believe there's good demand in the market for it. And we are working proactively to retenant that.
Jonathan Atkin: Two more questions then or a question related to kind of new markets. So Council Bluffs is a market that CyrusOne just indicated that they want to build capacity for enterprise sort of hybrid cloud applications. And I was interested in kind of that how you continue to look at growth opportunities domestically into new markets and whether those types of opportunities are interesting to you. And then secondly there's been very strong leasing in Europe and then there's been a recent M&A transaction announced there. And I know you've addressed this in many meetings as has your predecessor but just an update on your thoughts on international expansion.
Paul Szurek: So we do continually look for new markets. And I'm guessing at some point down the road we will enter new markets. But so far we just haven't found the right mix. We do very very strongly prefer and I'd be surprised if we did anything outside of a major metropolitan market. And we want to be able to deploy our business model which as you know depends very much on network density. So it's a high bar to jump but we keep looking for it. Our views on international haven't changed and we believe that the model that we pursued of going deeper and building larger communities and greater scale in major U.S. metro markets relative to the size of our company continues to provide us with as much percentage growth opportunity as I think is appropriate or needed for this property category.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Jordan Sadler KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Katie Noel: Hi, good morning. This is Katie on for Jordan. You kind of touched upon this in your prepared remarks a little bit. Just want to go back to churn. It was 3% in the quarter 10% at the midpoint for the year. Then you talked about this space to release in SV7. How should we think about churn on a go-forward basis for next year? Do you anticipate churn coming back down to your historical 6% to 8% levels?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. As I said a little bit in my prepared remarks based on the analysis we did and the items that led to our churn we expect some of those items to abate if not -- most of those items to abate as we go through 2020. However some portion of that decrease is going to be offset with the item Paul just alluded to some of the churn that will take place in Q4 2020. As Paul alluded we've got time to work on backfilling that space which is what we're planning on doing. But that's where we're headed for 2020.
Steve Smith: And I would just add Katie that we're already actively discussing that space with potential prospects right now. So activity is strong. And as you know that market is pretty tight right now so that's a good thing for us.
Katie Noel: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Colby Synesael Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you Two if I may. Jeff in the past you guys had talked about getting to potentially double-digit growth in 2020. And it feels like in the last few quarters you guys may have walked that back and some of the comments you just mentioned now in terms of timing delays and then also the full impact of churn in '20 versus what kind of rolled through in 2019. Just curious if you can give us an update on whether or not that double digits is achievable. And then secondly just going back to the California.This is one of the first times I think at least that I'm aware of a large 9-megawatt customer looking to vacate a third-party data center. And I'm just curious what your observations are around this trend and whether you think it's very specific to this customer or it's part of something broader going on. And maybe as it relates to California with the rolling blackouts with the fires do you think that that market's going to sustain the strategic value that it has had for now many years?
Jeff Finnin: Let me address your first question and then I'll have Paul provide some commentary on the second. But as you mentioned I did provide some items of reference in my prepared remarks as you guys look at updating models for 2020 and beyond. And as I noticed or as I mentioned primarily related to development completions that are further outlined in our supplemental and then as you guys think about the timing of leasing and commencements.In addition we've highlighted some of the Northern Virginia market challenges as well as some of the 2019 churn. So we still have a lot to accomplish before year-end and that will provide us some better visibility into 2020. But I think it is fair to say when we provided that guidance one year ago a lot has changed. And we do not expect to hit double-digit growth for 2020. And so hopefully that helps clear up that question from that perspective.
Paul Szurek: Colby this is actually the second time we've had a customer of this relative magnitude move out of that very same market. The last time was five, six, seven years ago and the circumstances were very similar. And I think we and all of our peers have seen this to some extent that the so-called unicorns in their early stages ramp up very quickly in markets like this. And then as they become more mature they start rationalizing things and moving things out as they discover more precisely what their latency needs are.Meanwhile that market has continued to grow with much more mature and established business models and operations that are however leveraging new technology products especially cloud-type products. And we see that continuing notwithstanding the factors that you've mentioned which as you know haven't really affected this particular area as much of us. Unfortunately some outlying areas are. And I know we all feel for the people in those areas. But so far we continue to see very strong demand and need for space in this market and expect that to continue.
Colby Synesael: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Frank Louthan Raymond James. please proceed with your question.
Frank Louthan: Great, thank you. Just wanted to touch on the churn in Boston. I assume that was similar to the churn that you discussed last quarter it was kind of expected. Any thoughts on that being released? And then to the commentary about at the steady pricing for KW. In your conversations you're having with clients now do you expect that to persist? How does sort of the next few quarters of pricing look on that basis?
Jeff Finnin: Let me address the first one and then I'll hand it off to Steve for the second question. But you're correct the decrease in occupancy in Boston is directly attributable to that churn an event that we've been mentioning the last couple of quarters. And so that occurred as we anticipated. They vacated that space in August. And that computer room is ready to be released with very little if any additional capital needed to get that ready for lease. Steve on the second?
Steve Smith: Yes just to carry on with the Boston conversation. While it does give us more space back there we are pleased with the market dynamics in Boston and have shown some good sales results and also see some pipeline there. So we're encouraged with what we see in Boston. As far as pricing on a per kilowatt basis as we mentioned in the comments earlier if they -- on balance they remain in check for most of our markets.And as we mentioned on prior calls probably the only market that we've seen any material erosion has been the Virginia market. And even that we feel like it's pretty much stabilized and look to see some of that come back. And given our retail and enterprise sectors there it's been pretty consistent over time. So overall things seem to be holding pretty well.
Frank Louthan: Right, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Erik Rasmussen Stifel. please proceed with your question.
Erik Rasmussen: Yes, thanks. On the leasing that again was quite healthy. And over the last 12 -- you've now outperformed your 12-month average. Scale was the -- sort of the primary driver there with steady sort of retail color we'll call it. But are you seeing a sort of a change in your business that would suggest that you may continue to see sort of larger deals come through?
Steve Smith: Well as Paul mentioned in his remarks as we bring on more capacity that does open up the market for us to sell larger opportunities. So that's a good thing for us and we've seen some of the results of that already. And I think as you look at the average size deal and that -- more contribution from new logos and just the overall maturity of the market where you see more mid- to large enterprises now maturing to the point where they're adopting more multi-cloud and hybrid cloud-type of environments that opens it up to on average larger opportunities for us. So we feel like with our expansions in different markets that well positions us for that opportunity.
Erik Rasmussen: And maybe just then a follow-on with that then. So in terms of -- what does this mean for like for pricing and cash rent growth? Obviously the scale and depending on who that customer base is that could have different dynamics. How do you plan to balance this?
Steve Smith: Well we're pretty judicious about how we approach each opportunity and especially as they get larger we do a lot of diligence around pricing and the yields that they deliver to that market and that specific facility. So we work through both timing as well as size and pricing and try to make sure that we make the right decisions to deliver the yields that we expect for ourselves and our shareholders are expecting of us. So we continue to balance that.
Erik Rasmussen: Hey, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Del Deo MoffettNathanson. please proceed with your question.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, Maybe first 1 for Steve. You've had a lot of success landing on-ramps for call it Tier 1 CSPs like AWS and Microsoft. You oftentimes highlight that in your presentations. How would you characterize your degree of success with call it Tier 2 or more specialized on-ramps? And do you feel like there are opportunities to grow that part of the business?
Steve Smith: Yes we have seen good success there. We don't necessarily publicly state those very often and maybe we should do more of that. Obviously most of the cloud business that happens there especially public cloud probably 80% of it happens among 4 players. So that's where the real focus is and that's where I think a lot of our customers are focused.But there is a lot of other services that are delivering those same type of on-ramps and we'll -- I expect to see more of those in the future as connectivity and low latency demands are driving better performance out of those platforms and customers are looking for better performance out of them that those on-ramps that deliver that performance will become even more important. So we pursue all of those and adding those to our platform and to our Open Cloud Exchange continues to be a focus and we've been successful but I always like to see more.
Nick Del Deo: Okay good. And I guess sort of back to the Bay Area you guys seem pretty confident you'll be able to release any space that you need to at attractive rents. Can you comment on that in the context of the number of projects that are currently under way by other market participants in the Bay Area and likely to come online in the coming years?
Paul Szurek: So predicting when any or all of those projects will come online is kind of a perfect science in that market. But we don't believe any meaningful capacity is going to come online before this space is going to be released.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Rollins Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Rollins: I Good morning. So just as a follow-up to some of the hyperscale leases that you repriced downward in the quarter. Do you have a sense for what percent of leases or the rent today might be subject to reductions in the future either because of the deployment size or the customer size just to try to ring-fence the future risk over time on pricing within the portfolio?
Jeff Finnin: Hey Michael were you -- let me just clarify were you asking on the entire portfolio or a market specifically?
Michael Rollins: Just the broader portfolio please?
Paul Szurek: Yes. So first of all the 3 leases where we had the significant mark-to-market I'm not sure they would -- they'd classify more of scale not hyperscale. And as we look at our portfolio and Jeff can correct me if I'm wrong we don't see a meaningful amount of that -- of customers in those circumstances. There's always going to be some. Every quarter we have some mark-to-markets that are negative and most of them are positive. And so most quarters that result is positive. And we don't see anything in our portfolio that would significantly change that.
Jeff Finnin: Michael just 2 other things to think about as you're looking forward related to that. But if I just look at 2020 and had to give you an estimate on where I think that mark-to-market would go I think it's going to be fairly consistent with maybe a little less than where we're going to finish this year. As you probably saw we're taking that -- we took it down to 1% to 2% mark-to-market for the full year.So keep that in mind as you think about 2020. And then the only other thing I'd have you look at is our lease expiration table which you're familiar with on 15. I think it's important to just look at the pricing that we provide. When those leases expire on a per square foot basis at least gives you some idea where those are as compared to where we're signing renewals at new and expansion leases. Just to give -- another data point to think about.
Steve Smith: Yes. And I would just -- I'll also just offer a little bit of color which is as we become more mature as an organization and our customer base becomes more mature we just evaluate each customer as they become up for renewal and ensure that we are market that we look to retain them and look at what our other alternatives are in that market based on available capacity and overall strength in demand and so forth. So overall we don't see a major risk there but we look at all those independently.
Michael Rollins: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Funk Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Funk: Yes, thank you for taking the question a couple if I may. You mentioned before that the churn and kind of throwing some resources out that to analyze the portfolio. Hope you can give some more detail kind of on what your findings were maybe ways that you found you can better manage clients. I think you also mentioned that it's part of the analysis that you maybe saw some opportunity to actually expand the business you're doing with existing customers in addition to predicting when they might churn.
Steve Smith: Sure. Just to give you a little bit of color on what we did in conjunction with a pretty broad team here within CoreSite we took a look at the last five years of data in our customers and just the behavior of those customers and work through any kind of correlation of growth as well as risk of churn and identified a small segment that might have some additional risk there. It didn't appear to be material as Jeff mentioned in his remarks but we did identify it. It allowed us to also just build a better view as to which customers are likely to grow with us as well and establish a bit of a more formal and deeper process around how we engage with those customers to give them a better experience give us better visibility into the likelihood of them growing or churning and make sure that we have the right resources around them to maximize that opportunity.
Mike Funk: Great. And then one more quick one if I could. You mentioned -- and thank you for the update that you don't expect to hit the double-digit growth in 2020. I think your comment worth a lot of change. Maybe just expand on that a bit on the different factors that have changed over the course of the past 12 months that are affecting your shift in view.
Jeff Finnin: Yes Mike. I think the churn that we've talked about obviously contributed to that. Northern Virginia contributed to that. And then a large part of what contributed to that is the timing associated with our development completions. As we thought about one year ago from where we are -- a year ago from where we are today we are obviously making a lot of estimates and assumptions related to that.And the timing has really been modified due to working through that development process which as Paul has alluded to this year it can be challenging. You manage it as best you can but you just don't know the ultimate outcome. So that's contributing to a lot of it. I think from our perspective as you think about 2020 the back half of 2020 where you're seeing a lot of our development being completed some of which has been pre-leased a lot which we will still work on to lease is where we're focused on trying to exit 2020 at a higher growth rate given what we think we can accomplish in the next 12 to 15 months. And that's our objective as we look out forward from here.
Paul Szurek: Yes Mike I'd only add briefly that as we transition out of this phase of a lot of ground-up development by the end of next year almost all of our new development the vast majority of it will be just building out in new buildings which is much easier to predict from a timing standpoint.
Mike Funk: Thank you guys very much for the questions and see you guys in a few weeks at a rate.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks right.Our next question is from Jon Petersen Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Jon Petersen: Great, thanks. Just maybe 1 more question on the Bay Area. I know you mentioned it's hard to predict what your competitors are going to do in terms of delivering product but how are you guys thinking about the SV9 development and starting that in light of the upcoming space you're going to have over the next couple of years?
Paul Szurek: So the important thing is to get it shovel-ready and we're vigorously in the process of that. And as we've said it typically takes about 12 months give or take a couple of months to go from acquisition to entitlement and permitting. And by the way that's for a data center the size of SV9. For larger campuses there's a much longer process to get all of the necessary environmental and power approvals.We feel good about where we are in that process so far. It is going as we expected. And therefore after about 12 months we should be able to start construction. And typically construction in that market takes about 12 months. And we'll be able to make that decision on starting construction based on what we see in the market and what we see in the SV7 retenanting. But from what -- the view we have of it today is we're likely to start that construction when we have the permits.
Jon Petersen: Okay. That's good color. And then a couple of your peers have achieved investment-grade ratings this year. I don't think that's something that you guys have aggressively pursued so far. But I'm curious what your thoughts are there. Obviously there's some interest expense savings but I think CyrusOne on their call just now was talking about some customers and how that was an important aspect in their underwriting of who to choose as a provider. So just curious any context or comments you might have around the possibility of getting an investment-grade rating how that might position you?
Jeff Finnin: Yes Jon. I would just offer that as you know and have seen over the last three years or so we've accessed the private placement debt markets and those go through a different ratings process. But as we sit here today and when we issued each of those instruments those were rated as investment-grade. And so we feel comfortable with the access to the capital we have and how it's been priced.Pricing on those instruments has been probably tighter than what we would have seen without the public markets just given the lending and the investor group in those instruments. So we're comfortable with where we are related to that. Obviously we continue to operate the business in a manner to get that investment-grade at more of a public level to the extent we ever go out in the public bond market. But that's probably not going to happen here in the near term but it's something we continue to watch and manage the business around.
Jon Petersen: So to what part is that a conversation with potential customers? I'm looking at your balance sheet and financial strength.
Steve Smith: Sure. Yes Jon I'll just tell you that it's -- I've never seen it be an issue in my customer interactions. I mean if you look at our balance sheet and how we're levered we're one of the least levered data center providers in the market. So our financial strength has actually been an asset to us not a hindrance.
Jon Petersen: Yes. Okay. Makes sense. Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, john.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Gutman Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Gutman: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. First last quarter you mentioned slowing customer commencements. I was wondering if you've seen that stabilize. Secondly on the legal expense which I think you gave guidance of $0.09 for the year last time around I think $0.04 had been incurred and I'm not sure did you say in this call another $0.01 had been incurred? And could that at all extend into next year? Or is that kind of -- that's all there is to it $0.09? And lastly although it's too early for guidance for next year given the expansion table and the elevated CapEx this year would you expect CapEx to be in a relatively similar level next year? Or as you mentioned second phase and second-tier developments are less expensive. Should that bring CapEx down next year?
Jeff Finnin: Rob it's Jeff. Let me answer 2 of those and then I'll pass it off to either Paul or Steve to address the commencements. As it relates to legal I did reference that we went through the third quarter as we expected and resolved our dispute through the trial that we unfortunately had to go through. The $0.01 of negative contribution to FFO keep in mind that was net of about a -- of the refund that we mentioned which we believe today is a minimum of $3.1 million. So just keep that in mind.So for the year it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.05 to $0.06 is where we'll expect it to be for 2019. Maybe some -- more of that noise as we go through '20. As most companies have there's always some legal issues out there that we're dealing with but at not nearly to the magnitude we had it for this year. As it relates to CapEx yes I would not expect our CapEx next year to be elevated like it is this year.Paul alluded to some of the reasons why. But if you think about us we've got about $265 million still to spend on everything that's under construction today. Some of that will be spent in the fourth quarter. And if I had to give you a range today I'd say somewhere around $275 million $300 million maybe by next year. Or I should say for next year that's going to be largely dependent upon leasing absorption etc. in the markets. But that gives you some idea where we think it would be going into next year. And then commencements?
Steve Smith: Yes. As far as commencements are concerned we did see a little bit of slowdown there from last year as far as commencements are concerned. And we have seen that moderate but then we've also seen the deal sizes I mentioned earlier. And the complexity within enterprises as they roll out their deployments to take a little bit longer. So that's part of the calculus on those commitments and when they actually happened and how they turn up their environment. So -- but overall we've seen that kind of stabilize.
Robert Gutman: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Lukas Hartwich Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
David Guarino: Hey guys, This is actually David on for Lukas. I wanted to ask about the pre-leasing at LA3 and what drove that tenant to sign the lease so far in advance of delivery. And maybe if there are more attractive terms attached with that deal. And then if you could just also talk about your yield expectations on that project. Obviously when you bring LA2 and 3 online they're going to improve. Just want to know if there's been any change in expectations there?
Steve Smith: Yes David I could just give you a little bit of color I guess on the pre-lease. Obviously we have nondisclosures with the customer and can't give you a whole lot of detail around the lease itself. I would just probably just offer more color around the value of our position in that market which is pretty consistent with our position in other markets which is large-scale capacity that's right next to 1 of the most connected buildings on the planet. And that is a unique offering a unique value that as I mentioned in my earlier comments is becoming more and more valued by more and more customers out there.So that is -- I would just say that that low latency scalable type of environment has proven to be invaluable to a lot of customers in this case a pretty large customer that was willing and could plan for the need of that capacity in the future. So I'm not sure I can give you a whole lot more color beyond that but that just gives you a little bit.
David Guarino: That's -- I understand. And then I guess just maybe with pre-leasing in general. Obviously the window has been shortened dramatically over the past few quarters but is there any indication that maybe that's lengthening again or was LA3 just a unique situation?
Steve Smith: Well I think it's market by market right? As there's more capacity in a given market like Virginia there's less need for customers to sign to longer pre-leases ahead of time. In markets like L.A. and the Bay they do. So it's really market-by-market and also application by application or even customer by customer. But obviously with tight inventory that always lengthens that behavior.
David Guarino: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from Richard Choe JPMorgan. please proceed with your question.
Richard Choe: Hi, I wanted to follow up on your analysis of your customers in terms of if they might churn or grow with you. With the ones that you identified with that might churn how do you plan on addressing them? Do you expect them to -- or kind of keep them or focus on growing customers in that same deployment to take over the space as they turn out?
Steve Smith: Well of course my preference is always to keep a customer. So that's job 1. As Jeff mentioned the numbers of those customers is very small. I think we identified it as roughly 2% overall. And within that 2% we expect to maintain hopefully all of them but many of those are still under term. And as we engage with them and get deeper into their business models and how they operate then hopefully we'll retain as much or all of them as possible. But the process just allowed us to identify them get a better operating model around how we engage with them and hopefully that will bear some fruit as the final outcome.
Richard Choe: And then regarding the Bay Area move-out is that going to keep the churn elevated this 9% to 11%? Or is that part of the envelope of 7.5% to 8% of normal or just part of that or is it too hard to say this far out?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. No Richard I think if you think about our annual churn when we -- you go back over to several years on average the range -- or it has ranged anywhere from roughly 7.5% to 8%. We expect as I mentioned some of those items that were elevating at this year to decrease for next year and if you back into that normal range. The offset that might drive that a little bit higher is related to this Bay Area customer and that's probably going to add somewhere between 225 to 240 basis points in late 2020 and in late 2021.
Paul Szurek: I'd only add to what Jeff has said that churn of this type in a market like that is generally a different quality of churn than the more widespread churn that is typically within our 7.5% to 8%. And again alluding to what we've mentioned earlier about having a lot of lead time to retenant that space before maturity and also having a lot of contiguous space to accommodate a wider range of customers.
Richard Choe: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes 2 follow-ups. One if you can maybe talk about the trajectory of channel mix as a portion of new logos in the most recent quarter and going forward. And then on LA3 are you anticipating that that new -- that pre-lease is going to generate a lot of direct cross-connect demand because of the nature of the customer's deployment? Or is it more likely to be indirect over time as perhaps there's enterprise hybrid attachments to that initial deployment?
Steve Smith: Sure. Jonathan this is Steve. As far as the channel mix is concerned we've been really pleased with the channel growth over the year. As of last quarter we saw that pick up even further. If you look at the collective mix it ended up being about 16% of our total. And if you back out the larger-scale lease that we mentioned earlier it ends up being about 32% just in rough math. So that's a pretty good chunk and higher than what we've seen in prior years and that's been ramping throughout the year. So that's good to see. As far as the LA3 pre-lease is concerned again not getting into too much of the details around that but I think your final comments are around not only that deployment connecting to a network that's going to drive some interconnection but also customers that will be connecting to that will also drive in their hybrid use cases will drive further interconnection is accurate.
Jonathan Atkin: And when a customer takes advantage of dark fiber between LA1 and LA2 for instance does that count as a cross-connect that you monetize? Or do you sometimes just let them buy the fiber and then you're just collecting rent?
Steve Smith: We typically count that as a cross-connect. In some cases we've worked out specific arrangements for them to have dark fiber between the 2 but in 99% of the cases it's through our cross-connect.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks very much.
Operator: I will turn the call back to Paul Szurek for a few closing comments. Please go ahead.
Paul Szurek: Thanks. Appreciate all the good questions. Before I move to my final comments I do want to invite you to our L.A. campus data center tour and networking event on November 11 at the beginning of REITworld. Come join both our local and headquarters teams who will be hosting the activities. You can sign up with the link in our earnings press release or you can go directly to CoreSite's website to do that.And let me just close by reiterating we believe the market trends we discuss today will continue to reward us for creating a more proactive development and construction program. And going forward our job is to keep meeting campus expansion needs and to continue growing the customer communities in our campuses. I feel very confident in the team that we have here that are doing all the various aspects of that of those activities and feel very good working with them going forward. Thanks to everyone for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CoreSite.
Operator: And this concludes today's teleconference, you may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to CoreSite's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Carole Jorgensen, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Carole.
Carole Jorgensen: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Maile Kaiser, Senior Vice President of Sales; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by the federal securities law, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons.We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risk is included in our filings with the SEC. Also on the call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information this is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page on our website at coresite.com.And now I will turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I will review our second quarter financial highlights, recap several significant second quarter events and provide an update on our development pipeline. First, I'd like to welcome to today's call Maile Kaiser who is substituting for Steve to cover our sales results and our sales strategy and execution. Steve is enjoying some well deserved family vacation time. Jeff will then take you through our financial results and financing activities and provide an updated guidance overview.Turning to our financial highlights for the quarter, we grew operating revenues 4.7% year-over-year delivered a $1.27 of FFO per share, grew adjusted EBITDA 2.4% year-over-year and achieved a record quarter for sales with $27.3 million of annualized rent including solid retail, scale, and new logo sales, and an unusually strong quarter for hyperscale sales, all of which Maile will discuss in more detail.Next I would like to highlight several significant events, some of which we shared on our call in April. First, our pre-lease at SV8 in Santa Clara. For two of the three phases at that data center with expected in-service timing of late Q3 for Phase 1 and late Q4 for Phase 2. Second closing on our SV9 property purchase, for a future data center addition to our Santa Clara campus. Third, closing the financing of senior notes totaling $400 million, and fourth receiving permits for LA3 data center leading to construction starting in early July.In addition to the SV8, SV9, and LA3 milestones, we also made substantial progress on the rest of our development pipeline. We completed construction at LA1 a data center expansion of 17,000 square feet, and also leased nearly 30% of the computer room to a large network and content provider. We completed construction of our last phase of LA2 and commenced the pre-lease of this data center expansion for the entire 28,000 square feet. We completed construction of VA3, Phase 1B, a purpose-built data center in Reston, Virginia, at 51,000 square feet. We advanced our ground-up construction of CH2 in Chicago, and we began pre-construction activities for SV9 including initiation of the environmental permitting and other early stage processes.Summing up we placed into service, about 100,000 square feet this quarter, of which, a third is leased. We have another 323,000 square feet under construction, of which we expect nearly 40% or 128,000 square feet to be completed this year.So we continue to make steady progress delivering on our commitment to provide more capacity in our markets and more large contiguous spaces to sell to customers. I'm grateful for the efforts of my colleagues in all of these areas. I also want to share a modest but important accomplishment related to our energy efficiency improvements. We were recently recognized by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power with an energy efficiency rebate of $3 million for the efficiency gains were achieved in 2018 based on our chiller plant replacement of LA2. Sustainability is an important ongoing goal for CoreSite, and we are pleased with both our energy savings and this award.As we look forward 2019 continues to be a transition year for us. We entered the year with a leasable capacity at lower levels than historical norms, and we plan to end 2019 with leasable capacity and quickly developable inventory at the higher levels we experienced in previous years. As I shared last quarter, to ensure a successful transition, our 2019 priorities include translating new construction into more abundant sales acquiring additional new customer logos, bringing new connectivity and customer service products online to drive sales and to delivering great customer experiences and operational efficiencies. I'm pleased that we are executing effectively on these priorities. That said, we have much work ahead of us, including ongoing sales execution for our existing and anticipated new capacity. Leasing at VA3 which is going well for retail that continues to be challenged by the supply and pricing for large-scale and hyperscale in that market, keeping construction on a good pace at CH2, SV8, and LA3, and obtaining entitlements, power, and permits for SV9.We are making important progress on the sales front, taking into account market dynamics. Hyperscale and large-scale leasing will continue to be lumpy as it has throughout our history as a company, but is currently challenging in Virginia.Outside Virginia, our market seem to be reasonably balanced in terms of supply and demand for our offering. We are pleased with the quarter and all that we've accomplished. The cycles of demand trends appear to be strong, however, the cyclical headwinds for Northern Virginia scale and hyperscale leasing and increased churn will affect the second half of the year. Jeff will discuss these items further in his comments.We've seen cycles of demand pick up quickly in the past, and this time we are ready to pounce with available data center space and shovel ready product. I have confidence in our teams, which are working diligently to address all of these activities and challenges and look forward to continuing to make progress toward stronger growth in 2020.With that I will turn the call over to Maile.
Maile Kaiser: Thank you, Paul. Today, I'll start off with a summary of our quarterly sales and leasing results and then talk more about our sales strategy and execution.Moving to our sales. For the quarter, we had new and expansion sales of $27.3 million of annualized GAAP rent. These sales reflected a record quarter for CoreSite where we delivered solid core retail colocation sales and a large pre-lease at SV8 in addition to other scale leasing.Turning to a few highlights on our sales. Our $27.3 million of annualized GAAP rent for new and expansion sales included $5.3 million of core retail colocation sales and $22 million of hyperscale and scale leasing including our pre-lease at SV8. These new sales included a 143,000 net rentable square feet reflecting an average annualized GAAP rate of $191 per square foot and strong sales of new logos. Our $5.3 million of annualized GAAP rent for core retail colocation sales included solid pricing on a per kilowatt basis compared to our trailing 12-month average. Looking at new logos we won 43 new logos, compared to 30 last quarter. These new logo additions reflect the highest number of quarterly additions in five quarters include quality new brand names that enrich our ecosystem and represent total annual rent nearly double our trailing 12-month average. We believe these new logos should help drive future growth and remain a focus and priority for us.Renewals were another key aspect of our leasing. During the second quarter, our customer renewals included annualized GAAP rent of $24.1 million reflecting our growing base of business and strong customer relationships.Our renewals represented rent growth of 2.6% on a cash basis and 7.4% on a GAAP basis, but included, as anticipated, higher than historical churn of 2.4%.Next, I'll talk more about our sales strategy and execution. I've been with CoreSite seven years, and in my current role as the Head of Sales for about a year. I can best describe our Team Sales focus as what we refer to as the community effect. Simply put, we bring customers together to support their digital transformations and access to new technology, such as new cloud applications, like advanced and specialized development platforms, analytics or machine learning, edge storage, and cloud adjacent storage, security as a service, and other SaaS offerings, and content delivery platforms. We have a strong ecosystem as we're positioned at the network edge, which creates an ongoing cycle of attracting large cloud and network providers and enterprise customers, who need to Interconnect their workloads and care about performance, cost, and latency, and need our proximity to serve their teams and customers with very low latency.To build on our ecosystem, we are providing our customers tools to drive opportunities for them to navigate their digital transformations. For some customers this means providing access to solutions like the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange, which provides an efficient, flexible, and scalable SDN product, to interact with multiple cloud providers and CoreSite's SDN inter-site capabilities between markets that provide convenient options for WAN realignment as well as easy access to multiple cloud regions from a single market. For other customers, it may mean introducing them to our solution partners, which provide them access to important solution providers to speed and streamline our transition to a hybrid cloud architecture and empower them to manage and interconnect those related applications and workloads.As the market changes and shifts we are changing also. We continue to refine our go-to-market strategy for ongoing growth and community density, constantly working to attract new customers that value our ecosystem, serving new applications as they are created, and supporting new ways to serve the network edge as new technology and customer needs become more defined.As Paul mentioned, new capacity is coming online, which is critical to the customer opportunities we are pursuing. As we continue to demonstrate to our customers that we have the capacity for them to grow with us.In summary, while we've had a strong quarter, we believe we can continue to improve in retail, new logo, and scale sales, while constantly building on the community effect in our markets and periodically achieving complementary hyperscale sale.With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Maile and hello, everyone. Today, I will review our financial results for the quarter, provide an overview of our April and July financing activities, and discuss our financial guidance.Turning to our detailed results for the quarter. Our total operating revenues were $142.9 million for the quarter, which increased 4.7% year-over-year and 2.9% sequentially. Operating revenues consisted of $121.1 million of rental, power, and related revenue, $18.8 million of interconnection revenue, and $3 million of office, light industrial, and other revenue.Interconnection revenue increased 7.8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. FFO was $1.27 per diluted share, which decreased $0.01 per share year-over-year and increased $0.02 per share sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA of $76.7 million, grew 2.4% year-over-year and 2.9% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.6% for the quarter, consistent with our trailing 12-month average of 53.8%. Sales and marketing expense totaled $5.8 million for the quarter or 4% of total operating revenues. General and administrative expense totaled $12.3 million for the quarter or 8.6% of total operating revenues, including elevated legal expenses, adding approximately $0.04 per share in costs this quarter that I will address further related to the impact on full-year guidance. We commenced 65,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases for the quarter at an annualized GAAP rent of $176 per square foot, which represented $10.2 million of annualized GAAP rent.Moving to data center sales backlog. As of June 30th, the annualized GAAP rent from signed, but not yet commenced leases was $26.1 million or $29.5 million on a cash basis. We expect most of the GAAP backlog to commence in the next two quarters.Turning to our property operations and development. Same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent for the quarter was $1575, reflecting an increase of 6.1% year-over-year and an increase of 1.2% sequentially. Q2 same-store turnkey data center occupancy was 88.9%, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year and a decrease of 30 basis points sequentially, which offsets some of the same-store growth in MRR per cabinet equivalent.We have 323,000 square feet of data center capacity under development. With a $191 million of cost incurred to date of estimated total cost of $528 million or $337 million of remaining cost to complete these projects. This includes all three phases of SV8 as well as LA3 Phase 1. For more details on our development projects please see Page 19 of our supplemental information.Capitalized interest was $3.6 million for the quarter and represented approximately 26% of total interest.Moving to our balance sheet. To recap and update our financing activities from our last call, on April 17th, we entered into a note purchase agreement and agreed to issue and sell an aggregate principal amount of $200 million of 4.11% Series A Senior Notes due April 2026 and $200 million of 4.31% Series B Senior Notes due April 2029. An initial aggregate principal amount of $325 million was issued on April 17, with the remaining $75 million issued on July 17.The proceeds from the notes were used to pay down outstanding amounts on the revolving portion of our senior unsecured credit facility. This provides us liquidity of $456 million, which includes credit available under the revolving credit facility, senior notes, and cash as of quarter end, that will be used primarily to fund the estimated $337 million of remaining current development pipeline costs.Turning to our financial guidance. As Paul mentioned, we've identified some headwinds in the last half of the year as it relates to sales in Northern Virginia and elevated levels of churn. For sales, this primarily relates to scale and hyperscale leasing in Virginia, where supply and demand dynamics are having a negative impact on pricing.And therefore, we are expecting more retail signings which support our expected returns for our business, and we are hopeful supply and demand dynamics for larger scale leasing will improve over the coming year. We also have recently identified additional churn for the last half of the year, resulting from customers terminating in end of life application or line of business or for some going out of business and deployments to the cloud, which will be elevated the next few months compared to historical trends.Fortunately, the elevated churn appears to support edge cloud provider demand on our campuses. We also have two other impacts to our financial guidance that are either event related or a reflection of timing. The first is our legal expense, which has increased and elevated our G&A costs this quarter. We anticipate incurring additional cost for a total full year negative impact of $0.09 per share.Another impact includes the timing of our commencements. We've had strong sales this year and we're focused on leveraging that momentum into the second half of 2019. However, we believe the timing of slower than expected sales commencements will impact this year's operating results. As a result, we are revising our guidance to reflect these items. Our 2019 guidance range is revised as follows.Total operating revenues of $570 million to $580 million with a midpoint of $575 million. Net income of $98 million to $103 million with a midpoint of $100.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $306 million to $311 million with a midpoint of $308.5 million. Net income per common diluted share of $2.04 to $2.10 with a midpoint of $2.07. FFO per diluted common share and OP unit of $5.07 to $5.13 per share with a midpoint for $5.10. Annual rental churn rate of 9% to 11% with a midpoint of 10%. This revised guidance reflects a decrease in FFO per share of $0.16 at the midpoint, largely attributable to $0.09 per share related to legal cost and $0.07 per share due to Northern Virginia sales, elevated churn, and timing of commencements. Please see page 23 of our supplemental earnings information for other guidance changes.In closing, we made significant progress in the second quarter including reporting a record sales quarter achieving substantial property development progress and closing a successful financing. As we move into the last half of 2019, the team will be working to continue our momentum despite the headwinds of churn in Northern Virginia scale leasing, which we will work through. Our business fundamentals are strong, and we will continue to focus on our goal to accelerate growth in 2020 and beyond.That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, and good morning out there. So first I wanted to just address the changes in the guidance. If I could dig in a little bit more, the churn elevated again for the second consecutive quarter. Can you sort of identify with the specific drivers were that caused you to increase it again, sort of 90 days later, Jeff? I mean, I think you probably had a decent handle 90 days ago which caused you to increase the guidance there? And then here we are 90 days later with an incremental sizable bump at the midpoint, at least, to the overall churn rate. And I'm just wondering what's driving that, especially seven months into the year?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, good morning, Jordan. Let me see if I can give you some color related to your question. And hopefully it helps explain the increases and what we're seeing inside the portfolio, but just a little bit more broadly speaking, if you look at our churn over the last several years, our average has been right around 7.3%. If you look at the bankruptcy that we talked about last quarter plus another small one we've got, that increases that average churn by about 120 basis points. So, all in there, you're at about 8.5% and what we've seen since that as we continue to look forward is we've got some additional customers who are looking to migrate some portion of their IT architecture into the cloud and that element of what is really resulting in the increase for this particular guidance is the incremental amount we're seeing and looking at for the rest of this year. And so that explains the timing associated with it. I think we are optimistic that we will retain a larger share than what we are of their deployments, but knowing what we know today, we felt more comfortable to increasing that guidance to the levels of which we have guidance.
Jordan Sadler: So I guess I would characterize that reason as sort of a secular driver, I mean something that you guys have been experiencing and seeing broadly, you and your peers, for a couple of years. Is there, are you baking in some incremental room for additional potential customers to migrate to the cloud? Or how do you, what's with the sort of out-sized migration to the cloud to sort of happening in the back half, is just one large customer?
Jeff Finnin: No, it's a handful of customers that are driving that. And most of that as Paul alluded to, and we're experiencing in three markets, two of those markets are on the West Coast, and so it is a-- I'd say, four or five customers that are really elevating that churn. And again, we just, we're estimating, we'd be able to retain more of their architecture than ultimately we think we're going to.I think to your comment is to it being a more broad secular driver, I think inside our portfolio, it hasn't been as big of a driver as what we're seeing this year. And so where we're spending more and more time is getting our arms around what that looks like in the next one to three years, so we could better understand that dynamic and make sure we're obviously communicating that as best as we can. We hope this is elevated for a single year and not a sign of a trend to come, but that's something we got to spend some more time on.
Paul Szurek: Jordan this is Paul. I would just add two things. There is a little bit of a good news element to this churn we're experiencing because from what we can see pretty much all of it is going into the edge cloud cases that we're hosting. And so, it further cements the demand in our data centers for that activity. Secondly, as you know there is always different used cases that increase and then subside. And I think we're sort of at the tail end of the cycle of some of those historical use cases that are subsiding. So, I would expect, and Jeff and his team will dig into it much more extensively over the next couple of months, but I would expect that this will be a crest of churn for us and we'll see it subsiding in the coming couple of years.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. That would be good. In terms of the timing of the churn, is it, I was surprised that it's a couple of hundred basis point increase since we're already past June 30, but has it churned out, have these guys churned out of the portfolio already or is this sort of a third quarter or fourth quarter event?
Jeff Finnin: No, I mean the churn we experienced in the second quarter was right in line with what we had originally communicated, Jordan. So we had expected the Q3 churn to be elevated again at that 2.5%. I would say based upon what we know today, I would expect that churn in the third quarter to be somewhere between 3% and 3.5% and then back to around 2.5% in the fourth quarter.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Last question is just on legal costs. You're elevated, what is the source of these? And then could you give us the breakout again of, I just missed it in your prepared remarks, how much the impact was in this quarter?
Paul Szurek: So, Jordan. This is ongoing litigation. So there's not a whole lot we could talk about. I can tell you it involves a dispute with a landlord in one of our smaller markets that started with the construction issue, there is, the normal disclosure in our 10-Q, which we'll be filling soon. And as with all ongoing litigation, there's just not a whole lot I should comment on beyond that. To clarify the numbers, though it affected the second quarter, $0.04 a share, and we expect the full-year impact and obviously it's not perfectly predictable, but to be about $0.09 a share, full year including the $0.04.
Jeff Finnin: And just to add one more level, just for your modeling purposes if it helps, the incremental $0.05 for the year will be weighted toward the third quarter.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. I'll yield the floor. Thanks guys.
Jeff Finnin: You bet. Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Erik Rasmussen: Yes. Thanks. Maybe just circling back on that. I know you had given the outlook for FFO per share and it was a $0.16 sort of impact and $0.09 was coming from legal. You gave sort of three other reasons for the other $0.07, if you had to sort of weight those three Northern Virginia or the churn or timing of commencements, how would you say that those would be weighted in terms of those, the $0.07 for that remainder?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, good morning, Erik. Yes, let me just go to some of the, obviously the public comments I said earlier in my prepared script, but you're correct, I did say that the $0.09 that was attributable-- the $0.09 of the $0.16 was attributable to the legal costs and the incremental $0.07 is largely attributable to the churn, the market conditions in Northern Virginia, and the timing commencements. Those three are relatively weighted equally to be quite honest. And just so that you also have again for just full transparency, given everything we've disclosed around our guidance, there are some offsetting, expense savings, some of it in SG&A, and in operating expenses, but it's largely attributable to those two items that we highlighted, and those three items weighted relatively equal.
Erik Rasmussen: Great. Okay. Well then, in terms of, it maybe just asking in another way, the top line, there was a $10 million impact, what would you say sort of the primary driver there? Is it more of the churn that happened or is it the impact of slowness that you're seeing in Northern Virginia? Is there something else? And then I'll have just one more question.
Jeff Finnin: Yes. I know that-- if you look at it from a topline perspective, those three have contributed to that $10 million reduction fairly equally at the top line. There is some additional power cost revenue also but the larger ones are the three that I mentioned weighted relatively equally.
Erik Rasmussen: Okay, great. And then, I guess then, thinking of the set up for next year and expectations for sort of accelerated growth. And I'd say return to low double-digits, at this point where do you foresee sort of the biggest risk to hitting this target as we stand today?
Jeff Finnin: Well, it's a great question, Erik. I think obviously based upon what we've just talked about in some of those items influencing 2019, is providing some headwinds, and those headwinds will impact 2020, and I think we've obviously got a lot of work ahead of us related to the back half of this year. In terms of the highest risk, I think ultimately, sales and churn are probably the two, I would elevate to the highest risk. Obviously, Steve, Maile and the team worked hard on the sales perspective, and we're doing what we can to minimize the churn, but I would say, those would be the two that I would say to elevate the highest.
Paul Szurek: Yes, Eric. We have a lot of opportunity between now and year-end, we have a lot of capacity, so we definitely have the raw materials to have a very strong. We'll have a good growth year next year regardless, but the strength of it will depend on how well we can capitalize on the raw materials we have in place.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you for taking my questions. I guess just to be specific, do you still expect to achieve low double-digit growth in 2020 or is that now less likely? And I guess as part of that, are you still wanting to do a scale lease for SV8 Phase 3 or that something that you're looking to do retail with? And then, my other question, how much are you recognizing in termination fees or expecting to recognize in termination fees, considering all the churn in 2019, including specifically what you just occurred maybe in the second quarter to the extent that it's immaterial. Thanks.
Paul Szurek: So, obviously, it's a little bit more challenging with the headwinds in Northern Virginia and not expecting as much scale and hyperscale sales out of Northern Virginia as we did six months to nine months ago, to hit double-digit growth, but it is still possible to do that for 2020, and then you carry that out with the capacity we have, in the markets that we have, and the much increased number of markets in which we have capacity, and it should be more sustainable thereafter. It's still possible. It's going to be a harder lift to get there.What was the second half of his question?
Colby Synesael: SV8.
Paul Szurek: Oh, on SV8, yes SV8, we will build that out as our traditional colo floor. Colby as you know we are flexible on all of our floors. They're designed where we can accommodate both scale, small hyperscale deployments, as well as retail deployments. And as we always do, we will pursue it on a broad range and make decisions based on customer ecosystem fit and pricing.
Jeff Finnin: Colby, to address your third question as it relates to termination fee. We don't have anything material in the second quarter regarding termination fees. However, I think what you're referencing is probably the bankruptcy, the customer that on the previous bankruptcy that we talked about, and I think it's important to just give you a little bit of color around that. When we went through, we basically negotiated a lease modification with that particular customer. And as part of that process, we drove overall economics that would include some level of a termination fee, but it doesn't get called that just because of the way it gets accounted for. But just so you're aware, in the second quarter we had $0.01 a share from that particular customer. And we expect another $0.01 a share in the third quarter from that particular customer before they vacate that particular computer room.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Gutman: Thanks for taking the questions. First, in the scale leasing of $22 million, does that include any other hyperscale or hyper block or small deals besides SV8 1 and 2? Secondly, you mentioned $3 million energy efficiency rebate, and I think in the quarter a footnote it said you realized $1.7, so does that mean the balance gets recognized over the next two quarters and more broadly, how should we expect recurring at capex to play out in the second half of the year in light of that and ordinary spending?
Maile Kaiser: Hi, Robert. This is Maile Kaiser, just to answer your first question on the scale leasing and hyperscale, there was other scale leasing in addition to the hyperscale that made up the $22 million and I'll let Jeff answer the other questions for you.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Robert. Paul alluded to his prepared remarks that we actually received $3 million, which is ultimately the cash that we received, and ultimately we allocated the $3 million pro rata to both recurring capex and expansion capex based upon the way we spent those dollars on the original project. And so, when we were spending the money. A portion of what we spent was included in recurring capex and that related to that portion that was already built. And then another portion was expansion capex, it related to the expansion of that particular data center, and so the $1.7 million just reflects the pro rata portion of that allocated to recurring capex initially and that's what's given you that, that decrease in recurring capex for the second quarter. Does that explain what you were asking?
Robert Gutman: Sure, but I think it was also, recurring capex in the first quarter was elevated, now it's actually a positive number with the rebate, what should we expect it to be in the next several quarters, what's the normal rate?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, that's a great question. So, I think if you just ignore the rebate in the second quarter, we would have had about $1 million of recurring capex in the second quarter, and obviously that's down just a little bit from the first. We've typically been forecasting somewhere between $1 million to $2 million per quarter of recurring capex for 2019, and that's what I would expect in the third and fourth quarter of this year.
Robert Gutman: Thanks. One more if I may? In the commencements that were delayed, was that a function of the opening times, like construction or was it a function of customer accommodation moving in later?
Paul Szurek: I think it really reflects the more new customers in this hybrid cloud type of architecture, and they tend to take longer to make some of the decisions they need to make to set up their space and even sometimes finalize the sales order for what they need. They have more decisions taking place than customers, typical customers two-three years ago would have had.
Robert Gutman: Got it. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Maile Kaiser: I was just going to say, this is Maile Kaiser. And I would just add that, that it really is a lot of times customer-dependent on their timing and putting together all of that architecture in the design and if it's a migration versus a new project. All of those commencements can change.So, we're really at the mercy of their timing and requirements .
Robert Gutman: Thank you very much.
Jeff Finnin: You bet. Thanks, Robert.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, cloud has been putting some pressure on the MSP business model or at least forced them to evolve some. In a general sense, do you think MSPs and system integrators are as attractive customers for CoreSite as they used to be, or would you describe them as higher risk now?
Paul Szurek: You know what I alluded earlier to churn we're having in traditional business models. I think we've seen over the last four-five years kind of steady bleed-off of MSP, hosting, some private cloud options that are not specifically geared to a hybrid cloud architecture. So I think a lot of our churn this year is related to some of those companies come into their final reckoning. So, yes, and we don't see those, Maile do we see those types of customers budget in our funnel these days?
Maile Kaiser: Well, I think that we see them in a new form. So we definitely do quite a bit of business with SI and MSP but there are a smaller deployments and they're more aggregating hybrid cloud architecture and then helping to manage that hybrid cloud architecture. So, traditionally, they used to purchase larger deployments and try to build out their own private cloud. Now, what we're seeing those customers do, is provide additional services on top of a hybrid cloud architecture and deploying those services in our data centers.
Nick Del Deo: Got it. Can you share what portion of revenue they represent?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. I think if you do a deep dive, just depending on how you categorize it for us, Nick it's about 2% of our embedded here today.
Nick Del Deo: Okay. So it's pretty small.
Jeff Finnin: Yes.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, that's helpful. And then one last one, would you consider the Northern Virginia market soft enough that any scale leasing renewals you're going to see in coming years are likely to face pricing pressure that you haven't historically seen?
Paul Szurek: It depends on how quickly the market recovers. I don't think we have any coming up for a couple of years, but if market conditions persist today we probably would have some negative market-to-market on some scale leasing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Atkin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Jon Atkin: Thanks. Got a couple, I'll ask them upfront and you can answer them in whatever order. But when you fail to close on a scale deal opportunity, is it because of churn? is it price? is it product? just curious to get a little color on deals that maybe came close, but didn't quite finish it? Secondly, on the new logos, I'm interested in kind of any qualitative color around the cross-connect intensity of the new logos you're bringing in? And also, is that primarily coming from channel or is that coming from the efforts of your direct sales people in terms of the new logos?And then on the churn, I was wondering if you could help us localize where on the West Coast? Is it some of your older inventory outside of Santa Clara and San Jose in Milpitas in Northern California? Or is it on the center of the campus that you were seeing some of the churn? And then in LA is it Alameda or One Wilshire? Thanks very much.
Paul Szurek: So let me try to address everything except the new logos, and I'll let Maile address those. Obviously I get involved in every large scale deal and every one of them that we have missed on, I believe, were just 100% pricing, where the pricing was below what we thought was the right trade-off. And understand that if our retail sales in North Virginia-- if our retail sales in Northern Virginia were not going as well as they were, we'd probably be more tempted to take some of this discounted pricing, but we're doing pretty well on the retail bucket and that continues to seem to gather momentum. So right now I think we can continue to pursue that strategy for leasing up VA3 until better opportunities come along on the scale side.In terms of the churn again, most of this is, most of the churn within the Stender campus in Santa Clara and in Alameda at LA2 and obviously the Boston situation. So Maile you want to talk about the new logos?
Maile Kaiser: Sure. So I think as we look to target new logos and bring on a new customers, we're looking for customers that value our ecosystem and our community effect, and with that and those deployments that are looking to be closer to the edge and interconnect their workloads with our service providers in our cloud on-ramps. We see that that brings in more cross connect activity. So we feel pretty good about the new customers that we've brought on, and the mix of customers, they're actually, about 55% of the new logos were coming from enterprise, and the rest were coming from network and cloud, and those enterprises are looking to interconnect with several cloud providers and network providers and services. So we expect to see a growth in cross connects with those customers coming on board.
Jon Atkin: And then lastly, is there anyway to kind of characterize the close rate that you've seen, is it same close rate, but just kind of a smaller deal funnel late stage or what was kind of some of the dynamics that you've seen? And then going forward, would you characterize the late stage funnel as being at average levels, above average, below average as we sit here today?
Maile Kaiser: So I think that the good news is, we are improving our win ratio that is one of our top priorities for 2019 in addition to improving sales productivity and increasing the funnel of new opportunities. So, both are critical. I think that we've seen an increase in the quality of new logos and opportunities in our funnel where we're trending in the right direction with our improved win rate. And again, our focus is on bringing in more and more customers that value our ecosystem and need access to cloud on ramps and the interconnection support that we provide in our data centers.
Jon Atkin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Nate Crossett: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about yield for the development pipeline as you do more scale leasing? And do you think you'll be able to maintain that 12% to 16% that you quote or should we expect that range to kind of migrate lower the more scale that you do?
Paul Szurek: So, Nate, it really depends on the market being very candid about Virginia, if we did a significant amount of scale in VA3 we would at today's pricing not hit that 12% threshold. On the other side of the coast that with, as long as we have an appropriate mix of retail, we can still do a significant amount of scale and hit our underwriting hurdles.And I believe that will be true for LA and Chicago based on the interest we're seeing in the early stages of construction, time will tell on those. But in those markets right now the supply demand balance seems to be much more healthy than it is in Northern Virginia.
Nate Crossett: Okay, and then just longer term like what percent of your overall portfolio should we expect to be scale. I guess is there a certain threshold you don't want to go over, or is it just customer?
Paul Szurek: It's really hard to give you any guidelines on that because it's going to vary based on pricing and supply and demand in each market. So I think that is going to be a derivative variable as opposed to an outright target.
Nate Crossett: Okay and then on just the land bank, are there any other purchases like SV9 that are in the works? What's the amount of capital you're allocating toward kind of land purchases?
Paul Szurek: I think it will be very modest going forward. We do want to, we've got SV9 in Santa Clara and very glad to have that. We will, down the road, probably need to acquire additional pieces of land in Los Angeles and Chicago. But we are good for a long time in Northern Virginia. We're good for a long time in the Northeast. And obviously we're in good shape in Santa Clara.
Nate Crossett: Okay, so there is no new markets on the horizon any time soon.
Paul Szurek: We keep looking at them. I'll be honest, the more we look at new markets, the more grateful I am to be in the markets that we're in. I think relative to our size and based on the quality of our markets in terms of supply and demand in the other drivers of demand. I think share per share we have more opportunity for growth relative to our size as far as I could tell among our peers. So time will tell if that's an accurate prediction, but I feel pretty good about where we are right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Louthan: Great, thank you. So, talk to us a little bit about the pace of some of the hyperscale deals that you've got, when can we expect to see those kind of layer in and start billing? And I apologize if you already addressed this, but how do you feel about funding for that? do you, do you need to raise additional capital over the next 12 months to 18 months to fund those?
Jeff Finnin: Hi, good morning Frank. Well, I think we did reference it, but let me just to make sure you caught what we said is, when you look at SV8 Phase 1 and Phase 2, which is really what is a majority of our backlog today, we've got 6 megawatts of that 12 coming online late Q3, and the remainder coming on late Q4. And so that's the timing associated with that particular deployment.In terms of liquidity, we've got about $335 million of remaining spend based on what's under construction today, and our liquidity, we ended the quarter at somewhere right around $460 million. So we've got plenty of liquidity to take care of what's under construction today, so I don't see any needs for additional liquidity before year-end. But, it is something we look at, and we always want to be watching the markets to ultimately see if we want to do something based upon pricing and where markets are headed. But as I look at it today, and I don't think there is a need to do anything. And we'll obviously probably have through the first half of next year without any real issues on the liquidity perspective.
Frank Louthan: Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow up to the question, so SV8 Phase 1 and 2 in Q3 and Q4, what sort of the revenue ramp we should expect? Is this, with the hyperscale deal, is this going to be a longer revenue ramp for the full billing run rate or will they be sort of at full rate in those, by the end of each of those quarters?
Jeff Finnin: I got to be a little careful here just due to the confidentiality we have with a customer. But just to help you out there, there is not a significant ramp there. I'd look at it fairly reasonable in terms of when it's coming online late Q3 and late Q4.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Aryeh Klein: Thanks. So, of the 7% or so on historical churn, how much of that has been associated with cloud migration? And then in your prepared comments you mentioned that you're hopeful that pricing would improve in Northern Virginia over the next year or so, what could drive that since it seems very challenging right now?
Jeff Finnin: Good morning Aryeh. If you look back historically, as it relates to our churn, and you know, you referenced that 7.3%, in terms of what's migrating to the cloud historically, it's been a relatively small percentage. We've had some of it over the years, but nothing to the levels of what we're seeing this year. So I would say, if I had to quantify it, it's somewhere around, call it 25 basis points to 40 basis points, maybe 25 basis points to 50 basis points on an annual basis. And I'm sorry Aryeh but what was the second question?
Paul Szurek: Aryeh, let me, I think you're asking about the potential for change in the Northern Virginia market and what would drive that. Is that right?
Aryeh Klein: Yes.
Paul Szurek: I mean, I think we're already seeing a little bit in that some of the buildings that we expect to come out of the ground by now, appear to have been postponed, what is behind that in every case, we don't know. We do, we are aware of a couple of prospective builders who have publicly said they're going to go on pause and just look for build-to-suit opportunities. So, supply will be affected by those types of actions, demand will pick up probably when the cloud hyperscalers get into their next, get out of their absorption phase of what they leased in 2017 and 2018 and move into the phase of having to lease or produce additional capacity to accommodate the growth. Historically that tends to be about 12 months to 18 months cycle between the bottom of those cycles and coming back up more to the top. So maybe we're, I don't know 12 months away from that, but it's hard to predict with certainty. Is that, is that responsive?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Rollins: Thanks. So a couple of follow-ups, if I could. So, first on the question of Virginia, from looking at the rent schedule correctly there is about $53 million of annualized rent. Based on current pricing, what would you estimate the revenue risk would be over time in the mark-to-market?
Paul Szurek: We'd have to going to go back and calculate that relative to scale and retail, you know, Virginia still is primarily a retail data center campus for us and retail pricing has been pretty solid there. So, I don't know what the magnitude of that would be, but we'll try to present that on our next quarterly call.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Mike just to further that, as you look at the numbers we've disclosed, keep in mind, what's in DC1, DC2 is really the retail side of the business, and then the composition of the Reston campus. If I had to give you an estimate, it will give you something more solid, I'd probably say at least two thirds of that is going to be built up with our retail business. And so just keep that in mind as you think about that. And you guys are asking very good questions related to pricing and let us just dig into it more we'll give additional color and commentary on that as we move forward.
Michael Rollins: And secondly as, as we think about the comments that you made on churn and the risk of customers migrating some infrastructure into the cloud. If we look at the segmentation schedule on Page 15 of the leases by size of NRSF, is there a story to tell of where their susceptibility in terms of the size of the leases? And is there some way that you've internally estimated like the long-term risk ,long-term exposure, where a certain class of the revenue is more susceptible to some of the migration that you're seeing from the handful of customers that you mentioned for this year?
Jeff Finnin: Well, I think you're trying to look at it with, obviously, the information we've given as best as you can. And when I think about what we're seeing this year, I would say most of that churn is probably bucketed in two portions, one would be the 5000 or less square foot bucket and the other one would be between 5000 square foot bucket to 10,000 square foot bucket, and that's why you've seen some of the numbers being elevated just due to the size, but in terms of what, what that looks like going forward, where is our biggest susceptibility, that's a, it's a great question. I think that the most important thing is ultimately as Maile and Steve have alluded to in the past, we're ultimately trying to make sure we can address those hybrid cloud solutions. And the question is going to be, what portion of their architecture that we, that might reside with us today, either is retained with us or that moves to the cloud, and I can't, I don't think I have enough data today. It says because just see how much of that we've been experiencing, to be quite honest. It's just not that we're going have to dig into more and see if we can get it quantified for you. But just to give you an idea, those two buckets is where most of that churn resides today that I referenced earlier.
Paul Szurek: And Michael, so far what we're seeing are really specialized use cases that are going into specialized edge cloud used cases. Most of what we have in our data centers, the network, the cloud obviously, that stuff is pretty impervious to migration of the cloud, and most of our enterprise occupancy is come in the last two, three years from customers that have already moved primarily into our data centers to do the hybrid cloud type of activity. I should point out, we also, one of our new logos this last quarter was somebody coming out of the cloud with a significant amount of capacity. So we're going to continue to see these dynamics and Jeff and his team have been working diligently this year to develop better predictive analytics around these things and it's still a work in progress, but I think we have enough visibility to not feel terrible about where the churn situation is with respect to cloud migration.
Maile Kaiser: And this is Maile. I think just to highlight what Jeff and Paul have shared, as we see our customers start to take advantage of some of the workloads that they can put into the cloud, we are going to see that right size of the deployment. But we're also finding that it's the exact same reason that we are winning new hybrid cloud deployments due to that exact need to have their workloads connected with the cloud providers and with low latency in the edge market. So where on the one case, we do see some churn on the other case, we do see new logos and then we also see it feeding into our edge campus cloud customers. So kind of a three pieces to that puzzle.
Michael Rollins: And so one final question. And so in the guidance change, the guidance for revenues changed, but not the interconnection revenue guidance. So, does that provide some observations about how your customers are valuing connectivity in that portion of what they get out of the data centers maybe to your point about the size of the deployment and if there's maybe some additional color there that would be great.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, I think just to give you some quantity numbers, I think obviously year-to-date our interconnection revenues up 9.4% cumulatively year-to-date. I think our midpoint of our guidance is 8.3. So we're comfortable where our numbers are for this year, and obviously, we didn't change the guidance. I think we've seen, in the first two quarters, we've seen good volume growth inside our business and that does play toward ultimately those customers that are needing to connect, whether it's to the cloud, whether it's to the networks, actually it's some of both. The growth in interconnection inside our portfolio continues to be very strong for those people needing to connect to the cloud.And I don't think that dynamic is going to change or subside anytime soon. And as long as we can continue driving those types of deployments Maile described, I think that will continue, at what levels, not certain, but we're comfortable with where we are for 2019.
Paul Szurek: Yes, Michael, on a micro level for an individual customer to the extent they're keeping some deployment in our data center, they will either maintain their current cloud connectivity or even increase it depending upon how many additional clouds they use and how they architecture to potentially connect to different cloud regions for additional resiliency.
Maile Kaiser: And we've added a couple of new products into our interconnection portfolio as we've mentioned earlier the CoreSite interconnection Gateway that allows them to interconnect and manage the connectivity between workloads to different cloud providers, as well as the inter-site capabilities between markets. So connecting their existing deployment into a new market, so more interconnection product that we have, will continue to drive the interconnection revenue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Jon Petersen: Great, thanks for sticking with us here. So if I could just a little bit more on the churn, if you could just maybe give us how you're thinking about backfilling this level of churn, or maybe just to think about more from a real estate perspective, obviously your occupancy is going to be going down through the rest of the year. How should we expect that to trend in 2020? And as you think of about getting back to 2020 or getting back to double-digit growth in 2020, it's kind of a quick turnaround of releasing that space required?
Maile Kaiser: Yes, hi, Jon, this is Maile. So we are actively pursuing backfill opportunities for any of the areas where we expect to see customers churn out. The good news is in most markets, the the location in which there, we're going to see that come back, is in turnkey colocation space and computer rooms, so very quick to be able to turnaround and support new customers. We've already been able to backfill a few opportunities and consistently look for pipeline to support the ones that are coming up.
Jeff Finnin: It term of.
Jon Petersen: Go ahead.
Jeff Finnin: Jon, I'm sorry, I was just going to say in terms of occupancy, I mean if you look at our same-store portfolio, it's declined a little bit here over the last couple of quarters and I would expect that to continue as you point out, it's probably going to decline probably another 200 basis points to 300 basis points or before year-end based on the churn we're looking at today.
Jon Petersen: Yes, that's kind of what I expected. I guess my thought, my question was more about as we look into 2020 do we expect that to reaccelerate?
Paul Szurek: I think it would, Jon. As Maile was saying, this churn space is basically our generic bread and butter colocation product. So we just keep selling.
Jon Petersen: Okay. I think you probably just answered this question, but just to be clear, when we think about your development pipeline versus this now vacant churn space, is there any different in kind of the ability to sell that space? And do you now have to kind of pulled in those markets where you now have more vacant space or are you going to pull back on new developments for a quarter or two while you backfill that vacant space?
Paul Szurek: All the development that we have in process right now, we will continue to press forward on because we think we're going to need it. The new development quite honestly gives us the ability to handle much larger opportunities than what the churn space enables us to handle. The churn space just comes back into our generic retail colocation inventory.
Jeff Finnin: And Jon the only change related to that is we did purposefully move back the completion of the Boston computer room due to the one computer room we're getting back. And so to your point, it helped, we're going to delay the completion of that room, but we still think longer term, we're going to need it. And as a result, we're continuing to move forward to just the timing is pushed back by quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Thank you. My question has to do with visibility of these discontinuation of applications, you referred to some of your customers doing that. Now when this happens in your business, how much of general visibility do you have before it happens, before they have this conversation where they want to disengage out of colocation and move to another type of workload or just ended application. Do they communicate this to you, like every month when it happens, three months, six months just so we have an idea for as this transition takes place. We can just have an idea on how exactly the dynamics are impacting your ability to guide?
Paul Szurek: So it really depends on the customer and the type in our traditional types of churn the SI, MSP, hosting companies that appear to be into their subsided cycle. We've generally been able to predict that based on the account representatives interactions with the customer plus some details around their activity in this space and historically we have been pretty accurate with that. Little bit harder to predict that with the things that might go to the cloud, because the customers themselves even though we are in close contact with them, are still evolving in some of these decisions, and so one month, it's yes we're not going to do anything for some period of time and then two months later, after more understanding of what cloud products are available, they make a change in decision. So that's why that segment is a little bit harder to predict than our traditional churn forecasting.
Sami Badri: Got it. And then we talked a lot about Northern Virginia market softness and most of the people on this call probably know that Northern Virginia is a very major market. So would you say that this specific dynamic is isolated, or you know like the supply and demand dynamics. Would you say that these are isolated to Northern Virginia or do you think this is a overall sector deceleration that we're going to start hearing about in some of the other markets over the rest of the year.
Paul Szurek: So in our markets. The only place we're seeing it is Northern Virginia, I've heard similar rumblings about the Phoenix and Dallas markets. But we're not in those markets, and I should also qualify that we're not, we don't have the capacity to be going after 12 megawatt to 18 megawatt deals in Northern Virginia. So, there might be less visibility for us into that particular subset of the market than others are seeing, and like you guys, I'm looking forward to seeing what we learn as our peers with activities in Northern Virginia report, in the next week or so, but so far, supply and demand, as I said, it looks pretty good in all of our other markets it looks pretty balanced, and again, the long-term secular drivers for demand. The new data products, the increase in the amount of content being pushed out. You know the increasing interaction with consumers and demand for lower latency, those all seem to be very much in place. And that's why we're seeing kind of consistent sales results across our core products and are hopeful of increasing that, over coming quarters, and why we still believe there will be periodically opportunistic sales for scale and hyperscale.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Choe: Great, thank you. Just a follow-up on the churn aspect and migration to the cloud. Normally, the life cycle is you go from being in the cloud and move to dedicated, and so this is kind of a reversal of that, but I guess, given your comments so far, it seems like it's with certain applications and very specific, do you think this is going to be more broad based or is this very application-specific? And then in terms of maybe on the other side of it, it seems like that you're getting some benefit in that, you're not completely losing the customer in that they continue to want connectivity and infrastructure around cloud providers. So can you kind of maybe give us a bit of a more holistic view on kind of the net loss versus the net gain on that? Thank you.
Paul Szurek: So, we actually track that pretty well, are pretty diligently, and so far between what we've leased for cloud applications, including all the different components of the cloud companies and edge cloud use cases plus what we've leased to companies coming into our data centers so that they could do hybrid cloud in the most secure and high performance way possible, we are way ahead on the whole cloud migration element. And I'm guessing If you talk to your colleagues in the enterprise space, they'd probably tell you that the vast majority of all migrations to the cloud are happening out of proprietary enterprise owned data centers.Again as I mentioned earlier, most of what we're seeing are specific use cases. And we're also seeing a lot of hybrid cloud that's coming to us specifically because they have the cloud operations right there on our campus or the direct cloud on ramps or the type of connectivity options we give them. So, net-net cloud is still a huge positive for us.
Richard Choe: And then in terms of the backfilling, is speed of filling it more important or getting the right price in looking at the space that you're getting back?
Paul Szurek: All of the above.
Richard Choe: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Lukas Hartwich: Thanks. I just want to clarify, has Northern Virginia become incrementally worse or you just reiterating prior comments around that market?
Paul Szurek: So we've been saying for about two years now that pricing for scale and hyperscale is coming down in Northern Virginia, we didn't really get to acid test that until we were out responding to RFPs for the new space coming on in VA3 Phase 1B and based on that, I would say that it has over the last three months to six months has continued to deteriorate a bit. It may be bottoming out right now. Everyone certainly hope so, but that's, that's our perception of the market.
Lukas Hartwich: Yes, it's maybe a little bit worse, and then you touched on this a little bit earlier, but in Boston. I noticed that a big chunk of square footage moved from stabilized to your held for development. But the AVR was the same. So I was trying to figure out what exactly went on there.
Paul Szurek: That was just a space that was leased on a powered shell basis to a wholesale customer that's in one of those business models that has been declining for a while and to release it according to our normal colocation model we'll have to put some additional capital into that space to convert it from powered shell to colocation space.
Lukas Hartwich: Got it.
Paul Szurek: And until we do that, it's not available inventory.
Lukas Hartwich: Got it. And then the rent didn't really move. Is that just a timing? Will that go down next quarter?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, no it's, those powered shell, obviously are not leased at the same levels in which typical turnkey is, so it did come down, but it was offset by the lease modification we executed with the other customer, that will come down in the third quarter.
Lukas Hartwich: Got it. That's it from me. Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: You bet, Lukas.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Jon Atkin: Thank you. Yes, just real quick on the new connectivity products that Maile was alluding to a couple of questions back, and I wondered, maybe if it be possible to learn a little bit about customer adoption. Is it new logos taking it on day one. Is it long-standing retail customers that are, that are beginning to kind of migrate to it. Are we still in kind of really early days here or is there a mature run rate to think about as people kind of adopts the Internet Gateway and other newer products. Thanks.
Maile Kaiser: Absolutely. Thanks, Jon for the follow-up. So these are relatively new products. So I think it is still early stages, we are actively proposing them to existing customers that can take advantage of new sites and interconnecting the two sites together as well as reaching new cloud zone, availability zones, from their existing site with us, but it's also, I think also on the CoreSite interconnection gateway product, we're going to see that be something that new customers are going to be interested in as they look to migrate out of their enterprise data center and into a colocation site, but they're not yet ready to make that move. So this, we see, is kind of a, a way to bring them into the data centers. So right now we're seeing some good pipeline with existing customers and we think that that's going to grow as we sell it with our solution partners.
Jon Atkin: Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Jon.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue, I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: So thank you all for your time and interest. Lot of good questions. I come out of every quarter, really proud of the team, the things the building blocks, we're putting in place for long-term growth have really come together well, and I like where we're going with that. I do believe the cyclical headwinds will pass and will be much happier as we have this additional space to sell, and I know one thing that you can't get any sales if you don't have the space to sell and so right now we have much more opportunity to sell than we've had in quite some time. So, I look forward to the future and I'm grateful to work with such a good great group of people to accomplish what we've accomplished so far. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference, thank you for your participation, you may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-25 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to CoreSite Realty's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Carole Jorgensen, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.
Carole Jorgensen: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to CoreSite's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on the conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages on our website at www.coresite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today I will share our first quarter highlights, discuss our development pipeline and cover a couple of significant recent events. Steve will cover our sales results and discuss how we continue to evolve our customer offerings, and Jeff will take you through our financial results, including all recent financing activities. Let me start by summarizing our accomplishments in the first four months of the year. We're executing well in our 2019 imperatives to create the momentum necessary to accelerate growth in 2020. These include substantial progress on our development pipeline, additional financing to fund the new capacity, strong sales execution with the highest core retail co-location sales in 10 quarters, pre-leasing of two phases of our new SV8 purpose-built data center, and financial results consistent with where we are in the development cycle and in line with our expectations, all of which we believe position us well for achieving higher growth in 2020. Turning to our financial highlights for the quarter; we grew operating revenue 7.2% year-over-year, delivered a $1.25 of FFO per share and grew adjusted EBITDA 2.2% year-over-year. Consistent with our forecast for the first quarter, our results reflect higher than normal churn and interest in operating expenses associated with recently completed developments now in lease up. Moving to sales, we did a good job of achieving momentum this quarter. Our sales were driven by our core retail co-location and included $6.6 million of annualized GAAP rent compared to $4.2 million last quarter. Turning to our customer offerings; we launched our new CoreSite interconnect gateway, a fully-managed service designed to help enterprises achieve their digital strategies which Dave will talk more about. We also made substantial progress on our development pipeline. During this quarter we launched a 20,000 square foot data center expansion in Boston, and a 35,000 square foot data center expansion at NY2. We began construction on the first phase of CH2 in downtown Chicago, we advanced our ground-up developments at VA3 Phase 1B in Virginia and SV8 Phase 1 at Santa Clara as we expect to achieve our targeted completion dates for both datacenters. At LA3 we continue to work with the local power company and government, and expect to know more the permitting progress later this quarter. Turning to a few of our notable subsequent events in April; on April 12 we closed on the purchase of the Santa Clara property that we refer to as SB9 where we anticipate constructing an estimated 200,000 net rentable square foot data center in the future. On April 15, we pre-leased both Phases 1 and 2 at SV8 for 108,000 square feet. As a result, we're accelerating construction of Phases 2 and 3 and targeting completion in late Q4 of 2019 for Phase 2 and the first half of 2020 for Phase 3. On April 17, we've closed on $400 million of senior notes, $325 million of which were issued immediately, and we expect to issue the remaining $75 million by mid-July. As I discussed previously, 2019 is a transition year for us. We entered the year with leasable capacity at lower levels compared to our historical norms and we've planned to end 2019 with leasable capacity plus quickly developable incremental capacity at the higher levels we experienced in previous years. To ensure a successful transition, our 2019 priorities include translating new construction into more abundant sales, acquiring additional new customer logos, bringing new connectivity and customer service products online to drive sales into delivering great customer experience and operational efficiencies. I'm pleased that we are executing effectively on these priorities as evidenced by our year-to-date accomplishments. That said, we still have much work ahead of us including scale leasing at VA3, keeping construction on a good pace at CH2 and SV8, finalizing power and permits for LA3, and obtaining entitlements power into permits for SB9. I have confidence in our teams which are working diligently and effectively on all of these activities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks Paul. Today I'll start off with a summary of our quarterly sales and leasing results and then talk more about our new customer solutions and growing connectivity offerings. Moving to our sales, for the quarter we had sales of $6.6 million of annualized GAAP rent which included 32,000 net rentable square feet at an average rate of $207 per square foot and was comprised entirely of core retail co-location sales. A few highlights on our sales; our $6.6 million annualized GAAP rent represented the highest quarter of annualized GAAP rent for core retail co-location sales in 10 quarters. And our sales included 30 new logos compared to 32 last quarter, and while revenues from new logos were down from prior quarter, enterprise sales with quality brands that we expect to drive future growth remains strong. We also see a strong pipeline for future new logo wins as we're continuing our strategic effort to bring new growth engines to the platform. Turning to pricing; for the quarter pricing on new and expansion leases was consistent with the trailing 12-month average on a per kilowatt basis for core retail co-location sales. Renewals were also another key aspect of our leasing. During the first quarter, our customer renewals included annualized GAAP rent of $11.9 million with rent growth of 3.2% on a cash basis, and 5.9% on a GAAP basis. And as previously forecasted, rental churn of 2.7% was higher than normal for the quarter reflecting churn of two larger deployments. Moving to the next retail and scale co-location leasing. The first quarter leasing represented all retail co-location sales. However as Paul mentioned, in April, we pre-leased a majority of our SV8 data center through hyper-scale leasing of valuable ecosystem components at our Santa Clara campus. As our development pipeline turns of new capacity, we look forward to the opportunity to having greater contiguous space available for additional scale leasing. Next, I would like to turn our focus on evolving our offerings in order to deepen our customer value while providing additional forms of revenue to the company. Building on our new service and connectivity offerings delivered in 2018 through a few of our ongoing efforts to enrich our ecosystem and help attract new customers to our data centers. In March, we launched the CoreSite Interconnect Gateway for SIG. SIG is a true gateway product to initiate and smooth a new enterprises transition into our data centers by providing a more secure, reliable and higher performance connection between enterprise and our data centers which can serve as a pivot point for building hybrid cloud architecture at our campuses and migrate data there too, and be scalable to add connections to other CoreSite data centers as a basis to dramatically lower customer WAN costs. In April, we announced hybrid network connections to Google Cloud available in our Denver and Los Angeles markets. This service from Google Cloud enables enterprises and network service providers that are co-located with CoreSite to directly connect to the Google Cloud platform through a high speed fiber interconnect. In summary, we've had a solid start to sales for the year and we're looking to build on those results by executing well on leasing our available space, driving new data center capabilities, and providing exceptional customer service for our differentiated services. With that I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve and hello everyone. Today I will review our financial results for the quarter, provide an overview of our April financing, and discuss our financial guidance. Turning to our detailed results for the quarter. As expected, based on where we are in development and due to higher than normal churn, this was a relatively flat quarter. Our total operating revenues were a $138.9 million for the quarter which increased 7.2% year-over-year and were in-line sequentially. Operating revenues consisted of a $117.9 million of rental, power and related revenue, $18.4 million of interconnection revenue, and $2.6 million of office, light industrial and other revenue. Interconnection revenue increased 11.2% year-over-year, and 2.2% sequentially. FFO was $1.25 per diluted share which decreased $0.02 per share year-over-year, and $0.01 per share sequentially, largely due to property tax and interest rate increases and dilution from pre-stabilized developments. Adjusted EBITDA of $74.5 million grew 2.2% year-over-year, and was in line sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.6% for the quarter and we expect full year 2019 margins to be within our guidance range. Sales and marketing expense totaled $5.7 million for the quarter or 4.1% of total operating revenues, and in line with our expectations for the full year. General and administrative expenses totaled $10.2 million for the quarter or 7.3% of total operating revenues, in line with our expectations for the full year. For the quarter we commenced 24,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $242 per square foot which represented $5.8 million of annualized GAAP rent. Moving to backlog, as of March 31st, the projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $8.9 million or $13.6 million on a cash basis. We expect most of the GAAP backlog to commence in the next two quarters. Keep in mind, that this backlog excludes all sales activities that occurred in April. Turning to our property operations and development; first quarter same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent was $1,556, reflecting an increase of 6.7% year-over-year and 0.6% sequentially. Q1 same-store turnkey datacenter occupancy was 89.2%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year and a decrease of a 110 basis points sequentially. We have a total of 428,000 square feet of data center capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. With $262 million of cost incurred to-date of an estimated total cost of $671 million or $409 million of cost to complete these projects. This includes all 3 phases of SV8 and two new data center expansions including one in Boston and the other at NY2 in the New York area. For more details on our development projects please see Page 19 of our supplemental information. Capitalized interest for the quarter of $2.6 million represented 21.7% of total interest in line with our full year estimates of 20% to 24%. Turning to our balance sheet; as we've shared previously we expected to access the capital markets this year for $350 million to $400 million in the form of additional debt and to term out the outstanding balance on a revolving credit facility which we just completed. On April 17, we entered into a note purchase agreement and agreed to issue and sell an aggregate principal amount of $200 million of Series A notes due April 2026 with the coupon of 4.11%, and $200 million of Series B notes due April 2029 yielding 4.31%. On April 17, we issued $200 million of the Series A notes and $125 million of the Series B notes and expect to issue the remaining $75 million of the Series B notes prior to July 17, 2019. The initial proceeds for the notes were used to pay down outstanding amounts on the revolving portion of our senior unsecured credit facilities. This provides us the ability to borrow $445 million under the revolving credit facility and along with the expected additional note proceeds of $75 million and $2 million in cash results in total liquidity of $522 million, which we plan to use primarily to fund the $409 million of remaining costs on our current development pipeline. Turning to our financial guidance, in terms of guidance changes, we've increased our annual churn expectations by 100-basis points due to a pending customer bankruptcy filing. As a result, we have arranged for the customer to vacate its deployment in the third quarter and expect to receive payments to utilize their current capacity and terminate their current license in August, 2019. Our annual guidance for 2019 churn is now 7% to 9%. As communicated previously, we continue to expect our second quarter churn to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%. We are also increasing the range of data center expansion capital expected for 2019 to $405 to $465 million and total capital expenditures now expected to be $425 to $500 million. This increase is primarily as a result of our pre-leasing at SV8 and the accelerated development of Phases 2 and 3. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you. Good morning out there. So, first I wanted to just touch base on the scale leasing you guys accomplished first quarter-end if I could. Can you talk a little bit about the type of tenant, if it was one tenant and maybe any terms of lease that you could share?
Steve Smith: Hi, Jordan, this is Steve. I think we've kind of shared as much as we possibly can around the lease. Obviously, most of our customers in general, but especially those larger hyperscale lease have a lot of confidentiality surrounding the lease itself. So, I think we've shared about what we can there.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And will you guys -- I mean, is it safe to assume that you guys will be able to achieve the typical 12% return hurdle?
Steve Smith: Yes, I think it's safe to assume that we will maintain that expectation for SV8.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And is it possible that the Phase 3 could see a similar type of lease? In other words, maybe same -- is this one tenant?
Steve Smith: It's one lease. Yes.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And is it possible that SV Phase 3 could go to the same tenant as well? They have an option on it or not?
Steve Smith: I'm not sure that we can disclose any of those details. As we mentioned in a prior remarks, we are in construction planning to kick that off here soon. So that will be available.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then maybe just moving to the bankruptcy that's pending, anything, Jeff, that you could share as it relates to that tenant exposure or that churn event? So, is that -- will churn just be an average or a lower number in 3Q versus 1Q and 2Q still or is that going to be elevated and is there anything else you can kind of share about this tenant maybe? Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, you bet. I think in general, as you think about churn for the third quarter, based on what we expect today, inclusive of the customer, I would expect churn in the third quarter to be up in that same range as we've given for the first half, which would be somewhere 2% to 2.5%. So, keep that in mind as you think through it. Again, that would be inclusive of this particular customer. I think just some other color on commentary, we've obviously had received some questions prior to the call regarding the customer name and can we give visibility or not, I just think in general, we're really not in a position to comment on who the customer is. We just don't think that that's our position to do so. I would say however, that the particular customer will be vacating an entire computer room in our data center. And as we think about it, there's very little, if any capital that Steve did to get that room ready to release it to the market. It isn't a market where we've had some good results over the past 18 months and Steve and his team have a strong funnel currently in that particular market. And obviously, we hate to see any customers going into bankruptcy, but we wish them well, they've been a good customer for us and that we wish them well as they continue their future business plan. The other last thing I'd add is just due to the customer vacating the space, that obviously adds some turmoil in terms of their operations. And we've been working with them to the extent any of those customers didn't want to leave that particular location. We have accommodated them and have taken them some of those customers on directly and made them just direct customers of CoreSite. So, we're currently working closely with the customer, helping them out where we can and we're helping them out and vice versa, wherever we can make ends meet.
Jordan Sadler: The service provider or third-party reseller of sorts then.
Jeff Finnin: Yes. I think that's a fair description absolutely.
Steve Smith: I think I just had a little more color from Jeff's comments there. We continue to have further conversations with some of their client base there to make sure there's a smooth transition and if there's an opportunity to have them remain in the building, those are active conversations.
Jordan Sadle: Okay. Last one to Jeff on financing sources of capital. I know you took your CapEx guidance step a little bit here. What would you estimate leverage would be at year-end on a net debt to EBITDA basis?
Jeff Finnin: Great question, Jordan. Obviously, we executed on the financing in April and I think as we had said, we assumed we would accomplish a majority of that financing for the year here in the first half. I think we probably went a little bit more than expected just due to pricing and the economics in the private placement. Having said that, I think from a leverage perspective, today, our stated policies to be somewhere around 4.5 times debt to EBITDA, we ended the quarter at 4.1 debt EBITDA. And I think as you look at the capital expectations for the rest of the year, it's likely we will exceed 4.5 times. Obviously, it's dependent on the adjusted EBITDA growth. We are comfortable taking that leverage an excess of 4.5, probably up to 5 times. However, just keep in mind, as we've said previously, that's ultimately a board decision and we'll continue to have those conversations with our board and to the extent that that formal policy changes, we'll get that communicated. But I would expect it to increase over 4.5 times throughout the year and we'll continue to have that conversation with our board in terms of the formal policy itself.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: Thank you. My question actually pertains to the interconnection revenue growth that we saw in the quarter and could you help us understand the dynamics here regarding why interconnection revenue has grown so much faster than rental revenue in the quarter? And it's almost a multiplier of two times as far as growth rates specifically in this quarter. And this dynamic hasn't really occurred in your model for about eight quarters and I just want to understand why it's happening specifically now and then I have a follow-up.
Jeff Finnin: Good morning, Sami. Let me try and address that as best I can for you and just something to think about for modeling. But in general, the interconnection revenue growth is from a pure quantity perspective, is dependent upon the types of deployments we sell in quarters probably, I'd say anywhere between one to two years preceding that particular quarter. And the reason for that is you typically get a trail of increase in interconnections as that customers deploying. And so, it's always follows the ultimate deployment of the customer's particular gear. So, it's important to just understand the composition of the type of deployments and ultimately what that means in terms of interconnection revenue growth. When we have higher retail coal co-location leasing, it will lead to a higher density of cross-connects for every kilowatt we sell as compared to the scale leasing. So, just keep that in mind as you think about it. And in terms of revenue growth, keep in mind when you look at the numbers, as we've said publicly, about two-thirds of that revenue growth comes from growth, impure quantity of our cross-connects. The other one-third of revenue comes from customers who are shifting due to volume needs on our open cloud exchange or possibly [indiscernible] exchange where they just need higher bandwidth. And those pricing step -- it steps up pricing without increasing quantities just to the higher volumes needed in those particular summit. So, you get about two-third coming from Peter Quantities, about a third of our revenue growth comes from a composition or a higher price product mix.
Steve Smith: Yes. Sami, and I guess the final piece of that is in Q4, as you think about 2018 in general, there was quite a bit of disconnects relative to M&A activity and consolidation there, of what you saw a fair amount of that in Q4 of which we did see some leveling off. And actually, the less of as we came out of Q1, so that obviously had a positive impact.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you. And then the follow-up related kind of to this is I'm assuming that a lot of your tenants are transitioning their switches from 10-gig speeds to 100-gig speeds. Can you give us an idea on where we are in this entire transition or this process? And then are you seeing any foreign a gig deployments given your customer compositions?
Steve Smith: Yes. I mean, as far as the interconnection product itself is concerned, the 100-gig migration has been going on for quite some time and we haven't seen a material impact of that as far as the overall number of cross-connects. As you know, the growth in overall IP traffic and data traffic in general has continued to ramp up and we hope the foreseeable future. So, that continues to offset any kind of efficiencies, but you start getting out of 10 gig to 100 gig or even greater than that. As far as the traffic that we see on those interconnections, we really don't see the traffic. Those are fiber connections that we pass between our customers and the traffic that they move on that whether it's 1, 10, 100 or more, is really dependent upon the gear that they put on either end of that light. So, we do see some higher speeds than that and some gear that's coming out to support that, but nothing material at this point.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you for the color. And then as just a model clarification question for you regarding real estate taxes and insurance, the percentage of revenues of that expense went up to 4.5% of revenues versus prior quarters. It just kind of stood out. Is that because of the new facilities or anything else? And this is pertaining mainly to real estate insurance. Maybe you could just help me understand what is going on regarding this step up.
Jeff Finnin: Yes. Sami, just really two things. We've talked a couple of times over the last probably year or so, just some commentary related to taxes. And I think in general, we've seen a general increase in real estate taxes through our portfolio that's largely driven by each of those municipalities as they're looking at and estimating overall assessed values. And so, I think that's going to continue. The other item is as we complete development of certain computer rooms and in the fourth quarter we completed DC2, any taxes associated with properties that come out of development, obviously we started absorbing that into our income on our operating results as it was being capitalized during the development, should it be in those results. So, just keep that in mind. Insurance is up a little bit, but the majority of that increase is really being driven by the property tax increases.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: That's great. Three quick ones. One is I'm wondering if you can disclose the GAAP rental revenue that you got from your customers since that's something you do typically. Obviously, give us each quarter just if you're giving us the megawatts was hoping you can give us the GAAP rental revenue. And then secondly, as relates to that customer churn, I was wondering what the termination fees are that you're anticipating getting from that customer. And I assume you will recognize those as is rental revenue, but just confirming that. And then, lastly on SB9, can you just tell us what's on that land right now and how long in broad brush strokes you think you could take before you could actually get a facility up and running there? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Colby, I guess I'll take those. When we report our second quarter sales results will include all the GAAP revenue from the April lease three lease in those results. But as Steve mentioned, we can't disclose that on an individual basis. The same kind of confidentiality provision applies to the termination fees we've negotiated with the tenant that's going into bankruptcy. So, I apologize, but we can't disclose those items of information. SB9, similar to SV8, currently has a building on it. It's a single story, a multi-tenant office building, service office type of building. All the leases will expire before or be terminated pursuant to the terms before we have to develop. Our critical path really starts with the entitlements process and then power process and then the specific permitting process. On SV8 that took about 12 months to get through. I would estimate it's going to be about 10 to 14 months in the case of SB9 because as you probably are aware, there are new power provisioning practices in California that add a little bit more time to your design before you can get into environmental reviews. And then once we start demolition and site work, it typically takes about 12 months from that point to deliver the datacenter. Obviously, there's a lot we can't predict or control in these processes, but our team has been very proactive and doing a good job trying to line up everything for as seamless process as we can have. But I think that's kind of the right range to put soft expectations run.
Colby Synesael: It sounds like broad brush strokes maybe mid-2021 we can get something there. And then just that you answer these first two questions so quickly, the VA3, I think there's been expectations first for several quarters now to be honest, that that would've gotten pre-leased by now and we still just haven't seen that. And you mentioned in your own prepared remarks that that's being a focus. Why do you think that that has taken so long and just kind of give us a little bit more color on what the pipeline for that potential opportunity is right now? Thank you.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Colby. I'll take that one. As far as VA3 is concerned, we've actually had some good retail leasing in V8. We're already in our initial phase there. So, that continues to show good traction and great quality brands that we brought into that building. So, the VA3 campus itself is often running and to a good start. So, it's 1B which I think you're referring to, we're nearing completion, but I think as you look at that overall market, as you know, there's more inventory in that market and I think as you look at pre-leasing, any market that has more available inventory is going to have a shorter window of time to pre-release. We continue to see a robust pipeline there and are on active conversations with customers. But as we've mentioned on other calls, we are disciplined on how we approached these larger leases to ensure that they either contribute to or value our ecosystem and are also a good return for our investors. So, it's a balance of all those things too ensure it's a good fit.
Colby Synesael: So, you still are pursuing a hyperscale least for Phase 1B. And I guess based on what you're seeing, you think there's a good chat, we can get that done once that facility opens?
Steve Smith: Again, we balance those things between the scale of a hyperscale lease with the return that we expect to drive for the overall campus. So, it's both of those things and scale leasing and hyperscale leasing comes in all forms and fashions and as well as size. And we continue to evaluate those and work with our pipeline of customers to try to drive a good fit there. So, it is important to us. We know we need to drive greater traction there and that's the focus from me and the team.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Aryeh Klein: Thank you. Maybe just following-up on that last question within VA3, do you still expect to deliver the 12% returns or do you think it might go lower from here?
Paul Szurek: As Steve mentioned and as we've mentioned on quarterly calls for some time, from a pricing standpoint is our most competitive market. And while we still think it's achievable to hit our targeted returns on VA3 as a whole, it is going to be a bigger push at VA3 than it is in our other markets.
Aryeh Klein: Okay. Maybe turning to Chicago, it looks like occupancy dropped a little bit in the quarter. Can you talk about what's happening there? And then you have -- sorry.
Paul Szurek: It was just one of those churn events.
Aryeh Klein: Okay. But with CH2 coming online in the first half of next year, do you feel any differently about the opportunity in Chicago than maybe you did a few quarters ago?
Paul Szurek: No, I think we feel the same and maybe probably a little bit better. What do you say, Steve?
Steve Smith: Yes, I think so too. I mean, we did have a couple of customers that we expected to turn and have, but the overall pipeline still remains strong even before CH1 for that matter. So, I think Chicago is one of those markets where it will be especially our position there, which is downtown and providing a modernize scalable facility that's connected to a heavily interconnected side of CH1. We think we got to a very unique value proposition in a great market.
Operator: Next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. So, I'm interested just real quick as a point of clarification on the, of course, the interconnected gateway. To what extent does that leverage third-party partners versus being an entirely homegrown product?
Jeff Finnin: Sure. Thanks for the question. It's difficult to try to give the full color of that in our prepared remarks, but it really is a service that we've worked with our partners on to provide essentially a rack of equipment that the customer would have fully managed from one of our partners there would reside in our data center. So, that starts their co-location experience with CoreSite and that can then support the customer in multiple ways. The first is providing a secure high-performance connection between our data center and their enterprise location that then provides an efficient and secure and high-performance way for them to connect to all the native on-ramps that we've worked very hard to establish where they are in our data centers. So, it gets them onto those cloud on-ramp very quickly and securely, which they otherwise wouldn't have from their enterprise location. And then from there they can either access to other data centers that we may have in order to diversify their cloud ramp experience and give them access to other availability zones or act as we expect it to, as to be really kind of a stepping stone for them to expand their co-location footprint within our data center into more of the hybrid enterprise deployment that we have seen more of.
Jonathan Atkin: But you wouldn't leverage other parties [indiscernible] offering. It's really your own homegrown products from a connectivity standpoint it sounds like.
Jeff Finnin: As far as the data center itself, it's obviously our data center, but as far as the equipment and the management of that equipment, we are working with our partners to provide that service. So we're not providing a managed service directly to our customer that's through one of our partners.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay. And then on SV8, any kind of color you can share around the commencement schedule around that commitment and kind of over multiple years or multiple quarters?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. I think I can give you a little bit of color there without any issue with the confidentiality components that we mentioned earlier. So, as you think about the two phases that this customer signed up for we expect the first phase of that to commence late Q3 and the second phase of that to commence late Q4 of this year.
Steve Smith: Very consistent with our construction completion [indiscernible].
Jonathan Atkin: But presumably, there will be a moving ramp. And so, would there be further kind of additive commencements that take place in subsequent quarters associated with that? Or is it pretty much once it's completed you're getting full rent contract condition?
Jeff Finnin: I don't know that I can give you any more color than what I just gave you.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay. And then lastly, I was just interested in kind of more of a broad question because we've kind of touched on Virginia and Chicago and a little bit LA, but just as you see the pipeline overall demand profile across the company, what are some of the markets going forward where you see potential for scale at leasing?
Jeff Finnin: Well, I think as you looked at where we are investing in capital and building new facilities as well as expanding in place capacity, we have a lot of opportunity ahead of us. The top four markets as we've historically provided and displayed growth in I think will remain strong. So, when we think about LA, the Bay Area, Virginia, as well as New York, and we've even seen some growth in Boston as well. Chicago really has been hampered by not having a modernized facility that can support it. And we look to have some of that growth come out of Chicago as well. So, we look to see more diversity across the platform as more of that capacity comes online. But in each of those cases we do expect some scale type of leasing.
Operator: Next question comes from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Erik Rasmussen: Tanks for taking the questions. First, the outlook for next year, based on your comments maybe trending a somewhat higher revenue growth, can you just help us reconcile what that means and how it compares to your previous expectations for low double-digit growth?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. Good morning, Erik. Obviously, consistent with what we've outlined for 2019, we got a lot of things ahead of us in terms of trying to work through and obviously through the first four months of the year we've made a lot of good progress. I think Paul touched on that and probably we will try and summarize a little bit more. So, I don't want to get too far out ahead of our skis [ph] in terms of declaring victory on 2020 guidance at this point in time. I would just say that obviously in our forecast and ultimately embedded into that guidance we gave is for us to execute on some portion of scale leasing, which Steve and his team are focused on. And I'm not sure today as we sit here today, I would just confirm where we are marching towards in 2020 and that is to hit low double-digit revenue adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share growth. I wouldn't modify anything from what we've said today.
Erik Rasmussen: Okay, great. And then maybe you do talk a lot about your new logos and new logo wins, but I think last quarter you talked about existing customers and what you could be doing. Can you give us an update there and any initiative that you're planning to kind of really accelerate growth from this segment and some of the things you can comment on the quarter and maybe upcoming for Q2?
Steve Smith: So, one of the things I think you saw even coming into this quarter was a bit of a resurgence and our basic spending with us, which is good to see. That was a little bit lighter in Q4. But we continue to make that a focus not only in having them grow their space with us but serve them in new ways, either through interconnection to the Open Cloud Exchange, for example and enhancing that. We announced our upgrade of our Open Cloud Exchange and some of the capabilities there on the last call. But also, intersite [ph] connect connectivity between our various campuses and we see more adoption there. And then the other things like I mentioned earlier on the call relative to our CoreSite interconnect gateway and those types of things. So, part of it is having them go expand their footprint, go into new markets, but also deepen those services and, therefore, the revenue that goes along with them. So, we're [indiscernible] as far as those enhanced services, but we're trying to be diligent about what we roll out and ensure that it actually does provide value and is represented by demand in the market and we'll execute accordingly.
Operator: Next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get your comments on a potential investment grade rating down the road and I know you just priced that at some attractive rates, but my question is have the conversations with the agencies changed recently now that Equinox has an investment grade rating? And is this something you are even pursuing?
Paul Szurek: Good Morning Nate. Let me just give you some color and maybe some observations related to that but, just in general, we’ve always operated our company and managed our capital in a manner for us to try and achieve investment grade rating, and in an appropriate time. Instead of that something we’ve been focused on and continued to be focused on. However, in addition I should say we meet with the litigations is on a very regular basics, at least once in a year with each of the agencies, just to continue to have those conversations and discussions. I will say that, it’s been good to see some of the movements from the rating agency, specifically to our pear side I think that that’s been a good sign. I know they and we have all been working hard to educate and to help keep them informed on the industry and I think they’ve been making some movements and I think that’s all headed to the right direction. We were totally an objective of ours and something we keep focused on but today, it hasn’t been needed at least in the public realms, but at some point as we continue to scale our company that’s purely something we focused on.
Steve Smith: I would only add, the investment grade rating for private bonds.
Nate Crossett: Okay. So, have you investment grades. What did you even change the grade -- that you could pursue at?
Steve Smith: That's really driven more by our capital allocation decisions and where we have opportunities and I don’t think it’s essential for us to be able to fund and good rate of opportunities, that we’ve have been pursuing is to work with.
Operator: Next question comes from Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: I just wanted to go kind of go into the higher turn rate, but overall revenue kind of holding same. Can you give us some puts and takes on what’s going better, despite the increase in return that makes you uncomfortable or keeping the revenue down to till the year?
Paul Szurek: Good morning, Richard. I would just say in general, as we look at our forecast through the rest of the year and obviously updated for Q1 results. You always have a lot of puts and takes throughout the operations of the company and obviously those have been updated. We’ve updated the guidance’s you have touched on, some of it related to return and some of it related to our CapEx spent. Obviously, it’s early in the year, but as we sit here today, the wiz that we going to have, we still are affirming the guidance from a revenue perspective and expect to be somewhere in that range but, it’s early in the year, we need to keep you updated and prices as we move forward. But nothing specific I can point to as we sit here today, other than today we are still comfortable with the guidance we have out there today.
Richard Choe: I don't know if you can answer this. Given the market that the -- previously done, is it fair to say that, it’s kind of your normal greater return for a whole sale dealer or could it be higher to relatively tighter market?
Paul Szurek: Again, we will talk about expect returns on property as a whole but not as to individual transactions.
Operator: Next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Can you comment little bit about pricing across various markets? Where are you seeing some strengths in the markets and what markets facing a little weaker and then if you can give us a general comment about how you view M&A? What assets are there in the market currently? How do you view assets that, may be where the owner owns all the underlying [indiscernible] and building and so forth and that they don’t and how that factor into your process and as you look at that? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: I will jump in where Steve normally converges to make it quick but, as you can see from our results, pricing is trending to be pretty stable through all of our markets with the same thing we’ve have been saying lot of Virginia last few quarters that has been a decline and scale and under-pricing over the last eighteen months, seems to be kind of [indiscernible] down there, but that dynamic is still there for Virginia. As we also set up previous calls, we do evaluate MNA opportunities. We have pretty tight criteria on that, what makes sense and it haven’t seen it and obviously yet other than that two very small one’s we’ve have in our history. I think everybody would value at our owned properties differently, then least properties with that certainly be their view then, and we welcome you to look what’s their out then.
Operator: Next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Doe: Number of you appears of discussing JV’s or selling more matured facilities like cycle cap project development and Can you vision sense for foresight nature of your campuses and business plans, makes a lot sustainable.
Paul Szurek: I think that it's not likely, probably a higher cost of capital that we are able to achieve. Following our historic strategy and the ways of modern value in our connective campuses and remember we also include a lot of much around scale and intensity around campuses ant there is value for everyone to have experience to get [ph] ownership and so for those reasons, I would say there is probably and likely for us. But again, we all evaluate opportunities, just keep an open mind.
Nick Del Doe: Got it. I want a county one for Jeff. Which one would straight assumption break in between [indiscernible]. And so, we think that the FBS was starting moving just impact with more at normal levels?
Jeff Finnin: Good Morning Nick. We’ve would expect as you sought coming something around $1.2 million for actual add back for AFFO purposes for this quarter and that’s largely been driven by the leases which were actually the lessee, what we have got some straight line expands up in our operations. I would just say that, typically on larger scale and hyper scale leases, we technically see some straight line affects, especially once the leases commence and so as you see some of those occurring later this year, you could see that straight line impact start to moderate and crossly reverse back to the other scenario, in the income state. So, I would say, expected to moderate this year and possibly as you get to 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave Rodgers: Just wanted to ask a little bit of color on Boston and NY2. Those were two visible markets heating up and already we have some of space available at NY2. So, may be a little color on, just kind of what do you expect and kind how do you look few markets and in aside to that, it looks like that, this next phase that NY2 talked about as much as on since the last phase. So could have a little color on that as well.
Steve Smith: Sure. I’ll just give you a little bit of color as far as the sales pipeline and the approach and those two markets and just can talk more about the precaution and the financing. As far as the overall market circumstance, we’re actually very bullish in both of those markets. In fact, if you look at back to last couple of quarters, Boston has been one of our stronger market sales that relates to sales execution area and so that the growth and the buildout that we are doing there is based on some of the distraction we have seen on customers from coming in. So, we’ve staffed a little bit higher there, as well to support their demand and we are excited about the opportunity at Boston. New York. We have continued to see new logos come through the door, the activity actually is very strong there and the pipeline looks very strong. So, again we're trying to align our capital based off of where we see the demand and we need to execute against that demand but we're bullish about where that heads.
Jeff Finnin: Good Morning, Dave. The only thing I'll like to add to Steve and just specifically related to the cost question is, in -- at NY2 in this particular buildout it was more efficient and much more price effective to build out some more of our back -- what we've referred to -- I guess, just our back plain infrastructure related to a future phase. And so we're just adding some infrastructure earlier to support another room buildup that will come later down the line and it was just more effective and efficient for us to do at this point in time.
Dave Rodgers: And then maybe just a border question on -- you've got about 40 megawatts, I think set to complete between now and in the middle of 2020. And there has been a lot of questions about different development yields by projects or even by lease but can you kind of talk about where you expect that to shake out in the next 40 megawatts kind of -- from an earnings power perspective? How should we think about kind of that set at development yield in the aggregate in terms of what that can contribute given how you're thinking about whether it's hyper-scale or co-low leasing?
Steve Smith: I think when you look at the chart we've got on Page 19 and we're supplement on that out really by particular expansion. I think the way to think of it is as follows: any time we're doing a ground-up construction, you're going to see generally lower yields in those first phases, and the yields will increase as we build up [indiscernible] phases just due to the investment we're having to make in the first phase where we're basically investing about 50% of our overall cost of that project. So that's -- so as you think about it to the extent we have pre-releasing like what we did at SV8, you'll see that come on much quicker than you might otherwise where we're leasing it up over a longer period of time. Where you've got those computer rooms just being built out inside an existing shell, obviously those are going to deliver -- those returns on that incremental capital are going to be substantially higher. And so just think about maybe taking those two components and putting some blend in there, I don't know what it would come out on a blended basis, I haven't done the math myself but I have better idea of where it is on a particular projects but just keep that in your mind as you work through in your estimates.
Operator: Next question comes from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman: Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe I'll ask you something that you will touch from a different angle. With the near-term deliveries that are scheduled in the second quarter, should we expect a return of leasing of the over 5,000 square foot deployments as they have been absent for the past two quarters? So should we be expecting that to be included in the second quarter leasing, basically, and obviously excluding SV8?
Paul Szurek: Well, I would say that, since we are in Q2 I'm not going to comment on where we are going to end up in Q2. But I will say that now we are actively working with customers and are working to execute against the pipeline that presents itself. So, I really can't comment on where we -- our forward-looking statements and where we're going to finish the queue other than the guidance that we've already provided.
Robert Gutman: Also out of the 32,000 square feet that was leased in the quarter, I think it looks about 5,000 was in the pre-stabilized properties. Can you talk about where the rest kind of landed and just a little color on vertical and geographies for the rest of the leasing that occurred in the quarter?
Steve Smith: Maybe I can just start off with the overall markets. The markets that we closed in were kind of typical markets that you would expect from us as far as LA be in our top market; Santa Clara, Virginia -- so those were really kind of the top three for us. As far as the same-store versus other, I know Jeff is looking for that right now and I'm not going to add my fingertips right now.
Jeff Finnin: Yes. I think obviously from a same-store perspective Robert, there was some leasing associated with that. And as you saw sequentially, our occupancy dropped a little bit. We would expect that to come back a little bit as those deals commence and there was some of that associated with that same-store obviously.
Paul Szurek: I'm sorry, just going to give you some colors as far as the verticals are concerned. That was really kind of split about half to enterprise and then the other half split between network and cloud; so that gives you a little bit more color.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Roland [ph] with Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: Two, if I could. So first, the development yield guidance has stayed consistent around 12% to16%, but I was curious if you could unpack that with respect to what the expectation for development yield is for a retail deployment versus a hyper-scale deployment based on current market pricing? And then second, as I was looking at the top 10 customer list, I noticed that the bottom half with about 10% of revenue or rent is coming due to an average term of less than 12 months. How do you look at that in terms of opportunity for up-selling or renewal pricing versus maybe some of the risks on architectural changes, etcetera? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: So Michael, just as it relates to the different categories; as you know, we try to not give out that type of specific pricing in return figures. I think it's fairly common knowledge that retail leasing generates a higher return than hyper-scale leasing does. You know, we look at overall data center yields, we're looking at them on an expected mix; and I'll let Steve address the rest of the question.
Steven Smith: Yes, I would just say as far as the mix is concerned, we do look at the difference -- obviously, it takes longer and more of them from a retail perspective to fill up our data centers and get to a stabilize yield for the building; so we really do try to strike that balance and look at the overall blend of the population of each data center to try to get to do the yields that we've stated. So that's probably the best way to think about it. As far as the Top 10 customers are concerned; I think you're probably referencing two of those customers that have expired in the Top 10, and I would just give you some color there that we do look at this as opportunity for us to not only extend those terms but to grow them. For all of our customers, I mean for those two I would just give you some -- that we have actually renewed several other spaces, both of them have quite a few spaces with us and we've renewed some of them and expect to move forward with completing the renewal of both of them.
Operator: Next question comes from John Peterson with Jeffries. Please go ahead.
John Peterson: Thanks. I was wondering if you could update on kind of your sales force how well staffed that is right now, and historically for CoreSite and all of your peers that has always been a little bit of challenge with turnover in the sales force. I was just kind of curious any update there?
Paul Szurek: Yes, sure. I would give you a little color. I mean, I'm happy that we are fully staffed which is always a challenge to get staffed with quality folks that you would like to see. We haven't really changed the overall expense component of our sales and marketing team. We have changed the mix and kind of some of the roles that we have throughout our sales organizations whereas -- as well as where some of those people are located in their focus based off where we have capacity or expect capacity to come online. So, it really is more of a mix and positioning component that we try to work with but to make sure that we're hitting the market as best as possible. We shifted a couple of resources around from sales to be more technical and trying to help customers through their hybrid deployment journey, and I think that's borne some fruit for us, as well as I've mentioned, we're putting some of the resources in markets like Boston and Chicago where we expect more capacity to come online.
John Peterson: And then, I was curious with all the development you guys have coming online, the first phase stuff; I would assume that's going to weigh on EBITDA margins over the next couple of years. I guess is that a reasonable expectation? I mean, I guess -- how do you think about your kind of long-term adjusted EBITDA margin targets with the company?
Steve Smith: I think it's accurate that as we roll-off some of this development and start going to lease up, it is not going to give us the opportunity to expand those margins. I think that's the best way I'd look at it. I think they should be fairly consistent as we roll through some of this development and get it through lease up. Having said that, I would then just say the longer term and this goes on beyond probably 2020. I think we have an opportunity to expand that margin by maybe 100 basis points to 200 basis points but that's something we've got to think through on exactly how to execute on it. And I think what's key to that is how can we continue to leverage inside our existing markets, and I do think we can scale off of them but it's just getting much harder to do that in the future as it's been in the past just given the size of the company and the way we've been making some investments but it's something we've got in our mind and something we'll work towards but as we get through the next year or year and a half, we'll continue to provide some color commentary around that. But I wouldn't expect it to expand as it has in the past but it's something I think there is still some room for improvement.
Operator: There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call over to Paul for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: Thank you. Carole, Jeff, Steve and I appreciate everyone's participation in this call. As you can see, we're pleased with what our colleagues have accomplished this year so far, and grateful for the opportunities ahead of us. We continue to see good demand for edge data center capacity in our markets, and now are bringing online the product to meet that demand. We have, and will probably always have much work ahead of us, and we have a great team pursuing all that work. We look forward to the future. Thank you. And have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-07 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the CoreSite Realty's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Carole Jorgensen, Vice President and Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin.
Carole Jorgensen: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to CoreSite's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I am joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our web site at CoreSite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I will share our key accomplishments for 2018, provide an annual overview of our business, and service models and share our 2019 priorities. Steve will then cover our sales results and initiatives to strengthen our market position and Jeff will take your financial results and our 2019 financial guidance. Our 2018 annual financial accomplishments showed another solid year of growth including revenue growth of 13%, FFO per share of $5.06, reflecting an increase of 14.2% or 11.9% growth after adjusting for 2017 one-time non-cash charge, and declare dividends of $4.14 per share, reflecting 15.6% growth. We achieved one of our primary sales goals of substantially growing no logo acquisitions. Annualized gap rent sold to new logos in 2018 increased 81% over 2017, and we added many important new companies to our customer communities. We also made significant progress on restoring our development pipeline in 2018. We placed in service nearly 172,000 net rentable square feet including data centers completed in Reston and Washington DC. We expect two new buildings under construction to come online in mid 2019 in Santa Clara and Northern Virginia, two of our biggest markets, and we proactively pursue further development in Santa Clara. In January, we entered into a contract for approximately 4 acre property adjacent to our existing campus to prepare for continued growth in that market. On the operational front, we delivered an approximate 7% improvement in power utilization efficiency on a same-store basis, compared to 2017 due to wise investments in new infrastructure and an ongoing program of operational improvements. We also achieved our highest uptime as a company, what we call seven 9s of reliability, thereby improving customer experience and reducing our operating costs. We also rolled out significant product improvements this year. We upgraded our open cloud exchange to an SDN architecture, which makes it significantly easier for customers to provision cloud interconnection and enables us to add additional features in a more agile manner. We also piloted and put customers in our first inter-market connectivity product and expanded our blended IP product. We also experienced some challenges in 2018. Our overall sales fell short of our goals. We underestimated the challenges selling when our occupancies were high and therefore capacity constrained, leading us to miss out on a number of good opportunities due to lack contiguous space. We expect this challenge will be mostly remedied as our SB8 and our VA3 Phase 1B buildings come online this year. We also expect to complete our LA1 expansion midyear, which will provide further opportunities. Construction commencement at our LA3 data center project in Los Angeles is still on hold due to delays at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and designing the power fleet for new facility, but we expect that design to be completed soon. On balance, 2018 was a solid year with much heavy lifting across our company to position us well for future years. Looking forward to 2019 and beyond, I would like to remind investors of the key components of CoreSite's items business model. Simply stated, we concentrated our activities in eight large metropolitan edge markets, which are rich in consumers and enterprises and where our extensive customer communities provide an outstanding platform for digital activities and transformation. Our campuses are characterized by major interconnection nodes and numerous cloud on-ramps, which anchor large, energy-efficient, highly flexible data centers where the widest possible range of customer deployment sizes and densities can be accommodated and where customers can interconnect with each other via short run, dark fiber or virtual connections providing the maximum performance bandwidth, reliability, flexibility and security. Our primary target customers include first enterprises in these markets through our moving to co-location to reduce the data service costs while increasing uptime and performance, and interconnecting to a powerful hybrid cloud and network ecosystem. Second, companies with edge needs in these markets; third, companies exchanging data traffic at these key internet points; and finally, companies who value deployments in these markets as part of a larger performance and cost strategy built around wide area network realignment. The flexibility of our model is shown by the range of leases we can accommodate. Our smallest new and expansion sales in 2018 was 1 critical kilowatt in our largest was 3 megawatts, and we have added significantly larger leases in the past years when we have more capacity to sell. We believe this speaks to the diversity of how we can drive revenue as we add new capacity. We leverage our service model to focus our leasing efforts on higher value deployments where there is a greater need for the components we offer compared to less differentiated offerings in the marketplace. Our 2019 priorities include; first, to translate new construction and a more abundant sales including to larger scale deployments in our edge markets; second, to continue to focus on acquiring additional new logos; third, to continue to bring new connectivity and customer service products online to increase sales from new and existing customers; and fourth, to continue to deliver great customer experience and ongoing operational efficiencies. We believe these priorities and our other operating objectives will continue to drive value for our customers and employees and shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul. I would like to start with a summary of our quarterly sales and leasing results and then spent some time on product enhancements. Turning to our sales results. For the quarter, we had sales of $4.2 million of annualized which included 16,000 rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $259 per square foot, comprised entirely of our core retail co-location sales. While our sales and scale and hyper-scale leasing were below our goals for the quarter, our performance included excellent growth to new logo additions, solid pricing and strong renewals. So, let me walk you through a few of these in more detail. We have discussed in prior calls, the goal of substantially growing new logos acquisitions in order to achieve greater diversity of our base, enhance our ecosystem and provide a platform for future organic growth. And we’re seeing some solid traction in that regard. Here are few highlights. The annual GAAP rent for new logo additions in 2018 increased 81% over 2017. In addition, the average weighted monthly lease term for 2018 new low winds increased by about six months for new logos in 2017 and the majority of these 2018 logos were driven by process with ongoing logo growth for cloud and network providers. Pricing was also an important focus for us. For the quarter pricing on a new and expansion leases was consistent with a trailing 12 month average on a per kilowatt basis driven by continued execution in the core retail co-location space, which typically supports, better pricing and profitability. Moving to scale leasing as Paul mentioned our capacity constraints impacted our sales opportunities primarily sells the scale co-location, which we believe will be addressed by our ongoing property development in our presale activity for projects nearing completion. We also have several markets for available inventory where we look to execute better and driving scale leasing. Renewals are another key aspect of the health of our business during the fourth quarter of customer renewals were strong with annualized GAAP rent of $22.5 million. Rent growth of 3% on a cash bases and 7% on a GAAP basis and rental churn of 1.9% for the quarter, which is better than expected. So the fundamentals of our business remain strong with increasing growth from new customers at logos signing with CoreSite, existing customers including key strategic accounts choosing extend their term and expand their space with us, and core retail co-location pricing levels remain firm. Additional focus going forward will be on executing well in the skill segment as those opportunities align with our value proposition and available capacity. In my role as Chief Revenue Officer, we're evaluating opportunities to evolve or offerings in order to deepen our customer value or providing additional forms of revenue to the Company. We have been working directly and through partners with the goal of making it easier to customers to continue the digital transformation journey. As such, there are several steps, we have delivered this year and look to expand as we go forward. In 2018, we upgraded open cloud exchange with SDN architecture; enabling easier on-boarding to cloud and SaaS providers as well as paving the way for future development; added Microsoft Azure Express Route private connectivity in our Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia markets; enabled enterprises with direct private connectivity between VMware and AWS in four markets including Boston, Denver, New York and Northern Virginia; introduced AWS' logical redundancy offering, a second native point of connectivity to AWS Direct Connect at our Silicon Valley campus; provided dedicated access to the Oracle cloud infrastructure in Northern Virginia and Washington DC campuses; enabled inner market connectivity; expanded the flexibility of our blended IP product and formalize the launch of our solution partner program to extend our reach and value through our ecosystem to help customers along their journey from IT assessment to transition services to ongoing support and management. I hope this gives you a sense of our ever evolving customer centric initiatives in our data centers. We’re focused on the collective value of our solutions to customers as we enable them to execute against their business plans and grow the relationships among each other. Technology is driving higher expectations in all companies to make it easier and faster to do business with them. We believe, we are key resource for enterprises upgrading their technology to better support their business in the future. Enterprises that can drive a better digital experience for their employees, customers and suppliers should win in their respective industries. We expect to be the cornerstone of how they successfully deliver digital transformation. With that, I will hand the call up to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and Hello everyone. Today, I would like to share some highlights of our 2018 financial performance, review our detailed fourth quarter financial results, update you on our property operations and development, and provide you our financial guidance for 2019. Looking at our financial results. Our full year 2018 results included 13% revenue growth, 14.2% of FFO growth per share, or 11.9%, after excluding a 2017 non-cash charge related to our preferred stock redemption. And adjusted EBITDA growth of 12.5% while maintaining an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.4%, and declare dividends of $4.14 per share or 15.6% growth. In 2018, we successfully access the capital markets and amended and expanded our credit facility which provided us $250 million of additional liquidity while extending our debt maturities as attractive rates. We were also an early adopter of the new lease and revenue accounting standards. So we've had that in our rearview mirror since the beginning of 2018. Moving to our fourth quarter financial results. Our total operating revenues were $139.1 million for the fourth quarter, which was in line with the third quarter and reflected a 10.5% increase year-over-year. Operating revenues consisted of a $118.3 million of rental power and related revenue, $18 million of inner connection revenue and $2.8 million of office wide industrial and other revenue. Interconnection revenue increased 1.8% sequentially and 10.9% year-over-year. FFO was $1.26 per diluted share and unit in line sequentially and an increase of 15.6% year-over-year or 6.8% growth after excluding the 2017 non-cash charge related to our preferred stock redemption. Adjusted EBITDA of $74.6 million increase 1.1% sequentially, and 8.5% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.6% up 57 basis points from the prior quarter and down 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the new lease accounting requirements that we implemented in 2018, higher power rates and increase property taxes. Sales and marketing expense totaled $5.4 million for the quarter or 3.9% of total operating revenue. For the year sales and marketing expense was $21 million or 3.9% of operating revenues in line with 2017. General and administrative expenses totaled $10.5 million for the quarter or 7.6% of total operating revenues. For the year, general and administrative expenses were $14.1 million essentially in line with our guidance. These expenses represented 7.4% of total operating revenues for 2018, compared to 7.8% in 2017. In the fourth quarter, we commenced 23,000 of net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $192 per square foot which represented $4.4 million of annualized gap rent. Moving to backlog as of year-end projected annualized gap rent from signs, but not yet commenced leases was $9.9 million and $14.3 million on a cash basis. We expect substantially all of the GAAP backlog to commenced during the first half of 2019. Turning to our property operations and development. Fourth quarter same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent was $1,537, reflecting a 1.6% sequential increase and a 6.3% increase year-over-year. Q4 same-store turnkey data center occupancy was 90.7%, an increase of 60 basis points sequentially. We ended the quarter with our stabilize data center occupancy at 92.8%, an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. During the fourth quarter, we completed construction and placed into the pre-stabilize pool 25,000, net rentable square feet for our DC2 data center. We have a total of 271,000 square feet of data center capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. This includes ground-up construction and VA3 Phase 1B of the and SB8 Phase 1, which together total 108000 square feet with $118 million incurred to date of an estimated $246 million. Data center expansions at LA1 and LA2 which together total 45,000 square foot with $9 million incurred to date of an estimated $34 million. And preconstruction of LA3 and CH2, which together represent 118,000 square feet with $39 million incurred to date of an estimated $250 million to complete the first phases of these projects. Collectively, these projects total $166.4 million invested as of the end of the fourth quarter of the estimated $530.2 million required to complete the projects. For more details on our development projects please see page 19 of the supplemental information. Turning to capitalized interest. The percent capitalize in the fourth quarter was 17.9% in the full-year percentage was 13.6%. For 2019, we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 20% to 24%, which is elevated compared to 2018 based on our development pipeline. Turning to our balance sheet. Our ratio of net principal debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times as of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $236.2 million of total liquidity, consisting of $233.6 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility and $2.6 million of cash. As a reminder, we announced last quarter that we expect to access the capital markets for $350 million to $400 million in the form of additional debt to term out the outstanding balances our credit facility. We expect the majority of the financing to be completed in the first half of 2019. As I stated last quarter, we are comfortable with modestly increasing our targeted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4.5 times. I would now like to address our 2019 guides. For context, it's important to note that our guidance reflects our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factoring changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions, or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. And bear in mind that our guidance reflects coming into the year with constraints capacity due to high occupancy and significant new capacity expected to be available mid-year and beyond. As detailed on page 23 of our fourth quarter supplemental information, our guidance for 2019 is as follows. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $580 million to $590 million, based on the midpoint of guidance which represents 7.5% year-over-year revenue growth which reflects the timing of our development pipeline in the current level of capacity entering the year. Connection revenue is estimated to be $74 million to $77 million. This reflects 8.3% growth at the midpoint. General and administrative expense is estimated to be $42 million to $44 million, representing 7.4% of total operating revenue at the midpoint. Net income is estimated to be $104 million to $109 million, representing $2.15 to $2.25 per share of net income to common shares, or $2.20 at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $316 million to $321 million. And at the midpoint reflects a 54.4% adjusted EBITDA margin and 7.6% year-over-year growth. FFO is estimated to be $5.21 to $5.31 per share in operating unit. At the midpoint this reflects 4% growth. As a reminder, this guidance reflects the plans of debt financing that I mentioned earlier. Other guidance includes rental churn, which is estimated to be 6% to 8% for the full year. Cash rent growth on data center renewals estimated at 2% to 4%. And capital expenditures which are estimated at $400 million to $450 million, including data center expansion of $380 million to $415 million, non-recurring investments of $5 million to $10 million, tenants improvements of $5 million to $10 million, and recurring capital expenditures of $10 million to $15 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: So I was interested in Steve's comments about better execution on scale leases going forward. And if you could maybe elaborate a little bit about what that looks like apart from having inventory to sell, what is it on the execution side that you think can drive better success? And then on the product side, you mentioned the OCX, the Open Cloud Exchange SDN offer. Is that something that you're offering because you can in anticipation of potential customer demand or are you seeing meaningful takeaways already you've kind of ramp that products and active customer interest or is that more on the come? Thank you.
Paul Szurek: Great. Hey, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. As it relates to better execution, I think, you'll hear me say that consistently regardless of our results. But I do think we can and should do better, especially in the scale leasing and really across the board. As it relates to scale leasing with the inventory that we have today, there are a few pockets where we have availability to sell scale deals today albeit a few. And I just think there is always areas where we can execute better as far as how we are aligning to the market, making sure that the market is aware of our -- our availability out there, how we're ensuring that our value is driven throughout the organization is making those decisions and that we position us in the most favorable light to win. So that's really just how do we ensure that those aspects come together and we continue to just try to get better in that regard. As it relates to your question around OCX and SDN, it really just sets the platform up for us to be able to provide those capabilities and automating the provisioning of logical circuits across our OCX. We have seen some initial interest and we are encouraged by the future of what that can provide us, not only for intra-market, but also inter-market and some additional enhanced services as we go forward. So it's really just kind of setting the stage for the future.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes. So if I could just follow up on that. Are there any sort of use cases that you could maybe illustrate in a generic fashion, that would be driving that demand? And then a last one, perhaps for Jeff. You mentioned the PUE improvement. How would you translate that into kind of margin lift? So on a same-capital basis without the benefit of cross-connect growth, what kind of margin lift would you have seen the PUE improvement that you referenced in the script? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Sure. So just to give you a couple of use cases, a great use case that we've already seen some demand for is where customers may be deployed in one market, but need access to a native on-ramp -- cloud on-ramp in another market, where they can access our Open Cloud Exchange, logically provision that circuit to gain access within our Open Cloud Exchange on the other end in different market and get that native connectivity. So that's a pretty common request, I would say. Another that it would be -- a pretty typical use case would be where our customers are deployed in more than one market, where they may have an active, active type of environment or perhaps want to just load share their requirements between different markets and they can share those from a connectivity standpoint and be able to turn those up and down, based on the amount of demand and amount of traffic that they need. So just a couple of examples for you. Now I'll let Jeff to answer your other question there.
Jeff Finnin: Jonathan, I would say that -- excuse me, in general, that PUE uplift contributed about 60 basis points to 70 basis points to our adjusted EBITDA margin during the year. And so those are some of the things that Paul has kind of messaged as we think about operational improvements during 2018 and that our team is continuing to focus on as we head into 2019.
Operator: Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: So Paul, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that the slower sales will likely be mostly remedied, I think, as it relates to additional capacity. And I'm just curious, is there something else beyond the additional capacity that you're focusing on to increase the sales effort?
Paul Szurek: Really just two things. One is the continuous improvement that we strive for that Steve mentioned and they do a great job here in Mali and the rest of the team and diving into every opportunity from the previous quarter, lessons learned, how do we change our approach for future opportunities. And we've seen a lot of success from that continuous improvement. The other thing is what you guys have seen happen in this space since it was created is that you have different waves and cycles of user demand. And one year, we see a lot of scale sales in our markets and then those get filled up. And then in subsequent years, there's less of that. But then as those fill up, the cycle comes back. So I think having the capacity is a prima facie requirement for winning those deals. And I feel good about what we see out there in the industry in general and pipelines in general.
Jordan Sadler: Is there anything you could add vis-a-vis the cycle, where you think we are in terms of what types of customers have been slower to lease, which may be coming around in 2019.
Paul Szurek: So every side of the edge cycles are different than undifferentiated or hyperscale cycles. We had a big edge cycle in 2015 and 2016. It started tapering off in 2017 and 2018. But we're seeing good signs going forward for that, that's not a promise of anything, but I do feel good about where we are in the edge cycle.
Jonathan Atkin: And then along those lines, I was curious regarding the interconnection revenue growth assumption or guidance of 8.3%, is it obvious moderation from what you did in '17, but also from the pace in 4Q of 10.9% growth, down 8.3 for the year. Is there anything else embedded in there in terms of consolidation or churn that you could point to?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. Jordan. I would say that all of those items you mentioned, whether it's some of the consolidation just some of it associated with some churn are all embedded into those estimates. But I think if you look at the past two to three years, you can see that has decelerated by 200 basis points to 300 basis points per year, largely driven off of the volume growth. To the positive side, what we continue to see is customers that migrate from a certain volume to a higher volume product which obviously increases price. And so while you may not see volumes, our overall volume increase from a per unit basis, overall pricings continue to go up just as they migrate to a higher priced product, we continue to see that, but all of that has been embedded into that -- those estimates. As you point out, the midpoint is about 8.3%, the range is somewhere around 6% to 11% and we'll just see how we perform as we work through the year.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay, thank you. Hey, Jeff, just while I have you there. The commencements, I noticed you didn't provide any specific commentary for the year. Is there any number that's embedded at the midpoint here that you could point to beyond the backlog you talked about?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, I mean the -- obviously the backlog as I mentioned, you got about $9.9 million call it $10 million that we've got visibility into for next year. And the remaining of those commencements are going to be largely dependent upon our leasing results and some of that is dependent upon our construction deliveries. And so, we'll continue to update as we work through the year. In terms of trying to estimate that, I would just point to whatever our high-level revenue guidance is, and our churn estimates, and make some estimates on estimated timing of leasing and commencements of -- gets you there based on the high-level revenue guidance we've provided. And we'll continue to update you guys as we progress during the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Del Deo: First one is for Steve. You noted the revenue booked from new logos in 2018 was up 81% versus the prior year, which is a pretty substantial change. Can you talk about some of the specific initiatives you undertook to help drive that results? And were there particular selling point you found to be particularly effective in getting new enterprises on board?
Steve Smith: Sure. Well, thanks, Nick. Thanks for the question. I mean, yes, there was one area that we did see some good traction on, I think, is an important aspect. We've mentioned it on prior calls, where that was a key focus area for us even, I would say, more than a year ago where we wanted to really provide more diversity across our base, be less reliant upon our existing customer base for our future growth and just enhance the ecosystem, and that's been the real impetus for this whole initiative. But there's been really a concerted effort both from our sales, marketing, product teams, our channel team really across the board to ensure that we drive the right messaging, the outright outreach that we align our incentive plans, all of those kind of things to ensure that we really motivate all over is in the water toward -- rolling toward those new logos. So, I'd say, it's really kind of a combined effort there as well as just looking at the industries that we've -- that have been adopting CoreSite, those that value our value proposition. And really trying to get better at identifying through internal as we call it customer knowledge of those customers that tend to buy from us, and how do we target more of them to just get smart about where we spend our money and where we spend our time to better attract those logos. So it's really just a combination of all those things.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, that's helpful. Then maybe one on Santa Clara specifically. Note that's historically been a very good market for you guys in part, because it's hard to bring new capacity online, it seems like there has recently been a spike in projects under development there with a lot of capacity in various stages of development. How do you see that influencing that market over the next couple years? And are you confident you can get your desired returns on SV8 and the facility you plan on building on the parcel you just acquired?
Paul Szurek: This Paul, Nick. We feel good about Santa Clara market. There is always room for more participants in that market. But we like our campus ecosystem, the value that it drives, the performance that it drives, that's why we are -- despite those new participants in the market, we're continuing to look to expand that campus, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Aryeh Klein: Paul, I think you mentioned earlier that LA3 construction has been delayed a little bit more. How does that impact your previous outline for 2020 growth as it relates to revenue, EBITDA and FFO? Do you still feel comfortable returning to the double-digits there?
Paul Szurek: I do. And I don't expect this to be a significant delay, although it's a bit of a disappointment. And let me just be clear, I have a lot of sympathy for these power companies that got to manage these grids, and I'm guessing there's more sensitivity around this today than there was in the past. So I get it, they want to get it right, we want them to get it right, and we're hopefully very close to resolving that and being able to start construction in the first half of this year. So it shouldn't meaningfully move from where we were expecting it in the past, but it could be a quarter or two maybe slightly more from what we had previously.
Aryeh Klein: Okay. And then, as far as you mentioned the positives from new logo growth, what are you seeing from existing customers? How are they growing their footprints and do you still feel confident about that side of the business?
Paul Szurek: It was a little bit lighter in 2018. And I would refer you back to my -- the comments I made earlier about cycles of demand in various areas. I think we'll see that be better in 2019.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Choe: Hi. I just want to get a little bit more color, I guess, you have completed projects, pretty stabilized but completed it in Virginia, New York, in D.C., it seems like they've been pre-leased but the commencements haven't kind of come in. Can you give us a little more color on when they will start commencing and when we can see revenue coming from those projects? And I have a follow-up.
Paul Szurek: Some of them have already commenced and there's revenue in them, others will commence over this quarter and the next coming quarters. Just want to give you a little bit of detail there, Richard. VA3, 1A is a pure co-location asset, so it doesn't really accommodate scale. And those take a wild lease up, but it's leasing up frankly handsomely right now. DC2 was really completed late in December, it had its first tenant signed up earlier this month. And so that's a very new asset and those new co-location assets tend to take -- they're more linear in their lease up whereas scale assets tend to be lumpier in their lease up.
Richard Choe: And giving the development table for 2020 and knowing it's little early. If you look at the megawatt numbers, they're relatively similar to the amount you're doing in 2019, should we expect there might be a little bit drop off in CapEx, but it really seems like the CapEx level for -- going into 2020 should probably be equal to 2019, would that make sense?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, just broadly speaking if you look at the megawatts for '19, we're looking at delivering about 19 megawatts, and 2020, it's only 12. And so I think, keep that in mind, I do believe 2019 would be elevated as compared to where we think 2020 will be at least as we sit here today. That may change based upon ultimate sales and absorption trends as we kind of work our way through 2019 and obviously will provide some detailed color around that as we get closer to to the end of this year. But I wouldn't expect it to be higher than what we're expecting for this year. If anything similar or slightly down based on where we sit today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Erik Rasmussen: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Just a kind of back-to-the-scale location, that obviously continues to be challenged and finished the year with roughly half the amount that you signed last year. So, given your guidance for 2019 and the capacity expansion plans you've talked about, would you say the 2018 was the trough and we'll see scale colo higher in 2019? Here, we're just trying to understand your comments about new leasing opportunities given a lot of the construction and development plans you guys have. Then I have a follow up.
Paul Szurek: So, yes, obviously our guidance implies very strongly that we expect 2018 to be a trough. And the the requirement of increased sales is you have to have capacity to sell, and it has to be the right capacity in the right markets. Our trademark has been, as I mentioned in our comments that we've been able to accommodate deployments from as small as a cabinet or sometimes even less all the way up to substantially larger requirements 8 megawatts, 9 megawatts and even occasionally a powered shell. We just didn't have anything like that kind of capacity to accommodate, accommodate those types of opportunities in 2018, but we will in 2019 and continuing further into 2020.
Erik Rasmussen: And then maybe in terms of your new development and construction projects, at this stage, how conservative do you think your development completion timeline is the one chart on 19 there, it seems that VA3 did slip the Q2. What were the factors there and then where do you see the major hurdles to hit your overall timeline on that chart. Thank you.
Paul Szurek: So we try actually -- and maybe we've taken the wrong approach to this, but we try to be really straightforward based on the documentation that we have in place. So when we're in the permitting phase for going off the advisor's estimates of how long it takes to get permits in a particular jurisdiction, I think, going forward, we're going to categorize that as pre-construction and not be as detailed as on in terms of when we will get permits, because it is very hard to predict in these markets. And then in terms of construction, we go based on what the delivery date in the construction contract is in terms of when we expect delivery. Now those delivery dates can change based on weather changes, we've got a certain amount of allowances and contracts, and sometimes, there are unanticipated field conditions that can drive the delays. That's primarily what's going on with VA3 in terms of sliding from late in the third quarter to call it mid second quarter is a combination of site conditions and weather conditions in the Virginia market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: When we met with you guys at NAREIT in, I think, it was early November, it seemed like you guys thought pretty good about the pipeline for a scale deal at VA3 and that you're tracking various opportunities, and obviously, you didn't sign anything during the quarter. Curious if those opportunities are still there, they've gone elsewhere? And if the the delayed opening had had anything to do with it? And then also as you look to get that anchor scale deal with VA3, how are you thinking about pricing? I know in the past, even though the pricing has come down, are you willing to do deal at what you perceive now as the market -- the market clearing price or are you going to kind of hold in there and taking at the price that you want? Thanks.
Steve Smith: Hey, Colby. This is Steve. I'll take a shot at this and then Paul can chime in anything that I might miss here. But I would just tell you, as far as the overall pipeline is concerned for pre-leasing, whether it'd be in Virginia or in the Bay Area, activity still remains strong. We are having multiple conversations and we're still positive with the outlook. As far as any individual deals are concerned, not sure exactly which individual deals we're in discussion. But I would tell you that even customer requirements, especially of that size, move all over the place based on their dates, and when they want them or whether or not they remain a real opportunity. So the overall market in the pipeline still remains strong and we're optimistic about where we can go with it. As it relates to pricing, we feel like we've underwritten the asset to where we can still absolutely execute against it and meet the returns that we underwrote. The market clearing price, I would say, there's not necessarily a market clearing price. So I think there's a lot of variables that go into what prices in any given market, but maybe especially in Virginia as to what customers value, whether or not they're willing to pay for it and how much scale they're looking to bring on board. So we feel like, based on the value, the ecosystem, the scale and size and the level of redundancy that we have built into the asset that we'll be able to meet the market.
Colby Synesael: Great. And then maybe just one for Jeff. You've taking your leverage target up from what has historically been sub-4 and this year it's 4.5 and in response to, I think, Richard's question, you noted that you expect CapEx next year to be down, but maybe similar. Once model would assume then that your leverage continues to go up as you go into 2020. Do you see that you just can't be taking up your leverage target further or are there other actions that you're likely to take?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, good morning, Colby. Those are items, it's going to be very dependent upon ultimately based upon our EBITDA growth in terms of where that leverage ultimately gets too. But more specifically, to your question, our leverage at 4.5 which we've messaged to, we continue to have those conversations with our Board when we meet and assess where we want to take that leverage, but that is one option that we would look at. There are other options that we need to consider based upon many factors in terms of the economics out in the marketplace. And so it's one lever we can pull, not the only lever. We just got to evaluate those with our Board as we work our way through the year and see how the lease-up is coming and ultimately the EBITDA growth associated with it.
Operator: Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Louthan: So going forward, do we -- are we looking for more growth in the sales team or is it really just more -- is having some more inventory available to kind of -- to kind of get the to get the sales up? And then can you walk us through some other rent per the -- rent per square foot kind of have seemed to tick up a little bit in the quarter. What sort of the nature of the mix of those leases that was driving that uptick sequentially? Thanks.
Steve Smith: Hey, Frank. This is Steve. As it relates to the sales headcount, we had a couple of open positions, few open positions, I would say coming out of 2018 that we have now filled a couple of markets, for example, Chicago, where we have obviously new building coming on board where we expect to have better traction there and be prepared for that building coming online and just adjusting a few heads here and there. But overall very consistent with where we've been in prior quarters and prior years. So I wouldn't expect any significant changes as far as total number of heads or dollars associated with them. As it relates to the rent and per square footage piece of it, I'll just give you those -- give you my perspective and then hand it up to Jeff. But the uplift was primarily driven just from increased density that we saw in the fourth quarter, whereas as we saw some of those smaller deals that were also more dense that drove the square footage dollar up in that quarter.
Jeff Finnin: Frank, the only thing I'd add to that is Steve did make a reference in his prepared remarks that our pricing on a per kilowatt basis was consistent with the trailing 12 months coming into the fourth quarter, and so that gives you a better sense for that density to drive some of that increase on a per square foot basis.
Frank Louthan: And how do you see that going forward? Is that just sort of anomaly in the quarter or it is the fact you had little more of the smaller deals versus some larger Hyperscale deals or you think you're able to take that density advantage going forward and drive some higher rents as we look out in our models?
Paul Szurek: I think it is pretty variable. I think we've seen that over time as that densities have crept up. So I think that trend will probably continue. I think Q4 was probably a little bit higher elevated primarily because of the fact we had just --such a concentration in retail and the smaller deployments. But I think in that segment and even in the skilled segment, you're seeing densities creep up a little bit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Dave Rodgers: Yes, hey guys. Maybe for Steve and tying on some comments that Paul had made earlier as well, but when you look at your completed pre-stabilized projects, the nearly 150,000 square feet, it sounds like a large portion of that not really colo scale available. So I was kind of curious, what the percentage of that portfolio is kind of leasable for scale colo? And then compare and contrast that to kind of what's under construction of the full out development pipeline, is all of that colo scale available? And then the third part of that question, just to be more confusing, is the 5,000 square feet that you use for the bottom of the scale colo portion of your business, is that too small? And is just the scale colo today for you needing to be substantially larger than kind of that low end of the bar?
Steve Smith: Yes, I'll give you a little bit of color on the scale versus retail. We don't necessarily break it out as far as which sites are specifically suited one for the other. But I would say in general, Paul kind of mapped this out earlier in his comments around our initial phase at VA3, which is primarily geared toward colo, the DC2 facility, which recently came online, is more colo oriented. Obviously the LA1 15th floor that we'll be building out this year, will be more colo-oriented. As you look to our newer build, it's probably easier to look at them has been able to accommodate either, retail or scale or wholesale. Just on the modular fashion and you have a fresh floor plate that you can grow from. So, I think if you look at the next phase of VA3 for example, SV8, LA3, CH2, those are all able to accommodate both retail and scale or hyperscale.
Paul Szurek: Dave, this is Paul. I just -- I would point you to page 13 of the supplemental. And I think you can kind of get the picture that it's a combination of tight occupancies and the market spread of where we had capacity like Santa Clara 97.3% occupied, I think you can easily interpret what that means for the ability to handle scale there. NY2, 77% occupied, more capacity to handle scale, but a less strong market, and I think that sort of illustrates the dynamic that we've been working through in 2018 and we'll be solving in 2019.
Dave Rodgers: And then maybe a second question. I don't know, Jeff or Steve. But with regard to the Interconnect business, do you have any additional color or clarity commentary around the switching -- the larger switching gear of the customers and maybe any impact that you're able to kind of see now as we've gotten deeper into that process?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Dave. I would just add that we saw, obviously, some of that occurring in 2018. I would say it moderated in the fourth quarter. What that looks like going forward is obviously, we have estimates associated with it and we'll continue to monitor, customer movement and/or changes as we work through the year. But I can't put a number on it for you, but it is, we did see it moderate in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question.
Nate Crossett: How do you guys think about land holdings in the long term? Obviously your product is dependent on having good locations and a lot of the markets you are in are tighter markets in terms of available supply. So how should we think about how you're positioning the land bank for the longer term? And maybe are there any new markets that are potentially on the table?
Paul Szurek: Nate about the land bank. And I think the new parcel we put under contract in Santa Clara illustrates our approach that we -- as we said the last several quarters, we need to be more proactive than we have been in the past about acquiring, entitling and getting shovel-ready land for expansion in key markets. And so we had a rush to get the SV8 land, the CH2 land and the VA3 land in position to develop, to acquire and put -- it get in a position to develop. And we don't want to fall short like that again in the future. So we are active in all of our major markets to look for additional opportunities to expand. Land availability, property availability in these markets is the -- the supply can be somewhat a femoral. So you have to be in the market all the time looking for it, working on it, striving for off-market deals when you can -- and making them work in terms of connectivity and power and proximity. So again, look at the new land we have under contract in Santa Clara as an example of that. And I apologize, I forgot the second half of your question.
Nate Crossett: Yes, are there any new markets that could be on the table? And maybe just your thoughts on U.S. like are you always going to be only U.S. or are you open to expanding kind of internationally?
Paul Szurek: So let me try to answer this one. When we sit down with our major customers, really all the way down to the top 20 or 30 customers, the primary thing they value about us is that we keep expanding and these infill edge markets, where we exist. Because they have tremendous needs, they foresee significant needs during the future and they realize it is hard to proactively expand in those markets. That doesn't preclude us from going into other markets, when we can find the right conditions. And believe it or not, we do consistently look at opportunities, but we just haven't found the right ones. I think that would be more of a domestic thing if and when it happens, international may happen in the future, I wouldn't rule it out, but it's not something that we're focused on at this time.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Funk: Just a few for -- if you could. First you mentioned earlier the other waves in cycles in the industry. Just curious how you're thinking on positioning CoreSite is so called skate to where the puck is going strategically based and where you see the market? Second part of the question is somebody asked earlier how you're feeling about -- about the kind of scale demand in general. I guess the freight is slightly differently versus where you stood a beginning of 2018, do you feel better or worse about about scale demand? And then finally in the last piece of the question would be any kind of commentary on build cost and what you're seeing there on an absolute basis, and then just trajectory too? Thank you.
Paul Szurek: I would say we feel just as good about secular long term and intermediate-term and really even short-term demand at today as we did at the beginning of 2018. Using your hockey analogy, we just want to camp out in front of the goal, because we know that's where all the pucks ultimately end up. And having capacity in major metro infill markets that is crucial for low latency, high-performance applications for consumers and businesses, and as well as the Internet peering points, is a core part of our strategy and it's served us very well so far and we feel -- we still feel very good about that. In terms of build costs, I think they have come up, obviously a little bit more, I would say than general overall inflation over the last couple of years. It varies significantly market-to-market, labor costs are probably the most variable dynamic. Our design team does puts a lot of work into not constantly, but regularly updating our designs to create a more efficient and cost effective way to build to offset some of those costs. Our construction management team works very hard to keep them in line and our equipment procurement team consistently works through our supply chain to try to offset some of that, but you're still seeing some construction cost inflation.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Lukas Hartwich: Given the comments that leasing was held back by a lack of contiguous space, can you provide a little more color on frictional vacancy for the current portfolio?
Paul Szurek: I'm sorry, on what vacancy?
Lukas Hartwich: Frictional, is there -- I think you're in the low '90s right now, is there -- is that kind of a natural state, it's hard to get above that given the lack of contiguous space?
Paul Szurek: I mean, really, again, I'd go back to the my response to an earlier comment. It really varies by market, but yes, there are markets where we are so tight in the -- or buildings that we're so tight that. And -- I think when you get above 91%, 92% you see this a lot more where you just don't have those contiguous spaces where you can handle 1 megawatt deployment much less 2 megawatts, 3 megawatts, 4 megawatts.
Steve Smith: The only thing I would add to that is that I think our model does lend itself, in some cases, to tighten that up on occasion, because we do sell smaller deployments that in the right floor plate will allow us to fill that in tighter with smaller deployments, whether they are networks, smaller enterprises or the otherwise. So I think our model as opposed to being just focused on hyperscale where the -- either you have it or you don't, that's another reason why are we focused on trying to bring in more logos and get more diversity across our install base, so that we can fill in some of those other pockets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please state your question.
Robert Gutman: So coming into 4Q, you'd expected I think 100 basis points of churn, extraordinary churn from the customer that churned about 70 basis points in the prior quarter. Net-net, the turnover came in lower sequentially, and I'm looking at guidance which is 6% to 8% for 2019. And I think you've prior set 2% to 2.5% per quarter through '19, which would be 8% to 10%. So how -- what's the color there on how your perspective on churn has changed? Secondly, if you could provide the number for new logos, which I think we have in prior quarters. And I have one follow up.
Jeff Finnin: I saw your note this morning. So I appreciate you raising the question. Just to give you some color on the fourth quarter, first of all. As Steve alluded to, our churn in the fourth quarter was better than anticipated. We had a good outcome ultimately with the customer we were renewing the fourth quarter. And while they did churn some level of their space, it wasn't as a high as what we anticipated. So I think, overall, that was good news. In terms of 2019, the commentary I provided last quarter which is consistent with where we sit today is -- and we would expect elevated churn from somewhere between 2%, 2.5% in each of the two first quarters, so just the first half of the year. Second half of the year, we would expect that to be returning back to normal levels. So just factor that in, that should explain your question related to the guidance for the year.
Robert Gutman: Thanks. And a...
Jeff Finnin: Does that make sense?
Robert Gutman: Number of new logos -- yes, that's great. Thank you, and about the new logos, number of new logos?
Paul Szurek: What was the question around the number?
Robert Gutman: I think we've had a number, it was 27, 28 in the prior quarters.
Paul Szurek: Yes, sure.
Robert Gutman: So what was the number of new logos for the fourth quarter?
Paul Szurek: Yes, it was 32 this last quarter.
Robert Gutman: Great. And the last thing is that with DC2 coming on at the end of the fourth quarter, rental expense was pretty flat quarter-over-quarter. Should we expect that to be higher in the first quarter and then the impact -- your view on EBITDA margin through the year?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, great point Robert. The DC2 did come online very late in the fourth quarter. And so you will see an uptick here in the first quarter associated with that rent for that particular data center. And in terms of the adjusted EBITDA margins, if you look at our guidance, you can see that it's very flat compared to where we ended 2018. I think the implied EBITDA margin is at 54.4%, right in line with where we ended 2018.
Operator: Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please state your question.
Jordan Sadler: Just a quick follow-up on the revenue growth guidance of 7.5%, Jeff, the total operating revenues. Do you have a breakdown of rental revenue versus power revenue growth?
Jeff Finnin: I don't, George. What I would utilize though, you can see where those percentages came out for the full year of 2018, I would use that same pro-rata allocation as you will look at your estimates for 2019. I don't think those are going to be moving meaningfully.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. So a similar split, I think, I had -- rental revenues were up 11% versus '17 for power something like that to a similar...
Jeff Finnin: Yes.
Jordan Sadler: Spread? Okay.
Jeff Finnin: I think that's fair.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then I was just coming back to the interconnection question. It sounds like maybe that cycle of equipment upgrades maybe slowing a little bit. I'm not sure if I read that correctly in your commentary, but what does longer term growth look like in terms of interconnection revenue in your mind sort of three to five year?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, I think, just maybe to clarify as it relates to some of the items that were impacting churn for the interconnection growth, I'm sorry in 2018. We alluded to some of the consolidation taking place inside the portfolio as one aspect of it, the second being some of the migration from 10 gig to 100 gig. And on the second, the migration, and there's only a minority of customers that really is applicable to. And so it's hard for us to ultimately forecast when it makes sense from their perspective based on the volume of traffic they are moving through those switches. It is something that we watch and try to make estimates on. I don't know if it's going to moderate for next year or not, but it's something we continue to watch. But just keep in mind, I think, it really is only applicable to a minority of our customers that we haven't based today. And then I've missed the last part of the question, second part.
Jordan Sadler: I guess I'm just thinking like what does organic growth look for -- look like in the interconnection business three years or whatever as opposed -- you've seen this 200, I don't know, are we moderating by 200 basis points a year for the next three years or are we going to level off here at 8% is I guess sort of -- and I don't know if you can break that down between price and volume. I mean is price stable in cross connects or are the SDNs eroding price?
Jeff Finnin: Yes. No, that's a great question and that's in area that we continue to focus and put a lot of energy into in terms of evaluating how best to monetize the value of the ecosystem that's there today and how to balance that with customer expectations. And as Steve alluded to, we're looking at various products that might enhance that, we're going to continue looking at it. I wish I could give you a definitive number and where that heads. Clearly, we would like to see it moderate rather than continuing to decline and we got to figure out ways to make sure that happens.
Steve Smith: The only thing I'd tell you Jonathan is, if you look at the -- just the broader industry and technology as a whole, interconnection is not reducing, it's accelerating if anything. So the amount of interconnected things out there just continues to grow. And so I think that provides a good opportunity for the industry and for us as well and how we monetize that. We have physical versus logical interconnection, I think, is playing out as we speak and that's why we've made some of the investments around the OCX and providing the additional capabilities there. But I guess to answer maybe an embedded question that you had there around SDN eroding any pricing around physical cross connects, we have not seen that as of yet.
Jeff Finnin: Jordan, one more thing I've to add as you think about longer-term growth. And that is, I do believe that the interconnection revenue growth is fairly correlated to the volume of kilowatts we're selling and the type of deployments that we are selling. And so keep that in mind as you think about the growth in the outer years. I do think it's little bit -- it's more correlated with the volume of kilowatts that we're selling.
Jordan Sadler: That's fair. And no erosion in prices kind of what I heard on the physical cross connects.
Jeff Finnin: I think that's accurate.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Paul Szurek for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: First, thank you all for being on the call. Appreciate the interest and the good questions. One of the -- I forget which one of you and I apologize for that, but one of the analyst reports that came out overnight, mentioned that they were glad to have 2018 behind us, and for CoreSite. And I certainly appreciate that sentiment because it has been a year of transition from using up the native capacity that we had since IPO and moving into a new development phase of the Company. I honestly feel very good about what the team accomplished in 2018. And I'm not referring to myself, I probably have a longer list than any of you guys of things that I could have done better. But the people that I work with here had a really remarkable 2018 in terms of putting together the building blocks for future growth. From the construction progress that we made, the new land that we've entitled and started into the permitting and development process. The operational excellence and the high levels that we achieved in that and frankly greater efficiencies, the better power efficiency and there are a lot of other smaller building blocks throughout the organization in terms of IT and other areas that are really going to collectively be important as we go forward. So it was from the outside, it was a year of a lot of work, a lot of grinding work, but I feel good about what the team accomplished and I'm very excited as we move forward into 2019 and beyond. So thank you very much for your interest and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-10-25 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Derek McCandless, General Counsel. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I am joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our web site at CoreSite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am glad to share our third quarter financial and operating results, as well as to update you on our markets and development activity. Financial results for the third quarter reflect revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and FFO per share each increasing 13% year-over-year. Regarding our internal growth, we had good performance across substantially all measurements, including solid cash rent growth on renewals and 7% year-over-year growth in same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent. Sales performance was mixed in the third quarter. Our core retail colocation sales were $5.1 million of annualized GAAP rent, consistent with our trailing 12-month average. Pricing overall for the quarter was up approximately 5% above average on a per kilowatt basis. Our consorted efforts to focus on quality deployments and strong pricing has paid off in this area. Scale coloation leasing was on the low end, resulting in total sales of retail and scale of $6.1 million. We believe scale leasing this quarter was primarily influenced by two factors we have mentioned before; smaller than normal inventory of contiguous space in our major markets, which is being remedied by the new buildings, we expect to bring on line beginning in 2019 and the normal lumpiness and scale leasing after which we are encouraged based on current pipeline and utilization trends we see in our data centers. During the quarter, we had a healthy balance of organic capacity expansions by existing customers coupled with our strong quarter in number and quality of new logo acquisitions. The annualized GAAP rent signed by the 27 new logos in Q3 increased 11.2% compared to the trailing 12-month average. The number of kilowatts licensed increase 15.4% and the average lease rent increased by 25.3%. We are optimistic about the demand trends we are seeing in our markets and believe supply is generally in balance with demand. We view Santa Clara as the most supply constrained and Northern Virginia as the least supply constrained. We still like the Northern Virginia market due to the overall high demand of our network and cloud dense campus, and the diversity we provide in Reston as compared to our peers in Ashburn. However, we believe pricing on undifferentiated or marginally differentiated large scale deployments have declined in Northern Virginia over the last 12 to 18 months, which will likely impact our pre-release economics to our new building at VA3 We continue to make good progress on construction of our new VA3 building and are likely to deliver an additional 6 megawatts of capacity in Q1 2019. In Santa Clara, construction on SV8 is progressing and we expect to deliver the 6 megawatts of Phase 1 during the third quarter of 2019. CH2 and LA3 are progressing through the permitting phases as expected consistent with our comments from last quarter we expect LA3 Phase 1 will be complete around year end 2019 and CH2 Phase 1 in early 2020, subject to the uncertain timing of the permitting process in these markets. Please keep in mind, all our projects are ground-up developments, which take longer to deploy the first phase of supply but allow us to build subsequent phases more quickly. As we've discussed on previous calls, we expect 2019 to be a transition year for us. We expect to enter the year with leasable capacity at a low level compared to our historical norms, and to end the year with leasable capacity, plus quickly developable incremental capacity consistent with the higher levels available to us at the end of 2015. This new capacity should enable us to reaccelerate growth moving from 2019 to 2020 and beyond. In summary, it was a solid transition quarter as we prepare for the new capacity in our construction pipeline, and we have an excellent group of colleagues to drive our success. Demand for and stickiness of data center requirements that are network and cloud-enabled in large metro edge markets continues to be strong. I remain optimistic about our future opportunities, reflecting our solid position in great markets with large numbers of dynamic enterprises, consumers of content and sophisticated customers of cloud, analytics and similar data products. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks Paul. Our new and expansion leasing activity was again driven by our core retail colocation product, which accounted for approximately 84% of GAAP rent signed in the quarter. In total, we executed 120 new and expansion leases totaling $6.1 million in net annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 31,000 net rentable square feet and average GAAP rate of $193 per square foot. As Paul mentioned, portfolio-wide pricing on a per kilowatt basis was 5% above our trailing 12-month average. This is noteworthy considering Boston was among our top three markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed for the first time in several quarters. We saw good traction in attracting high quality new logos for our portfolio, signing 27 this quarter, which accounted for 19% of net annualized GAAP rent signed. Our well-established campuses or cloud enabled networked dense datacenters continues to be a magnet for enterprises, with this vertical representing 61% of the annualized GAAP rents signed from new logos. Among our new enterprise logos, our global leader in financial technology and payment processing, our leading network security provider, our top-tier member of the education vertical, a global provider of online games, and as American luxury retailer. In addition to new logo growth, we again experienced organic growth from our expansion of existing customers across our portfolio, which accounted for 81% of annualized GAAP rent signed in Q3. During the quarter, our major public cloud providers expanded it on-rents with us in both our Denver and Los Angeles markets. A global web conferencing provider expanded with us in the Bay area a [indiscernible] company expanded with us in two additional markets. Turning to our vertical mix, networking cloud customers accounted for 25% and 35% of annualized GAAP rents signed respectively. The network vertical had a very good quarter with high overall transaction count and seven new logos signed, including three international network nodes, which speaks to our continued appeal with the international environment. We also signed a subsea cable deployment, connecting the consortium of telecos and major content players between Los Angeles and Asia Pacific markets. The cloud vertical continued to perform well, adding four new logos, including an industry leading digital certificate provider, as well as the expansion of two public cloud-on rents in Denver and Los Angeles that were discussed earlier. Our enterprise vertical accounted for 40% of annualized GAAP rents signed, driven by a leading ERP as a service software provider, [indiscernible] on a global public cloud that expanded with us an existing site and into new market. In addition, several other existing customers expanded, including the member of the Fortune 500 seeking direct access to three other cloud on-rents we provide in the San Clara market and a bunch of ecommerce companies expansion in Boston. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases were Boston, Los Angeles, Northern Virginia, and Silicon Valley. Collectively new and expansion leases in these four markets represented 86% of annualized GAAP rents signed. Demand in Boston was elevated this quarter as couple of lease new capacity we brought to the market in the fourth quarter of 2017. A large ecommerce company chose to expand with us into this new capacity, provided flexibility and a clear path for us continued future growth and expansion in market. Demand in Los Angeles was solid, with strength in the network vertical, followed by enterprise and cloud deployments. New logo activity included seven new customers which are well distributed among the verticals. Northern Virginia continues to be our most competitive market with substantial amounts of undifferentiated offerings. However, this product typically does not impact our competitiveness relative to latency, network and cloud-oriented used cases. Hence lease in this market was led by enterprise customers with seven new logos. With regard to large scale leasing, we look forward to presenting to the market additional capacity become available in early 2019. Finally, leasing volume was low in the Bay Area as a result of our tense supply in this market. The cloud vertical led our other verticals with 81% of new and expansion GAAP rent signed in the market. In summary, we are encouraged by the execution of sales in our core retail colocation product during the third quarter. However, we look to improve our leasing of scale deployment as additional capacity becomes available. We are also pleased with the incremental changes we continue to make in our sales execution and product features as a result of the sales and revenue leadership changes we announced last quarter. Going forward, we will continue to focus on generating profitable organic growth, attracting high quality new logos for portfolio and delivering incremental value to our customers as we grow our ecosystem and footprint. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. Our Q3 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $139.2 million, a 2% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 13.1% increase year-over-year. Our rent, power and related revenue contributed $118.6 million to operating revenues, an increase of 2.1% on a sequential quarter basis and 14.1% year-over-year. And our connection services contributed $17.7 million to operating revenues, an increase of 1.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 9.3% year-over-year. Turning to FFO, we reported $1.25 per diluted share and unit, down 2.3% on a sequential quarter basis and up 13.6% year-over-year. As a reminder, last quarter we highlighted a couple items that would impact our sequential FFO growth in Q3. First was seasonally higher power costs, which amounted to $0.03 per share, and seconds primarily as a result of the renewal and expansion of our lease at LA1, rent expense increased by $800,000 or nearly $0.02. Partially offsetting these items were two items that provided a benefit of approximately $0.02 per share. The first being a lease termination fee and the second being incremental revenue related to the build out of a customer's deployment. AFFO increased 1.6% sequentially and 19.4% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the growth in the operating portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA of $73.8 million decreased 1.4% sequentially and increased 13.1% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the trailing 12 months ended Q3 2018 was 54.7% and remains in line with our expectations and our guidance for the full year. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $5.2 million or 3.7% of total operating revenues in line year-over-year. General and administrative expenses were $10.1 million or 7.2% of total operating revenues, down 70 basis points year-over-year. Both amounts are in line as a percentage of revenue with our expectations for the full year. Q3 same-store turnkey datacenter occupancy increased 490 basis points to 90.1% from 85.2% in the third quarter of 2017. Sequentially, same-store turnkey datacenter occupancy increased 20 basis points. Additionally, same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year to $1,513. We renewed approximately 98,000 total square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $166 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 3.2% on a cash basis and 5.8% on a GAAP basis. Year-to-date, our cash mark-to-market growth of 3.9% is in line with our guidance for the full year. Churn with 2.5%, inclusive of 70 basis points of churn from the single customer we mentioned last quarter. We anticipate the same customer to churn up to a 100 basis points of additional capacity in Q4 2018, including churn from this specific customer and our year-to-date churn of 5.7%. We expect churn for the year to be at the higher end of the 6% to 8% guidance range. We commenced 37,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $160 per square foot, which represents $5.9 million of annualized GAAP rent. Turning to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $10.2 million at September 30, 2018. On a cash basis, our backlog was $17.5 million. We expect approximately 35% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the fourth quarter, with the remainder expected to commence during the first half of 2019. We continue to have a total of 161,000 square feet of datacenter capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. As of the end of the third quarter, we had invested $100.7 million of the estimated $281.8 million required to complete these projects, those buildings also includes space for future construction of an additional 167,000 square feet of datacenter capacity. Turning to our balance sheet, a ratio of net principal debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.6 times in line with the prior quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $295.9 million of total liquidity, consisting of available cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility. I would now like to address update to 2018 guidance and growth drivers heading into 2019. We are maintaining 2018 guidance related to operating revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share and unit. However, we have updated our expectations together with some visibility into 2019 for the following items. Based on our 2018 year-to-date commencements of $28.6 million, in our expectation for timing of commencements in our backlog we are decreasing are expected commencements for the full year to a range of $33 million to $35 million in annualized GAAP rent compared to our most recent guidance of $36 million to $38 million. As you will recall, we expect Q4 2018 churn to be elevated in the range of 2% to 2.3% depending upon the resolution with our customer I mentioned earlier. Looking ahead into 2019, we also expect elevated churn in the first half of 2019 in the range of 2% to 2.5% in each quarter before returning to more normal levels. We expect 2019 cash rent growth on renewals to be in the range of 2% to 4%. As it relates to our capital expenditures, we expect to finish 2018 towards the low end of our guidance range. In addition, we anticipate an increase in 2019 capital expenditures to $400 million to $450 million depending upon the timing of final permits and approvals. Importantly and further to Paul's comments related to leasable capacity, we anticipate growth capacity in our five largest markets equal to approximately 15% of our total portfolio entering 2019 as compared to 19% when we entered 2018, and our longer term average of approximately 30%. The anticipated development in 2019 should increase this percentage of growth capacity to mid 20% by the beginning of 2020, depending upon future absorption. Due to our elevated capital expenditures in 2019, we anticipate accessing the debt markets for $350 million to $400 million to term out the balance on our credit facility. Given our history with the business and the leverage metrics across the datacenter landscape, we are comfortable modestly increasing our targeted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4.5 times. As a result of all of the above and a related timing, we anticipate directional financial results in 2019 and 2020 as follows; revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in the upper single digits for 2019 and low double digits for 2020; FFO per share in unit growth of mid-single digits in 2019 and accelerating into low double digits in 2020. All of these estimates are dependent upon completing in leasing our growth capacity and related capital financing, and our team will continue to work to achieve these growth estimates. We will provide our typical annual guidance related to 2019 in connection with our Q4 call in February. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, and good morning. I wanted to first take a stab at the pipeline, it sounds like you guys are encouraged by what you are seeing in scale pipeline, but I think you pointed out this quarter was a little bit light there. Is it just a function still of the availability, I think you touched on Paul in your prepared remarks. But just maybe a little bit of color around what you are seeing and why are encouraged?
Steve Smith: Hi, Jordan, this is Steve. I think we did covered better enough in our prepared remarks there. We do see the overall pipeline remaining healthy, and I think if you look at the use cases in the marketplace that continue to drive more opportunity for that. And as we mentioned, there is a couple of things. One is, we like to do better in that space. I think we can do better on this thing that we are working on to just operate better there and sell better with the capacity that we do have, but we are a bit capacity constrained at this point and we are looking forward to bring that capacity back in line.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then is there any color around what you're seeing in terms of that pipeline that you talked about being encouraged about, anything either by market or nature and customers?
Steve Smith: Well, I think it's more the nature of our strategy and how we are aligned around key metros or across the U.S. and the makeup of our overall strategy really focusing on those latency sensitive network dense type of applications that seem to be more and more prevalent regardless of the line of business, so you think about things like 5G that's rolling out in the market place, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, all of those kind of things drive to more and more edge computing and latency sensitive type of applications and I think we'll just continue to see more of that which fits very well with us.
Jordan Sadler: Then, Jeff, could you clarify. I caught your guidance there in the end, was that FFO that you gave growth for 2019 and 2020, upper single and low double digits?
Jeff Finnin: Good morning, Jordan. I gave revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for both 2019 and 2020 as well, so let me just clarify and repeat it.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, I did hear this. Okay.
Jeff Finnin: So, revenue and adjusted EBITDA for 2019 to be upper-single digits and for 2020 to be the low-double digits. For FFO per share and unit, for 2019 mid-single digits and low-double digits in 2020.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you for clarifying that and then just lastly, the churn that you are forecasting into the first half of next year, any additional insight on what's driving that elevation?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, Jordan, primarily it's some of the – what we typically see related to some of the M&A or end of life type of events you are seeing, some of that being a little bit elevated in the first half of next year.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Rodgers with Robert W. Baird.
David Rodgers: Jeff wanted to follow-up on your comments about CapEx this year, it seems like it's getting pushed a little bit in the next year and thanks for the added color on 2019 CapEx, but without an execution problem in term of maybe not getting more money out this year, because clearly there has been a capacity issue for a while. You think you guys have been a little bit higher on that and pushed as hard you could to get that number as high as possible?
Jeff Finnin: No, I wouldn't call it an execution problem Dave. I think Brian Warren in our construction team are pushing this hard as they can and our estimates obviously are dependent upon a lot of things going perfect on the construction side. And so, it's not uncommon to see as you get towards the end of the year, some of that capital spend ultimately moving from Q4 in Q1 just depending upon where they are in the construction cycle. So, that we do see that periodically and then obviously we provided some additional commentary around what we expect for 2019 again to be elevated largely due to the ground up development that we have in the queue and that we'll expect it to beached out on light this year or early next year.
David Rodgers: Thanks for that. Paul, in your comments you talked about impacting a return at VA3, can you just dive a little bit further into that? Was that more a function of maybe how you know anticipate leasing that asset? Is that purely just a function of the market with no change in your view on what you want to do with VA3, but maybe some added color will be helpful.
Paul Szurek: Yes, mostly just market and you know what pricing for scale leases has done is Northern Virginia, our best guess and again we don't have you know as markets don't have perfect transparency, is that it's about 10% to 15% over the last 12 to 18 months for scale leasing. You know we will still – we believe will still hit our targeted underwriting hurdles that we've – you know talked about in the past, but it does give us less cushion and room to outperform them as we frequently have in the past.
David Rodgers: Okay, that's helpful. Then, I don't know for Steve or maybe like Jeff, in terms of kind of cross connect pricing and volume, you may have discussed this in the prepared comments and I just missed it, but can you kind of talk about that and then maybe what was in the quarter and then kind of how do you anticipate that impacting same store MRR going into 2019.
Paul Szurek: Yeah, let me give you a volume growth on our fiber product Dave. Year-over-year that was up about 8.1%, so that gives you some idea on volume. What we also saw which is consistent with what we saw in the earlier parts of 2018 is some continued consolidation of customer deployments predominantly from some previous telecom and telco M&A activity where they are consolidating some of their pops which is leading to some increase in some of those disconnections.
Jeff Finnin: And the other thing I would add there, Dave is, as you look at the overall mix and health of the interconnection business, you look at enterprises, connecting to clouds, we've seen that grow significantly in the 30% range, so overall connectivity continues to grow and I think really what you are seeing there predominantly is largely effect of just rationalization of telcos as they have gone through that M&A process.
David Rodgers: And the 8.1% that's gross or net?
Paul Szurek: That is net.
David Rodgers: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
Bora Lee: Hi, this is Bora Lee on for Jon. Thanks for taking the question. On the renewal spreads which were positive again on both a cash and GAAP basis, can you talk about the capital intensity associated with those renewal spreads?
Jeff Finnin: I would say that in general if you are enquiring in terms of whether or not there is additional capital required upon those renewals, it's very minimal if any. And so there is not a lot of capital intensity on our typical renewals.
Bora Lee: Got it. Thank you very much.
Jeff Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Deo with MoffettNathanson.
Nick Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. You are back to price in Virginia. Are the pricing pressures you talked about for scale deployments leading to pricing for small deployment as well? Are those sufficiently differentiated if they've been surely from those pressures?
Steve Smith: Nick, this is Steve. I would say that it's not necessarily size, it's really the application that goes along with it and sometimes that can go alone with size. But you know it's really the use case that goes behind the actual application and how they tie back to either a hybrid multi-cloud type of environment or other network type of deployments that value that low latency connectivity. So, we feel like that gives us a competitive advantage and also gives us a bit more staying power on relative to pricing on the market place.
Paul Szurek: Just to add to what Steve said Nick, as you can see from our overall pricing levels it's not affecting the pricing for our core relation colocation product.
Nick Deo: Got it. Then maybe turning to development pipeline, what plans do you have currently for the space ultra-development in LA1 and how long would it take to turn that up once you decide to push the button?
Paul Szurek: It's primarily there to accommodate the growth need of existing customers as well as additional customers we expect want to come into that ecosystem, and then as you know that's a very special facility. It is not an easy construction building something new in one of these old office building, telecom, hotels, but I believe we expect to be able to bring that online in the second half of next year possibly as early as late Q2.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First off, on the $400 million to $450 million CapEx next year, I assume that goes beyond the project which you – as you've discussed thus far. In terms of other projects which you have yet to announce, I'm just wondering are you intending to go outside your current markets, or do you think if there is still enough demand I should say in those markets to get you to the growth expectations that you are citing for 2019 and I guess even more so 2020? Then secondly, on leverage, you noted that you are comfortable taking that up to 4.5, would you be expecting to maintain that leverage on a go-forward basis, or if given the opportunity, you would look to potentially do an equity raise to get that back down or simply just deleverage back to your current levels over time? Thank you.
Paul Szurek: Let me take the first half of your question Colby. All of the capital that's in our forecast is in our existing markets and projects. VA3, SV8, LA3 and CH2 as well as you know we from time to time we build additional computer rooms in our existing buildings that are already out there. None of that capital is targeted for any additional markets.
Jeff Finnin: And Colby in terms of the second question, on the leverage, you know our leverage is something that we look at and have discussions with both internally and with our board, and I can't and I don't anticipate we'll continue to have those discussions, but I do not anticipate bringing that back down to our typical 4.0 level and it's something we'll continue to just monitor as we work through 2019 and 2020.
Colby Synesael: Great. And then just, Paul, if I could just go back to the response to that question, when you think about getting back to double digit growth in your model which has historically been call it 50% retail oriented and 50% more scale oriented, when you look at the four or five markets to which you see majority of your growth coming from, is there enough growth in those markets the way that you guys build the way that your business is structured to achieve those or do you have to kind of get more aggressive and for example a scale product or is there another aspect of the story here that needs to get augmented over time?
Paul Szurek: I think as we've shown historically and as we've forecast out demand trends, we could achieve those levels of growth we believe in our existing markets. And as you know, we've always been flexible around the scale versus retail dynamics along as we are focused on differentiated use cases that require that interconnected cloud-enabled campus dynamic and you know we try to make sure that we can accommodate higher density as well as low density applications within the same campus. That's really what makes the community of customers thrive. And again, most of the growth in edge use cases the vast majority of it is going to take place in the major metros of the type that we're in. And so, we do believe that's possible. Now, we always look to evaluate and enter different markets with the business model that we have, but those opportunities are few and fall between and really hard to forecast or incorporate into a model in anyway.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim.
Robert Gutman: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering, looking at next year's interconnection growth year-over-year, if that will be impacted by the churn occurring in the second half of this year. And I was also wondering if in terms of the $40 million plus CapEx guide little more tangible indication in terms of the amount of capacity, net rentable square feet that you expect to add?
Jeff Finnin: Rob, let me comment on the interconnection and we'll see if we can get you a number for the $400 million to $450 million. I would just say in general any time you some level of churn which we report on a rent perspective, you are going to get some additional churn associated with the interconnections, that's just very common just given the types of deployments. What we don't always know is the level of churn in the interconnection side of it and it's going to vary just depending on the cross connect density in each of those deployments. So, it will impact it to some extent, to what extent is uncertain and so we ultimately see which customer's churn and the timing of that event. And just to get back to your other – your second question, we've got about 160,000 square feet, it is under construction today and that complemented with what we have talked about related to LA3 and some of which is CH2 is going to be about 280,000 square feet that in total you would see under construction, some of which will be completed in 2019 – some – in late 2019 and then some of that will ultimately bleed into early 2020.
Robert Gutman: Do you think that, let say is longer term beyond 2019 or is it – you are saying high-single digit growth 2019 beyond that and low-double digit in 2020, is that a – would you expect – is that long-term rate beyond that? Do you expect it to plateau around there? What's – just a longer-term view.
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, I wish I could give you more color on that Rob, but you know lot of it as you've seen for 2018 and 2019 is really going to be dependent on the incremental capacity that we add to the market as well as performance on the sell-side. And so, I think we wanted to give some insight into 2019 into 2020, because we are going through this low from a capacity perspective, just to give better visibility into that. Beyond that, I'm hesitant to comment at this point in time.
Paul Szurek: Well, let me just add to what Jeff said, you know ultimately it's dependent on sales which is primarily dependent upon demand, but bear in mind what I said in my comments that what we're building in this first phase are the corn shell of all these four new buildings out of which we're initially building only the first phase of capacity. So, we do in these buildings in our current footprint, plus what we can add in – you know in the land that we own down the road could – if the sales and demand are there, you know continue to maintain double digit growth beyond 2020. But that's going to be dependent upon sales execution and demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins: Thanks for taking my question. A couple if I could. First, is there a significance to the conversion from some of the operating unit into the common shares into the quarter? And second, can you talk about how your guidance may affect the dividend policy going forward in terms of what kind of growth investors should expect in 2019 and 2020 relative to what you've been delivering over the last few years?
Jeff Finnin: Good morning Mike. Let me try to address your first question related to the conversion, so you probably saw in early August Carlyle chose to monetize some portion of their OP units and when that does occur, you just literally get a rotation out of what we refer to as our non-controlling interest into additional capital inside our equity statement. So, I think that's what you are referring to, does that answer your question on that?
Michael Rollins: It does.
Jeff Finnin: Okay and then secondly, the dividend policy, I think as you've seen historically and when you look at our dividend today as compared to AFFO, we have about a 90% payout and it's something we obviously address on a quarterly basis with our Board to evaluate what that dividend needs to be, but as we've said historically, those increases are largely going to be tied to our increases in cash flow. And we define that most relevant is common – is our cash flow that is distributable to our common equity shareholders which in a simplistic view from our perspective is AFFO less non-recurring capital that we spend inside our portfolio. So, I think that's the measurement you have to watch and that would largely give you some indication in terms of what that dividend increase could be relative to the growth in that cash flow number.
Michael Rollins: And is there any thought to maybe holding back some dividend growth to use that internally generated cash, maybe flatten it out for a period of time, or any other alternatives just as you are thinking about financing for the business?
Paul Szurek: So, given where we are on a leverage basis, you know we're low levered and as Jeff pointed out, we have the capacity to still be conservatively leveraged and fund our capital growth plans. Don't think we need to view any changes to the dividend policy as necessary in light of where we are leveraged.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you. In regards to your transition year and your comments in 2019 and then the revenue acceleration into 2020, when considering your vertical revenue mix across cloud networks and enterprises, which tenant do you think is going to be driving the majority of the acceleration from 2019 to 2020 and the reason why I bring this up is, this quarter you reported 49.4% of annualized revenues from enterprises and this is coming during – this is a step-up for about 200 basis points versus the prior quarter, it is also during a time where almost every single public cloud is scaling. So, just want to get an understanding on where you guys see the acceleration occurring by vertical mix from 2019 into 2020.
Steve Smith: Hi, this is Steve. I'll give you an answer to that. As this relates to our overall mix, I think it really points back to our overall strategy really keen around three aspects of the market, one being network, the other being cloud and the other being enterprise and how those are mutually attracted to one another and really ultimately drive their unique value that we have across our platform. So, all three are very important to us and if you look at the overall mix of our ecosystem about 50% of that is enterprise and then the other 50% is evenly divided between cloud and network. So, we see little bit of oscillation here and there between quarters. This quarter, enterprises was a bit elevated, primarily based off of the scale of the old socket than we would like, also the impact for the available capacity to sell that space, so overall we see a fairly consistent balance as we go forward. But all three aspects are very important to us.
Sami Badri: Thank you. And then my last question is have to do with a potential investment grade rating and whether the company is deciding to pursue that after some of your peers have already achieved an investment grade rating and wanted to get some color on that given the interest in increasing the leverage ratio to 4.5 times EBITDA, so any color would be great?
Jeff Finnin: You bet Sami. It is clearly something we watch and monitor closely not only what our peers are doing and what those rating agencies are doing, but also we have those conversations with the rating agencies that we meet with on a periodic basis and so, we obviously operate the business with that in mind and is something that we clearly have an eye on. I think it'd be premature to think about being in 2019, but we continue to operate in manner that ultimately we could do that in the public markets. Having said that, I would just comment on one of the areas of financing, we've tapped as you've seen is that private placement and those two issuances are rated what's referred to as NAIC 2 which is a surrogate for investment grade in the private market. And so – and we've been able to access that at the investment grade level, which continues to be a – I think an attractive source of capital for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you. How should we think about the scale of deployments going forward? So, what percentage of your mix should we think about being deployed that way. And then, maybe I missed this, but talk a little bit about the current size of your sales force and how you are going to see that grow maybe over the next 12 months as the top-line is ramping? Thanks.
Steve Smith: Sure. Well, this is Steve. As you think about the overall mix of our transactions have been pretty consistent with about – over 90% of our lease has been less than 5,000 square feet and I think that's really the meat and potatoes of our strategy and you will see that going forward, which is also one of the key attraction for why a lot of the cloud and content companies want to do business with us as well on the scale level. So, as far as number of transaction, I think you'll see that be fairly consistent. And as we've mentioned before, there is scale and hyperscale opportunities are more opportunistic they thought from those that – by that same ecosystem that can contribute to it and overall provide more value there. So, they are important to us and as I mentioned before, we do want to improve there and we feel like the additional capacity that we're bringing online will give us the opportunity to do that. And you'll probably see as you've seen in other quarters where when those events do happen and those leases do occur, that that will outweigh some of the smaller deployments in terms of just square feet and overall revenue, so again opportunistic, needs to provide value to the ecosystem as well as through returns that our shareholders are looking for. As far as the sales team is concerned, the overall expense structure we looked at – be very consistent to next year. We have done some things, we have some organizational changes last quarter and we are looking to drive better efficiencies that can better align to the markets as we have new capacity coming onboard and as we see just opportunities for improvement. So, across our sales, sales engineering and product mix, there is areas that we've already identified where we feel like we can make improvement there and we continue work there.
Frank Louthan: And what percent of your sales are coming from the channel partners right now and where do you see that going forward?
Steve Smith: Our channel business fluctuates a bit from quarter to quarter. It's anywhere from I'd say 8% to 15% depending upon the quarter. It is an important part of our business and will continue to be an important part for us as we go forward. There's essentially off tables resources that can get our brand up in the marketplace and really not only carry our value but other components that are important to customers as they evolve their IT strategies is key to us. So, we continue to focus there and expand that and I expect our focus to be even more strong as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk with Bank of America.
Michael Funk: Yeah, thank you for taking the question. A couple if I may. I understood that leasing can be lumpy any given quarter based on supply constraints and then I mean scale lumpiness as well. You know where do you see leasing longer-term, as capacity comes online and maybe more on a normalized basis for the scale business.
Steve Smith: I think you'll continue to see it be lumpy. There is – and the use cases that go into that scale leasing, again I think you need to look at what the deployment is within those larger scale leases and how they either value or don't value. The ecosystem and the network connectivity that we offer within our campus model, because some don't. And those that are – that don't value that up and drive much lower price points that frankly is an additive to our ecosystem or our shareholders and the return that we expect. So, again, it will be opportunistic, but we do see good opportunity and the opportunity actually improving as those low lengths of use cases continue to evolve and we see more and more of those every day, across every industry for that matter. So, as you see capacity come on, especially within our top four markets, we expect to see better performance there as it relates to scale and hyperscale opportunity.
Michael Funk: One more if I may, I mean obviously you know ability to bring capacity online is dictated by obviously the permitting process and you know available land. What's your view with regard to you know other strategic alternatives for expanding the business either geographically you know product set or event just in terms of getting more reach and scale in the business in general?
Paul Szurek: So, great opportunity in our development program is that we are really meeting the needs of our customers where they have the highest need. People like us we're not developing these in-fill urban campuses that have these great connected communities. Somebody else would have to do it and you know the returns there are higher, because the difficulty and the ability of others to compete is you know rewards people who can do it and who pursue it and stick to it. So, we believe that's very strategically important to meet our customers' needs where they express the greatest desire for them and so that's I think for the foreseeable future that's going to be the highest and best use of capital. It has been since our IPO and I think we're going to continue to focus that as our primary strategy where we can differentiate ourselves both to our customers and to the investment community.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JPMorgan.
Richard Choe: I just wanted to ask a little bit about how we should think about the pacing of churn, the development and revenue growth. It seems like growth will be more back-end loaded in 2019 and accelerating into 2020. And then also can I have an idea of what gives you the confidence about the low double digits in 2020 in terms of your pipeline, if you can give a sense there that would be great? Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Hey good morning Richard, let me just comment a little bit on any questions and I'll ask Steve add some color and commentary. But you are right in that as you point out that in the second half of 2019 is where you are going to see some additional capacity being added and that's going to be the Bay Area with the completion of the first phase SV8. And so, I think what is important and we've tried to get as – be as transparent on this as possible which is getting to when capacity will be coming online on a quarterly basis and by market. Keep in mind that as we do bring some of that capacity online, depending upon whether some of its pre-leased or not. If we don't have any pre-leasing, you will see some impact – negative impact to our earnings as a result of absorbing some of costs until we get that list up to a certain level. So just keep that in mind as you look at your quarterly models. And in terms of what's driving that or our confidence around – you know beyond that, I'll just have Steven or Paul comment on that.
Paul Szurek: So I think what you are really asking Richard is, our confidence levels around the timing of delivering capacity, I hope this isn't too much detail, but as we go through our process is the biggest unknowns are in the permitting process. They are just a lot of steps, a lot of opportunities for community input, special environmental reviews. And so, until you are basically at the end of that, it's a lot harder to predict what the timing of development will be. We feel pretty good because we are pretty far along in the properties that have not been permitted yet, and so we've got a few hurdles behind us. Once we have a property under contract with the general contractor, those contracts have set target dates that are based on assumptions you know around field conditions and weather to some extent. And you know sometimes you'll exceed those exceptions, sometimes you won't, but typically on average you are going to be right around those contracted dates with your general contractor. So, once we start coming out of the ground with vertical construction, there are a lot fewer variables that can, you know not completely eliminated but fewer that can impact your schedule and your delivery time lines.
Richard Choe: And to follow-up on that really quickly, when can you actually starts selling that capacity and have it in bookings? Is that a second that or like when these properties are actually made or is it – can you do it ahead of scheduled kind of just some idea of timing? When we can actually do booking?
Paul Szurek: So as we said in the past, it really does somewhat depend upon market and somewhat on buyer, but a good rule of thumb is that some pre-leasing can begin to take place, you know generally three to six months before you have an expected certificate of occupancy. And so, typically we see some preleasing before we actually opened up a facility and we try to approach that opportunistic. We are trying to smooth out the J-curve but still get to right applications that value the ecosystem, and the best pricing that we can.
Richard Choe: Right. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of Erik Rasmussen with Stifel.
Erik Rasmussen: Thanks for taking the questions. A lot has been addressed, but just circling back maybe some clarification on the churn. You guys talked about elevated churn levels in the first half of the 2019 and getting back to more normal levels. But is that 6% to 8% still a good range to consider with the context of the first half guidance?
Jeff Finnin: Good morning, Eric. I think when we referenced back to normal levels, we would consider our normal levels to be somewhere between 1% to 2% per quarter, so take a midpoint of some more around 3% from the backend of the year, and if you add on to that 4.25%, you're going to be somewhere towards the higher end of that 6% to 8% range. We are a ways out from some of that, but based on the visibility at least that we have in the first half, we wanted to at least make sure people were aware of it as you considering your models and obviously we are going to work to outperform, but that's our best visibility as we sit here today.
Erik Rasmussen: Great, thanks. And then the interconnection, your guide this year is 11% to 14% growth has been decelerating, obviously there is some churn as I think was it talked a little bit earlier that kind of leaks into the equation here. But what is an appropriate growth rate next year or what you are targeting is kind of a longer term, is it 11% to 14% still appropriate? Or can that change based on some of the development that's happening in the pipeline that you have?
Jeff Finnin: A great question, Eric. Let me address that. I think if you look at year-to-date growth for our interconnect, we're right at about 12.3%, and I would expect this to end up somewhere in our guidance range of 11% to 14%. If I had to guess maybe towards the lower end, but we'll see how Q4 ultimately produces. In terms of beyond that, we'll obviously plan to give some specific guidance as we typically do on our February call. I think the things to consider is that volume growth really generally is going to drive that revenue growth, absent any increases in pricing or migrating certain customers to different products. So I without giving a lot of specificity, I think it's a reasonable range, but as we get better clarity into 2019 will give some specifics around it probably in February.
Erik Rasmussen: Great, thanks. And one final one, obviously, you categorize next year as the transition year and there is a lot of development happening, and you know you talked in the past and it seems like it's still very much in an issue now or consideration is the local permitting. But what could potentially pull that or drive that growth rate up next year? I mean is there potential to pull some of these – from this land held for development into production now or is it difficult based on the market that you guys participate in?
Paul Szurek: So in terms of upside opportunities, the two primary things that could drive that would be; A, if we lease up more quickly the computer rooms that are coming on line in the new buildings that were constructing. B, if we have to start sooner constructing new computer rooms in those buildings or for example in the VA3 campus, where we actually have some shelf where we can add some additional computer rooms more quickly than doing ground up development. So if it is a big year for scale leasing that would be the sort of thing that would drive upside to what we described on this call.
Erik Rasmussen: Great, that helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ari Klein with BMO.
Ari Klein: Thanks. Just going back to Northern Virginia, as early to the pricing decline you've noted over the last 12 to 18 months. Have you seen that accelerate at all recently? And then just as far as the lack of available capacity recently. Has that in any way affected your customer relationship at all?
Paul Szurek: So, on the first question, I don't think we can pinpoint exactly when that pricing drop occurred over. That's why I said over the last 12 to 18 months, but it doesn't seem to have changed much in the last quarter or two as far as we can tell. On the second point to be honest, I think we've actually been fortunate in that we haven't had to – and part of this is holding some stuff back, so that we make sure we can take care of the existing customers, but we haven't had to disappoint any existing customers and their need or ability to expand in our current markets yet. Although, we do see them ramping up and using up space that was acquired previously, so we do need to stay on top of our development.
Ari Klein: Thank.
Operator: The next questions come from line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors.
Lukas Hartwich: Hi guys. Given the deceleration in interconnection revenue growth, do you think you're hitting some sort of saturation point there?
Paul Szurek: I mean I think the best that we can tell Lukas is that it is just – this part of the cycle related to telecom and carrier, M&A and subsequent pruning. There has been this longer term slow grind of the 10-gig or 100-gig, but that doesn't seem to have meaningfully changed. On the other hand as you know from the history of this industry, the cycles tend to increase and decrease as a new data products and new demand sources come up. So, I don't think we are negative about interconnection trend growth. We think it's a solid component of the story and the industry and consumer factors that drive it continued to be positive.
Lukas Hartwich: That's helpful. And then can you just remind us about the company stance on international expansion?
Paul Szurek: We just haven't seen it as necessary to fulfill our business plan or meet our customer needs. And so far compared to developing in the markets that we are in is not the best way to provide value to either our customers or shareholders.
Lukas Hartwich: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We reached at the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll like to turn the floor back to Paul Szurek for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: Thank you all for being on the call and for your interest in those good questions. We'll be at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. I am sure many of you will be there as well, and we look forward to seeing you. I'd like to just close by thanking my colleagues at CoreSite, as you can tell from the information we provide to you we have a lot of good things happening that require a really capable team, building out new capacity, bringing in all these high quality new customers into our ecosystem, continuing to drive a good product mix of customers within our ecosystem and great diversity there. These are not easy things to accomplish and I am really proud of how well all the members of our team prosecute their jobs day in and day out, and I'd like to thank the board. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-07-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Greer Aviv. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at CoreSite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We continue to execute well, achieving another quarter of strong growth with revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and FFO per share, each increasing 16% year-over-year. Regarding our strong internal growth, we had solid performance on substantially all measurements, including solid cash rent growth on renewals, low churn, and 8% year-over-year growth in same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent. Our sales activity generated $10.4 million net of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases. Our core retail co-location business was solid, and we had a good quarter in scale co-location leasing. Healthy organic growth is represented by 90% of GAAP rent side coming from the expansion of existing customers. New customers looking to optimize their IT architecture who are embarked on a digital transformation drove the 28 new logos we signed in Q2. More importantly, we believe we continue to see an increase in the quality of new logos. The annualized GAAP rents signed by them in Q2 increased 13% compared to the trailing 12 month average, while the number of kilowatts licensed increased 10%. Hybrid cloud architectures appeared to be gaining traction because they permit scaling, expansion, cost efficiencies, and adoption of new technology products, including the constantly-growing menu of cloud based applications. We believe most companies today can deploy valuable innovative applications even globally from a single well-connected datacenter with the right customer ecosystem and direct connect facilities. Our network in cloud-connected datacenters together with our customer communities can help businesses with this kind of rapid scaling and innovation while also generally lowering their cost per data center capacity. Our facilities continue to benefit from businesses requiring low latency and robust performance to serve many consumers and enterprises in our very large edge markets. We remain optimistic about the demand trends we are seeing in these markets, and supply is generally in balance with demand. Our Q2 pricing realized reflects the relatively stable pricing in the markets and segments we compete in. We also continue to make solid progress on the building blocks for future growth. In Los Angeles, we commenced construction on 28,000 square feet datacenter capacity at LA2, which is 100% pre-leased. Following the expansion signed by one of our strategic customers of LA2, we have approximately 65,000 square feet of remaining capacity at this building. Overall, we believe demand remains stead in LA and continues to outpace supply in the downtown market. With these dynamics in mind, we recently renewed our existing space in LA1 and expanded it to an additional 17,000 square feet. Importantly, this renewal and expansion extended the term of our lease by seven years to 2029, and extended our control over our space at One Wilshire to 2044. As it relates to LA3, we continue to progress through the permitting process and expect to break ground in the last quarter of 2018. Please bear in mind that the timing is almost entirely determined here in Santa Clara and Chicago by the municipal permitting process. In Reston, we remain on track with our current phase of development at VA3 Phase 1B scheduled for Q1 2019 delivery. In Santa Clara, we commenced demolition of the existing building on the SC8 site earlier this month. We expect to deliver Phase 1 consisting of 58,000 square feet of datacenter capacity during the third quarter of 2019. In Denver, we delivered 15,600 square feet of capacity in DE1 or capacity in the downtown area remains constrained. We have seen good demand in Denver. Finally, we completed 18,000 square feet of additional capacity in NY2 in Chicago. In summary, we are pleased with the quarter and we are grateful for the colleagues who drive our success. I remain optimistic about our future opportunity, reflecting our solid position in great markets with large numbers of dynamic enterprises, large populations of consumers of content, numerous sophisticated customers of cloud, analytics, and similar data products, and a good pipeline of capacity growth for the intermediate term. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul. Our new and expansion leasing activity was again driven by our core retail co-location group, which accounted for approximately 95% of leases signed in the quarter. We also had a good quarter in the scale co-location category, including a sizable expansion of existing enterprise customer. In total, we executed 143 new and expansion leases, totaling $10.4 million in net annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 65,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $178 per square foot, offset by near-term reduction in reservation fees. As it relates to portfolio wide pricing, on a per kilowatt basis, Q2 new and expansion pricing was approximately 3% above the trailing 12-month average, with variation by market similar to what we saw in Q1. We continue to focus on attracting high-quality new logos to our portfolio, signing 28 this quarter, which accounted for 10% of net annualized GAAP rent signed. Our well-established campuses are cloud-enabled networked datacenters continue to be a magnet for enterprises, with this vertical representing 65% of annualized GAAP rents signed from new logos. Among our new enterprise logos, our next generation networking technologies company [indiscernible] solutions. We also signed two large West Coast based health and social services agencies, Lifelong Medical and the [technical difficulty]. In the education vertical, we signed St. Johns University and Udemy, a leading online college level learning platform. Further, we had five IT solutions and services companies joining our ecosystem, including Lighthouse [ph], a Fortune 500 information technology, engineering, and science solutions provider. Our strong organic growth reflects the continued expansion of existing customers across our portfolio, which accounted for 90% of annualized GAAP rents on Q2, including enterprise customer that expanded its corporate with us in Los Angeles, discussed earlier. In Denver, we also signed an expansion with a large social media company, who will be deploying its peering exchange serving in the Rocky Mountain region with us. Turning now to our vertical mix, networking cloud customers accounted for 17% and 19% of annualized GAAP rents signed respectively. The network vertical had a very strong quarter with a high overall transaction count and six new logos signed, including Pilot Fiber, an Internet service provider that will deploy with us in four markets to support its growing footprint. We signed six new deployments from international networks, reflecting the continued strength and value of our ecosystem, with two of those international providers deploying at our Reston campus. Additionally, one of the world's largest telecom companies selected CorSite in Virginia and Denver for significant deployment over its corporate infrastructure directly linking it to our cloud on rents, improving its performance as it moves to a hybrid cloud architecture for its internal IT needs. The cloud vertical continued to perform well, adding four new logos, including cybersecurity and intelligence provider. Additionally, a large data based cloud and content provider expanded its footprint in Santa Clara to support the growth of one of its existing customers. Our enterprise vertical accounted for 64% of annualized GAAP rents signed, driven by a Fortune 500 customer that exercised its expansion option in anticipation of demand for its cloud platform in Los Angeles. In addition, several other existing customers expanded, including the new deployment with one of the fastest-growing demand side platforms in digital advertising, which shows CoreSite's first production environment and data analytics platform due to the ability to achieve scalability, high density and performance. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases were Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Northern Virginia, and New York, New Jersey, collectively representing 89% of annualized GAAP rents signed. Leasing on the Bay area was weighted towards expansion of existing customers in terms of verticals, cloud customers, leasing activity including a new logo in Prismo Systems, which is a local provider of software for enterprise digital security operations. New enterprise deployments included the signing by Stamps.com. Demand in Los Angeles was solid, with strength in the enterprise vertical, followed by network and cloud deployments. New logo activity was well-distributed among the verticals, and includes a network from LiveCom Limited, a Chinese provider of satellite-based voice services. In Northern Virginia, leasing was driven by the network vertical with deployments across all of our buildings in the market, and two networks deposited VA3 Phase 1A. Lastly, in New York New Jersey, demand continue to by led by enterprise customers, including four new logos; healthcare and media/gaming remain the primary demand drivers in this market along with financial services. In addition, a leading public power provider expanded its footprint at NY1. In summary, we are pleased with Q2 sales. Going forward, we will continue to focus on generating profitable organic growth, attracting high-quality new logos to our portfolio, and delivering incremental value to our customers as we grow our ecosystem and footprint. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. Our Q2 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $136.4 million, a 5.3% increase on a sequential quarter basis, and a 15.7% increase year-over-year. Datacenter revenue consisting of rental revenue, power revenue, and tenant reimbursements contributed $116.1 million to operating revenues, an increase of 5.6% on the sequential quarter basis and 16.6% year-over-year. Interconnection services contributed $17.4 million to operating revenues, an increase of 5.2% on a sequential quarter basis, and 13.7% year-over-year. Excluding U.S. Colo interconnection revenue, Q2 interconnection revenue grew 3.5% sequentially and 11.8% year-over-year. Turning to FFO; we reported $1.28 per diluted share in unit, up 0.8% on a sequential quarter basis and 16.4% year-over-year. As you think about sequential FFO growth in Q3, there are a few moving pieces to keep in mind as it relates to your models. First, in Q3 we usually have seasonally higher power cost, amounting to approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share. Second, as a result of the renewal and expansion of our lease at LA1, we expect an increase of approximately a penny per share in our rent expense. And third, we anticipate increases in our property taxes of about a penny per share. AFFO declined 0.5% sequentially, primarily due to higher interest expense and capitalized leasing commissions, reflecting an increased mix of scale, co-location leasing in Q2. On a year-over-year basis, AFFO increased 30.5% reflecting the growth in the operating portfolio and lower levels of recurring capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA of $74.9 million increased 2.7% sequentially and 15.5% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the trailing 12 months ended Q2 2018 was 54.7%, and remains in line with our expectations and our guidance for the full-year. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $5.4 million or 3.9% of total operating revenues, up 20 basis points year-over-year. General and administration expenses were $10.3 million or 7.5% of total operating revenues, down 60 basis points year-over-year. Both amounts are in line as a percent of revenue to our expectations for the full-year. Q2 same-store turnkey datacenter occupancy increased 430 basis points to 89.9% from 85.6% in the second quarter of 2017. Sequentially same-store turnkey datacenter occupancy increased 80 basis points. Additionally, same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 1.7% sequentially, and 8.3% year-over-year to $1,483. We renewed approximately 140,000 total square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $137 per square foot. Our renewed pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 2.8% on a cash basis and 5.7% on a GAAP basis. Year-to-date, our cash mark-to-market growth of 4.2% is in line with our guidance for the full-year. Churn was 1.3% and we continue to expect churn for the year to be in the 6% to 8% range. As you may recall, within our annual churn guidance, we expected a 200 basis points impact related to a specific customer move out in Q4. With increased visibility related to this specific customer, we now expect approximately 70 basis points of churn in Q3 with the remainder in Q4. We commenced 34,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $192 per square foot, which represents $6.5 million of annualized GAAP rent. Turning to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $9.9 million at June 30, 2018. On a cash basis, our backlog was $20.9 million. We expect approximately 42% of the GAAP backlog to commence during the second-half of 2018, with the remainder expected to commence during the first-half of 2019. We ended the quarter with our stabilized datacenter occupancy at 93%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to two computer rooms moving from the pre-stabilized pool to the stabilized pool. We have a total of 161,000 square feet of datacenter capacity and various stages of development across the portfolio. At the end of the second quarter, we had invested $56.3 million of the estimated $274.4 million required for these projects. Those buildings also include space for quick future construction of an additional 167,000 square feet of datacenter capacity. Turning to our balance sheet, our ratio of net principal debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.5 times, in line with the prior quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we had $336 million of total liquidity consisting of available cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility. In closing, I would like to address our updated guidance for 2018. I would remind you that our guidance reflects our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on page 23 of our Q2 earnings supplemental, our guidance updated for 2018 is as follows: total operating revenue is now estimated to be $537 million to $547 million compared to the previous range of $535 million to $545 million. Based on our year-to-date commencements of $22.7 million and our expectation for timing of commencements in our backlog, we now expect commencements for the full-year to be closer to $36 million to $38 million in annualized GAAP rent, compared to our original guidance of $40 million. As Paul mentioned, keep in mind that the timing of future construction deliveries and related leasing is driven in large part by each locality's permitting process. While the lower level of commencements should not have a material impact on 2018 earnings, realization of incremental revenue in 2019 will depend on the timing of permitting and subsequent completion dates for SV8, LA3, and CH2. So far the municipal approval processes are tracking at the slower end of our estimates. Adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be $293 million to $298 million, an increase of $2 million based on the midpoint of current and previous guidance. FFO is estimated to be $5 to $5.08 per share in OP unit. This midpoint of $5.04 per share represents an increase of $0.06 per share or 1.2% from the previous guidance. The increase in our FFO guidance also reflects lower than expected interest expense as a result of better-than-anticipated execution on the debt financing transactions completed in April. As it relates to our guidance for capital expenditures, we are increasing the total expected investment to a range of $280 million to $310 million, from the previous range of $250 million to $300 million. The increase is related to our outlook for datacenter expansion primarily related to commencement of construction at SV8 and LA2, which we now expect to be $258 million to $273 million compared to the prior range of $228 million to $253 million. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to first just clarify something, Jeff, if you could, in the guidance. Can you help me understand just the difference between the upward adjustment in the operating revenues in the context of the downward adjustment in the commencements?
Jeff Finnin: You bet. Really, Jordan, it's the increase in revenues is really attributable to two things. And that's really related to the timing of the commencements, and it's also related to the product mix, predominantly power. So as you think about commencements, even though we've taken them down slightly for the full-year, the first-half we experienced slightly higher than what we anticipated in terms of those commencements, so it led to higher revenue that we're expecting for the rest of the year. And then in terms of the profitability of the dollars, our product mix also helped contribute to most of that increase in revenue basically flowing down through adjusted EBITDA and to FFO. And then the other item that I mentioned in my prepared remarks really relates to just interest expense, which is we're doing better than what we anticipated in our original guidance. So those are really the three pieces that drive the $0.06 increase, but the revenue is really driven by timing of commencements and the product mix.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then in terms of product mix, is it -- it sounds like you mentioned power revenues. You saw a greater mix of breakered-amp type requirements or…
Jeff Finnin: That's exactly right. A greater proportion of the breakered product model than what we had anticipated.
Jordan Sadler: And can you expand on that a little bit. It was sort of an area of questioning I was curious about in terms of what you're seeing. Maybe that's better for Steve, trend-wise in terms of customer requirements. Are they -- it seems like they're still receptive, obviously to the breakered-amp product, but are you seeing more pushback and are more people looking for metered power solutions today or no?
Jeff Finnin: Let me just give you what the numbers are telling us historically and then Steve can give you a little commentary in terms of what the customers are seeing and saying. But if you just look at our product mix of power revenue today, that composition equals -- about 55% is on our breakered model and about 45% on our metered model. And that's been fairly consistent over the past several quarters. And so to date, we haven't seen a significant degradation of that breakered power model, but Steve can give you some commentary related to the conversations with customers.
Steve Smith: Yes, sure, thanks, Jeff. Hey, Jordan. Yes. As it relates to the overall mix and the, I guess, adoption of the breakered model, the core retail co-location space is a big focus for us. So it has been and we talked about that in the prepared remarks as well. And the bulk of those customers are typically buying at the size level and in the markets and the buildings where breakered is the predominant product that those customers are buying. It gives them better predictability around their costs and also gives us a better view into how we distribute power across the buildings. So overall, that's -- I think, just speaks to the health of our business in that core area of retail collocation and those hybrid type of deployments that we're seeing from those enterprise customers.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then Steve, lastly, while I have you, yes, I was curious -- Jeff talked about, I guess, the pace of permitting and titling, or maybe you know planning, moving a little bit slower on some of the builds. I'm kind of curious if that is at all affecting your ability on the pre-leasing side or basically, you know, what you're seeing on that -- on the pipeline for people who are interested in a possible pre-lease for some of those developments?
Steve Smith: Well from a overall pipeline perspective, if the pipeline continues to be healthy and you know, as you look at just the overall data growth in the market in general and just technology adoption, the pipeline does remain healthy. I think that the pre-leasing window is probably shorter than it's been historically, because there's more inventory that's available on the market. But at the same time you still see a healthy amount of pipeline that we feel like can time out well with when those commencements happen. So overall, it doesn't seem to be impacting us overall.
Paul Szurek: Jordan, I just would add -- this is Paul. We are still in the window of expectations for receiving permits that we signaled previously, just at the slower end of that and that's 100% reflected on the fact that we're building an infill market much stricter permitting processes, generally understaffed government agencies. In the long-term that creates a lot of the value in these markets, but it does make the short-term permitting harder to predict.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.
Paul Szurek: Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman: Yes, thanks for taking the question. So it seems like the smaller footprint leasing under a 1,000 was accelerated a bit off of last quarter. Just wondering, you seeing any -- you know, what's underlying that in terms of market demand last quarter versus this quarter in that category? And was the scale stuff, did you say it was driven by one customer in particular, the rise there to $4.6 million from $2.6 million last quarter?
Paul Szurek: Yes, I'll just speak to the overall demand aspects of the less than 1,000 square feet there first, I guess. I wouldn't say that I've seen any major shifts in that space, in that market. As I mentioned earlier, it's a continued focus for the company, our marketing team and our overall sales team to try to bring in those customers, the majority of which are enterprises that are looking to deploy and take advantage of the many networks and cloud on-ramps that we have in our datacenters. So overall, I'd say the trend is positive as more enterprises continue to adopt collocation in hybrid type of environments. But I wouldn't point to anything that says that anything dramatic has changed. As it relates to the larger scale leases, Jeff has probably more detail on the numbers there, but…
Jeff Finnin: Yes. Yes, Rob, it was driven by -- there's a handful of customers in that second bucket and obviously one was a little bit on the larger side, but without going into any specifics around customer individual customer is about what we can tell you to.
Robert Gutman: Okay, great. Thanks.
Paul Szurek: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you. The revenue per cabinet up I think it was up 8% pretty strong growth there just wondering if there's anything worth calling out in the sustainability of that going forward. And also just more broadly, Paul, just curious if you can give us your current thinking on the importance of market expansion having a global footprint, how that may or may not have changed in terms of your thinking over the last I guess since beginning of the year. Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Colby, let me address your first question really when you look at that MRR per cabi growth, what we saw this quarter is very consistent with what we've seen in the past several quarters which is the interconnection revenue in the power revenue are really driving the majority of that increase, So for instance interconnection revenue in our same-store on a per cabi basis was up 10% and power was up 13%. Overall contributing to the 8.3% increase we saw year-over-year and as we look at the second-half of the year I would tell you that we would anticipate that MRR per cabi growth to be at the mid to higher single digits consistent with what we saw the first two quarters of 2018 to give you some idea of what we expect.
Steve Smith: And then, Colby, expanding to new markets would be a nice to have not a need to have we have plenty of opportunity in the markets where we are and frankly building out the campuses in the scale, in the customer ecosystems is a really good way to drive value both for customers and for shareholders. We do continue to look at other markets. If we -- where we can enter and follow our existing business model. Internationally our views have not changed on that over the course of the year, we continue to have very good traction with non-U.S. customers attracted to our campus communities and increasing amount of our customers both new and old who are able to go international via other mechanisms than been established in their own data centers in other places. Cloud, content, delivery and things like that so I think we provide a very good service to those customers by making it easier for them to do that within our data centers that have all the companies in the utilities they need in order to do that.
Colby Synesael: Okay, thank you.
Paul Szurek: Thanks, Colby.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: Great, thank you. I want to dig into what factors inflation may be having in its potential impact on development yields what are you seeing your posts are in raw materials and labor and your outlook, you believe it kind of pass it along you did see that play into the increase CapEx for SB8 LA2? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Not really LA2, a little bit in SB8 labor costs in the North California market are have increased materials costs have increased a bit, I'm sure you all know what's going on in the background there. But with all that and as Steve mentioned in his prepared comments pricing continues to be pretty strong. We were actually 3% above our trailing 12 months average on a per kilowatt basis and so we still expect to achieve or exceed our targeted returns on investment that we've previously talked about, so yes you got to be you have to pay more attention to your development planning and design in cost Brian Warren and his team are doing a good job with that and we think everything will work out pretty well.
Frank Louthan: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Nick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, the guidance clarification for Jeff that you mentioned the timing of commencements and product mix for the revenue guidance change, how much should be U.S. Colo acquisition plan to that if I remember correctly last quarter you didn't include it and it was going to be worth a couple million bucks this year?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Nick what we're seeing from U.S. Colo is obviously it's contributing some to our revenues and has played in part to some of what we're seeing with the results and ultimately guidance. To date, U.S Colo contributed about for the second quarter they contribute about a $1 million of revenue in the quarter and that gives you some idea in terms of its contribution.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, then your maybe one bigger picture question, do you guys have any interest in developing your own SDN offering the way I can access or is that not something that makes sense for you?
Paul Szurek: So there's lot of different flavors of how companies can service customer desire for more nimbleness and how they provision aspects of their network. We recently pushed through and upgrade our open cloud exchange which provides a lot of that functionality more options for customers a broader range of choices they can make a greater API integration to other platforms and that's a utility that we can continue to evolve to give customers more control and flexibility about have a provision both cloud and network.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you for the question. Jeff, you made a comment earlier about 3Q, 2018 realizing higher power costs and I just want to understand what is driving that across your customer workloads and install bases like what is fundamentally happening around that time in the seasonality?
Paul Szurek: It's really not attributable to our customer workload. Sami it's really attributable to the rates that we receive from our power providers that's is something that happens every year due to the increased volumes of power consumption throughout the markets not just from data centers obviously just from the U.S. consumption in general and that's just very common we see it every year and it's about $0.01 to $0.02 per share in the third quarter is what we would consider to see?
Sami Badri: Got it and then the next question is more to do with how we should be thinking about modeling and the dividend and dividend growth rate over time and you've increased it now a couple times the last two years probably a little bit faster than what some people are already modeling should we think about modeling an adjustment like that payout ratio against the dividends like maybe like close maybe just give us an idea on how we should be doing is like how should we think about this in the next two years as far as like total dividend?
Paul Szurek: Yes, I think that the best way to look at that Sami as if you look at our payout ratio and just take the second quarter of 2018 and this is provided on page nine of our supplemental You can see that our payout is about 82% of our trailing 12 month FFO and it's about 91% of our trailing 12 month AFFO. I don't anticipate those increasing meaningfully there already at the fairly at the high level if they move it would be very at the margin at best, so what really is going to drive that growth is really growth in our cash flow which as we've talked in the past is really driven by what we define as cash flow that is distributable to our common equity holders, which is AFFO last nonrecurring capital. All of that's disclosed in the way in our supplemental but that's really the way we manage around our dividend increases is to monitor increases and CFDCE today and what we think it will do prospectively.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you.
Paul Szurek: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Eric Rasmussen: Yes, hi, thanks for taking the questions. So circling back with the permitting the patients seem to be slowing down but still kind of within the range but what has fundamentally changes it really just more of the supply and more deals kind of trying to be put through the system and then do you continue to see this as a headwind and are do you think that at some point things can free up a little bit and have a follow-up?
Paul Szurek: So honestly, I don't think there's any new news here within the ranges of what we said before and it's pretty typical for these types of permitting environments in fact I again I want to give credit to our development and construction team for being very proactive and getting us within the ranges that we've originally set, just to give you some historical perspective if you go back to VA2 which we built on land that we already own before we started the special exception, design and construction process we started that in early 2011 we're not able to bring new capacity on until the first quarter of 2015 so about four years, every project that we've got going on right now is tracking to about 50% of that timeline, so again not an unusual situation in many of these markets it just is what it is and it makes the asset more viable going forward.
Jeff Finnin: Eric, one thing that I will point out to just because I think it's important as you and others think about models for 2019 because obviously we've had three ground up developments that we're working as Paul alluded too another thing I think I would add as you saw we put us under construction this quarter and so we have better visibility into the timing we've disclosed that at this point as being sometime in Q3, 2019 as when we think will be completed with that first phase. As you think about the other two construction projects that we're working on LA3 and CH2 We've always said that we always thought LA3 would be expected to be completed by sometime in the back half of 2019. And we still expect it to be in late 2019 but as Paul alluded to subject to what happened on the permitting process as it relates to CH2 we've always been saying it sometime probably late 2019 early 2020 as we sit here today I think it's probably leaning towards more early 2020 before that would get completed again tracking towards the latter part of our original estimate, so just think about that fact of that and as you guys model 2019.
Eric Rasmussen: Thanks. That's helpful and then just around easy seems to be a lot of variability on your larger Colo deals. The prior two quarters, numbers were either were down or lower but then you've seen a meaningful improvement this quarter it speak to maybe that is it just the nature of this business can explain the variances and maybe your expectations for these larger deals?
Steve Smith: Yes, this is Steve that for you it is lumpy as you've seen in our results and I think we kind of call that out as the expectation both in prior calls as well as going forward. We do look to really be disciplined on how we approach that marketplace and make sure that those leases that we're signing on that larger scale are additive and complement our ecosystem, so there's a lot of hyperscale deals that are going on out there that are probably not a great fit for us. Given the economics that are associated with it and whether or not they value the ecosystem of our customers as well as networks and other on ramps and so making sure that we get those right customers and right deployments. Doesn't happen every day but there is still a good pipeline of those type of deployments that are out there.
Eric Rasmussen: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from John Peterson which Jefferies and Company. Please go ahead.
John Peterson: Great, thanks. So the pricing on new leases this quarter was a little below average from recent quarters but obviously you guys had one or two large scale deals I'm just kind of curious if you could break maybe out the different product types smaller leases, skill side leases. I mean how are rents trending and then maybe even a little more specifically on the scale side you seen rents trend on down like we're seeing with some of these like really huge hyper scale deals, how you guys usually plan?
Paul Szurek: So John, let me let me take a stab at that and Steve and Jeff can jump in it if I omit anything. We tried to give both space and power pricing because both components play into our business and with higher density step the power side of it actually tends to be more meaningful and as you saw from Steve's comments on a per kilowatt basis our pricing was 3%, the trailing twelve months. We don't break out pricing by market and by product because quite honestly that just gives away too much competitive information. But we do look at that internally and we feel good about where the trends are as Steve said it's up in some markets down and some others but overall it's up and as it relates to scale leasing, we tend to focus on those scale leasing opportunities that need to retail co-location ecosystem or the network ecosystem. There's more value to those types of scale opportunities in our data centers and so far we're seeing that pricing hold up pretty well although that does vary by market.
John Peterson: Okay, thank you. And then maybe a question for Jeff on the balance sheet, I mean, just thinking about your capital needs between now and the end of the year and maybe into 2019, I guess what sort of financing needs do you have I guess how does the preferred market look today versus maybe some unsecured debt and then also with the permit in process I guess slowing down some of these developments in LA, Santa Clara, and Chicago, does that kind of push out I guess your capital needs? And a little bit trying to think about how we should be modeling from that perspective?
Jeff Finnin: Sure. Yes, John, I think when you look at the guidance, we updated related to our CapEx spend, you can see the midpoint went up by about $20 million so kind of $295 million is what we are currently guiding to in terms of total CapEx spend. We spend $120 million in the first-half, which means you will see some acceleration spend in the second-half of the year upwards around $175 million, just given what our total liquidity is, I don't think we need to do anything from a financing perspective through the end of this year and so there is no need to do it. Having said that, it is something we watch closely to see whether or not there is any type of movements or changes in the markets that we might want to take advantage of. But as we sit here today if I had to bend, I would say I can't imagine doing something by the end of the year, it's probably be more of a first quarter maybe early Q2 2019 type of event unless something changes significantly from a pricing perspective that we might want to capture before the end of the year.
Paul Szurek: I would only add that given our low leverage, I don't think we would tap the preferred market.
Jonathan Atkin: All right, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Choe: Hi, I wanted to ask about the churn event in 4Q, so far rental revenue has been growing on a dollar basis at a very nice rate, how should we think about the impact of that churn event and then going into '19, what the quarterly impact will be?
Jeff Finnin: Richard, let me see if I can address that and add any additional commentary. So we updated our guidance this quarter related to that particular churn event and just given some incremental visibility we have, we know that that particular customer is going to churn about 70 basis points of their deployment in the third quarter and we are estimating the remaining 130 basis points of churn in the fourth quarter. So I'm not sure I could add any more commentary associated with it beyond that other than to say that it's obviously a customer we continue to have conversations with and we will ultimately what they end up during the fourth quarter but at this point we are modeling as if they churn but we don't have perfect visibility into that as we sit here today.
Paul Szurek: And Richard that, even that it just puts our churn in our normal historical range year-b-year.
Richard Choe: Yes, I appreciate that Paul, I think we typically expect as though we are continuing to expect 6% to 8% churn for the full year of 2018.
Paul Szurek: And I guess just some added color I guess there relative to the churn of that customer. The churn that we do expect is on our stronger markets, so as far as the backfilling and more customers in there were bullish on that and optimistic.
Richard Choe: So can I take away from that that if the customer didn't churn, churn would be probably lower and as probably could be quickly backfilled?
Paul Szurek: I think that's a good way to look at it, yes.
Richard Choe: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ari Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ari Klein: Hi, thanks. Maybe just following up on that last question, what kind of interconnection footprint does that customer that's churning have? And then, maybe turning to the -- to the scale leasing opportunities, how does that compare to, how do the pipeline for that compare to maybe a year ago and do you expect that to continue to grow?
Paul Szurek: Yes, as far as the interconnection footprint typically on those larger leases we eventually have interconnection as less than you would see on a couple of smaller deployments where you look at it on our either per square footage basis or on a per kilowatt basis. I don't have the specifics in front of me and so that's individual customer, I'm not sure we will disclose that anyway, but not a material amount I guess it's probably the easiest way to put it in this great scheme of things is it relates to our interconnection landscape. As you think about scale leasing, as I mentioned before it's -- it is lumpy as far as the deals that we write, the overall pipeline is still very healthy as I mentioned earlier and the forecast as we look towards it is optimistic, it's just a matter of aligning those key deployments that also again value our ecosystem or looking to take advantage of it but also are willing to essential pay for it. There are some lower cost providers out there that don't offer that same value and if they are looking for just space, power and cooling and don't value that, it's probably not a great fit for us. So there is a lot of kilowatts that are being sold out there that's probably on a great fit for us and how we align that and be disciplined around our pricing and outfits and our ecosystem is the game we play. So overall we are optimistic and it looks possible.
Ari Klein: And regarding the extended development timelines, how should we think about CapEx into next year, can it be higher than 2018?
Paul Szurek: Yes, Ari, as you think about it typically when we have ground up development starts like what we would expect to see what LA3 in 2019 that's typically going to drive CapEx at the higher [technical difficulty] than we would normally see. Without giving you some specific numbers, I would just anticipate it. I wouldn't see it decreasing meaningfully from what we expect for this year, let's just say that. I would expect it to be a little bit elevated like what we saw again this year.
Ari Klein: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Lukas Hartwich: Hi, guys. Just one from me as computing seems to kind of continue with positive momentum, what sort of opportunity do you think that presents for CoreSite?
Steve Smith: Yes, I will dive in on that one. This is Steve, I think it's a great opportunity for us and it continues to -- you continue to see innovation in the marketplace that just turn the new businesses into global players, traditional brick and mortar type of businesses are being put on their head and now being done in more electronic ways that require low latency and all those are being deployed at the edge, a lot of round artificial intelligence as well as the emergence of 5G on the mobile front all that leads to the critical need to improve speeds of the end-user which means edge computing. So we feel like we are well positioned for that because that requires interconnection and networks to make that happen and we feel like we have a great model and in terms of both the interconnection footprint that we have as well as the ability to support some of those kind of I would call like kind of mid scale type of deployments that are typically come along with us, those edge type of environments.
Lukas Hartwich: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great, thanks. I will just ask one. I know you said last quarter you are operating it is slightly lower level of sellable inventory that you had historically, you could just update us on where you sit today, you inventory levels we look out towards the second-half to 2018 and whether I need potential capacity constraints could impact your ability to do continue your momentum with scale leasing over the course of the year? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: So the good news is that we've restored our sellable inventory to more normal levels. I think we ended the quarter with about 265,000 square feet, a sellable inventory, we actually have -- we completed so far this year a 147,000 square feet. We actually have 161,000 square feet of the initial phases of development in various stages of construction or development and in those buildings we could very quickly have another 167,000 square feet of capacity and we still have some capacity in other markets for expansion. So we feel like we are in good shape when you look back over the last two years, we were. We have one building under construction in July of 2016 and no new land for development and now we've got four projects under construction or in development on new land and all of them are proceeding to pay, so we feel like we've rebuilt the pipeline and although the timing related to permitting is not greatly predictable, it's a matter of short timing and once we get through that the new capacity will come on in a very regular pace.
Eric Luebchow: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would like to turn the floor over to Paul Szurek for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: Thank you for joining us today. I do want to thank my colleagues for another solid quarter. We are all very fortunate to work with a talented group of people here at CoreSite. I also want to congratulate Steve and Maile Kaiser on their new roles of Chief Revenue Officer and Senior Vice President of Sales respectively, and thank them for taking all those larger roles. I look forward to seeing Steve and Maile can both further drive growth with their broader responsibilities. It is great that this exciting industry and our organizational ethos combine to enable us to provide these kinds of growth opportunities for our team. We look forward to the future. I hope you all have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-04-26 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and thank you for joining today's CoreSite Realty Corporation First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Greer Aviv, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you, you may begin. Thank you, Mr. Aviv. You may begin.
Greer Aviv: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to CoreSite's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at CoreSite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our financial results again demonstrate consistent execution and solid growth with revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share increasing 13% and %year-over-year respectively. The components of our internal growth remain strong as evidenced by healthy same store growth and monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent, low churn, strong cash rent growth on renewals and continuing operating and power efficiency improvements. We are fortunate to have an excellent team operating in great markets and to have built an advantages position in these markets. Our data center campuses combined dense network nodes with purpose built power efficient, scalable, flexible data centers suitable for the higher density applications that are being more regularly deployed. Our customers benefit from an IT environment that minimizes latency, accommodates high data volumes and provides exceptional interoperability of enterprises, clouds, networks and managed service providers, resulting in unusually valuable solutions. The network effects of our customer ecosystems increased the stickiness of deployments, drive interconnection revenue and attract quality new logos. Our sales activity generated 7.1 million of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases. Sales activity was constrained by less available capacity in key markets. We entered the quarter with approximately 32% less than typical capacity in our four largest markets. Near the end of the quarter we restored capacity to more normal levels with the completion of computer rooms at VA3 and LA2. Meanwhile, the quality of sales was very high due to continued strength in our core retail colocation business, which is generally proven to be more profitable over time. We had a healthy balance of organic capacity expansions by existing customers coupled with one of our strongest quarters in numbers and quality of new logo acquisition, which has historically boded well for future organic growth. These new logos reflect continued robust demand for our network and cloud-dense platform in large edge markets. Demand is holding up well with supply for the most part in balance. Pricing therefore, seems generally stable around our markets especially for our core retail collocation, performance sensitive and hybrid IT deployments. In Los Angeles we placed into service 87,000 square feet of multitenant data center capacity, 54% of which was preleased and commenced in the quarter. Additionally, in early Q2, we acquired another Los Angeles colocation provider that operates in One Wilshire and the nearby Hope Street building, acquiring more than 120 additional customers, increasing our economies of scale in downtown LA and ending litigation with that company. In Reston we completed and placed into service at the end of the quarter a colocation room of 26,000 square feet of turnkey capacity at VA3 Phase 1A and have seen strong interest from both existing customers and new prospects for this new capacity. We ended the first quarter with 108,000 square feet of additional turnkey capacity under construction, including Phase 1B at our Reston expansion and projects in DC, Denver and New York. We continue to expect to break ground on SV8 and LA3 later this year, which together will provide an additional 355,000 square feet of multi-tenant shell with a combined 12 megawatts of initial computer rooms. While we have increased staffing in our data centers to keep up with customer reliability needs, we have simultaneously improved operating efficiencies in most parts of the organization. As important, our operating and technical approved minutes increased our power utilization efficiency by approximately 8% compared to a year ago. In summary, our hybrid business model and the resulting strong organic growth and industry leading returns on capital continue to deliver good results and to provide a solid runway for future success. With that I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks Paul. New and expansion leasing activity was solid our core retail colocation group, which accounted for more than 95% of signings in the quarter. In total we executed 136 new and expansion leases totaling $7.1 million in annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 30,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $239 per square foot. Most importantly we continue to see excellent volumes of new logos acquired, with Q1 being the highest level in the last twelve months, while the value of the pipeline has also been trading higher over the same period. As you relate to portfolio wide pricing a per kilowatt basis Q1 was 1% above the trailing 12 month average with variations only above or below the trail to depending upon the market. We signed 47 new logos, which accounted for 25% of annualized GAAP rent signed, compared to 8% over the trailing 12 months. Enterprise customers accounted for the majority of the annualized GAAP rent signed from these new logos, reflecting the growing demand for hybrid use cases that value low latency, access to cloud On-Ramps and world class support of their critical IT environments. Among our new logos are five new financial organizations, including the leading European Stock Exchange and [indiscernible] a high frequency trading technology firm. Further we saw an uptick in demand from the transportation sector, signing three new logos, including a leading designer and manufacture luxury mission electric buses, a provider of solutions for global air traffic control, airlines and airport operations as well as the developer of GPS tracking and fleet automation solutions. We also continue to see good traction in the online content and services industry with one of the largest online content marketing and advertising companies joining our platform, along with an internationally e-discovery and digital prints and solutions provider. Existing customers also continue to expand across our portfolio which accounted for 75% of annualized GAAP rent signed in Q1. Many of these customers are scaling the footprint across the CoreSite platform as they further leverage the benefits of our strategic proximity in major edge markets. While our scale of colocation lease signings were modest by historical standards, the pipeline and capacity is solid and were lumpy in nature we continue to strategically work towards winning these deployments as they add value in supporting the ecosystem in hybrid cloud customers like the architectures. Before discussing our vertical performance, I want to point out that in Q1 and moving forward we have updated our customer vertical composition to help us more effectively cost supplier accounts based on the core services the customer provide to its end users. You will notice small shifts in the vertical diversification chart on Page 16 of the supplemental to reflect the update a customer classifications. Network and cloud customers accounted for 21% and 13% of annualized GAAP rent signed respectively. The network protocol had another strong quarter of activity with the highest transaction count since Q3 2016, including the new logos. We also signed a significant power expansion with a subsea cable in the Bay Area, evidence of continuing demand from our subsea customer base. The cloud vertical produced a very healthy 70 logos including a network-cloud for one of the largest global SaaS providers to support a new deployment in Northern Virginia. Additionally a leading e-commerce platform expanded with the new deployment at SV7 to support a new hybrid model leveraging AWS Direct Connect. As it relates to enterprise vertical, this vertical accounted for 66% of annualized GAAP rent signed driven by steady growth in the content vertical. In addition to the new logo customers I discussed earlier, we also signed several in place expansions with existing strategic content customers in Los Angeles, the Bay Area and Boston. Finally, an existing 41,000 global live sciences customer expanded its footprint in the Bay Area From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases were Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, New York, New Jersey and Northern Virginia collectively representing 88% of annualized GAAP rent signed. Bay Area leasing was well distributed among all our facilities with available capacity and was driven primarily by organic expansions of existing customers. In terms of verticals, enterprise and network customers accounted for a large portion of leasing activity along with the new deployment for next gen multimedia on behalf of its end customer, which is one of the largest network cloud and e-commerce providers in China. Demand in Los Angeles remained steady with strength in the enterprise vertical followed by network and cloud deployments. In New York, New Jersey we continue to see good momentum with the highest level of annualized GAAP rent signed in the last two years. Enterprise leasing was strong, especially from the financial and healthcare and an uptick from performance sensitive applications such as gaming and media. Finally in Northern Virginia, leasing was well balanced with healthy activity in all verticals. Absorption is steady with demand from the top technology customers continuing to grow or we are seeing a continued trend of sophisticated data center customers shifting to higher density deployments. In summary, 2018 is up to a good start. We've solid momentum on our core retail colocation business remaining discipline and opportunistic with regard to larger scale colocation opportunities. We're looking forward to our next phase of newly constructed capacity and growth for the company. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks Steve and hello everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q1 financial results followed by an update on our development CapEx and our leverage and liquidity capacity. Q1 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $129.6 million, 2.9% increase on a sequential quarter basis and 12.8% increase year-over-year. Operating revenue consisted of $107.4 million and data center revenue comprised of rent and power, an increase of 2.4% on a sequential quarter basis and 13% year-over-year. Interconnection services contributed $16.6 million to operating revenues, an increase of 1.9% on a sequential quarter basis and 14.1% year-over-year. The lower sequential growth in Q1 reflects the impact of a large network customer rationalizing its cross connects due to its acquisition activity. As we have seen over the years, there are quarterly fluctuations with cross connect, adds and disconnects and we believe it is more relevant to look at growth on a trailing 12 months basis. Specifically for the trailing 12 months ended Q1 2018, interconnection revenue increased 17.3% driven by 10% increase in total volume over the 12 months ended Q1 2017. Turning to FFO, we reported $1.27 per diluted share in unit up 7.6% on a sequential quarter basis, excluding the non-cash expense related to the original issuance cost of our redeemed preferred stock in Q4. On a year-over-year basis FFO per share increased 12.4%. Our first quarter FFFO per share contains a benefit of approximately $0.02 related to onetime items. The first being, better than expected cash collections, which resulted in a reversal of bad debt expense. The second item reflected funds from a legal settlement with an office customer relating to its lease. AFFO growth was also strong increasing 18.1% year-over-year due primarily to lower levels of tenant improvements and capitalized leasing cost. Adjusted EBITDA of $72.9 million increased 6% sequentially and 13.2% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the trailing 12 month ended Q1 2018 was 54.7% and was in line with our expectations and our guidance for the full year. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $5.1million or 3.9% of total operating revenues. General and administrative expenses were $9.2 million or 7.1% of total operating revenues, both amounts are in line as a percent of revenue to prior year and our expectations for the full year. Now turning to our same store metrics, Q1 same store turnkey data center occupancy increased 430 basis points to 89.1% from 84.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Sequentially, same store turnkey data center occupancy increased 40 basis points. Additionally, same store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 0.8% sequentially and 9.3% year-over–year to $1,458. Keep in mind that our same store pool is redefined annually in the first quarter and the 2018 pool only includes turnkey data center space that was leased to our colocation customers as of December 31, 2016 and excludes our power to shell data center capacity. We renewed approximately 119,000 total square feet at an annualized GAAP rent of $170 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 5.6% on a cash basis and11.5% on a GAAP basis. Churn was 1.9%, which included 100 basis points impact from to move outs, including the customer in New York that we alluded to during the Q4 call. The second customer consolidated its capacity in Santa Clara and the vacated space has already been back filled with the new lease schedule to commence in the second quarter. We continue to expect churn for the year to be in the 6% to 8% range inclusive of a specific customer that is expected to contribute 200 basis points of churn in the fourth quarter. We commenced 82,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $184 per square foot which represents $16.2 million of annualized GAAP rent. The level of commencements was in line with our expectations and as a reminder we expect commencements of $40 million in annualized GAAP rent for the full year. We ended the quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 93.4%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the churn at our Santa Clara campus that I just mentioned. At LA2, 21,000 square feet moved into the stabilized pool at 86.3% occupancy while 25,000 square feet at VA2 moved into the stabilized pool at 75.4% occupancy. We completed forty seven thousand square feet of data center capacity at LA2, which was 100% occupied and is now also reflected in the stabilized pool. In addition we completed another 40,000 square feet at LA2 and 26,000 square feet and VA3 Phase 1A, both of which were completed and are now components of the pre-stabilized pool. Turning to backlog projected annualized GAAP rent from signed, but not yet commenced leases was $3.7 million at March 31, 2018. On a cash basis our backlog was $16.8 million. We expect substantially all of the GAAP backlog to commence during the second quarter. We have a total of 108,000 square feet of data center capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. As of the end of the first quarter we had invested $40 million of the estimated $131 million required to complete these projects. Keep in mind that the capacity currently under construction and the associated investment does not include forecasted investment for projects currently in permitting, entitlement or design including SV8, LA3 and CH2. Turning to our balance sheet, our ratio of net principle debt to Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.4 times in line with the prior quarter. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we closed on an amended and expanded credit facility with $1.05 billion of total borrowing capacity. This credit facility amendment also extended our debt maturity profile with no maturities until June 2020. The revolving credit facility amendment provides an incremental $100 million of borrowing capacity, bringing its capacity to $450 million and extends the primary term of the facility to April 2022, with a one year extension option. In addition, we entered into a new five year $150 million term loan. This new loan matures in April 2023 and bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. We chose to swap 75 million of the variable interest rate associated with this term loan to a fixed rate of 4.1%. As of March 31, 2018 pro-forma for the financing and related swap, our ratio of fixed versus variable rate debt would be 47% fixed versus 53% variable, in line with our stated goal of maintaining a balance between fixed and variable priced instruments in our capital structure. Including of the increased liquidity resulting from the financing transactions, we had $381.7 million of total liquidity available, including cash on the balance sheet at March 31, 2018. As we mentioned in previous calls, we will update guidance when we believe conditions have changed materially enough to alter the limits of our guidance range and we still think the range of guidance previously provided is appropriate. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks and good morning. First question regarding the pipeline Steve, I think you characterized it as solid. I'm curious if you could sort of parse the trend in the pipeline sequentially for us. I'm wondering if you're continuing to aggregate or accumulate new potential clients or existing clients and capacity or if you're losing folks to alternative inventory in the market.
Steve Smith: Sure. Hey, Jordan, thanks for the question. As it relates to the overall pipeline the result of spoke to in the prepared remarks around new logos. There is a concerted effort to try to bring in more new logos as they have demonstrated future organic growth for us, so that is the focus for the company and we like the success that we've seen out of Q1, so that is a continued effort. We do see more of that in the pipeline. Overall, as far as general pipeline is concerned, I would say it's consistent, but consistently growing as we find more and more customers that value the platform and want to buy from us, so we're encouraged with what we see so far.
Jordan Sadler: Any color you can sort of share on sort of how you've been limited by capacity, so just maybe provide an example of where or how you're limited and how that sort of stems the ability to put up overall leasing volume revenue.
Steve Smith: Sure, and I think really it comes down to those larger leases that likely show up in larger chunks of revenue as well, so as you look at the broader capacity across the platform large chunks of space are fewer in various markets and particularly in some of our strongest markets, which therefore has an effect as to those larger leases and sometimes kind of the larger edge or kind of scale type of environments that we would otherwise win, so that's really the biggest space where we have been constrained.
Jordan Sadler: And then just one point of clarification, Jeff, did you say on churn, on the 68% guidance that includes or excludes the customer that's going to contribute 200 basis points of churn in 4Q?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, Jordan that annual 68 includes that 200 basis points.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, is that a year-end move out or is it just some time in -
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, it's a mid Q4 term at this point in time.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, thank you.
Jeff Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from wind of Dave Rogers with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Dave Rodgers: Yeah, hey guys Jeff I wanted to follow up on your comment about 10% increase in cross connect volume and parse that out, you obviously lost a decent amount of cross connects with the churn event in the fourth quarter and it's now again early in the year. What does that volume growth look like? It's historically been 14%, so can you give us a sense of what that looks like either without the customer churn event or what maybe the new adds might have been to offset that in the fourth and first quarter?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, good morning, Dave. I think the best way - historically we've given volume growth sometimes in the aggregate, which is what I'm referenced in my 10% and sometimes we also give volume growth for just fiber, just to give you some color around that. Obviously our fiber cross connects make up roughly 80% of all of our cross connects which - that is the product that we sell that really probably drives the most performance in terms of volume. If you look at it just isolated on the fiber cross connects that volume growth was 13.6% year-over-year, gives you a better idea exactly what's driving the volume growth and obviously the revenue growth as well.
Dave Rodgers: And sorry, that 13.6 is net of the churn as well just on fiber?
Jeff Finnin: That's correct, yeah. And I would say, just to give you some other color in terms of the adds versus disconnects, the - really what drove the lower volume growth was we just had a higher disconnects. Our growth rates were coming in, in line with our expectations, it was really some of the churn we experienced in the first quarter from the one customer that had higher than what we would typically see in terms of disconnects.
Dave Rodgers: Okay, that makes sense and that's helpful. Thanks, Jeff. And then maybe Steve as you look forward, you had talked about starting SV8 later in the year, do you worry and look out at pricing at all as you start a larger facility and how do you kind of plan to go to market with that type of asset? Would you build it completely spec, will you add some tenants ahead of time, how are you thinking about that and pricing?
Steve Smith: Sure, well specific to the Bay Area, we've seen pricing hold up very well there. There are some additional inventory that's coming online, so we continue to watch that very closely, but I think one of the things that we do benefit from specifically in Santa Clara is a very strong customer base that is also looking to expand as well as other customers that just value that location, the interconnection that we bring along with it and the ecosystem. So we do watch it and there is, as I mentioned, some other capacity coming online, but so far pricing seems to be holding and we're optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us.
Dave Rodgers: Okay, great. Thank you.
Steve Smith: Thanks Dave.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks, so it sounds like demand is quite strong and the financial results certainly were quite solid, but I do want to drill down on just the churn topic. The churn that you saw around disconnects, was that listed as cabinet churn or was that cross connects grooming or was that cross connect absolute disconnects, grooming meaning going from say 10 gig to 100 gig?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah John the specific item we referenced is really a customer we would best describe is really rationalizing their cross connect deployments and they were disconnecting certain of those cross connects because of some M&A activity on their side. They happen to acquire a customer or two of ours and they're just rationalizing their spend based on what they see in the traffic that they're trying to exchange between different parties.
Steve Smith: Then Jonathan, just to give you a little bit more color there, I was just going to say as far as the rationalization it really just rationalizing various assets that they may have done. We've done it in various locations it's more about consolidating those than it is about any impact of 100 gig versus 10gig.
Jonathan Atkin: If there are anything going on, on that front or are you like getting it cycled through that or have you yet to see it or have already seen it in terms of the grooming impact?
Steve Smith: As you look at just the last decade of M&A activity across the telecom industry, it's happened pretty regularly over that period of time and we see a lot just based here in Denver there's a lot that goes on. So it happens and it's happened over time and I think it will continue to happen as we go forward, but on balance I think if you look at the collective demand for data, the applications were rolling out and the continued demand for interconnection, the broad based fundamentals are very strong, so I think you'll see more of that as more M&A happens, but I think on balance the market as a whole continues to grow.
Jonathan Atkin: And 4Q event this year that Jeff talked about mid 4Q, is that more just sort of cabinet - somebody exiting the contract, so can you provide color around what sort of vertical, which geography are we talking about?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, it's obviously a customer of ours there and more than one geo Jonathan and an enterprise customer of ours that is just not getting full utilization out of their space and again that terms in mid Q4.
Jonathan Atkin: And then finally is there anything to call out, DHV, SV8, given the nature of the pipeline that you're seeing, anything different about the products that's been marketed or indicates that C8 will be built around resiliency or power density that you would want to call out and related to that anything about cost to bills in terms of labor or materials or speed to deployments are there any different trends to be aware of in the overall markets?
Paul Szurek: Jon, this is Paul. VA3 is traditional colocation network-dense and so you have to maintain a fairly high level of resiliency there. SV8 will be very similar to SV7 for similar reasons. Having said that, we have redesigned the electrical system around more cost effective concurrent maintainable structure, which does generate some cost savings. In addition, frankly we're seeing overall I would say net reductions in cost due to better process management and better procurement practices and so those are offsetting - more than offsetting some of the other cost increases that you mentioned that are happening in the construction market. But for these major metro networking cloud-dense note higher levels of resiliency are still required by margin [ph].
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Rollins: Hi, good morning. I was curious if you could just put a couple of things into a little bit further context. So first on the bookings, just curious if you could describe a bit more about whether competition, whether it's from the cloud or from other competitors and regions having any impact on the flow of bookings over the last couple of quarters? And then secondly on the releasing spreads 5.6 this past quarter, what's driving that number, is it the price gap between you and your competitors, is it power densities or what's helping get the releasing spreads that you're achieving? Thanks.
Steve Smith: Sure, thanks Michael. This is Steve. I'll start off and Paul you can chime in as you will there. As far as the overall bookings over the last quarter and you mentioned last two quarters and the impact of competition, I would say it's less about competition more about available space to sell and how we align with that. The competitive landscape as it relates to their available capacity does impact that I guess, so that's that is one factor to convey to consider there. But overall as we look at the broader based pipeline of the activity the number of customers that are buying for us as reflected in the results of transactions and logos it actually was very healthy. And so overall in balance the - how we're showing up in the marketplace and how customers are buying from us remains very strong.
Paul Szurek: As it relates to the mark-to-market performance, I think that also speaks to the value of the platform primarily and that sticky customer base that continues to grow in value the ecosystem more than anything as well as the lot of customers that we have in place that continue to auto renew and renew on a regular basis and continue to grow with us, so I don't think there's any magic there other than just that intrinsic value in the ecosystem.
Michael Rollins: Thanks very much.
Paul Szurek: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Please proceed with your question.
Robert Gutman: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Of the $16.1 million of commencements in the quarter, how much of that came from the preexisting commencement backlog versus signed and commenced deals in the quarter? And secondly what do you see as the time horizon on lease up for some of the pre-stabilized properties mainly in Northern Virginia and Los Angeles, which don't seem to have any leasing as of yet?
Jeff Finnin: Hey, Rob. Let me first address your question as it relates to commencements. My recollection was, don't quote me on the exact numbers, but we entered the year with a backlog of what we thought was going to commence in the quarter of just north of 13 million and so I want to say about 3 million of those commencements resulted from sales that we actually generated in the quarter and also commenced in the quarter, so call it about $3 million of that was incremental to the backlog that we had coming into the year.
Paul Szurek: As it relates to the other property, in Los Angeles we actually brought on board much more than the pre-stabilized capacity this quarter. The overall capacity was roughly 88,000 square feet, 54% of that was leased. Much of that was on one floor, so we just put the floor into the stabilized pool and the balance of it is in the pre-stabilized pool. And it's not unusual for us to put new retail colocation capacity directly into the pre-stabilized pool without much pre-leasing just the character that's space does lends up well to pre-leasing and really more the character of the customer. Having said that, we do already have one lease in VA3 and we have a lot of interest in both of these in good pipelines for both of these computer rooms and we're very glad to have the additional capacity on hand.
Robert Gutman: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you. First up, just regarding the acquisition that you made in LA, I wonder if you could just provide a little bit more color in terms of revenue, EBITDA or FFO impact as well as utilization of that 30,000 square feet? Yeah, I think you mentioned 120 customers, so I would assume there's some financials. And then secondly, I think the goal is 40 million in commencements in 2018, you did 16 million in the first quarter, I think your backlog is about 4 million to call halfway there. How comfortable are you with that goal relative to where you are today? Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, good morning, Colby. Let me give you some commentary first about the company US Colo in the Los Angeles market, just ballpark they have about $5 million in annualized revenue. In terms of the impact to 2018, we have assumed about $0.01 to $ 0.02 of accretion per share for 2018 that gives you some idea where their adjusted EBITDA and FFO are coming in. In terms of the space itself, it's about 30,000 square feet of capacity there and they're largely I would say stabilized at this point in time; there's not a lot of that. It's very highly utilized at this point in time, so it gives us some idea in terms of where they are and obviously we'll get more into the granularity as we integrate and get our team involved working closely with their individuals at this point in time. In terms of the commencements, you're right. Based on what we did in Q1 in our visibility with our backlog we're right at the 50% mark. And obviously it's something we'll continue to monitor as we look forward and the other 20 million of that is obviously going to have to come from our future shells which Steve and his team continue to work very hard at and will keep you updated in terms of how we proceed during the year. I think in general that's just one of those guidance numbers that we will update as we see fit and periodically as we see changes needed and at this point in time where we are at this point we're comfortable with our guidance not only our commitments but everything else that we've given guidance till today.
Colby Synesael: I just put a follow up then so as relates to the acquisition, so you're not changing your revenue guidance, but I guess you're swimming with this cost $2.5 million or $3 million from that, just want to clarify? And then secondly as relates to the commencements, assuming you have to do 20 million in the back half of the year, is it fair to assume that you are assuming in that a fairly notable step up in leasing somewhere in the next few quarters relative to what we've seen the last two quarters.
Jeff Finnin: You're correct; we're not changing our guidance. Again materially we don't think it needs to be modified and if you can read into it as you need to, but I think that's the way the numbers would play out in terms of the quarter expectation for the next three quarters in terms of sales and ultimately commencements.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Thank you, regarding a recent Chinese hyper scale deployed into your data centers earlier year in the year, specifically Alibaba and to Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia. Have you or any of your customers seen any concerns that were expressed around international, specifically a Chinese tenant and interconnection-dense facilities. Could we just get any color on that because you have heard from things from the channel regarding concerns we just wanted to get your take on what you are seeing on your side.
Steve Smith: Yeah, thanks for the question. This is Steve. As far as any concern, we haven't seen any concern around it. In fact we think it adds to the overall ecosystem and choice for our customers, so what we announced earlier was the cloud On-Ramp which is similar to other cloud On-Ramps that we have deployed in the Virginia market and other key markets around our platform. So that's what we announced and so far it's been very good for the broader campus there as well as other enterprise customers that are looking for additional choice. We do see other international customers that are leveraging that platform likely more than US customers that now see core side even more beneficial than they had in the past, so overall it's been very positive for us.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you for the color on that. Then my other question has a lot to do more Miami, as I look at Page 8 of your supplemental, it looks like Miami's campus is the only one that does not have cloud On-Ramps deployed and Equinix is down there and is taking full advantage of the facility and the market. I'm just trying to get your perspective on why that is not really a cloud On-Ramp market or a target?
Steve Smith: I think that really relates more to the size and capacity at that facility Sami, it's our smallest facility and we continue to do a solid job in terms of keeping it leased up and generating cash flow, but it's not been a growth focus for us.
Sami Badri: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.
Nick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for taking my question. First, as you noted over the last year or two you've kind of been a victim of your own success and it's left with a relatively tight inventory position relative to your history. Now what's the sweet spot for inventory where you have enough on hand to sell but don't have too much trended in capital in place and when you anticipate getting back to and consistently stay in that sweet spot given the project you have development?
Paul Szurek: So historically we've been in the 225,000 to 250,000 square foot of available inventory, it means it's not occupied and it's not under lease. That's been consistent with our sales performance over the years. We're at, I guess we started Q2 at 246,000 square feet of capacity and in most of that new capacity is in our top four markets, the only one where we didn't add any new capacity this past quarter was Santa Clara. With our pipeline that's in place we should be able to sustain that level of available capacity seven quarters out of eight for the foreseeable future beginning in 2019 once we bring SV8 online and we'll add to that with CH2 once it comes online and LA3, so I feel very good about how we're positioned for the future starting late in 2018 and going on into 2019 and we have good available inventory right now, so it feels like we're the right spot.
Steve Smith: The other thing I would just add to that as well as we've taken some pre focused efforts here internally to ensure that we can just move faster in the market. So as we look to capacity getting to a more critical level that we can move quicker on land, we can move quicker on permitting and we can move quicker on getting things out of the ground and getting them constructed. So I think that will also help us stay ahead of the curve, but at the same time not struck out capital when you don't need to.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe switching gears a bit, on a STN virtual cross connect versus physical cross next question. Can you talk about the common use cases you see where customers are opting for virtual cross connects versus physical cross connects?
Steve Smith: Sure and I think the most obvious use cases the traditional enterprise those that typically have one or two connections to a network into a cloud provider or many of them are using cloud today that they can now how those virtual circuits go across multiple clouds. And many of those are just evolving over time as there is more and more clouds available for those enterprises to use. So you think about your ERP, CRM, all the other application storage and so forth that are now becoming more as a service it just makes those more readily available and able to scale over a virtual type of connection. I mean, historically they in many cases haven't even had that service available for them at all, so I think it opens up the value colocation much more so than it has in the past because now that those services are available, but then the data center they can leverage those hybrid use cases.
Paul Szurek: Should point out though that the data indicate very strongly that it's an advantage for our customers who want that flexibility to access services that are outside our data center, within the data center open cloud exchange and the virtual activities that we provide clearly seem to dominate and so far we've seen SDN as a very strong positive - net positive on cross connects and we haven't seen any evidence of cannibalization of colocation or other services we provide.
Nick Del Deo: Okay, that's great. Thank you, guys.
Paul Szurek: Thanks Nick.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Louthan: Great, thank you. As you look at adding more capacity is there any particular markets that you would entertain and additionally in North America or overseas that you are looking and then with regards to the customers that was rationalizing the cross connect deployments, how long ago was the M&A, was this left over from 12 or 18 months ago or something relatively recent and you see any other customers that you think might be going through some similar process.
Paul Szurek: Let me take the first question and then I'll let Jeff handle the second. As we mentioned in the past we continue to look at other markets and see ways that we can scale in those markets with our network-dense model and that is obviously not something that's easy to do and so we haven't made many moves in that area in the past. We continue to see the highest returns on our capital by deepening and broadening our capacity in the markets that we're in with very attractive markets and seems to have lot of growth going forward. And so as we've said in the past, until we actually are ready to move into another market and have something signed we typically we don't talk about what potential targets might be.
Jeff Finnin: And Frank let me just add just a little bit and I'll answer the second question, but I think overall that comes down to our overall capital allocation strategy and I think we continue to be very disciplined related to that obviously focused on driving high returns on invested capital as Paul alluded to. So I think - I don't think we have not modified that at all and obviously you can see the results on those returns from our financial results. As it relates to the cross connect disconnects that we saw, I think it's fair to say that that M&A activity is not a recent event from that particular customer and that's consistent with what we typically see when some of those customers are - when there's M&A activity from some of our customers. It is not an immediate type of event where you might see some of those disconnects. Sometimes you see them one to three years later, sometimes you never see them, it really is dependent upon their utilization of those cross connects in the traffic that they're trying to move and connect to, so it's not a recent event for this particular one.
Frank Louthan: Are they adding any other cross connection capacity in other areas that maybe were they're taking some way and adding some on a different location?
Jeff Finnin: Absolutely, we see - and specifically for that customer this quarter we saw a lot of additions as well and so absolutely that's its stay. That's why when we think about it talk about the cross connect activity, it really is a fluid type of activity we see in our data centers, you see high volumes of additions and disconnects just depending upon what our customers are trying to do in any given period of time and so - hence the reason we have people staffed to execute on that in a very timely manner, but that particular customer is adding and we saw a large group of additions from that customer in Q1 as well.
Frank Louthan: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Peterson with Jeffrey. Please proceed you're your question.
Jon Petersen: Great, thanks. Just one on the US Colo acquisition you mentioned that that ended litigation, can you just give us a little more context on what that litigation was about? And then also maybe broader - I know at One Wilshire you're not the only colocation provider there, I guess are there other opportunities at that facility or maybe some other facilities that you have to roll out some of the guys that are competing with you in the same facility and drive little bit of growth that way?
Paul Szurek: Sure, Jon. Gad to answer those. We've had a discussion of this litigation in our financial statement foot notes for over a couple of years now. It really was a dispute about various contractual elements between US Colo with us and to go into it beyond that is probably not very helpful. We typically don't talk about M&A unless we have something to disclose and so unfortunately probably shouldn't address the latter part of your question.
Jon Petersen: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Choe: You mentioned in your earlier comments that you came in with a lot less capacity than normal, do you feel like you're at a place - and I think you mentioned it a little bit for where we could see signings kind of ramp up from here now that you have enough capacity or do we have to wait for a later in the year into second half of '18 and into '19 before we could see signings kind of ramp up because of a more balanced capacity situation.
Paul Szurek: So I don't want to put any additional pressure on Steve and his team. They do a great job. And they've really done a remarkable job in increasing our acquisition of these quality new logos over the last two, three quarters, but there is a very strong correlation historically between available capacity especially in our big four markets and sales. And so as we've increased capacity in two of those big four markets LA and Virginia bringing additional capacity online in a third, New York in Q3, historically - based on historical persons that you translate into higher sales. We do still have a bit of a constraint capacity situation in the Bay Area, some of that will be - that will be remedied next year when we bring SV8 online.
Richard Choe: And then in terms of what your customers are asking for or maybe what you're focusing on are you seeing customers ask for larger deployments and this is might be a shift that you have to kind of shift to in terms of the process and how you're willing to sell space and power or are you still kind of just focusing on Colo and high density and higher interconnection. Just kind of wanting to see what you're seeing in the marketplace of what customers are asking for.
Paul Szurek: Really not a huge change from historical trends, our focus continues to be on the core retail colocation customer that's our bread and butter and for all the reasons that Steve and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that's worked really well for us. There is from time to time larger deployments that need storage and compute at the edge market, these tent to be lumpier, but we still see opportunities for those in the pipeline and expect to bring some of those into the sales mix as we have additional capacity.
Richard Choe: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Yeah, just a follow up on the subsea cable situation where you're well positioned particularly Los Angeles at both One Wilshire and Alameda, but you mentioned the Silicon Valley campus and can you talk a little bit more? Is that an actual physical termination point or just an extension into your facility? Thanks.
Steve Smith: Yeah, as far as the subsea cable customer base, I'm not sure that we've disclosed the exact end points on that level of detail, so probably would hold off and give me more detail until we make sure we have that clearance from the actual customer. But overall we have 11 subsea cables to terminate within our platform and that has continued to add more value not only to those international customers but to domestic customers that are looking to get access to those international marketplaces. So I'm sorry, I can't be little bit more specific, but just need to do a lot of more diligence to make sure that we can disclose.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Bersey with MUFG Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Bersey: Hi, guys. I think you mentioned you saw 8% improvement in efficiency for power utilization, just wondering kind of drivers behind that and if that [indiscernible] on a certain location and can you potentially see improvements in other areas.
Paul Szurek: So it's across the portfolio and I want to make clear that that's on a same store basis, so that doesn't reflect the impact of new construction. It's a combination of factors, in some facilities we have gone back and upgraded and reprogrammed automated control systems, in other facilities we did a deep dive into all the components of power utilization and 20 tweaks lead to significant achievements and in power efficiency and in one facility in particular, as we disclosed in the past, we upgraded to a very large, more economically efficient chiller plant from the smaller chiller equipment that we had there in the past and that generated significant return on investment and drove power efficiency in that in that site. So we think there's still more opportunity as we continue to get better at operations and focus on technological improvements that can drive PUE, but it was a real big gain year-over-year and I'm very pleased with the engineering and facilities team for what they've accomplished here.
Stephen Bersey: Great thanks guys.
Paul Szurek: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. Mr. Szurek, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: Well, I just want to thank everybody for their interest and their questions and listening to us talk about the company and thank my very valuable colleagues at CoreSite for their excellent work they continue to do. We look forward to the future and we will look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-09 07:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and thank you for joining today’s CoreSite Realty Corporation Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Greer Aviv, Investor Relations and Corporate Communication for CoreSite. Thank you, Mr. Aviv. You may begin.
Greer Aviv: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results. I will highlight our 2017 accomplishments, update you on our new developments and briefly comment on our markets. We finished out the year with solid fourth quarter financial results, highlighted by year-over-year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO growth, of 14%, 13%, and 11% respectively, excluding the one-time preferred stock redemption charge. Organic growth was driven primarily by the continued expansion of existing customers and also by new logo growth. We continue to operate our facilities as carrier, cloud and manage services neutral facilities, which attract valuable deployments which drive commerce and interactions among our customers. We executed well on our strategic priorities in 2017 with full year organic revenue growth 20% and FFO growth of 22%. We took important steps to grow our differentiated scalable and flexible multi-tenant campus in key markets, including Santa Clara, Northern Virginia, Los Angeles, and most recently, Chicago. 2018 will be a relaunch year for CoreSite with the newest version of our enterprise class multi-tenant building coming online or commenced construction in several of our strongest and the most dynamic markets. These buildings together with computer room build outs in our other markets support the foundation for another extended phase of attractive organic growth over the next few years. Turning to sales performance; we signed $7.2 million in annualized GAAP rent in the fourth quarter. Retail signings were very strong reflecting the value of our ecosystem for applications, needed capacity and larger edge facilities that support latency sensitive, data intensive and hybrid cloud deployments. The amount in quality of new logos was also excellent with Steve comment on in more detail. We expect the rebound and retail leasing combined with a continuing strong funnel for larger deployments to support healthy pricing and the construction of additional leasable capacity. Supply and demand seems to be in an expectable balance in substantially all of our markets. We are keeping an eye on the amount of the development and potential development in Northern Virginia, particularly in Ashburn, but demand is also very strong in this market. As I mentioned earlier, campus expansion in four excellent markets is a great opportunity for us in 2018 and beyond. Despite record levels of absorption in 2016, 440,000 square feet followed by another strong year of commencements in 2017, we forecast demand for new product to continue at attractive levels for the foreseeable future. During 2017, we worked effectively to replenish our campus pipeline with new land in Santa Clara, Virginia and Chicago and the creation of an expansion opportunity on our LA2 side. We expect these projects to restore us to our historical model of having the ability to quickly bring new capacity to market in line with demand. As important, the leasing of this new capacity should deepen our campus ecosystems and increase their network effects and corresponding value. We are pleased to have acquired in downtown Chicago a two acre land parcel in late January. CH2 is one mile from our existing CH1 facility and network node and we plan to connect the two sites via diverse, high-count dark fiber to create the type of campus interconnectivity most valued by our scale customers. We expect to be able to build approximately 175,000 square feet, or 18 megawatts of turnkey capacity on this land. Along with restoring our development opportunities to more typical levels across the portfolio, we have taken steps to strengthen our development and construction team over the past year. We added some valuable new colleagues with extensive data center construction experience, made some productive internal transfers and have approved our design and contracting processes. We entered 2018 with 220,000 square feet of turnkey capacity under construction and we expect to break ground on SV8 and LA3 an additional 355,000 square feet of multi-tenant shell with a combined 12 megawatt of initial computer rooms at various stages in the year. And if the permitting process goes well, we may even be able to begin CH2 late in 2018. Our team is focused on ensuring our offering is providing desirable new technology and energy efficiency options for our customers as well as accommodating higher density deployments. As an example, in Q4, we took steps to improve energy efficiency by consolidating our cooling systems at LA2 into one massively efficient chiller plant for which we have been nominated for an energy efficiency award by the local power company. We also entered into a long-term power purchase agreement leveraging fuel cell technology in two of our markets, which significantly reduces related carbon emissions for that amount of power. Our expansion in Reston is progressing and we anticipate delivering 25,000 square feet of turnkey capacity at VA3 Phase IA around the end of the first quarter. We are making good progress on the overall site development for that campus designed to preserve our ability to increase buildable capacity in the future and on the ground-up construction at VA3 Phase 1B and expect to deliver that building in the fourth quarter of 2018. In Los Angeles, we are on track to deliver 87,000 square feet of multi-tenant data center capacity this quarter with the pre-leased space commencing in Q1 as well. Entitlement, permitting and design work for LA3 is ongoing and we expect to commence construction in the later half of 2018. As it relates to the Bay Area, we are targeting a mid-2018 construction start on SV8. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we are making with our development program. In addition to adding another good campus expansion site in downtown Chicago, we've added expertise and experience to our staff and it laid the groundwork for developing high redundancy at lower cost, providing the flexibility to accommodate high density deployments, significantly increasing power efficiency and lowering ongoing maintenance and operating costs. I look forward to seeing this work bear fruit as we bring these developments online over the next couple of years. With that I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul. Our new and expansion sales activity was solid reflecting a resurgence that we’ve seen among the smaller deployments, which can be seen an increased transaction count, helping new logo growth and the pricing we achieved on signed leases. We signed a 128 new and expansion leases, totaling $7.2 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 42,000 net rentable square feet and average GAAP rate of $174 per square foot. Leasing results also reflected solid new logo activity across our platform with 30 new logos signed across substantially all of our markets and 117 signed during 2017. Enterprise customers continue to account for the majority of new logos as they look to optimize their IT architecture and leverage the key network and cloud providers across our platform. By deploying in our network DIPs and cloud connected facilities, they can reap the benefits of a strongly connected and synergistic ecosystem as well as extended geographic reach and that of their end customers globally. To that point Alibaba cloud joined our ecosystem, enabling international customers to expand their cloud based applications world-wide in an efficient and cost effective manner. Additional examples of new logos that were attracted to our ecosystem include one of the largest global post-production companies and a large television production organization expanding its content distribution capabilities. A key part of our organic growth strategies is a continued expansion of existing customers, which accounted for approximately 88% of annualized GAAP rent signed in Q4. We have seen that our differentiated campus strategy and strong market position leave us well aligned to meet our customers’ increasing demand for compute and storage needs and close proximity to their other deployments as well as to enable them to scale and grow into additional CoreSite markets. A great example is a key enterprise customer that has continued to expand its footprint on our Santa Clara campus and just deployed at our Reston campus with a new application supporting research and development for self-driving technologies and mapping. The strength and leasing to smaller deployments combing with the organic expansion opportunities of our embedded base resulted in interconnection revenue growth of 16% year-over-year driven by total volume growth of 11% and fiber volume growth of 15%. For the full year, the interconnection revenue grew 17%, slightly ahead of the high-end of our expected range. Turning now to vertical mix, network and cloud customers accounted for 41% and 19% respectively of annualized GAAP rent signed. It was a great quarter for the network vertical with the highest level of new and expansion leases signed this year, driven by strong growth of existing customers and by six new logos. A large Chinese telecom expanding with us in the Bay Area and a leading global telecommunications provider deployed its – their latest SDN solution in four markets, providing additional connectivity options for enterprise customers. We also saw a solid expansion activity among network providers at our Denver campus further solidifying our leading interconnection position in this market. Turning to the cloud vertical, it was an exciting quarter with strong growth from existing customers and the addition of three new logos including a private cloud service provider. A large network solution and the cloud hosting provider expanded its footprint across the number of markets while one of our existing large public cloud partners expanded its reach and deploy natively in Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia. This expansion brings the total number of native on-ramps for this provider to four across our portfolio. Additionally, another leading public cloud company deployed a new on-ramp in Los Angeles. The cloud vertical continues to experience outpaced growth in terms of other customers interconnecting reinforcing the value of our highly interconnected platform. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, this vertical accounted for 40% of annualized GAAP rents signed. New logos also accounted for approximately 40% of the leases signed as enterprise customers continue to focus on robust connectivity solutions, diversity of providers and the performance and scalability needed to optimize their deployments. Additionally, a large global technology company expanded its gaming platform deploying in two new markets and a provider of digital services and content distribution expanded its footprint to support its rendering capabilities with both applications requiring a highly dense colocation solution. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases for Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Northern Virginia and New York, New Jersey; collectively representing 87% of annualized GAAP rent signed. Strength in Bay Area leasing was again led by growth from existing customers with the cloud vertical demonstrating a strongest performance followed by enterprise customers and network providers. Demand in Los Angeles remains steady with strength in the network vertical followed by enterprise and cloud deployment. Notably, network and cloud traction continues to gain momentum at LA2 as we signed a same number of network deals at LA2 this quarter as we did at LA1. Turning to Northern Virginia, leasing activity was lead by the enterprise vertical. Hybrid use cases leveraging multiple clouds are becoming more common among customer requirements and we remain well positioned in the market with strong relationships with leading public and private cloud providers, which should continue to drive incremental interconnection opportunities at the Reston campus. Finally, in New York, New Jersey demand is steady and slowly increasing specifically among financial and healthcare sectors, which is reflected in our solid enterprise leasing results. We continue to see cloud and network providers expanded in LA2 while large local enterprises continue to move towards leveraging hybrid cloud use cases. In summary, the fourth quarter results marked the end of another solid year for CoreSite with consistent execution, growth across our markets and ecosystems and continued investment as we set the stage for future growth. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q4 financial results followed by an update of our development CapEx and our leverage and liquidity capacity. Finally, I will discuss our outlook and guidance for 2018. Q4 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $125.9 million, a 2.3% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 14% increase year-over-year. Operating revenue consisted of $104.9 million in data center revenue comprised of rent and power, an increase of 3.1% on a sequential quarter basis and 14.2% year-over-year. Interconnection services contributed $16.3 million to operating revenues, an increase of 0.3% on a sequential quarter basis and 16.2% year-over-year. FFO was $1.09 per diluted share in unit, down 0.9% on a sequential quarter basis and an increase of 2.8% year-over-year. FFO includes approximately $4.3 million of non-cash expense related to the original issuance cost of our redeemed preferred stock, which was previously not reflected in our guidance. Excluding this one-time amount, FFO as adjusted was $1.18 per share, or an increase of 7.3% and 11.3% sequentially and year-over-year respectively. For the full year excluding this expense, FFO was $4.52 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 21.8%. As it relates to the recurring capital, we spent $8.6 million in Q4 to substantially complete the chiller plant replacement at LA2, which resulted in a sequential decline in AFFO of 10% consistent with our expectations. Adjusting for this investment, AFFO would have been $52 million, or an increase of 8% and 29% sequentially and year-over-year respectively. For the full year, we invested $11.9 million on the chiller project. 2017 AFFO adjusted for this investment grew 25% year-over-year. Turning back to Q4 results, adjusted EBITDA of $68.8 million increased 5.4% sequentially and 13.4% over the same quarter of last year. We continue to drive margin expansion with our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing 160 basis points to 54.6% for the full year, slightly ahead of our expectations. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $4.6 million, or 3.7% of total operating revenues. For the full year, sales and marketing expenses were 3.8% down 60% basis points from the prior year. General and administrative expenses were $10.2 million, or 8.1% of total operating revenues. For the full year, G&A expense was 7.8% of total operating revenues, down 100 basis points year-over-year though slightly above our guidance. Q4 same-store turnkey data center occupancy increased 100 basis points to 91.8% compared to Q4 2016. Additionally, same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 5.3% year-over-year and was flat sequentially at $1,508. As you look at your models, keep in mind that we will redefine the same-store pool in Q1 as we do on an annual basis. We renewed approximately 79,000 total square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $142 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark to market growth of 3.5% on a cash basis and 6.2% on a GAAP basis. Churn in the fourth quarter was low coming in at 0.5%. We commenced 52,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $157 per square foot, which represents $8.2 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 94.4%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the prior quarter. In Boston, a 14,000 square foot computer room was moved into the stabilized pool at 90% occupancy and 25,000 square feet at VA2 moved into the stabilized pool at 87% occupancy. We completed in additional 13,700 square feet of data center capacity at Boston and 3,000 at VA1, both of which were placed into the prestabilized pool. Turning to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $13.2 million as of December 31, 2017. On a cash basis, our backlog was $21.7 million. We expect substantially all of the GAAP backlogs to commence during the first half of 2018. As Paul mentioned, we have a total of 220,000 square feet of data center capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had invested $98.5 million of the estimated $213.6 million required to complete these projects. Keep in mind that the capacity currently under construction and the associated investment does not include forecasted investment for projects currently in permitting entitlement or design including SV8, LA3 and CH2. The percentage of interest capitalized in Q4 was 13.7% and the full year amount is 12%. For 2018, we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 12% to 18% slightly elevated compared to the 2017 level based on our development pipeline. Turning to our balance sheet. Our ratio of net principal debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.4 times. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $180.9 million of total equality consisting of available cash in capacity on our revolving credit facility. On December 12, 2017, we completed the redemption of all 4.6 million shares of our 7.25% Series A cumulative redeemed preferred stock, which was financed through the use of our credit facility. We expect to add incremental debt financing, the majority of which is expected to be completed during the first half of 2018 to fund our development pipeline. The related timing, pricing and type of debt instrument are dependant on market conditions and we expect a total issuance amount of $225 million to $300 million while maintaining a healthy balance between our fixed and variable price debt. During the fourth quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend to $0.98 per share on a quarterly basis, or $3.92 per share on an annual basis. This correlates to an 8.9% increase over the prior quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share that was established in May 2017 and a quarterly per share increase of $0.18 or 22.5% over the dividend rate set in December 2016. You should continue to expect the timing and amount of our future dividend increases to be closely aligned to financial performance and cash flow generation. Now, I would like to address guidance for 2018. Please remember that our guidance reflects our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on Page 23 of our Q4 earnings supplemental, our guidance for 2018 is as follows. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $535 million to $545 million. Based on the mid-point of guidance, this implies 12.1% year-over-year revenue growth, the estimated growth reflects the timing of our development pipeline as well as a reduced level of available sellable capacity as we enter 2018. For context, we enter 2018 with approximately 19% of our operating portfolio available that is either currently available or under construction compared to a historical average of 29% following a period of elevated absorption. We currently expect commencements of approximately $40 million in annualized GAAP rent in 2018 compared to $33 million in 2017, or an increase of 22%. We expect that 2018 interconnection revenue growth to be between 11% and 14% correlating to interconnection revenue in the range of $69 million to $71 million. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $38 million to $40 million, or approximately 7% of total operating revenue. This correlates to a 4% increase in G&A expenses over 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $291 million to $296 million. This correlates to 11.5% year-over-year growth based on the mid-point of the range and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 54.4% and revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 52%. Our expectation for adjusted EBITDA margin is consistent with the 2017 level and reflects recent investments in our facilities and construction teams given the strong growth in absorption over the last two years. FFO per share in OP unit is estimated to be $4.92 to $5.04. This implies 10% year-over-year FFO growth based on the mid-point of the range and the $4.52 per share we reported in 2017 excluding the impact of the one-time non-cash expense related to the preferred redemption. As a reminder, the FFO per share guidance includes the debt financing that was mentioned earlier. As we discussed last quarter, our guidance of FFO per share reflects the adoption of two new accounting standards: revenue recognition and lease accounting, which are cumulatively expected to reduce FFO per share by approximately $0.06 inclusive of the impact from accelerated straight line rent expense. Absent these changes, our 2018 guidance mid-point would reflect 11.5% year-over-year growth. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows, estimated annual churn rate of 6% to 8% for 2018. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 3% to 5% for the full year. As we communicated last quarter, total capital expenditures are expected to be $250 million to $300 million. The components are comprised of data center expansion cost estimated to be $228 million to $263 million, non-recurring investments are estimated to be $7.5 million to $12.5 million and include amounts related to investments in our IT architecture, facilities upgrades and our capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures are estimated to be $12.5 million to $17.5 million down significantly from 2017 reflecting the completion of the chiller replacement and upgrade project at LA2 and tenant improvements are estimated to be $2 million to $7 million. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Dave Rodgers: Hey, guys. I wanted to start with some of the leasing details from the quarter. It looked like both leasing spreads as well as kind of the overall absolute level of pricing in the quarter both commencements and leasing trended lower. How much of that was the function of pressure in the market versus geographic mix versus density? Can you kind of break those thoughts out for us?
Steve Smith: Yeah, sure. This is Steve. Thanks for the question. I would say overall it's just primarily a function of timing as to overall volume. So as far as the overall leasing activity is concerned, as I mentioned in my predetermined comments there, the overall volume is very strong and we were very encouraged with the total number of leases as well as the content of those leases, the network vertical obviously was very strong, a little bit lighter on the wholesale end of the things and that’s primarily driven from timing and just availability of overall capacity, but the underlying current demand in the market is very strong.
Jeff Finnin: Hey, Dave. This is Jeff. And let me just give you some additional commentary as it relates to – I think he also commented on commencements and renewals. If you look at it on a per square foot perspective, from a pricing perspective, that that is going to vary depending upon our density and the type of deployments that are being renewed and ultimately commencing. So, for example, when you look at the renewals, the composition of those renewals this quarter were – had a very low density. And as a result, you're seeing a price perspective being lower. When you take away and neutralize the density impact, you actually get to the point where that pricing for renewals, this quarter was flat to slightly ahead of where we were on the trailing twelve months. So hopefully that gives you some additional commentary around that.
Paul Szurek: And Dave let me just follow up addressing both sales and maybe interconnection volumes as well. Historically, these have always varied quarter by quarter and we don't expect that to change. This is probably, as Steve mentioned, due to the timing of bringing on new capacity, but it's also attributable to the increase in scale leasing we began to experience in 2015 as edge needs in our markets rose to new levels. These deployments are lumpier and the sales cycles are longer. So while the pipeline for this type of demand is very robust, as Steve mentioned, the timing of concluding any particular sale is difficult to predict. And we do our pricing in this way by trying to jam these types of sales into any particular quarter. We see the same type of lumpiness in interconnection growth, which frequently follows to some extent scale deployments and enterprise additions, but not on a linear path. These are the reasons combined with the lumpiness of delivering new capacity that we've incurred to observers to focus more on annual trends as opposed to quarterly results.
Steve Smith: And Dave just to kind of round that out with a bit more color there, if you look at the overall lease count, 127 of the 128 leases that were signed in the quarter were less than 5,000 square feet. And if you look at the revenue from leases that are less than 5,000 square feet, we're actually up 5% over the trailing 12-month average, so overall health in the pipeline as well as the results, we feel very positive.
Dave Rodgers: Great, appreciate all the color from everybody, Paul maybe turning to you in terms of the volume. It sounded like based on your comments, you’re pretty happy with the pipeline and the projects that you have in it, but it did sound like that you are maybe frustrated with the fact that you didn't have product to deliver to meet the outside demand that you continue to see in the industry. Are there one or two big things that you've kind of been addressing over the last whether six months a year or you plan to address that really kind of cause this maybe mistiming between development delivery and demand in the market?
Paul Szurek: Well, I wouldn't say frustrated. It's almost all related to VA3 and as we've – in fact as far as I can tell it's all related to VA3. As we stated previously, we have a reasonable but ambitious plan to maximize the amount that we can build on that site that requires converting the low density office and light industrial development into a denser development with more interconnected buildings. Accomplishing this goal, requires a significant amount of moving underground utility infrastructure and creating new infrastructure. These are the tasks that have taken longer than expected partly due to unforeseen conditions like utilities that were not located on the survey more underground rock than the geotech studies indicated although to some extent rock is very seamy and that's not completely unexpected and frankly to some extent contractor performance. The good news is that these elements are almost entirely behind us. We have one more power line to move, so we can finish our new main entrance. And the better news is that the new colleagues we've added working with the team that has continued have really performed well to limit the delays caused by these elements. So I'd honestly say rather than frustrated, I'm just really excited about where we are right now and where we can take this forward.
Dave Rodgers: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Rollins: Hi. Good morning for you guys. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. First, you made a comment about the timing of dividends referring to it as following, I think, you mentioned the cash flow. Is that a change in the timing that we had last year where you had two division increases? So is this something that's just going to be on an ad hoc basis each quarter? Or should we expect the same kind of cadence for the company to revisit the dividend? You know I have an operational question if I could afterwards.
Paul Szurek: Yeah, good morning, Mike. Yeah, I think, I wouldn't read too much into that in terms of a change. I think what we're trying to communicate is we do look at our level of growth in cash flow on a quarterly basis and obviously look at the dividend on a quarterly basis. But what we're trying to communicate is which is probably similar to what you saw last year which is to the extent you do see us or that we do see cash flow growing incrementally that we want to make sure we're more timely in paying that out to our shareholders. Last year, we did it on an every six month basis. And from our perspective I think that fits well into the way we anticipate to do things going forward, but it is something we look at on a quarterly basis.
Michael Rollins: And the second things on the operational side, you mentioned the difference now versus in prior period in terms of the percentage of footprint of total that was available to sell whether it was in development or kind of ready to serve up. When you look at the development pipeline that you have for this year, does it get you back towards that historical percentage I think you mentioned it was 29%? Or is there more development that you would need to bring forward to get to that kind of available capacity level?
Paul Szurek: Good question, Michel. I think with what we have in process we will actually be better and more consistent than historical norms, but we are going through a little bit of a valley. In fiscal year – in 2015, we added 15.3% to our leasable capacity through construction and development. That ballooned to 32.2% in 2016. In 2017, it was only 3.7% based on what we have in process today in LA and VA3 and other places. We'll add 10.5% this year and that's included in our 19% number. But that will be able to accelerate in future years up into the high teens to low 20% range as we build out the four projects that we've talked about. And quite honestly if demand continues as strong as it has been and we see as many or more demand drivers going forward as we've seen historically, we have the capacity to accelerate some of that development if we need to do.
Michael Rollins: Thanks very much.
Paul Szurek: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.
Jordan Sadler: Hi, good morning. So I wanted to just come back to one of your answers in the Q&A here. I think you described leasing now a little bit more as lumpier and longer. And I guess it's a little bit new to me as it relates to CoreSite. I kind of think of you guys just being a little bit steadier and I recognize that you bring a bunch of product on. But can you maybe just give us a little bit of context for what you meant by that? Is that germane to Reston and that project? Or would you expect potentially to see larger, lumpier or longer sales cycle leases in some of these other more traditional markets as well like Chicago or Silicon Valley or LA?
Paul Szurek: Jordan, it's a good question. And I think if you went back to these sessions over the last four or five quarters, you probably heard us mention on at least every quarterly call the lumpiness that has been introduced by these scale leases. And in fact I think if memory serves me correctly, Jeff our sales this quarter in terms of GAAP rent are pretty comparable to our sales in the fourth quarter of last year. And then we’ve obviously had some accelerated quarters in between. So I'm sorry if we weren’t more clear about that in the past, but that that is something that we've tried to make sure everybody was aware of. But you are correct the introduction of new capacity and the timing of bringing new capacity on adds an additional element of lumpiness, which we are expecting and hoping to reduce going forward with a more robust and proactive development platform as you see in the announcements that we've made over the last couple of quarters. Jeff?
Jeff Finnin: And Jordan, the only other thing I'd complement with that is in order to give you some visibility into that lumpiness. As you’ve probably seen and heard us in the past, we break up our sales in those two buckets: one that's less than 5,000, one is greater than 5,000, inside that supplemental if you haven’t had a chance to look. It does give you some better insight. But as Steve was alluding to that less than 5,000 has been fairly steady and is actually up slightly as compared to the trailing 12 months. The lumpiness as Paul alluded to really does come from those larger than 5,000 square foot leases. And that's where you're seeing some of the – of what we’re alluding to.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. But so you would expect to see – it would be safe to assume that you’d expect to see scale type leasing in markets outside of Northern Virginia for example over the next year.
Steve Smith: Yeah, Jordan, this is Steve. I tell you that the pipeline overall looks very robust and the activity there looks very strong. It's a matter of timing when the customer requirements line up with available capacity and we work very hard to stay on top of that so far the overall pipeline looks healthy.
Jordan Sadler: And Steve, while I have you, just sequentially this is about as flat as I've seen the interconnection revenue. I know that this business just as a function of the growing base and some of the other factors as you guys talked about regularly. The growth is moderating a bit, but was there anything going on in the fourth quarter at all that we should be looking at?
Steve Smith: No, I think if you look at the underlying current there, the trend is still very healthy. We could have one customer that churned out of LA1 in Q4 that had pretty significant amount of interconnection and we have another customer that consolidated some of their deployments. So that drove part of the pressure there, but overall the trend for interconnection is still very healthy. There are some technology trends that are also out there relative to – customers able to get 100 gig out of a single interconnection versus 10 gig, but you still need a connection to a provider to get there. So you may see some efficiency come out of that as well as some of the capabilities from some of the big network providers as far as SDN capabilities, but overall we still see a very strong trajectory as far as health in interconnection.
Jordan Sadler: Is that crapping – sorry, go ahead.
Paul Szurek: I just would add to what Steve said. The ability to increase the amount you can move over those interconnections is one of the attractions to being able to interconnect within the data center. And you know while it may reduce the total cross-connects, it also increases the value of the space and the deployments in those data centers.
Jordan Sadler: All right I think we’ve talked about the same as it relates to SDNs. Are the SDNs crapping up a little bit more in terms of discussions with customers that using – are they using them to a greater extent a little bit more comfortable these days?
Paul Szurek: Well, I think they're beginning to embrace it more as you talk to some of the carriers that are also partners of ours and our data centers that they seem to see a greater level of adoption. And I think that's actually helping us more as customers look to be closer to those interconnection points and leverage their hybrid architecture. So I think the starting number is that more.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, thank you.
Paul Szurek: Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. A couple of questions. Wondered about CH2, what was the thought process? Did it come from customers or just kind of your own preferences in terms of going downtown versus perhaps suburbs where you could have had maybe more of a campus environment? And then secondly, you mentioned chiller plant and it just kind of made me think about just the technical design above what you're delivering on your maybe current and prospective builds, power densities, are they going higher 2N versus N plus one if you could just sort of comment on the product that you're aiming for and where you see the sweet spot of the market? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: I'll try to remember all those elements, Jonathan, but feel free to remind me if I leave something out. First of all both from a customer and product perspective, we were very heavily focused on downtown Chicago. And if you look at you know the president for our campus development, LA1 and LA2 are a great example of the tremendous synergies you can achieve by providing this enterprise class scalable you know more flexible for higher density product, more power efficient, new building or new – new space that that has this type of dark fiber connectivity back to your main network node. It really expands the use cases and the edge cases that can take place in the urban core where there is a much more enterprise rich target environment. And it's essentially our model. We use it at VA2 and 1 and 3. We use it at – in Santa Clara. And so, we were very, very focused on finding this type of opportunity in downtown Chicago and we're glad to do that. I would also add that as we've had ongoing conversations with customers about their needs and what they need and where they need it, this is exactly the type of product in Chicago that has received a lot of encouragement from that – on which we've received a lot of encouragement from our customers. Regarding the product overall and I've touched on this a little bit earlier in the answer. Brian Warren, our Senior Vice President of Construction and Engineering and his team, which I have a very high regard for, have really evolved our product over the last couple of years. It gets better with each iterations but figuring out how to achieve the appropriate levels of redundancy with more design efficiency and lower cost, how to improve our contracting processes to deliver better results and lower cost and how to design and setup the data center to where we have more flexibility within the same building to accommodate both high density and low density deployments and to get the best possible PUE outcome from the equipment we're deploying and to set it up and commissioned it and turn it over in such a way that we have significantly better operations results although we've always had outstanding operations result, but at a lower cost on an ongoing basis. So I'm really pleased with what he and his team have done in that regard and I think we're still in the fairly early innings of ongoing product evolution.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. And then just on kind of it just maybe relates to cross-connects and the Alibaba announcements that you had on both coasts and then I think bringing AWS Direct Connect into Denver. Can you talk about pull through of these cloud nodes? And does it drive – does it drive cabinet ads? Does it drive cross-connects? Or is it really depends on the particular situation? What trends have you seen over time?
Steve Smith: Yeah, Jonathan, this is Steve. I would say it’s all of the above. They do provide unique value not only in their own drive as far as interconnection and passing traffic to other providers, but also for those enterprises that are looking to gain close and immediate on-ramps to those facilities. So we feel like those are another key differentiator that are attractive to our sites because of our network density as well as our go to market model around the enterprise because enterprises are obviously attractive to those same sites because we have the network in those on-ramps. So it’s really a synergistic type of environment that I think helps all three of those.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you.
Paul Szurek: Thanks, Jon.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman from Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Gutman: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering against a backdrop of – well let's say in 2017, you’ve finalized the year with $33 million dollars of commencements and came into the year with $5 million of backlog, so that was $28 million additional. And that was also in the context of 33,000 square feet I think of additional space added. And for 2018, you're going to $40 million in commencement of which there is $13 million in backlog which really implies the same amount of additional commencements through the year roughly $27 million, $28 million, but you’ve got 220,000 square feet of space to be delivered. So how do we reconcile those two ideas and sort of what it means for the pace of leasing? Is there just an element of conservatism there or what is there to read into that?
Paul Szurek: Hey, Rob, let me provide some commentary and then if Steve has some additional things to add he can do. So I think you're looking at it absolutely correct in that. When you look at the amount of commencements that need to be generated and ultimately signed from new sales activity in 2018 as compared to 2017, they're at equal and in par with each other going into 2018. The one thing that's different is when you look at the amount of commencements that we're projecting that ultimately need to be embedded into and filled with capacity that's under construction. As we head into 2018 that's about 50% of the estimated commencements have to come from new construction and that's higher than where it’s typically been. And so that's where they're just provides some element of risk around and it's all tied to completion of the construction cycle, but that's what we're forecasting at this point in time.
Steve Smith: Should add to that though that much of that new construction is the LA construction, which is – some of it's already complete and occupy, some of it is – will be completed this quarter. And the balance of it primarily is in multiple sides including VA3 and VA3 is the only new construction in that context. But in VA3, we only have about 25,000 square feet that we will have available early enough in the year to have commencements during the year. Most of the rest of – the rest of the new capacity coming online in VA3 is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter and that makes it more challenging to forecast any commencements for that capacity that would start in 2018 as opposed to 2019.
Robert Gutman: Got it, thanks. And one additional question if I may. In the past several quarters, you reported some high price per square foot due to higher power density. And I was wondering if given some of the high power density quarters that you've reported does that imply going forward that metered power or the power pass through part of revenue could be a higher percentage than it's been in the past?
Paul Szurek: Yeah, Rob, let me just give you some color as you're probably aware. If you look – if you go back maybe two or three years, our mix between our power products as we refer to them as call it breakered to metered going back two or three years it's been about 60:40 breakered to metered. When if you look at 2017, we ended the year and it moved that down to 55:45 right in line with what our expectations were and so we would expect that to be honest I think to be fairly consistent as we move forward here over 2018. I don't think that we'll see a significant movement on a go forward, but that gives you some relative idea where it is at the end of 2017 compared to where it was a couple years ago.
Robert Gutman: Great, that helps. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Thank you for the question. My question is a follow up on the Alibaba cloud announcement. And I just want to get an idea will Alibaba cloud or have their discussions if you already followed a little bit what some of the other cloud on-ramp providers have done? Are they potentially going to start expanding in some of your other facilities and kind of build their ecosystem? Have you already had those discussions? And then I have a follow up.
Steve Smith: Yeah, thanks for the question. This is Steve. We would obviously love to see them expand consistently across our platform and we're always in active conversations with them. I wouldn’t forecasting any of those kind of experiences at this point, but we are actively pursuing those.
Sami Badri: Got it. Have other Chinese operators – Chinese cloud providers approached you as well for similar services or like are they just generally in the market in the U.S. right now?
Steve Smith: Yeah, we do see a pretty strong activity from many of the Chinese providers, who are looking to expand in the U.S. So that is an active pipeline for us.
Sami Badri: Right. And then my last question is just regarding the California market. Have you seen any recent market pressures in the market from specifically Nevada? Just trying to get an idea if customers are looking for lower power rates for new deployments, have you seen any opportunities missed because of pricing?
Steve Smith: The Nevada, I guess, the aspect of overall supply and demand is not new. It’s been out there for quite some time. And actually what we've seen more of as of late is some of those deployments that went to Nevada and other places that we’re less latency driven and those are now coming back closer to markets that we serve for example in the Bay Area because they found that in order for their applications to be competitive if they need to be closer to customers. So it’s really the factor. But we will actually see some benefits from it right now.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Louthan: Great, thank you. Just looking at development yields, is there anything we should think about changing as you're building out looking at some of the new pricing that you've seen underwrite, should we expect development yields going forward to remain stable? Or is there anything to read through there from the change of the pricing? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Yeah, good morning, Frank. Yeah, I think as you know and as we've communicated historically as we underwrite our developments, we're always looking to achieve north of a 12% overall stabilized yield on cost. Obviously, when you do the math, you can see that we've exceeded that in terms of what is in our embedded base, but that's still our underwriting. As we sit here today, I don't think I would read anything into that near-term as it relates to the pricing aspects of what's occurring this quarter.
Frank Louthan: Okay, great. That’s helpful. All right, thank you very much.
Paul Szurek: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with J.P Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Choe: Great, one on CapEx and then another one on churn. In terms of CapEx, this looks like it's kind of a peak year and you're doing enough where it could come back a little bit going forward? Or is this a new level that we should be thinking about?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, you’re talking total CapEx being deployed, Richard.
Richard Choe: Correct.
Jeff Finnin: As you saw we're guiding to $250 million to $300 million, I think as you think about CoreSite, any time we're coming out of the ground with more Greenfield developments. You're going to see that CapEx be elevated in that particular year. And so as you think about LA3, SV8, I mean those are going to cost some elevated CapEx deployment probably in 2018 and then in 2019 when those gets finished up. In addition to that I think as Paul alluded to we're deploying a little bit more right now just as we're trying to ramp up some of the capacity needed in our markets. And so, I want to say it's a new level, but any time to see Greenfield development, it is going to elevate that CapEx.
Richard Choe: And then can we get a little bit more color on annual churn that came in below the low end of the range last year? How is this kind of – how do you drive it? Is it by facility? Is it by customer? How should we think about how our lease is expiring kind of how should we think about how it’s built up to this 6% to 8% range?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, you bet. On an annual basis, generally in the fall, we go through and do a deep dive on our entire portfolio working with Steve and his team to better – have a better idea of where we expect churn to come in as we go out over the next couple of years. And I think just a couple comments as it relates to 2017. First you know came in at 5.5 for the full year, a little bit underneath our guidance, some of that relates to one or two deals that actually we had anticipated to churn in the fourth quarter. They didn't, and we think they'll come out in the first quarter of 2018. Those numbers are built into our guidance for 2018. And so, it is a matter of doing a deep dive and getting a sense for where we anticipate that churn to be. And hopefully, we can outperform again this year, but that 6% to 8% averaging, call it, 1% to 2% per quarter is what we've seen historically and I think it's fairly consistent in terms of way we look at the business going forward.
Richard Choe: Great, thank you.
Paul Szurek: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Lukas Hartwich: Thanks, good morning guys. So occupancy was up a fair amount of SV1 and SV2, but the annualized rent didn't budge that much, so I was just curious is that a timing issue or what’s going on there?
Paul Szurek: Yeah, Lukas, a couple of things. We had some renewals that took place in each of those locations and so you will obviously – depending upon how those come out are going to impact that rent to some extent. But overall in addition on an annual basis, we do what we referred to as an update of our conversion factors from cage usable square feet to NRSF and on occasion that will drive occupancy up or down without moving the dollars. And we had a little bit of that noise at SV1 and SV2 this quarter.
Lukas Hartwich: Well, great. And then lastly, so EBITDA margin has grown a fair amount in recent years. I am just curious do you guys have an internal expectation of where that will stabilize at?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah, great question. We ended the year 2017 at 54.6% EBITDA margins. And as you see in our guidance, it gives you an implied margin of – right in line with that, two things to think about. Paul alluded to it as did I in terms of our commentary where we did make some investments in our team during 2017. And so, you're seeing some of that effect – the full year effect coming into 2018 and having an impact on those margins. Secondly is the accounting change due to the new accounting is compressing those margins by about 50 basis points as well. Having said all of that 2018 should be consistent or in line with 2017. Longer-term I could tell you that those are ultimately decisions that we got to see how we can figure out what is that right level on a go forward basis. And I think you've probably heard us before saying that we'd like to target something higher than – kind of call it at the high 50%, but we're working towards it. I don't know how quickly we’ll get there, but it's something we're continuing to work as we think about investments in our team here in – at the CoreSite.
Lukas Hartwich: That's great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to Paul for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: I'd like to close by thanking the broader CoreSite team. Greer, Jeff, Steve and I are fortunate to work with outstanding colleagues, who enable us to consistently increase value for customers and shareholders while also making this a very good environment in which to work. I look forward to our ongoing achievements and I thank all of you who took the time to listen to us today. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-10-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Greer Aviv, Investor Relations and Corporate Communication. Thank you. You may begin.
Greer Aviv: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call.

And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning, and thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm glad to share our third quarter results and to update you on our near-term plans and the current state of our market. CoreSite delivered strong third quarter results. Revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO grew 22%, 25% and 22% year-over-year, respectively, driven by continued customer expansion across the portfolio and a focus on good execution throughout the organization. Last month marked the seventh anniversary of our IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, and I couldn't be more pleased with the CoreSite team and its accomplishment since then. We have remained committed to a focused strategy and have distinguished our hybrid model, expanding our network and cloud-anchored campus model to a substantial majority of our market. We are generally best positioned to provide our customers with access to low latency interconnection-rich network node complemented by flexible and scalable purpose-built data centers that can accommodate both higher density workloads and the customer ecosystem emerging in major metro market. Since IPO, we have more than tripled revenues almost entirely through organic growth while prudently deploying capital at a pace and at return that have allowed us remain one of the lowest levered REIT. We continue to believe our business model will support future growth and create a compelling value proposition for our current and future customers. Moving on to third quarter sales performance. We signed new and expansion leases of $10.1 million in annualized GAAP rent. Q3 leasing volume included an incremental expansion of a strategic customer at LA2. This customer is utilizing its collocation space with us to support multiple applications that require low latency and interconnection density combined with a reasonable total cost of ownership. This deployment illustrates how the value of our campus model continues to drive strong expansion demand from existing customers both in their current CoreSite facilities and in our other market. These organic customer expansions accounted for approximately 94% of annualized GAAP rent signed in Q3 and 85% of GAAP rent signed since December 31, 2014. In addition to this organic growth, in the third quarter, we added 24 new logos to our customer base. We have been redirecting our new logo efforts consistent with the market turn towards hybrid cloud and multi-cloud architecture focusing on the enterprises and enablers most attracted to that model and most likely to contribute to the customer ecosystem. We are pleased with these efforts so far. These types of customers generally increase their requirements over time becoming additional contributors to our organic growth. I expect our new logo generation to increase as our modified sales and marketing efforts gain additional traction. We believe our markets are generally in balance or close to it in terms of supply and demand. We are therefore focused on ensuring we have adequate capacity in key markets to continue to meet customer needs for differentiated turnkey data center capacity. We currently have a solid pipeline of projects in planning, entitlement and construction with nearly 220,000 square feet of capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. We look forward to 2018 during which we expect to set up our company for its next phase of growth, including expected construction commencement on SV8 and LA3 and our ongoing expansion in Reston. These 3 projects, cumulatively representing nearly 415,000 square feet of incremental TKD capacity, provides significant runway as we look to 2019 and beyond in 3 of our largest markets. In addition, we are opportunistically looking for additional land and/or capacity in Denver and Chicago. Looking more specifically at our individual markets. In Los Angeles, we are on track with our development projects at LA2 and expect to deliver 87,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity in the first quarter of 2018. Due to existing customer growth and new customers, the total expansion capacity under construction at LA2 is now 43% preleased. We continue to work through entitlement, permitting and design work for LA3. Pending any unforeseen delays, we expect to commence construction in the first half of 2018. In terms of the market overall, pricing has softened slightly due to additional capacity created by churn at sites owned by others, but we view that as temporary. In the Bay Area, occupancy levels remain elevated across the market, while pricing is moderately down due to incremental supply from other developers but still ahead of historical norms. Across our Santa Clara campus, we have approximately 56,000 square feet available at the end of Q3. We are in the design process for SV8 and anticipate filing for permits in the coming weeks, which should enable us to start construction in the first half of 2018. Northern Virginia and DC still see strong demand though the market remains competitive with new supply primarily in Loudoun County and Manassas. Occupancy rates are high, but the amount of new supply has resulted in modestly more competitive pricing in this market. We anticipate delivering 3,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity at VA1 in the fourth quarter as well as a 25,000 square foot first phase of turnkey capacity at VA3. We have begun site work at VA3 for an 80,000 square foot data center building, which, at full build out, will have capacity of 12 megawatts plus a 77,000 square foot centralized infrastructure building to serve the entire VA3 property. We will build out the first 50% of this new data center building as Phase 1B. Other site work ongoing will enable an ultimate VA3 capacity of 611,000 to 897,000 square feet of new data center space, depending on final zoning rules. We continue to have good discussions with current and prospective customers in this market regarding their growth needs and remain encouraged by the pipeline for pre-leasing opportunities at VA3. In Denver, we completed the first phase of expansion at DE1 and placed into service 8,200 square feet of turnkey capacity, which was 42% leased and 35% occupied. We continue to enhance the value of the ecosystem as our Denver campus is now the site of the first native on-ramp for a leading public cloud provider serving the U.S. Mountain region. With supply across the market still constrained, in Q3, we began construction of the final phase of expansion at DE1 with 15,600 square feet of turnkey capacity, which we estimate completing in the third quarter of 2018. In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results, our development activities supporting future growth and our efforts to increase market share in the hybrid and multi-cloud space. We believe that our differentiated business model and ownership strategy focusing on scalable, flexible, network and cloud dense data centers in infill locations of large-edge markets where the data community has a high level of interaction and interdependence will enable us to continue to prosper on behalf of our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Smith: Thanks, Paul. I'll begin by reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activity during the third quarter and then discuss in more detail our vertical and geographic results. During the quarter, we signed 103 new and expansion leases, totaling $10.1 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 41,000 net rentable square feet and average GAAP rate of $247 per square foot. There are a few dynamics impacting the Q3 rate, including higher average density, which was almost 40% above the trailing 12-month average. Related, we had somewhat of a unique situation with a full room enterprise customer in Santa Clara that contracted for additional power without adding incremental square footage, resulting in the above average density. We saw good traction this quarter as it relates to new logo signed with enterprise customers accounting for 75% of annualized GAAP rent signed for new logos. These customers included a regional credit union, which deployed with us in 2 markets; a network pop with the largest social media provider in China; a Fortune Global 500 Japanese information technology equipment and services company; and a provider of hardware and cloud-based CDN and caching solutions. As Paul mentioned, Q3 leasing was again heavily weighted towards expansions of existing customers, which continues to be a strong source of organic growth for us in existing deployments and in new markets or facilities. During the third quarter, a large public cloud provider expanded with us in New York supporting its dipole node and access to its cloud onramp. Second, a large cloud application and platform services company expanded with us in Chicago with a new backbone pop deployed to support its cloud computing services. Lastly, a leading enterprise cloud -- private cloud and backup infrastructure provider expanded with us in Northern Virginia to support multi-cloud service offerings to its customers. Both the organic growth from our embedded base and the incremental growth from our new logos that are attracted to the high level of interaction with our ecosystem continue to drive better-than-expected performance for our interconnection products and services. In Q3, interconnection revenue grew 21% year-over-year, reflecting total volume growth of 13%, including 70% from fiber cross connects. Year-to-date, interconnection revenue increased 18%. With respect to the vertical mix within our ecosystem, during Q3, network and cloud customers accounted for 12% and 14%, respectively, of annualized GAAP rent sign. The network vertical continued to perform well in Q3 with solid growth from existing customers driving activity in the quarter. We signed 4 new network logos in Q3, including a global satellite connectivity solutions provider and an international fiber to the home network developer. Network demand from existing customers remains healthy with a number of expansions across nearly all of our markets, including the sizable expansion of a subsidiary of an international telecom provider in the Bay Area to support its end customers growth in the U.S. Turning to the cloud vertical. As I mentioned previously, we saw good growth from existing cloud customers that are expanding with us in Q3 to support growth in their respective products and services. We signed 5 new logos, including a global cloud hosting provider, a leader in software defined infrastructure and a network visibility and traffic monitoring technology provider. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, this vertical accounted for 74% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the third quarter. Looking more specifically at Q3. In addition to the expansion with our strategic digital content enterprise customer in Los Angeles, we signed expansions with a leading e-commerce retail of home goods, a leading e-health care provider, a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate and a sports broadcasting organization. We continue to believe our highly interconnected network-dense data center campuses provide the optimal mix of connectivity, low latency and scalability to attract this key customer demographic. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases during Q3 were Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and New York, New Jersey, collectively representing 85% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. Strength in Bay Area leasing was led by the power expansion in Santa Clara, which I discussed earlier. Above and beyond that specific lease, performance was driven by the cloud and enterprise verticals followed by network service providers. We have also seen increasing interest from the autonomous vehicle sector in the Bay Area market and continue to see the enterprise vertical representing the demand for larger requirements. Demand in Los Angeles was again impact by the expansion of a strategic content customer, which Paul highlighted earlier. Apart from that specific lease, digital media entertainment continues to be a reliable source of demand for us, where we continue to see steady network growth with 3 new networks added to the Los Angeles ecosystem. The positive trajectory continued in the New York, New Jersey market in Q3 with performance led by cloud growth. In addition, we see increasing activity among the financial services vertical while the health care vertical is also increasingly common in the funnel. Sales of square footage sold both increased again this quarter with leasing at NY1 the main driver. New logo growth was weighted towards the enterprise vertical at both NY1 and NY2. In October, we received notification from the Virginia Economic Development Partnership authority that CoreSite successfully achieved the targets set forth for capital investment and new jobs creation in order to qualify for the sales and use tax exemption for the purchase or lease of qualifying computer equipment and enabling software by data centers and their customers. CoreSite is the first and only data center provider to qualify in Fairfax County, and we believe this is an important differentiator and benefit to our customers. We can continue to include additional current and future CoreSite data center customers as participants in the programs, sales and use tax savings program through June 30, 2035. Over the last 6 quarters, a significant amount of our leasing activity has been focused on the necessary building blocks to support our customer ecosystem and future growth by attracting key networks, cloud service providers and enterprises with similar anchor tenant characteristics, which promote the robust exchange of traffic within our facilities and interdependence among our customers. As we build critical mass of such customers, we will focus more sales resources towards attracting new logos that complement and exchange data with these core customers. In summary, the third quarter sales results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and business model, and we will continue to work to attract valuable new customers and applications to our data centers. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q3 financial results followed by an update of our development CapEx and our leverage and liquidity capacity. Q3 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $123.1 million, a 4.4% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 21.5% increase year-over-year. Operating revenue consisted of $101.8 million in rental and power revenue from data center operations, up 4.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 22.5% year-over-year. Interconnection services revenue contributed $16.2 million to operating revenues, an increase of 5.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 21.1% year-over-year. And tenant reimbursement and other revenues were $2.2 million. Office and light industrial revenue was $2.9 million. Q3 FFO was $1.10 per diluted share and unit, flat on a sequential quarter basis and an increase of 22.2% year-over-year. The quarter included a couple of items worth highlighting and the first is a benefit of approximately $0.03 per share related to real estate tax true-ups at some of our facilities in the Bay Area. In addition, during the third quarter, we saw elevated repairs and maintenance expense across the portfolio primarily for chiller repairs and upgrades which amounted to approximately $0.02 per share. We also experienced increased expenses in Miami related to Hurricane Irma, which amounted to approximately $0.01 per share. Related to Hurricane Irma, we want to personally thank our team for their efforts in serving our customers and keeping our Miami data center up and running throughout the storm and its aftermath. Looking forward into Q4. I want to emphasize that we expect to invest approximately $8 million to $10 million of recurring capital associated with the chiller plant replacement and upgrade at LA2 and, therefore, we expect AFFO to decrease sequentially. Please remember that we expect a strong return subsequent to this investment with increased energy efficiency. Returning to Q3. Adjusted EBITDA of $65.3 million increased 0.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 25.2% over the same quarter last year. We continued to expand our margins with our adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 54.7% as measured over the trailing 4 quarters ending with and including Q3 2017. This represents an increase of 230 basis points over the comparable year ago period. Related, trailing 12-month revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 65% and 54%, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses in Q3 totaled $4.6 million or 3.8% of total operating revenues, down 60 basis points year-over-year. General and administrative expenses were $9.8 million or 7.9% of total operating revenues, a decrease of 140 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, we expect G&A expense to be approximately 7.5% of total operating revenues, in line with the year-to-date level. Now turning to our same-store metrics. Q3 same-store turnkey data center occupancy decreased 20 basis points to 90.3% compared to Q3 2016. Additionally, same store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 6.1% year-over-year and 2.2% sequentially to $1,503. Turning to renewals. In Q3, we renewed approximately 81,000 total square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $178 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 5.5% on a cash basis and 10.9% on a GAAP basis. Churn in the third quarter was 1.4%. We commenced 22,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $410 per square foot, which represents $8.9 million of annualized GAAP rent. As previously mentioned, the density increase in the Bay Area elevated the commencement rate in Q3. We ended the quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 93.4%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to the prior quarter. We completed 8,300 square feet at DE1 and this capacity was placed into the pre-stabilized pool at 35.2% occupancy. Turning now to backlog. Projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $13.7 million as of September 30, 2017. On a cash basis, our backlog was $20.1 million. We expect approximately 35% of the GAAP backlog to commence during the remainder of 2017 with the balance expected to commence during the first half of 2018. As Paul mentioned, we have a total of nearly 220,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity in various stages of development. This includes new construction and expansion projects in Northern Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; Denver; and Boston. As of the end of the third quarter, we had invested $62.3 million of the estimated $217.1 million required to complete these projects. We have now included the expansion opportunities associated with the future development of both SV8 and LA3 to our held for development summary, which is reflected on Page 19 of the earnings supplemental. The percentage of interest capitalized in Q3 was 11.5% and the year-to-date amount is 11.3%. For 2017, we continue to expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 10% to 15%. Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2017, our ratio of net principle debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.0x. Including preferred stock, the ratio was 3.5x. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $332 million of total liquidity consisting of available cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility. As we announced on October 16, we intend to redeem all 4.6 million outstanding shares of our 7.25% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a redemption date on December 12, 2017, for a total of $116.3 million, including accrued dividends. We believe this transaction will result in significant savings and earnings accretion for shareholders of approximately $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2018. We expect to utilize the credit facility to redeem the preferred shares and we anticipate the need for additional debt financing during the first half of 2018 to further increase our liquidity. Timing, pricing and the type of debt instrument are dependent on market conditions, and we've targeted a total issuance amount of $225 million to $300 million while maintaining a healthy balance between our fixed and variable price debt. This additional liquidity can be utilized to fund continued development across the portfolio. And looking into 2018, we currently expect our total capital investment to be between $250 million and $300 million. Finally, as you begin thinking about your models and 2018 estimates, keep in mind that we are planning to adopt 2 new accounting standards, revenue recognition and lease accounting, effective January 1, 2018. The adoption of these new standards predominantly impacts us in 3 ways, all of which have been disclosed in our previously filed financial statements in 2017. First, related to the balance sheet, it will require us to gross up our balance sheet by $100 million to $300 million to reflect the estimated lease liability for the properties we lease from third parties. Second, depending upon the quantification of the balance sheet impact, it may increase our rental expense to reflect increased levels of lease expense included in current lease terms. This will likely range from $0.00 to $0.07 per share. Third, we will no longer capitalize indirect sales and marketing payroll cost associated with successful leasing. This has a negative impact of $0.03 per share. All in, we anticipate this will have an impact of $0.03 to $0.10 per share and is more fully explained on our public filings with our Q3 Form 10-Q expected to be filed tomorrow. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.
David Rodgers: Maybe, Steve, just wanted to start with the leasing activity in the quarter. It seems like it was maybe just a little bit slower than the pace you've been moving at, and I wanted to know if that ties in all your comments that you had made about setting the groundwork for the right tenants to come in. So I guess the 2 questions, to shorten it up, would be, did you see any kind of pull back in leasing in the quarter that worried you at all? And the second would be, do we expect leasing to accelerate now that the building blocks are in place or just kind of stay where it's at?
Steven Smith: Yes. Thanks, Dave. I guess the short answer is it doesn't provide any concern as to where we are with any slowdown. I think we are being, and continue to be, disciplined about how we're first to marketplace in pricing. So that's a key aspect of this. But as we mentioned in the prerecorded remarks there, it's really around how do we target the right tenants, those that are going to value low latency and interconnection. And as we establish those building blocks, to your point, we continue to look to those right logos that will complement that as well as value that, and that continues to be our strategy. So as far as overall volume is concerned, we continue to drive more focus there, and we expect to see those results to increase.
David Rodgers: Okay, great. And then, Jeff, you did mention on the balance sheet up to maybe $300 million of issuance in the first half of next year. Have you thought more about the public fund market in terms of that being an new option for you given the sizing of the transaction you talked about?
Jeffrey Finnin: Obviously, the public bond market is always an option, and we watch that market and that pricing closely. Having said that, you saw the recent execution actually that was just priced yesterday by one of our peers in the public bond market. And I think that data point, together with some of the other data we see in terms of trading pricing of some of the other public bond issuers, is something we'll take into consideration. But I think we're able to get better pricing in the private market today. At least we were -- last April when we went out, last test of the market, we hope that's the same as we again look at trying to do something again the first half of '18 but is something we'll have to watch closely.
David Rodgers: Lastly for me, you talked about added power revenues or added power density at existing leases in the quarter. One, do we see more of that coming in the future; but two, also, how much of an impact did that have in the third quarter, and is there any additional carryover into the fourth quarter as well?
Steven Smith: Yes, as far as power densities are concerned, we do see some applications that are requiring higher density overall. We feel that that's fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter, though. So I think as equipment and customers get better utilizing their power as well as gear gets more efficient in using that power, you'll see that climb up a bit over time. But nothing dramatic that we've seen, just a continued march towards that better utilization.
Jeffrey Finnin: And Dave, the only other data point I'd give you if you just take a longer look at what's happened to density, just call it, over maybe the last 2 years, you have seen an increase in overall power densities across at least our portfolio. But this quarter was even higher than what we've seen there. That's obviously why Steve wanted to point it out in the prepared remarks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.
Jordan Sadler: I wanted to follow up on the development and sort of the positioning again for '18 and the sort of next phase of growth. So you've added LA3 and SV8 to the new development schedule and, obviously, Reston is underway. Can you just talk a little bit about the return expectations there vis-à-vis sort of maybe commodity space versus what you've historically been able to generate on sort of more network dense facilities?
Paul Szurek: Jordan, this is Paul. We view these investments as having the same potential returns that we have always historically targeted. And as you know, that is based upon the fact that our space is not commodity space but leverages off our network nodes and our model of providing scalable higher density capacity, more efficient capacity close to, i.e., interconnected to our network nodes. So I view these as continuations of our historical development strategy and return targets.
Jordan Sadler: That's helpful. But I was also kind of -- I can't help but notice that the scale of some of these new investments, obviously, the function of you guys kind of leasing up a lot of the existing portfolio. You and I have talked about sort of avoiding the J curve a little bit and maybe signing big leases up front. And it seems to me that there is some real competition around courting those larger customers, those anchor customers that you guys have historically targeted. Is -- will you be able to maintain sort of price on those larger requirements still?
Paul Szurek: Consistent with historical practice, I believe so. The preleasing activity really heats up right around the time that you break ground for your vertical buildings. We expect the same here. And historically, a lot of our pre-leasing is to just coming from customers who need to expand in place in our existing campuses, and we see a lot of those same trends continuing with these projects which is why we're excited about moving forward with them.
Steven Smith: The only other thing I would add there, Jordan, is that as we've put together these projects not only to -- as we determine the scale of each individual project but also the underwriting of it, we factored in some of the pricing that's needed in order to get those off the ground in order to get the ultimate returns out of that project. So we feel like we're well positioned in order to compete and still drive the returns that we need to.
Jordan Sadler: Last one. As we ramp these developments a little bit more, especially the initial phases, I think you talked about first half of '18 for SV8 and LA3, should we anticipate that the CapEx spend for next year would ramp up a bit above the levels we're seeing this year?
Jeffrey Finnin: Yes, Jordan. I think today, we've got guidance out there for this year to be, I think, it's $250 million to $290 million range, so midpoint of 3 -- I'm sorry, midpoint of $270 million. In the prepared remarks, I actually highlighted that we would expect CapEx for 2018 to be about $250 million to $300 million. So at the midpoint, right on top of what we expect to ultimately spend in 2017.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
Jonathan Atkin: So I was interested in the renewal spreads and maybe talk a little bit more about the positive spreads that you're seeing. Is that fairly broad-based? Does it vary? Is it shorter-term contracts? Are you also seeing a step up on the law of the longer-term full sale deals that come up for renewal? And then my second question is on interconnection and -- what types of scenarios are you seeing that's driving the growth there? Is it just more businesses connecting to each other within the same campus or data hall? Or is it cloud? Or more carriers popping your sites?
Jeffrey Finnin: Jonathan, it's Jeff. I'm just going to add some commentary and I'll then turn it over to Steve to give you a little bit more details. But one thing I just wanted to make sure we recalled is when we gave guidance at the beginning of this year, we tried to highlight that we expected our cash mark-to-market to be fairly flat or at the lower end of our range in the first half and then to be elevated in the second half. And so based on the third quarter results, it's right in line with what we expected, and so we weren't surprised by it. But that's -- I just wanted to highlight that to make sure you guys were aware of what we expected to happen during the year. Steve can give you some additional commentary related to your other questions.
Steven Smith: Yes, Jonathan. As far as renewal spreads are concerned, it is a cause and focus for us to ensure that we are maximizing the opportunity there but also being fair to our customers, and we feel like we strike that balance. We do have a fair amount of customers that came due this year that we were successful in marking to market, so we continue to look at those individually. And as we also have constrained space to make sure that we're getting the most return out of the space available. So that continues to be a focus for us. But overall, we seem to be in balance with where market conditions are. And also, as you look at the churn, we seem to be striking that balance fairly well. As far as interconnection growth is concerned, the primary factor that we've seen is really in the connection to cloud so we've highlighted that on prior calls and that continues to be the trajectory that we're seeing right now and we look to see that continue in the foreseeable future.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay. And then Chicago, you mentioned that, I think, alongside Denver, is a place amongst you're looking for additional location. So in Chicago, is that kind of a campus situation or an additional site downtown? What are you thinking there?
Paul Szurek: Like most of our peers, when it comes to that type of activity, it's better to talk less until you actually execute something. But I think we've been fairly clear that our business model is based on the campus model, and whatever we do in any city like Chicago or Denver will be consistent with that model.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay. And then finally, I'm just interested that you called out the chiller plant investments at LA2. And just at a broader level, can you talk about how frequently one would see the sort of lumpier and more expensive maintenance activities going forward?
Paul Szurek: I think that they're fairly rare. I mean this one came about because we were expanding LA2 anyway and needed to add additional chiller capacity, and that gave us the opportunity to actually upgrade all the chillers at the same time and achieve a much higher energy efficiency and significant savings. And so really -- it really is a great return on investment. So that doesn't happen very often where replacement calendars can be accelerated in conjunction with a new build. But in this case, it's very attractive.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim.
Robert Gutman: So given year-to-date commencements and what's scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter from the backlog, I think we get pretty close to the $30 million that you estimated to be close to the year. So if we assume another consistent quarter of incremental deals signed and commenced, and without any meaningful change in power revenue and churn, is it a valid assumption to say that you're -- we're looking towards the high end of the revenue range?
Jeffrey Finnin: Yes. Yes, let me talk a little bit about -- I think what you're looking at is probably guidance for 2017 that we have provided. I think as you think about the fourth quarter, we -- obviously, we chose not to change our guidance for the fourth quarter for the remainder of 2017 just given where we were in the year. Having said that, I think it's important to think about as you look at it for operating revenues, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share that we would likely be at the upper end of our current guidance ranges. I just wanted to add that additional commentary just as you guys think about the fourth quarter.
Robert Gutman: And just a quick follow-up. So I guess the same thought process applies to the interconnection guidance because it's 13% to 16% and you're already about 18% year-to-date.
Jeffrey Finnin: Yes. I mean, I think we're just under 18% year-to-date, so we would agree we would be probably at the upper end, probably exceeding the upper end of our guidance range given what we've got out there today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.
Colby Synesael: You've historically reviewed your dividend towards the end of the year. I realize you raised it, I guess, out of order in the second quarter. Is it fair to assume that you're going to still look at it again at year-end this time around? Or are you now in a new schedule for that? And then as it relates to the stabilized square feet, it looks like it was down quarter-over-quarter, I think, for the first time if not ever. I'm just trying to understand what would have been behind that.
Paul Szurek: So thank you for the question. I believe we mentioned after the last dividend raise that we expected to review the dividend biannually, and I expect that our board will continue to follow that approach.
Colby Synesael: And if that's the case, is it fair to -- we should still kind of think of the payout ratio being somewhat similar? So whatever we kind of all assume for our growth assumptions, it is what it is, but the payout should be most likely fairly similar?
Paul Szurek: I mean, I guess that's a good way to look at it. It's ultimately a board decision, so I can't say any more than that.
Jeffrey Finnin: And Colby, just related to your second question around the stabilized square feet, that decrease of about 9,000 square feet really just relates to some of the churn that we experienced in the quarter. And the churn that we experienced in that decrease was largely a result of some move-outs we had at Chicago.
Colby Synesael: Okay. And did I also hear -- just as a quick follow-up, as relates to the guide, I appreciate that the recurring CapEx investment will impact AFFO, and I think you may have said you expect, I think, AFFO to be down quarter-over-quarter. Did you also say that because of that, it's going to impact FFO? And if so, what line item does that ultimately show up and to drive that since that's -- I think that excludes recurring CapEx.
Jeffrey Finnin: Yes. No, Colby, the recurring CapEx that we expect to invest in the fourth quarter specifically related to that chiller plant is about, we said, $8 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter. And so that will only impact AFFO. That does not impact our -- I'm sorry, does not impact our FFO, just AFFO.
Colby Synesael: Great. So AFFO down quarter-over-quarter but not necessarily the case with FFO?
Jeffrey Finnin: That's correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Crédit Suisse.
Ahmed Badri: Regarding the updated disclosed number of interconnections, the 25,000-plus in the supplemental disclosures, could you give us some color on the driving force behind the new cross-connects? And how come things like Megaport, PacketFabric and other software defined network companies are helping drive interconnection revenue for your company?
Steven Smith: Yes, sure. As I mentioned earlier, the primary driver that we see, so far anyway and has been on the trail, has been related to those enterprises that are connecting the cloud as well as network to network. So a lot of enterprises that are connected to both networks and to cloud customers. We do have several SDN providers that are built out within our buildings. One of those is PacketFabric, another is Megaport, as you mentioned. And they are driving some of that interconnection as well. But so far, not a material amount.
Jeffrey Finnin: And Sami, the only other commentary I would add, and we mentioned this on the last call, and it's fairly consistent again this quarter, Steve touched on this earlier in regards to the interconnections being driven by our cloud providers. That growth rate of those companies connected to cloud providers is probably 2 to 3 times higher than what we're seeing in the fiber cross connect volume, just from a volume perspective, just to give you some perspective on what we're seeing inside the vertical mix.
Ahmed Badri: Got it, got it. And then on the 24 new logos added in the quarter, are these customers coming to collocation as a solution for the first time? Or are they -- do they already have collocation solutions deployed and we're just looking to expand with CoreSite?
Steven Smith: It's really a mix of that. It is difficult, which is one of the great things about our model, to pull somebody out of an existing collocation provider. So winning those new logos especially as they transition to an outsourced model is a great opportunity for us, which seems to be the primary driver for those new logos but there is some that we win from other providers as well. But I would say, without having the exact numbers in front of me, the majority of those new logos are moving from an existing space that they may already operate to outsourcing to a collo provider for the first time.
Ahmed Badri: Got it. And then I just have one more question regarding the Miami market. Can we just get an update on what's going on in specifically that part of the U.S.? And have Phoenix, Dallas or Oregon come up with opportunities that you guys are evaluating? Or you're just sticking to the same campus model that was already in place?
Paul Szurek: The answer to your second question, we continue to look at other markets where we can deploy a campus model, but we're not looking to enter the race for undifferentiated collo in any other market. But we do continue to look for new market opportunities.
Steven Smith: Yes. With respect to Miami, I do think that provides us an opportunity there. As we've mentioned in prior calls, we had some space that came back to us that gives us the opportunity to lease up again. And with some of the changes in the competitive landscape there, I think it actually gives us a greater opportunity to lease up there as well as access to Latin America and so forth. So we continue to drive more focus there. We're also looking to make some slight improvements to the site there that I think will make it more appealing for customers, so it is a focus for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.
Michael Rollins: You were mentioning when you were discussing the Virginia Ashburn market just that there was some deployment and pricing may have gotten a little more competitive there. I was curious if you can just unpack you comment a bit more as to what you're seeing specifically in the competitive environment in that market. And are you starting to see any signals of incremental competition in some of the other major markets in which you operate?
Paul Szurek: As I said in my remarks, we don't see any serious degradation in pricing. But it has been moderately impacted by the competition, the new development that's out there, I think, probably in the range of 5% to 10%. Although that's hard to estimate because products and solutions differ significantly. Having said that, it -- in line with right now the way Steve describe that we underwrite our new investments and our preleased economics. So we feel good about that. And a lot of the -- being the only network node in Reston, which provides diversity to the Ashburn route and Ashburn network node, we don't see quite as much of that. And so probably can't provide as much color as to what's going on in Ashburn and Manassas as some of the other companies can.
Steven Smith: Yes. And Michael, this is Steve. I would just kind of reiterate that point that Virginia has always been very competitive. There's always been a lot of competitors in that market as well as inventory that comes online. The absorption still seems to be holding strong there. But as Paul mentioned, I do think we have a good story to tell there, being a strong interconnection story that's not in Ashburn but still within that net market that provides low latency, scalability but an alternative to Ashburn being in Reston. So we do see even some of the bigger cloud providers that have deployed in the Ashburn market that are looking for an alternative to provide redundancy and other on-ramps, and that's been a good story so far for us.
Michael Rollins: And one other question. If you total up the development that's in your pipeline right now and measure that historically, how would the size of this development pipeline compare? And are there opportunities to get more aggressive and accelerate the pace of build over the next 12 to 18 months?
Paul Szurek: I believe that we are significantly above average in total dollars in our development pipeline. But as a percentage of our total assets, probably similar or maybe even...
Jeffrey Finnin: Slightly ahead than where we've been.
Paul Szurek: Yes. But in terms of accelerating it, we've always been glad to accelerate when the market allowed that, and there is some possibility for that in all of these developments, but it's hard to predict the certainty at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JPMorgan.
Yong Choe: Following up on that, how should we think about the timing of the SV8 and L.A. developments along with Reston in terms of next year and the year after?
Paul Szurek: So one of the difficulties in predicting precise timing relates to the advantages of developing in these markets. They're not easy to develop in, which creates natural barriers to entry. The regulatory scheme is part of that and it sometimes -- or always difficult to predict exactly when you will receive permits. In my comments, I gave you, and in our other materials, we've given you guidance as to when we think these projects will commence. Typically, once they are commenced and in our current construction model, it will take 9 to 12 months to completion and the commencement of revenue generation. And that's the best we can do in terms of predicting timing right now.
Yong Choe: Great. And I guess to follow up on the pricing question earlier. It seems like there was a little bit more available space because of churn from competitors in L.A. and it seemed like you kind of held the line on price. Can you give us an idea of how the company thinks about what drives wanting to drive a higher deal versus a lower one versus, I guess, the space you have? Just kind of getting an update on that would be great.
Paul Szurek: Typically, especially in markets where we -- are space constrained until new developments come up, we adhere to a very good discipline on pricing and also a customer discipline. So we target that space to those customers that we perceive as being healthier, long run for the ecosystem, stickier, more likely to grow, generate more cross connects and attract other customers to the ecosystem.
Steven Smith: And the only other thing I would add is as we look at the overall absorption rate as well as the competitive dynamics in the market, just trying to align those things to obviously maximize return but also look at, as Paul mentioned, the overall value to the ecosystem, both in terms of rent and power margin but also interconnection and the overall attractiveness that they might bring to other entities that we would want to sell to.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Frank Louthan: Just wanted to unpack a little bit of the pricing commentary in this market. What do you think is sort of behind to the competitor pricing? Is it irrational behavior in your view? Or is it maybe just the benefit of some lower cost construction? Or how should we -- how do you view that in this market?
Paul Szurek: I don't think it's irrational behavior so much. I think that people perceive these as good markets with good, long-term supply and demand characteristics. Demand is still growing right now. But there is a lot that's been started recently, maybe a slightly greater supply than demand growth relative to historical. And so -- and there are more participants doing that in some of these markets, and so that usually leads to more competitive pricing.
Steven Smith: Just to give you a little bit more color there as well. I think it really depends on the market as to whether there's additional inventory that's being built there or in some cases, there's been some customer churn from some of our competitors that drives them to be more aggressive and try and back fill that space. So overall, to Paul's point, I think it's been very balanced. I don't see anything irrational in the market at this point. It just -- we just want to make sure that we stay to our strategy. We're disciplined about it and so far, that seems to be holding.
Operator: Mr. Szurek, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: Thank you. Thanks to everybody on the call for their interest in the company and for the opportunity to answer your questions. I just like to close by thanking my colleagues throughout the company for their excellent efforts, another good quarter. And we very much look forward to the future. We love our business model. We love our team. Our customer communities are understanding and growing in the right way. And the future for us looks very promising.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-07-27 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And a directive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Greer Aviv. Thank you. You may begin.
Greer Aviv: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans, or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our 2016 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at coresite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning. And thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm glad to share our second quarter financial and operating results, as well as update you on our markets and our outlook on supply and demand. Financial results for the second quarter were strong again with year-over-year increases in revenue of 23%, while adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share grew 27% and 24% year-over-year, respectively. Very strong leasing volume of $11.9 million in annualized GAAP rent signed in Q2 included a significant expansion with the Fortune 500 customer in the Los Angeles market and several other key deployments. Overall, it was an unusual quarter for leasing with existing customers representing 95% of new and expansion sales, reflecting the organic growth needs of customers in our markets and an increase in the percentage of sales in funnel related to larger deployments. Correspondently, retail collocation sales were $4.9 million, 18% below the trailing 24 month average. We saw a similar pattern in Q1 2016 when we had another surge in sales of larger deployments. Going forward, we believe these scale deployments and the services they represent are key components of our cloud enabled data center product. They will continue to increase the attraction of our data centers to enterprises and networks, and lay the foundation for continued successful campus expansions. These deployments illustrate the importance of network density plus scalable solutions in large edge markets, which characterizes our national data center platform. We also continue to see a steady influx of new logos joining the CoreSite ecosystem each quarter with 31 new logos entering our customer base in Q2. Net of customer churn, we added 18 new logos. Across our markets, demand remains consistent and absorption, over the last two years, has exceeded our forecast; while supply remains generally in balance or in a couple of markets constrained. Given the strong demand and the organic growth inherent in our existing customer base, we currently have a number of projects under construction to enable us to continue to meet customer demand across our markets, as well as working through the process of planning new data centers in markets that are most inventory constrained. In Los Angeles, the 47,000 square-feet that we commenced construction on during the first quarter, is now 62% preleased as a result of Q2 leasing. In order to maintain available capacity in the market and keep up with overall strong demand, we have commenced construction of an incremental 39,000 square-feet of turnkey datacenter space at LA2. Consistent with what I mentioned earlier, we are accelerating the initial development plans for LA3. On land, we already owned, adjacent to LA2, but which is not yet entitled and permitted for construction. We have commenced the permitting and entitlement process for this asset. In the Bay Area, absorption continues to outpace historical levels while supply remains limited across the market, and occupancy levels are elevated. We are optimistic about the funnel in this market for both larger footprint requirements that need the performance and connectivity to support edge notes and for performance and geographic sensitive retail collocations. As it relates to the land on a contract for SBA, we are substantially complete with our due diligence and anticipate closing in mid Q3. Please keep in mind that we currently estimate the first phase of capacity of SBA would come online approximately 18 to 22 months after we close on the land purchase based on our expectations around timing for permitting and entitlements. Regarding Northern Virginia and DC, demand and absorption continue to be strong. Occupancy rates remain high in this market and a number of datacenter providers have land to develop new capacity, primarily for wholesale deployments and some had commenced construction. Although, we believe the majority of the new construction is preleased. We are under construction on a total of 53,000 square feet across the market with development in Downtown DC, expansion of VA1 and initial development at VA3. We see good activity in the sales pipeline, and continue to have discussions with customers for preleasing opportunities at VA3, where we expect to deliver 25,000 square feet or 3 megawatts of turnkey datacenter capacity in the fourth quarter. We also expect to commence construction in the third quarter on Phase 1B, a 58,000 square-foot building of 6 megawatts plus a centralized infrastructure building to serve the entire VA3 property at an estimated cost of $85 million. In Denver, we are nearing completion on the first phase of expansion of DE1 and expect to place into service 8,200 square feet of turnkey capacity in Q3. Supply across this market remains limited, and we see good opportunities to support customer demand. During the second quarter, we signed a midsize prelease with a company that will be a valuable addition to our ecosystem. Finally, in the New York New Jersey market, we saw an uptick in both square footage and annualized GAAP rent signed in Q2. This March, the third straight quarter of increasing sales in this market and that trend should continue a bit longer. NY2 again accounted for the majority of new and expansion leasing in this market, as well as all of the new logo growth in the quarter. Enterprise activity was strong, accounting for 88% of the annualized GAAP rent signed here. While all of the new logo signed in the quarter within this vertical. In closing, we are pleased with our financial performance and sales results in the second quarter, especially our securing of key ecosystem building blocks, which provide a strong impetus for growth in 2018 and beyond. We continue to believe the flexibility of our platform, our network density and cloud on ramps and our vibrant ecosystem, make CoreSite uniquely positioned to capture demand in a world of increasingly data intensive applications. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Paul Szurek: Thanks, Paul. I'll begin by reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activity during the second quarter, and then discuss in more detail, our vertical and geographic results. In Q2, we signed 119 new and expansion leases, totaling $11.9 million in annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 52,000 net rentable square-feet at an average GAAP rate of $208 per square-foot. Note that this rate excludes revenue associated with contractually reserved data center space across our platform. Our ability to support evolving customer IT workloads from tradition enterprises with hybrid and multi cloud requirements to high density large scale deployments coupled with access to hundreds of network and cloud service providers, continues to differentiate CoreSite. We are encouraged with the increasing value of this ecosystem as we add more new customers that contribute to the overall attractiveness of our platform. As Paul noted, new logo growth was strong again in Q2, and we continue to be pleased with the quality of applications and customers that are coming to CoreSite datacenters. Included in this quarter's new enterprise logos is a consulting and technology services company, two financial services organizations, our retail ecommerce site, an international consultancy specializing for inter-accounting and data analytics and an international online commerce and payments ecosystem. Additionally, existing customer expansions, which have historically accounted for 70% to 80% of sales on a quarterly basis, continue to be a strong source of growth. This includes customers that either increase their current deployment or expand through additional markets. During the second quarter, we have some powerful examples of customers expanding their applications and/or infrastructure closer to the edge. First, a large public cloud customer expanded with us in New York, and is deploying infrastructure to establish a metro ring around the New York New Jersey market, so that customers can distribute traffic more efficiently to and from their edge sites. The same customer will be deploying a number of applications in our Denver market, representing their first deployment in this area of the U.S. Second a large content company expanded its existing environment with us in Los Angeles, as well as established a new deployment with CoreSite in Northern Virginia. Both expansions were part of this customer's ongoing efforts to increase capacity at the edge to support existing customers and new initiatives, such as streaming video and TV applications. Lastly, a digital media company expanded with us in New York to support high performance video streaming of sporting events. Overall, we continue to see growth in cloud deployments throughout the portfolio as data intensive use cases appear to be increasing. With the expansions of existing customers and the new customer activity contribute to the vibrant interconnection density of our datacenters. In Q2, interconnection revenue grew 18% year-over-year, reflecting total volume growth of 12%, including 16% growth in fiber cross connects. With respect to the vertical mix within our ecosystem, during Q2, net work and cloud customers each accounted for 9% of annualized GAAP rent signed. Specific to the cloud vertical, we continue to see good traction with four new logos, including an international infrastructure as a service provider and a global provider of online business solutions. Additionally, we signed an expansion with a cloud contact center provider, as well as an expansion within edge cloud platform serving digital businesses. The network vertical saw a strong activity during the quarter, which was the result of both new customer growth, as well as expansions. We had five new logos join our ecosystem, including an international communication solution company and a global virtual phone number provider. Additionally, we signed expansions with six fortune 1000 network customers during the quarter. Network demand was broad based with new and expansion leases signed in every one of our markets. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, this vertical accounted for 82% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the second quarter. Our enterprise vertical, which represents approximately 50% of our embedded base, captures not only pure enterprise deployments but also includes cloud deployments that may reside within an enterprise company. Looking at Q2, performance across the vertical was strong, led by strategic content expansions for compute catching nodes at the edge, as well as expansions with six fortune 1000 companies. As Paul discussed, we executed a larger expansion with an existing Fortune 500 customer for their edge compute deployment at LA2. In addition, we signed an expansion of our strategic content customer’s network PoP in Boston, and another strategic content customer’s edge nodes in Los Angeles and northern Virginia. Lastly, we executed an expansion of Fortune 20 customer’s online video streaming services in Silicon Valley. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases during Q2 were Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia DC. Collectively, representing 84% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. As I touched on earlier, demand in Los Angeles was impacted by the expansion of an existing Fortune 500 content company. Apart from that specific lease, demand was led by the enterprise vertical, followed by networks and cloud providers. Stabilized occupancy across the Los Angeles campus was 92.9% at the end of Q2, up 40 basis points from Q1. Activity across the Bay Area was strong led by the enterprise vertical or by cloud deployments. Our network dense access in the Silicon Valley market continues to be attractive for enterprises with two new logos signed this quarter. Stabilized occupancy across our Silicon Valley campuses decreased 50 basis points to 95.8% due to some modest churn at SE1 and SE4. In Northern Virginia DC, demand continues to be weighted toward smaller enterprise deployments from both existing customers and new logos. We saw good demand from cloud customers with three new logos in this market. Stabilized occupancy across northern Virginia DC now stands at 95.4%, a decrease of 100 basis points on a sequential basis, reflecting some customer churn at VA1. To wrap up, we continue to be pleased with the sale performance in the quarter, and we’ll continue to focus on driving added value across our operating portfolio by attracting synergistic deployments to our datacenters. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q2 financial results, followed by an update on our development CapEx and our leverage and liquidity capacity. I will then conclude my remarks with an update on our 2017 guidance. Q2 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $117.9 million, a 2.6% increase on a sequential quarter basis and 22.7% increase year-over-year. Q2 operating revenue consisted of $97.3 million in rental and power revenue from datacenter space, up 2.3% on a sequential quarter basis and 23.5% year-over-year. Interconnection services revenue contributed $15.3 million to operating revenues in Q2, an increase of 5.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 18.1% year-over-year. And tenant reimbursement and other revenues were $2.3 million. Office and light industrial revenue was $3 million. Q2 FFO was $1.10 per diluted share in unit, a decrease of 2.7% on a sequential quarter basis and an increase of 23.6% year-over-year. This sequential decline reflects the final expiration of our original full building customer's lease at SV3, as well as the financings executed in April. In addition, we saw an acceleration of decreased power margin in the quarter that we typically see in Q3. Q2 FFO also includes a benefit equal to approximately $0.01 per share related to a real estate tax accrual true up. Adjusted EBITDA of $64.8 million increased 0.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.7% over the same quarter last year. Our margins expanded again this quarter with our adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 54.4%, measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q2 2017. This represents an increase of 220 basis points over the comparable year ago period. Related, trailing 12 months revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 65% and 56% respectively. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter totaled $4.4 million or 3.7% of total operating revenues, down 100 basis points year-over-year. General and administrative expenses were $9.5 million in Q2 or 8.1% of total operating revenues, a decrease of 110 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect G&A expense to be approximately 8% of total operating revenues, in line with the year-to-date level. Now, turning to our same store metrics. Q2 same store turnkey data center occupancy increased 320 basis points to 91.1% from 87.9% in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, same store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 6.1% year-over-year and 2.1% sequentially to $1,470. Turning to renewals. In Q2, we renewed approximately 83,000 total square-feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $156 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 2.6% on a cash basis and 6.5% on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, we expect cash rent growth of approximately 3% for 2017. Churn in the second quarter was 2.6% and included 170 basis points of churn related to the final lease expiration of our original full building customer ion SV3. We commenced 26,000 net rentable square-feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $256 per square foot, which represents $6.6 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the second quarter with our stabilized datacenter occupancy at 93.8%, a decrease of 90 basis points compared to the first quarter, primarily due to 33,000 square-feet of turnkey capacity at NY2 that moved into the stabilized operating portfolio from pre-stabilized at 51% occupancy. Year-over-year, stabilized datacenter occupancy increased 180 basis points. Turning now to backlog. Projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $11.6 million as of June 30, 2017 and $20.2 million on a cash basis. We expect approximately 40% of the GAAP backlog to commence during the second half of 2017 with the remainder expected to commence in the first quarter of 2018. Turning to our development activity. As Paul mentioned, we had a number of projects under development at the end of Q2 with a total of 162,000 square-feet of turnkey datacenter capacity under construction as of June 30, 2017. This includes development and expansion projects in Northern Virginia, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Denver and Boston. As of the end of the second quarter, we had spent $31.3 million of the estimated $121.9 million required to complete these projects. The percentage of interest capitalized in Q2 was 12.3% and the year-to-date amount is 11.2%. For 2017, we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 10% to 15%. Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2017, our ratio of net principle debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.9 times, including preferred stock, the ratio was 3.3 times. As if the end of the second quarter, we had $368 million of total liquidity, consisting of available cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility. This increased level of liquidity reflects the two financing transactions completed in April, resulting in an incremental $275 million in available liquidity, as well as the fact that we had no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility at the end of the second quarter. As it relates to our dividend, during the second quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend to $0.90 per share on a quarterly basis. At this level for the remainder of the year, we would pay a dividend of $3.40 per share equal to approximately 77% of FFO based on the current midpoint of guidance. The $0.90 per share quarterly dividend represents $0.10 or 12.5% increase over the prior quarterly dividend. We took the opportunity to raise the dividend again six months after the last increase to more accurately reflect the recent performance of the Company and our sustainable cash flow levels. In addition, over the last 6.5 years as a public company, we have grown more comfortable with our visibility into the business, allowing us to increase the FFO payout ratio from the historical level of 60% to 62% to approximately 75%, which is more in line with the REIT industry average payout. Now in closing, I would like to address our updated guidance for 2017. I would remind you that our guidance reflects our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on page 23 of our Q2 earnings supplemental, our guidance for 2017 is as follows. Total operating revenue is now estimated to be $473.5 million to $483.5 million compared to the previous range of $472 to $482 million. Based on the midpoint of guidance, this implies 19.5% year-over-year revenue growth. Keep in mind that our revenue guidance is dependent upon the power product composition of deployments within our portfolio, and how quickly the larger metered power deployments install their infrastructure and ramp into their associated power requirements. As it relates to interconnection revenue growth, we now expect the 2017 revenue growth to be in line with the higher end of the range of 13% to 16%. Adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be $257.5 million to $262.5 million, an increase of $1 million based on the midpoint of current and previous guidance. This correlates to 22.4% year-over-year growth based on the midpoint of the range and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 54.3%, and revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 61%. FFO is estimated to be $4.39 to $4.47 per share and OP unit. This midpoint of $4.43 per share represents an increase of $0.03 per share and implies 19.4% year-over-year FFO growth compared to the $3.71 per share we reported in 2016. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect the first half and second half FFO per share to be generally balanced based on our expectation of relatively flat sequential growth until Q4 with growth resuming that quarter and into 2018, reflecting the full contribution from the cumulative effect of new and expansion leasing. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, in Q3 we have historically seen a seasonal impact related to higher power costs, amounting to approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share. As it relates to our guidance for capital expenditures in 2017, we are decreasing the total expected investment to a range of $250 million to $290 million, from the previous range of $280 million to $310 million. The decrease is based on our outlook for the timing around datacenter expansion investment related to some of the larger development projects across our portfolio. We now expect datacenter expansion investment of $211 million to $239 million compared to the prior range of $241 million to $259 million. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, we commence spending on the project to replace our chiller plant at LA2, which is recorded as recurring capital and deducted from AFFO. While this impacts sequential AFFO growth, we continue to expect this investment to generate a return on investment that is substantially higher than our overall stated return objectives. Now, we’d like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: First question regarding the funnel, it sounded like, Paul in your opening remarks, you talked about an increase and that related to some larger scale deals. Can you maybe offer a little bit more insight in terms of the flavor, the nature of the requirements that you’re seeing out there?
Paul Szurek: Jordan putting it as simply as possible these are higher density requirements but the lot of data in them and a lot of data being either exchanged or pushed out of the network. So there is obviously tremendous operational and cost advantage for processing that much data moving that much data through interconnection as opposed to other ways of doing it from further out datacenters.
Jordan Sadler: Are these cloud service provider oriented or is it just more enterprise?
Paul Szurek: I think it’s a mix. And Steve can shed some more color on it, primarily cloud and content and to a lesser extent, enterprise.
Steve Smith: I would say that cloud content and even enterprise are becoming more and more susceptible to the tolerance of latency, which is becoming less and less by consumers, suppliers and customers, in general. So as that expectation of the general consumer there is more real time, companies are having to solve for that and that involves moving computing data closer to the edge.
Jordan Sadler: Just thoughts on some of the competition that you’re seeing from, if at all, and it may actually be complimentary based on what you’re seeing of the FDNs? I mean, is that helping facilitate some of these lower latency requirements or are they, I guess, complimenting your efforts or are they intersecting it another way?
Paul Szurek: I think they’re generally complimentary to our efforts. Again, the types of deployments that have to go to the edge really have volumes of data that they’re exchanging at much quicker pace that require that close that interconnection as opposed to having to go through different forms of networks, whether their FDN, metro fiber or other ways of moving traffic around between datacenters. Steve, anything you'd add to that?
Steve Smith: No, I'd just echo that, as far as being complementary, I think anytime you give customers choice an ability to access other environments within our data center, that's a good things for those customers. It's good thing for the end customer. And ultimately, that ends up being a good thing for us, because we typically have that compute within our datacenters. So we have many of those SDN providers that have built into our datacenters. And that gives not only customers with their access to those deployments that are there, but also customers that are introduced that may want to access in environments that maybe other places that gives them choice and flexibility as well. So, so far, we've seen it to be very complementary.
Jordan Sadler: And then lastly, on SV8. How do you expect that product to orient itself and be presented to the market? Will that be an opportunity to sign another larger scale deal, do you think? And is there an opportunity to prelease that so far in advance, or will that be more of an extension in the campus and you'd look to build that out a bit more gradually, and just be a source of inventory?
Paul Szurek: Well, predicting that far out is never precise. So I think the simple way to answer it is, it's going to be an extension of a campus. If you look at that campus, historically, it has periodically had opportunities for preleases and there's every reason to believe that that activity maybe available when we bring SV8 to market. Otherwise, we'll continue the mix of scale deployments and transactional deployments that have characterized that campus so far.
Operator: Our next question is from Dave Rogers from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave Rogers: One of the follow-up, obviously, a lot of questions or comments this quarter around enterprise and the strength in enterprise; and I just wanted to maybe understand better if there was a shift in terms of how you're thinking about it internally from enterprise as a cloud customer or cloud being categorized now under enterprise in the sense of what the customer is doing in that space. And I guess maybe the broader question is are you seeing a slowdown in the cloud activity and enterprise is taking over, or is it one quarter doesn't make a trend? Just any color there would be helpful.
Paul Szurek: Just to give you a bit of clarity there and maybe just doesn't help on the clarity, because I think what you're seeing is that many content customers are also cloud customers and many cloud customers are also content customers; and that leaves open to tradition enterprise even. So what you're seeing is a lot of customers leveraging technology differently that bleeds those verticals a bit. So I think that's part of what you're seeing as far as how we categorize them. But as far as overall demand in the marketplace, we're still seeing very strong demand from the traditional enterprise, it's collocating. We do see greater adoption as you've seen from the cloud providers and those enterprises going to the cloud, but we still see plenty of run way for those enterprises to come into our data centers. And especially as you like to medium to large enterprise, there'll be plenty of opportunity ahead of us that’s not necessarily a feasible or a very quick journey for them to move entirely through that model.
Dave Rogers: With regard to revenues and maybe a follow-up on the prior question. Paul, you talked in the prepared comments I think as well as in that answer about higher density. Are we seeing that come through the average rate, has it being masked in any way? And maybe second revenue question for Jeff. How much of that was reserved capacity that you recorded in the quarter in terms of signings?
Paul Szurek: The reserve capacity was not material. And obviously for accurate disclosure, we’ve excluded that from the rate category. Density does have some impact on rate per square foot and we like and have set ourselves up to accommodate higher density requirements for that purpose. We tend to look at pricing overall on quarter-to-quarter on an apples-to-apples basis, we breakout by categories of deployment size and markets and density. And when you look at all of that together, the net pricing seem to be about 11% quarter-over-quarter. So there is more than just increased density that’s driving the price increases.
Jeff Finnin: Dave, just to clarify, as Paul just related to that 11% increase would strip out some of the wholesale deals we did. Because those just aren’t comparatively quarter-to-quarter and that 11% is on a trailing -- compared to the trailing 12 months basis.
Dave Rogers: Maybe last from me I think the one market you didn’t talk about Paul in the comments, if I missed it, was Chicago. Is it just that you’re not seeing the opportunity, the ability to get into more land there? Or are the opportunities just in LA with the resurgence there just taking precedence in your mind?
Paul Szurek: No, we continue to look for expansion capacity. In Chicago, we expect that over the next couple of three years, our customers in our existing Chicago facility are going to need that and will drive other opportunities. We continue to work on some opportunities there and we just don’t have anything that is ready to announce. But that’s a good market and we’ve got a good data centre that’s performing well in that market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: It looks like there is a variety of projects that got pushed out of quarter, so whether those were -- some of those are supposed to open up in the 2017 period or some in late ’17 that are now opening up in ’18. I’m curious if what’s behind is, is it simply just coincidental that there is so many of them this particular quarter that got pushed out. And when you look at the amount of money you’re spending in terms of CapEx for the projects that are anticipated to open up in 2018. Well, I appreciate it’s still early. Any thoughts on what CapEx could look like next year? It seems like it could be down again next year versus 2017. And then also on rest and I think everybody is looking to see when you guys signed in anchor tenant deal, that’s expected to open up in the fourth quarter this year. You mentioned I think that the funnel is pretty strong. Is it fair to assume that we’ll most likely see something in the third quarter? Thank you.
Paul Szurek: I think it’s mostly coincidental that some projects got pushed back quarter, and I think it’s partly coincidental that we had so many projects going on at the same time. One of the attractions of our markets is that the regulatory and entitlement process create barriers to entry. And although that’s a pain in the neck in the short-term that sometime it takes longer to get permits and entitlements than it does in other markets. We’ve all seen that in every real estate product that creates value for the long term, because the local government provides one of those barriers to entry to new product. So that’s mostly what we have seen with these deployments. I don’t view it as a big deal, but we just try to keep everybody informed about it.
Jeff Finnin: The other question was related to 2018 CapEx. And Colby, I guess the thing that I would think about, as you think about CapEx levels for 2018, is just take a look at the more recent three year trend in terms of what our annual CapEx has been, that’s going to give you some level of inside into what that might possibly be for 2018. But at this point, we’re just not ready to give any specific guidance on 2018 CapEx.
Paul Szurek: And I wouldn’t draw too many conclusions though. We do have, as you know, a couple of larger projects that depending on when permitting and entitlement is completed could start construction in 2018 at some point as well that we mentioned in both the press release and in our scripts.
Jeff Finnin: And then Colby if I wrote down your question correctly your third question was related to VA3 and how are we doing in terms of progress for lease up for developments coming online there. And Paul and Steve could probably give you some color on that.
Paul Szurek: So I do want to point out that we’ve got two components to VA3. We’ve got the 3 megawatt build out of an existing computer room that we’re really targeting to be more for the transactional and smaller deployments and then the larger 6 megawatt building that would cover more scale deployments. We can't provide -- I don’t want to predict the future with any grade certainly. But yes, we’ve got a lot of good discussions going on and I would expect some announcement some time later this year if those discussions continue to proceed at pace.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: So couple of questions, one on markets that you’re in that a lot of your peers are, Dallas and Portland and just kind of an update on how you view the pros and cons of inorganic growth, maybe greenfield to brownfield developments in those metros. Secondly, probably for Steve but just maybe an update on sales headcount trends and how much of your leasing recently has been due to direct versus indirect sales channel contributions? And then I was curious about SV3 in the backfill, the prospects of backfill. Is that going to be scale deployments retail and how the technical attributes to that site compare to SV7?
Paul Szurek: Let me take the first and the last question and then Steve will address the second one. We look at every opportunity that makes at the triage to expand into other big markets. Now the thing that we repeated in the past and is worth completing here is that we really like big markets with a lot of business activity. Our current eight markets are 20% of the U.S. population, 27% of U.S. GDP and have a much higher level of business activity and data intensive activity than the typical market. There are other markets that meet those categories. Our business model, as you know is successful, primarily because we're able to merry up a network dense node with scalable interconnection ability within the campus or building environment. And that makes the screen a little bit finer for new opportunities, but those are the opportunities that, like our current portfolio, create the best long term sustainable value. And so that's what we look for. And so far we've seen only Denver work is expanded into or have that opportunity, but we continue to look for that in other areas. I do think we can bring some tools to the tables that are not generally out there. We have in a couple of three instances been able to create network dense nodes where they did not exist before. And so that's an opportunity we might bring to bear in another market if we can find the right price point and size to enter and have visibility to scale at attractive returns. So I hope that helps answer that question. On SV3, I just want to remind you that we didn't actually have a tenant move out of SV3 that is the payments from the original tenant at SV3 that they paid out as part of their moving out of that space. SV3 is pretty fully occupied right now. Technologically, it's in the same category as everything else on the Santa Clara campus.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul. And Jonathan just to answer your question and relative to sales headcount and trending and so forth, we've been roughly at the same headcount, little bit of fluctuation throughout the year and for the last year and a half, I guess. But overall, we haven't had any major changes as far as headcount is concerned, a few changes here and there as you would expect in any sales organization. But overall, we've been fairly stable and really just working towards getting our talent better-and-better every year, our skill level better every year and just get better utilization out of the people that we do have, which kind of leans through the second part of your question, which I think was around direct versus indirect and channel. And that ratio typically is up 10% to 20% of our overall sales as far as the indirect channel is concerned. We do look to try to leverage that and getting additional value and getting deeper and wider within our accounts and markets. And we'll continue to do that. But that's strictly opportunistic and that's off pay our resources that we try to leverage and represent itself, and as the value presents itself. So continues to be a focus and we’ll leverage it as best we can.
Jonathan Atkin: And then last question is on artificial intelligence. And I don't know if this ties into the power density comments earlier or not. But to what extent are you seeing that as a current absorber of market capacity overall for the industry, or driving RFP activity or is that kind of more on the come. And do you see that as from what you understand that AI. Is that performance sensitive, meaning that it needs house in major metros, or is it may be less performance sensitive, more computing sensitive in secondary markets? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Jonathan I’ll start with that and then Steve can chime in, if he has anything to add. I think that product category is in early stages, but there is definitely elements of it that are data and compute and performance sensitive, where the insides generated from the AI algorithms lose value if there is too much latency and are responding and reacting to so much data exchange that interconnection is valuable. At this point, I can't really predict how large that opportunity becomes, but it does seem promising at this point for the future.
Steve Smith: And I would agree with you Paul. And depending upon how AI is a pretty broad bucket and how it's defined. But I think if you look at some of the most obvious examples of that and the terms of automated vehicles and so forth, that obviously is very latency sensitive, and these make decisions quickly and react quickly. So we’ve had several examples of startups and so forth that our deployment in our datacenters because of need for latency as well as scalability. And I think you just have to look deeper as to the use case and the need for that latency. But I think inherently as you look at intelligence and being able to make smarter decisions quicker, that brings with it the need for low latency and speed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Gutman from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Robert Gutman: In light of the high growth in interconnection year-over-year, I was wondering if you could provide some incremental color on some of the applications that are driving that. And just some greater detail on whether true sustainable at this level as its really above our guidance range for the year?
Jeff Finnin: Rob, it's Jeff. Let me just give you some commentary around that as you probably saw. Obviously, the revenue this report this quarter was up 18.1% year-over-year. If you look at the underlying volumes where we’re seeing particular strength are those deployments where people want to be connected to the cloud environments. And if you just look at the overall volume increase going to and connecting with our cloud customers, it's probably 3x what it is in general of the portfolio overall. It gives some idea of what's going on there. Obviously, in some of the commentary I gave around guidance, our initial guidance range of 13% to 16% for the year given that we’re year-to-date at 16%. And we expect that to be at the upper end of that range. But we’ll see how the second half of the year migrates here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Frank Louthan: You mentioned a couple of markets you said were seemed a bit constrained even. What are the pricing trends there? And do you expect that -- how long do you expect that to be the case? And are you seeing anyone acting irrationally in any of your markets. How would you characterize the mindset of some of your competitors you see in the markets? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Let me address the second question first. We have not seen any irrational behavior. Just to give an example of market, Northern Virginia has seen the most development activity. As I mentioned in my remarks, there is significant new development going on there. But most of it, to our knowledge, is preleased. And I suspect there is probably some leases out there that we’re not aware of that takes the member up higher. But even if, if you look out going forward, if the only amounts in that market that are under construction that are preleased or what we think we know about that might move the vacancy rate. And there is no other change in absorption that might move the vacancy rate by the end of the year, early next year from like maybe 8% to 11%, so not a huge move. But given our own funnel in that area, my guess is there is probably more leasing going on and we are aware of in other areas with other companies. So not seeing any place in any of our markets where development behavior concerns me. In the constrained markets, there has been some pricing uplift. I think that’s reflected in our overall number of 11% that Jeff and I sighted to you earlier. But the pricing uplift is, I would say, measured as opposed to dramatic. There is this one phenomenon that goes into the datacenter industry that we see from time to time, which is that sometimes markets have to have a little bit of supply or latent supply in order to attract more demand. And so constrained markets tend to see things balanced out a little bit more than you would than you would see in other real estate markets where people just don’t have any choice about when they move into something.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
Andrew DeGasperi: I'm not sure if you already touched on this. But you mentioned the $30 million guidance on lease commencements for this year. If my guess is correct, you are about 22 if include the backlog that you expect to realize. Is that a conservative number? And then secondly, can you just let us know what the timing is around the LA3 property and when you’re going to bring that online? Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Andy, let me take the first part of that question and then Paul can add some commentary on the second one. But you’re right. We have given some earlier guidance around commencements for the year of about $30 million. And you can look at where we are year-to-date at 15.7 and we said that the backlog about 40% of that would commence. So you’re directionally you’re fairly close in terms of where we expect or at least what we have visibility into. We’re right around 20, just north of $20 million. And so while we believe, obviously, we’ve got the second half of the year, we’ve got some visibility in what we think that will be if I had to even amount I would say would be at or slightly ahead of the $30 million guidance we gave earlier this year. Hopefully, that helps.
Paul Szurek: Andrew, in terms of the next building in LA, little bit hard to predict just because again that’s one of those infill markets where the path of entitlements and permitting is not clearly definable. But I would say that best case it would be first quarter of 2019. And then when it actually comes on board in 2019 and when we actually start it, depends on that permitting process. And frankly, the continuation of strong demand in the Los Angeles market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi Research. Please go ahead.
Michael Rollins: Just have couple of questions, if I could. First, when you look at the cost of building out new datacenter development. Over the last few years, do you see that as inflationary in terms of the component cost versus technology, which is generally deflationary? Just want to get a sense of how do you look at those build costs overtime? And then secondly, if you could just talk a little bit further about what you described as demand closer to the edge. And so what's that doing to demand for market away from the edge? And how does that affect pricing and value for those types of markets versus the ones that you're seeing more favorable demand? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: The cost of building generally has been stable, modest inflation, components, not as much. Like everyone in construction, labor has been where you've seen the biggest inflation. The component of that relative to overall cost is much more percentage in datacenters, which are very equipment intensive than it is in other product. So we haven't seen that turn into a real problem. At the same time, we continue to do it all our peers do, and I give Brian Warren, our SVP of Engineering, Construction and his team a lot of credit for continuing to develop improvements in our processes and our designs, in the way we do our construction to deliver, to keep our price per kilowatt at a very good level. So don't see any big area of concern there. The things that are driving demand closer to the edge and there're a couple of good articles out there and that summarizes and it’s supplemented extensively by what we see in our own deployments and the companies that come to us for the space. We've always -- performance, latency has always been an issue for many. I mean some products, especially if they’re going to consumers and businesses. They have to have very good latency in order to be successful; think about ecommerce, video streaming, video on demand all those sort of things. And frankly more-and-more cloud -- some cloud development compute platforms and others, the customers they're serving are latency sensitive. But there's another factor that has emerged that I think is gaining an importance and maybe becoming as important as latency. And that's just the sheer volume of data for particular applications that need to be crunched very quickly and exchanged with customers and other peers pretty quickly. And that just creates engineering challenges for doing that thing further away from the edge, further away from the network node and in an environment where you’ve got to go, worse case over the Internet, best case over some type of WAN process. But we're even like 10 milliseconds of delay and how these thousands of transactions get processed or data exchanges get processed can really clog that performance. And that data intensity is what's driving more -- has driven some of the good traffic we've seen in these larger scale deployments at the edge nodes lately, as much as -- may be as much as the performance sensitivity. And we have seen we have customers that have moved deployments from lower cost places further away into our datacenters in order to overcome both the cost and the operating inefficiencies of exchanging that data outside an interconnected environment.
Steve Smith: I would agree with that Paul. And I think the only thing I would add to that is mobile traffic is also a huge contributor to that as you see more and more mobile device and doesn’t where you walk down the street or airplanes or anywhere else, everyone’s got a mobile device. And you see a lot of video streaming that’s happening on those, which drives this huge amount of data. And so having that data and throughput closer to where those mobile networks interconnect is also critical in order to get that performance level up, whether it's a content provider or cloud provider, or even an enterprise. There is a balance that they work and it’s a math equation on their end to figure out latency relative to constants and support to that deployment. So you have seen, even in some cases, some of these other providers moving into secondary markets and where it justifies that cost and expense. But in the markets that we're in, it’s a fairly easy math problem to compute, given the number of eyeballs and networks and demand that’s there for them to establish those points of presence.
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Heinz from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz: I'm curious just about the engineering challenges. May be for some of the order or more highly connected edge co-lo sites as you're referring to the power density requirements going up. Do you feel that some of these order buildings are properly equipped to handle denser requirements not only now but where you anticipate they could go? And I guess what impact did this have the economics generally across the industry, because we see upward pressure on maintenance or upgrade expenditures for new power and cooling systems as this trend potentially continues and accelerates.
Paul Szurek: Well, I think the old carrier tells and the traditional network dense nodes and office buildings are always going to have their core and faithful customers who will deploy in those environments, equipment of density that those environments can handle. But they are constrained that’s why we develop the campus model to interconnect with some of our network nodes directly. For loading requirements in some of those older office building don’t allow for as much density, the heavier racks, heavier servers. There are also harder to cool efficiently. They are not raised for environments, so you’re flooding the computer rooms with cold there generally. There is not as much as you can do with hot and cold aisle containment; although, we do as much as we can in our facilities like that. So as the actual data intensely and the amount of cash of storage and compute that you need at the edge that goes along with those network nodes grows and requires more density. The scalable options that we provide in our campus environments where they are purpose built, they are raised for environments, you can put -- it's easier to put in cold aisle containment, we can drive PUV down. And the fur loading is not an issue they serve a real purpose million that’s -- we tried to explain and maybe haven’t done a good job. But that’s driven a lot of our growth is our ability to provide that type of more efficient more dense environment close to these traditional network nodes where target create that kind of density and that kind of power and cooling efficiency. But I still think, we still continue to see strong demand for deployments of smaller types of broader enterprise and networks, and then some of the companies that use networks extensively in those network nodes, in those traditional carrier hotel buildings.
Steve Smith: Matt, in regards to the second part of your question, in terms of capital cost for recurring maintenance. I think the important aspect to think about, if you just look at us historically, we’ve been -- our recurring CapEx has been anywhere between 1.5% to 2% of revenues. While that’s all, you and the street have visibility until we continue to think about the best way to think of that is on a per kilowatt basis. Having said that, we don’t give visibility into that, so it's hard really for you guys to gauge what that’s going to be. But I would think, as we look forward and based on some of the experience we’ve seen for 2017, a range as a percentage of revenue of 1.5% to 2.5% is probably reasonable range to think about for CoreSite. I don’t think that helps meaningfully but it is something that we think about in terms of the go forward modeling, et cetera. So hopefully that helps.
Paul Szurek: I would like to add on that, because as Steve mentioned of the core chiller replacement in some reports. And again, put the blame on us for not explaining that more carefully. We did not have to replace all those chillers that we’re replacing this year. Those are multiple units of chillers that could have been replaced over the next two to four years and what kept our CapEx expenditures in line with historical averages. However, we had the opportunity to do something totally different, which was combined all of them instead of replacing them with more small chillers combine all of them in a single large chiller plant that serves other space as well; and is so much more power efficient that the return on investment on just rolling these into this bigger project is probably higher than anything else in our portfolio. Whereas if we just follow the traditional method of replacing them, each of them as they got to end of life, we would not have that opportunity to achieve that power efficiency, because there's still physical limitations on how power efficient a smaller chiller can be. So I know that to be pure on the AFFO count and we put that in the right bucket for recurring CapEx. But it has a tremendous return associated with it, and continues our path that we pursue aggressively towards more power efficiency.
Matthew Heinz: Do you think they're ahead of your peers on replacing some of the equipment or upgrading some of the equipment that you think will drive added advantage?
Paul Szurek: Honestly, I can't say anything about that because I don't really have visibility into what they're doing. I'm guessing that part of the reason our release results are so good is that our PUE is at least viewed as not a negative, maybe it's viewed as a positive. But I just really don’t know how to compare with peers on that point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Lukas Hartwich: Net neutrality seems like its back in the public debate again. I'm just curious what CorSite's stance is on that issue?
Paul Szurek: From which perspective, Lukas?
Lukas Hartwich: I guess are you on the side of the more of the tech industry and pushing for the net neutrality provisions, or are you more on the side of the, sounds like the current Chairman of the FCC pushing to revoke those -- I think entitled to?
Paul Szurek: So the last time I've actually spoken to a politician or a federal regulator might have been a decade and a half ago. So I think that the simple answer is that there're a lot of people working through this. However, it turns out its probably fine for us either way. We didn't see a big change when net neutrality was implemented by the prior FCC Chairman and I don't expect we'll see a big change if that gets unwound in the current or is being unwound in the current administration. So I hope that's -- that’s as response that I can give to your question.
Lukas Hartwich: And then another just kind of housekeeping question, the new development in LA2. The cost basis looks pretty low, 376 square foot. I'm just curious what's going on there?
Paul Szurek: Well, because we've got a lot of core and sell in other system is already in place.
Lukas Hartwich: Is that in incremental CapEx?
Steve Smith: Yes, that's correct. That's just in the incremental component and obviously leveraging off of the investment we made several years ago there as well, Lukas.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Paul Szurek for any closing comments.
Paul Szurek: I just like to close, thanking my colleagues for another good quarter. All, Steven and Jeff and I know we're very fortunate to have an outstanding team that works hard every day to take the care of our customers and create value for our shareholders. And I'd like to thank all of you that are on this call for your interest in the Company and thank you, especially to those who asked questions so that we have the opportunity to answer them. I hope you all have a great rest of your day. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-04-27 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Greer Aviv. Thank you. You may begin.
Greer Aviv: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to CoreSite's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer.

And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm glad to share our first quarter financial and operational results with you as well as to update you on our markets and our outlook on supply and demand. Our momentum from the fourth quarter continued and we started the year strongly. Financial results for the quarter reflect continued steady growth with year-over-year increases of revenue of 24% while adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share grew 33% and 31% year-over-year respectively. Importantly in Q1 we continue to execute our business objectives and we were able to further increase efficiency and effectiveness across our organization. Leasing activity was very solid in the first quarter with new and expansion sales of nearly $10 million which was well distributed across each of our network, cloud service and enterprise verticals. Steve will provide greater detail around the compositions of our new and expansion leasing. We are pleased with the pace, pricing in terms of our sales in Q1. As we have said in previous communications, our business model is dedicated on the strength and attractiveness of our markets and the quality of our assets in those markets. The eight large cities in which we operate represent approximately 20% of U.S. population, 27% of GDP and the lion's share of data intensive business and consumer needs generating exceptional demand for performance and proximity sensitive co-location requirements. Our assets in these large edged markets are tailored for these high value data needs. They are all well positioned at key intersection of the Internet, our network and interconnection dense [ph] and have large customer ecosystems including native access to strategic public cloud on ramps. We continue to benefit from our considerable scale in each of our markets affording us the ability to deploy exceptional local go-to-market teams that provide a hands-on service intense customer experience. Our scale in each market also supports strong local facilities management leadership infrastructure capabilities. Our campuses provide scalable and flexible solutions that allow us to accommodate a great diversity of increasingly sophisticated and dynamic customer needs as our [ph] network architecture continues to evolve and require compute, storage, caching and interconnection at the edge. Our existing customer ecosystems are thriving and generating new demand; we see this most clearly by looking at new logo growth as we work to identify and to track new customers that can add value to the ecosystem. In the first quarter we added 32 new logos, 84% of which were enterprises which are attracted to the established network and cloud density available across our portfolio. As a result of these market and scale dynamics, we continue to see considerable growth opportunities within our existing markets and campuses. We have in-flight $84.6 billion of new computer room construction. We have also commenced construction on the first phase of our rest in campus expansion. In order to keep up with a strong sales funnel in that market we are building a 25,000 square foot three megawatt computer room in one of the existing buildings on our new property at a budgeted cost of $22 million which we expect to complete early in the fourth quarter. We will also commence construction in the middle of the year on a central infrastructure building and a new six megawatt data center building which collectively are budgeted to cost $85 million and be completed in the second quarter of 2018. Please remember that all these buildings are in very close proximity and connected by diverse fiber pass to our existing rest and data centers and interconnection node and our public cloud on ramps. We have expansion capacity in almost all of our other markets; including Virginia we have entitled capacity to expand our portfolio square footage by 65% and we also have additional land which we believe can be entitled for expansion. We will continue our ongoing program to identify and acquire more expansion that's in our markets to keep abreast of demand. As part of that initiative we recently signed a contract to acquire a two acre land parcel with a 30,000 square foot industrial building we will raise immediately adjacent to our existing Santa Clara campus. The purchase is subject to customary due diligence, much of which we've enabled to complete prior to signing. We estimate that we could build approximately 160,000 square feet of new data center capacity on this partial comprising 18 megawatts at full build out. We currently anticipate closing on the land in the third quarter of 2017. We estimate the cost of the land, building, and first phase of computer rooms including cost associated with design entitlement and permitting to be approximately $118 million. We are pleased to have this path towards expanding our very successful Santa Clara campus and the customer ecosystem thereon where approximately 81,000 square feet remains in our current inventory. Across our markets demand remains healthy for high performance low latency co-location solutions while supply remains generally consistent with demand. We are seeing consistent demand and a healthy balance with supply in Los Angeles as minimal new supply has been brought online over the last two years and churn at other data center operators has only modestly increased supply. The steady pace of absorption in this market supports the growth of our L.A. two facility with an additional 41,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity now under construction. This incremental inventory will ensure we are well positioned to keep pace with demand in the market and what we view as a solid funnel and favorable pricing dynamics. In the Bay area, similar to last quarter, inventory across the market remains constrained and pricing remains positive. New capacity is coming online though a substantial amount of it appears to be preleased and targeted to large wholesale. Despite the new supply, we expect the market to continue to be supply constrained in 2017, particularly as it relates to requirements for scalable network and interconnection dense deployments. Regarding Northern Virginia and D.C. demand continues to be strong following a record year of absorption in 2016. Occupancy rates remain high in this market and new and potential supply seems concentrated on the large wholesale market and it appears that a good amount of the new supply is pre-leased. We are excited about our opportunities in this market and in the downtown Washington D.C. market due to the strong demand and a more limited supply for small, medium-sized and scalable performance and interconnection sensitive requirements, especially those seeking diversity from Ashburton [ph]. Finally in the New York/New Jersey market, we are encouraged by another sequential uptick in the face of leasing with 20 new and expansion leases signed in Q1, more than 60% above the trailing 12-month average. Leasing at NY-2 was quite robust accounting for two-thirds of leases executed, and the majority of new logo signed in this market. As we continue to support a growing community of enterprises, domestic and international carriers, and leading cloud providers; we see a steady stream of leasing activity amongst smaller customer deployments which is weighted toward the enterprise vertical including financial services and healthcare organization. We continue to feel good about the funnel in the New York/New Jersey market. To wrap up, the first quarter again demonstrated our consistent execution, both financially and operationally. We will continue to differentiate core site with our large edge market focus and our hybrid approach providing both scalability and flexibility to our customers based on their changing needs. We will remain focused on bringing additional capacity online in our markets to meet customer demand and accommodate ecosystem growth. As we look ahead, we believe that we have a compelling opportunity to continue to drive strong internal growth from our existing assets and to effectively develop new asset to meet growing demand or generating attractive returns for our shareholders. With that I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks Paul. I will begin by reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activity during the first quarter, and then discuss in more detail our vertical and geographic results. Our Q1 new and expansion sales totaled $9.7 million in annualized GAAP comprised of 46,500 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $209 per square foot. This rate is 5.5% above the trailing 12-month average, primarily due to higher deployment signed during the quarter. We have seen a modest uptick in the average density over the past three quarters and we normalized for density, the Q1 rate was in-line with the trailing 12-month average. Regarding the composition of our new and expansion leasing by size of deployment, leases signed at 5,000 square feet or less totaled $6.3 million at annualized effort signed in Q1. During the first quarter was signed two leases greater than 5,000 square feet each which included net expansion of existing strategic customer. We continue to be encouraged by strong network and cloud service provider demand which we believe create stability and long-term attractiveness for our ecosystem and is synergistic with enterprises looking to either outsource their IT infrastructure or support a hybrid multi-cloud deployment. Since our view that these diverse and highly interconnected customer communities across our platform continue to attract new logos to our data centers. When looking at geographic distribution, 88% of the new logo sold in Q1 were deployed across our four largest markets. As it relates to our vertical distribution, 84% of those new logos were in the enterprise vertical. This group of new enterprise customers includes a multi-site gaming platform, a multinational mass media corporation, a multinational law firm, and a British visual effects company. Net of customer churn, we added 60 new logos in Q1. In addition to our solid new and expansion leasing, renewals in Q1 resulted in approximately 95,000 total square feet renewing at an annualized GAAP rate of $146 per square foot, 6% below the trailing 12-month average primarily due to a specific low density customer renewing in the Los Angeles market. Our renewal pricing reflects mark to market growth of 1.9% on a cash basis and 5.5% on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, we expect cash rent growth of approximately 3% for 2017 to be modestly weighted towards the second half of the year. Churn in the first quarter was 1.1%, in-line with the lower end of our historical quarterly average of 1% to 2%. Supported by our success with the small to medium-sized transactions I discussed earlier; interconnection revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q1 reflecting total volume growth of 10%. Volume was comprised of a 15% increase in cyber cost-connect [ph]. We remain encouraged by the demand outlook for interconnection services and the value they bring to our customers. These services enable customers to provide a low latency performance, needless to support a multi-cloud, IT architecture is required to better serve their own customers, suppliers and employees in this increasingly performance sensitive digital economy. As such we continue to enhance our go-to-market strategy to drive awareness of the unique value that our customer ecosystem delivers within our data centers. Enabled by the course community which provides dynamic web-enabled interface, customers can learn of other service providers; how they can benefit from one another and engage easily just for their IT strategy. These services include number providers, thought on [ph] ramps, maintenance service providers, and software providers; just to name a few. With respect to vertical mix with our ecosystem, during Q1 networking cloud customers accounted for 9% and 36% of annualized signed respectively. Specific to the cloud vertical, we continue to see strong momentum with three new logos including the cloud-based on-demand platform serving the financial services industry, as well as a cyber-security managed services organization. In addition, during the quarter we signed an expansion with a strategic customer in Northern Virginia and a software-driven cloud networking solutions provider expanded its footprint with us to the point of private [indiscernible]. The network vertical had a strong first quarter driven primarily by expansions of existing customers. Networks are continuing to grow and expand within existing building and deploying that the new buildings with us. So they see an increase in end-customer requirements from our growing ecosystem. Demand was broad based as we start, network providers expand with us in nearly every market in which we operate. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, this vertical accounted for 54% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the first quarter. Performance was driven by expansions with managed service providers and digital media companies with several new logos and the media and entertainment space. We signed a sizable expansion with a global content delivery network for live streaming and other web-based content, and expansion with a leading online video game platform and an expansion with a global systems integrator supporting a critical public sector service. We're pleased to see continued momentum and diversity within the enterprise vertical as these companies look to rearchitect their IT requirements around hybrid cloud deployment. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed and new and expansion leases during Q1 with Northern Virginia D.C., Los Angeles, Silicon Valley collectively representing 87% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. In Northern Virginia D.C., the pace of leasing remains robust with continued strong demand from smaller requirements and one large lease signed in Q1. As we have seen in recent quarters, [indiscernible] remains strong with these customers accounting for nearly 60% of leases executed and substantially all of the new logos signed in Northern Virginia D.C. Stabilizes occupancy in this market now stands at 96.4%, an increase of 30 basis points on a sequential basis given the number of commitments occurring across the campus during Q1. Demand in our Los Angeles market continues to be steady driven by demand from smaller customer requirements, as well as expansions of existing customers. Demand in L.A. was skewed towards our LA-2 facility with leases signed at this building accounting for 77% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the market. The strength of our sales pacing at LA-2 reflects the success of our overarching baseline strategy which is to leverage the value of our legacy, low latency and network dense facilities such as LA-1 that are then redundantly connected by high account dark fiber providing not only high performance but also increased flexibility and scalability to support the higher density requirements of today's workloads. In terms of verticals, enterprise was our strongest in this market followed by network and cloud. Stabilized occupancy in the Los Angeles campus was 92.5% at the end of Q1 down 10 basis points from Q4. Activity in the Bay Area was strong with leases executed at all of our available multi-tenant data centers in the market. Demand for our new turnkey data center tested as we said and was particularly strong, the leasing of this building accounting for approximately 90% of annualized GAAP rent started in the Bay Area in Q1, as customers take advantage of the low latency, high performance access to the network and cloud in enterprise community, we have developed on static their campus and across the Silicon Valley market. In terms of verticals Q1 lease executions in this market were again weighted towards cloud followed by enterprise appointments [ph]. Stabilized occupancy across our Silicon Valley campuses decrease 40 basis point to 96.3% due to some modest churn in Q1 and Q2. In summary, 2017 is up to a solid start in terms of leasing activity and the continued maturation of our customer ecosystem. We believe we are well positioned to continue to gain market share on the performance sensitive side of the market given our scalable, flexible mix of available capacity, significant network and cloud density and a differentiated customer experience. I will now turning the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thank Steve, and hello everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q1 financial results followed by an update on our development CapEx and our leverage in liquidity capacity. I will then conclude my remarks with an update on our 2017 guidance. Q1 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues $114.9 million a 4% increase on the sequential quarter basis and 24.3% increase year-over-year. Q1 operating revenue consisted of $95.1 million in rental and power revenue from data center space up 3.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 25.2% year-over-year. In our connection services revenue contributed $14.5 million to operating revenues in Q1 an increase of 3.8% on a sequential quarter basis and 13.9% year-over-year, in tenant reimbursement and other revenues were $2.3 million. Office and light industrial revenue was $3 million, which includes revenue associated with the rest and campus expansion. Q1 FFO was a $1.13 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 6.6% on a sequential quarter basis and a 31.4% increase year-over-year. The strength in FFO was due in part to better than expected rental revenue following a year of record commencements in 2016 and better than expected flow through to adjusted EBITDA resulting in better margins. Adjusted EBITDA $64.4 million increase to 6.2% on a sequential quarter basis and 32.8% over the same quarter last year. We continue to expand our margins with our adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 54% measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q1 2017. This represents an increase of 260 basis points over the comparable year ago period. Related trailing 12 months revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 67% and 60% respectively. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter totaled $4.5 million or 3.9% of total operating revenues down 70 basis points year-over-year. In general and administrative expenses were $8.1 million in Q1 correlating to 7.1 % of total operating revenues, a decrease of 230 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a benefit of approximately $0.01 per share related to annual compensation true ups [ph]. Now turning to our same store metrics. Q1 same store turnkey data center occupancy increased 430 basis points to 90.9% from 86.6% in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, same store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 7.3% year-over-year and 0.5% sequentially to $1,439. On a per unit basis, the largest contributor to the year-over-year growth in our MRR per cabinet growth in power revenue, followed by interconnection and rent growth. Keep in mind that our same store pool is redefined annually in the first quarter, and the 2017 pool only includes turnkey datacenter space that was leased or available to be leased to our co-location customers as of December 31, 2015, at each of our properties and excludes powered shell datacenter space. We commence a 37,000 net rental square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $244 per square foot, which represents $9.1 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the first quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 94.7% an increase of 20 basis points compared to the fourth quarter and an increase of 410 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016, reflecting the record level of leases that commenced during 2016. Turning now the backlog. Projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was 5.6 million as of March 31, 2017 fairly consistent with where we ended the year and $15.7 million on a cash basis. We expect substantially all of the GAAP backlog to commence during the remainder of 2017. Turning to our development activity. We had a total of 116,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity under construction as of March 31, 2017. With development and expansion projects Northern Virginia, Washington D.C, Los Angeles, Denver and Boston. As of the end of the first quarter, we had spent $16.9 million of the estimated $106.9 million required to complete the project. As shown on Page 21 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized in Q1 was 9.9%, for 2017, we continue to expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 10% to 15%. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2017 our ratio of net principal debt to Q1 analyze adjusted EBITDA was 2.8 times, including preferred stock the ratio was 3.2 times slightly below where we ended the year. Including preferred stock the Q1 leverage in adjusted EBITDA levels provide capacity for an additional $195 million of debt assuming a four times debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. With that in mind, last week we closed two separate financing transactions, resulting in additional liquidity of $275 million modestly above the amount we targeted given the lender demand in economics. The first transaction results in an incremental $100 million of liquidity by expanding in existing senior unsecured term loans, originally scheduled to mature in 2019 to a total of $200 million. The expanded term loan has a new five-year term maturing in April of 2022. In addition, we successfully raised $175 million through a private placement bond offering, priced with a 3.91% coupon. The execution of the expanded term loan and private placement offering allows us to improve our overall liquidity position, manage our debt maturity profile and maintain both financial flexibility and a balance between fixed and variable price instruments in our capital structure. The proceeds of both transactions were used to pay down all outstanding amounts on the revolving portion of our existing credit facility providing approximately $362 million of available liquidity to fund our growth and development plan. Now in closing, I would like to address our updated guidance for 2017. I would remind you that our guidance reflects our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on Page 23 of our Q1 earning supplemental, our guidance for 2017 is as followed. Total operating revenue is now estimated to be $472 million to $482 million, compared to the previous range of $470 to $480mmillion based on the midpoint of guidance this implies 90.1% year-over-year revenue growth. Keep in mind that our revenue guidance is dependent upon the power product composition of deployments within our portfolio, and how quickly the larger, metered power deployments install their infrastructure and ramp into their associated power requirements. As relates to interconnection revenue growth, we continue to expect the 2017 revenue growth rate to be between 13% and 16%. General and administrative expenses are now expected to be $35 million to $37 million or approximately 7.5% of total operating revenue. This correlates to an approximate 2% increase in G&A expenses over 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be $256.5 million to $260.5 million up from the prior range of $253 million to $258 million. This correlates to 22% year-over-year growth based on the midpoint of the range and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 54.3% and revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 61%. FFO was estimated to be $4.35 to $4.45 per share and OP unit compared to the previous guidance of $4.25 to $4.35 per share, an increase of 2.3% at the midpoint. This implies 18.6% year-over-year FFO growth, based on the midpoint of the range and the $3.71 per share we reported in 2016. In addition, due to the completed financings we expect FFO per share result to be fairly balanced in the first and second halves of the year, and therefore FFO growth to be weighted toward the first half of the year. We also anticipate this to result in a decreased revenue flow through to FFO, which we estimate at approximately 45% based on the midpoint of our updated 2017 FFO guidance. As relates to our guidance for capital expenditures in 2017. We are increasing the total expected investment to a range of $280 million to $310 million from the previous range of $243 to $271 million, the biggest drivers of this increase are increased data center expansion investment, which we now anticipate to be $241 million to $259 million, compared to the prior range of $212 to 228 million. As Paul mentioned this updated range includes the first two phases of expansion in Reston, additional turnkey data center capacity at L.A-2 to support demand in that market and the acquisition costs associated with the land under contract in Santa Clara for our build out of S.B8. In addition, we are increasing our expected investment in recurring capital expenditures to a range of $21 million to $25 million from the prior range of $13 million to $17 million, this represents a significant increase from the 2016 level and a substantially higher level than we expect to spend in subsequent years on average. The increase in 2017 is largely driven by the opportunity we had to replace our chiller plant that existed when we originally purchased L.A2 upon deciding to commence the build out of incremental capacity on our fourth floor. The new equipment is more energy efficient and with the economies of scale from the new construction, it made sense to combine the replacement of the older equipment in this project. The older equipment was originally scheduled to be replaced in 2019, and was accelerated due to the cost savings and our continuing pursuit of improved PUE. This incremental capital investment will also provide a return on investment that is substantially higher than our overall stated return objectives in criteria. Now we'd like to open the call to questions, operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions].
Paul Szurek: While Audrey is pulling for questions, I just wanted to comment very quickly on the fact that we issued a corrected and replaced earnings release this morning, shortly after our initial release, that was done, as we needed to correct some prior period financial information specifically related to Q4 and Q1, 2016-income statement. The initial release included in reflected some incorrect information, I just wanted to mention that before we get into Q&A in case there was some remaining questions from that. Audrey?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets, please state your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you and good morning out there. Wanted to follow up on guidance. The increase it makes sense given the quarter's results, I'm curious what might be the drag as we look at the run rate you are able to achieve in 1Q. What the offsets are as we look forward to the rest of the year, outside of obviously the financing you discussed and the churn event you have coming in 2Q.
Jeff Finnin: Good morning, thanks Jordan. I think you touch on two critical elements, first, as you discussed the interest expense associated with the incremental finances, if you just think about for instance Q2 we think about Q2 is that in subsequent quarters the interest expense have been about a $0.02 per share drag on earnings per quarter. In addition, as you mentioned we do have our last churn event from our customer out in the Bay Area, and that churn event also will be contributing a decrease of about $0.02 per share in the quarter - in the second quarter think about that. One other item we did mention in the call or on my prepared remarks, was the fact that we did get about a penny per share benefit in our G&A during the first quarter associated with some true-ups [ph] we made on our compensation year in compensation true-ups [ph]. So that give you some idea how we've been looking at it at least pacifically for the second quarter. And then beyond I would say it's largely going to be attributable to the timing of our commencements, and at the end - at the end of the day it's going to be driven by the timing associated with that and ultimately have a sales continued to generate and reflected for the rest of the year.
Paul Szurek: But Jordan, to that we obviously saw a lot of commitments up in Q4 which are growth significant revenue growth that we're seeing in early - earlier in the year so that's hoping to see the growth earlier we plan to see that moderate as we go forward in our traditional year.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And this $30 million commencement guidance obviously looks like a new statistic you'd be providing which should be helpful, but relative to historical commencements, it feels like it's a little bit light and is that - would you say that's a function of just available inventory today.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, I think you know in our call last quarter we gave some commentary around historical commencements and my recollection if you just look at the past several years, our commencements have averaged somewhere around $26 million to $27 million per year just depending upon the year. So it's up slightly from the pace which we've seen historically, and so that's where we're patient to and hopefully to execute. If you just look at what we did commence in the first quarter we were at $9.1 million. Our backlog that were exit in the quarter at is $5.6 million and we've said that that will all commence at various times during the rest of this year. So we're at slightly less than $50 million, we're at about 50% of the way there, we feel good where we are and Steven and his team continues to work to try and hit and or outperform.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, there was a news report recently of a competitor taking some space in L.A1 and I had a curiosity as to what the impact of that might be on the dynamic in that market, meaning would you view that as more competition for L.A2. Or how we should be thinking about that.
Paul Szurek: Jordan, this is Paul, thanks for that question. We view that as kind of business as usual, one will sure --there has always been an ecosystem there that included space that we didn't control. As it relates to that particular space, the anchor tenant for that space which takes up most of that space just wasn't a deployment that required the value that we provide in our - in our particular solutions and in fact it's not even going to be connected directly to the meet-me room. So it just wasn't in the fairway for the sort of things that we do. The tenet that has the space overall, we have a good working relationship with them and as we said on prior calls, we have a - we have a unique for care - historic care hotels we have a unique set of rights to preserve the value of our meet-me room experience of our meet-me room composition, and we have been able to work very successfully with the other people in the building to make that work for everybody. So you know, long story short we don't view this as a meaningful change in [indiscernible].
Jordan Sadler: Okay, just - that is helpful. One last clarification and I noticed that the MRR per CABI reported went to 40, 39 I think in the quarter. And it looks like either of the change in disclosure that I made to maybe I missed something, my last quarter supplement I had 15, 29 I don't know if there was change I missed.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, no - we - that same store pool gets updated in the first quarter of every year, Jordan, just because we then add an incremental level of real estate so that it's just a defined new pool. And that happens every year in the first quarter.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that is helpful, thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Please state your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning guys. I guess you've been doing a large number in a fairly consistent number of smaller deals the average size has been largely the same last couple of quarters, in the number of deals as well. I think one of the things that maybe caught us off guard in the power revenue did slow and if you mentioned in your primary comment I didn't hear it, but it is the slowdown in sequential growth in power revenues a function of just maybe the deal just kind of just above the threshold for recognizing power revenue. Is there anything that happened in the first quarter we should be thinking about.
Jeff Finnin: Yes. Steve?
Steve Smith: I provided a little bit of color commentary on that as it relates to guidance, and it really simply relates to if you look at our historical leasing over the last call it two to four quarters, we have been leasing and specifically SV7 had some larger metered power deployments that ultimately commenced in early on in the fourth quarter of 2016. Ultimately the power revenue associated with those will be dependent upon when those customers ultimately deploy all of their architecture, and then ultimately begin drawing on a metered basis. And those are large supplement just take some little bit of time to get that ultimately installed and before they're ultimately drawn into power levels that we've expected.
Unidentified Analyst: And is that in 2017.
Steve Smith: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: I guess as we think maybe moving forward with regard to some of the new development whether it's on Santa Clara or Reston or we've get a quite a bit of capital going to go out the door, should we expect to see you maybe anchor some of those developments as they start to come on line as we think about maybe late 2017 or early 2018 doing some larger deals and transactions at those - at those parcels.
Paul Szurek: We do as you as you know follow a policy we started a couple years ago of seeking strategic tenants to pre lease space in newly developed data centers and will continue that would be new developments as well.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, no real change I guess on the policy there is what you are saying.
Paul Szurek: No change.
Unidentified Analyst: That's helpful, alright thanks.
Paul Szurek: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets, please state your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. So on that last question maybe just to push back on the pulse that is if the site is across the street and immediately adjacent what - why wouldn't you want it just to immediately kind of continue the kind of that retail progress that you see in SV7, and not necessarily seek a larger anchor.
Paul Szurek: Well, we have other places in the Santa Clara campus to accommodate the retail demand. And we just find their tremendous synergies both with enterprise and retail demand going forward and having the right strategic tenants in place, during the - during the pre-leasing process. On top of which as you guys know developing in Santa Clara does take some time for entitlements, so there's plenty of time during the entitlement and pre-construction process to seek those kind of anchor tenants without really slowing down the realistic schedule of construction.
Jonathan Atkin: The 118 million. How many - What's kind of your baseline assumption on megawatts of critical load and is that [indiscernible] what can you share on that in terms of your baseline assumptions.
Paul Szurek: You know, that's for - that's to bring the first third of capacity into the data centers, so it's about six megawatts, it will eventually expand 18 megawatts our best guess is that cost per kilowatts about 10,500 to 11,000 per kilowatt. And that will provide the same mix we provide today which is 2 and plus 1 to accommodate customers that have differing needs.
Jonathan Atkin: And then maybe for Steve or you Paul, but I'm just interested in kind of the interconnection revenues and the ecosystems that are driving that, is it just the traditional ones that are continuing to grow or is there emerging one that you're seeing their starting to gain share within the revenue mix interconnects.
Steve Smith: This is Steve, we are seeing continued growth just on a broad base level but we're really seeing accelerated growth is really around the enterprise connected to the cloud. We've seen over 14% growth year-over-year, so that continues to be a healthy market for us and I think just speaks to overall strategy of trying to drive on ramps available in those markets and that versus of cloud networking enterprise.
Jonathan Atkin: Is there anything around advertising or Internet of things or any at anything else worth call it out as a driver in interconnects.
Steve Smith: Sure, and I think the Internet of Things going to ply do a lot of things, so we do see that across the board and whatever business you happen to be and typically the Internet is involved, so we do see a lot of different enterprises really requiring those hybrid multi-cloud type of deployments as well as just using their infrastructure to do commerce over the Internet. We feel that customers are continuing to see value in that within our data centers and the overall legal system that brings all the - those things together helps them drive more of their business and that's where we've seen a lot of growth.
Jonathan Atkin: And then just real quick two more on Chicago I think 95% utilization and as you think about expansion in that market is it is it down town, is it suburbs where it would be kind of your thoughts there. And then on the new logo capture I am just interested in whether the majority of those are taking occupancy at one of your sites or multiple sites, thank you.
Paul Szurek: Just so you know, the start off with as far Chicago is concerned we continue look at markets and the opportunity there that to grow, a lot of it comes down to where we have capital already deployed where we see the maximum return for our shareholders in each given market, and what the absorption looks like there as well as the competitive dynamics. And Chicago definitely one of those that we continue to look at, we do have an opportunity to better efficiencies out of the facility that we have there today, but we continue to look at new opportunities to expand the Chicago market that continues to remain attractive for us.
Jonathan Atkin: For the new logos 6 single site or multi-site mostly.
Paul Szurek: We're seeing an increase in multi sites, our customers start to deploy in more markets but for the majority of our new logos that we find that typically come in as a single market.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from a line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and company, please state your question.
Colby Synesael: Thank you. You talked in your prepared remarks about improvement in profitability in Presley, you talked about increasing efficiency, I was wondering if you dive a little bit further into what you might be doing and how that might be different that in quarter's past. And then also just as a point of clarification the Phase 1 of the - for the new facility to be built on the land that you're - that you're acquiring. Recognizing that can take some time and you talked about having to take a building down first, how quickly do you think you could actually get that out to market. Thank you.
Paul Szurek: Thanks Colby. Good questions. First on the - on the latter question. My guess is that building would come online probably about 18 to 22 months after we close on the land purchase, could be - could be faster depending upon how quickly the entitlements process goes, and as you know that's always the hardest thing to predict in some jurisdictions more so than others. Efficiency and effectiveness, we are continuing programs we started a couple of years ago to re=architect our own IT systems, to provide our people in the field and our construction and development teams with better tools to manage and take care of the plants and the facilities and to do new development, reduce the amount of time they have to spend on tasks that the systems can do for them. And not only to gain more efficiency from each person, but also to be able to be more proactive in how we take care of plant and equipment, just so you know, we have a great record for reliability. Sometimes that involves more unscheduled time than is necessary and these systems give us greater visibility and the ability to be more proactive. And that's really going on across the organization, and that's just part of the maturation of the company, and the benefits of our increasing scale.
Colby Synesael: And was there anything that happened I guess in the in the first quarter in particular that allowed you see any step improvement and profitability that the products may have completed.
Paul Szurek: No single thing in particular, just a number of small things that together add up to incremental efficiency and that's probably going to be our pace for the next few quarters.
Jeff Finnin: Additional commentary I would add, this isn't specifically related to efficiencies but first quarter while we did highlight you know we had a benefit of about a penny associate with some annual comps ups, and we also benefited we think from having some lower bad debt expense the first quarter, we hope that continues but obviously that's a hard one to predict, and again it is something to watch closely, but all signs in the first quarter looks very good.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you for that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Partners, please state your question.
Robert Gutman: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So I was hoping you could provide a little more color on network demand. Is it being driven by the deployment of content delivery infrastructures support of OTT offerings, is it unify communications and what are some of the underlying drivers there?
Steve Smith: Hi Robert, this is Steve. We are really seeing it across the board, I mean as enterprises interconnect more between their locations as well as with our customers and suppliers are driving more and more demand just in general. We do see - depends on the market I guess a previous way to look at it so as we talked about in the earlier remarks the L.A. market is obviously very entertained in kind of delivery focus as far as the general market is concerned, so we see greater demand there and with that comes greater demand for the network that goes along with it. But overall, between cloud come to delivery just the proliferation of enterprise and how they connect to their suppliers and employees across the globe, frankly, that just requires more and more network to do so.
Robert Gutman: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please state your question.
Michael Rollins: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Look like most of your net leasing growth in terms of number leases came from the point under 5,000 square feet. I'm wondering if as you unpack performance of that segment or category versus the others, what are you seeing in terms of new customer interest versus lease from existing. And are there certain markets that you find are doing better than others on the smaller co-location side of the deployment game, thanks.
Steve Smith: Hi Michael, this is Steve. I'll give you a little bit of color on just the overall approach and where we're seeing demand and try to give you a little more from the financial perspective. From an overall lease perspective as we talked about in the earlier comments, we do see a vast majority of the transactions being created in that less than 5,000 square foot space and that's really a reflection of our go to market strategy, which is that three pronged [ph] approach between enterprise, network and cloud but a lot of effort and focus is around driving enterprise into our data centers, that then those cloud and networks want to connect to and those enterprises obviously want to see the value from. So it's a lot of work, a lot of effort to bring those type of customers in, but that's the vast majority of the new logos that we saw in the first quarter, and frankly every quarter is through the enterprise, and as we see that market continue to mature my expectation is that we would continue to see that proliferate across our ecosystem. That answer's your broader base question, but in general across each of our markets that is where the focus is, is driving enterprise which of those less than 5,000 square foot deployments typically sometimes are networks as well, but for the most part those are just the traditional enterprise in the larger over 5,000 square foot type of deployments are either large fortune 1,000 type of deployments or cloud content type of delivery.
Paul Szurek: I would just add to what Steve said, going back to the introductory comments about our business model and the importance of being scalable and flexible for your costumers. Adding new logos has long been a part of a consistent strategy, providing - bringing new companies customers in and that will then subsequently expand and also providing expansion business for the customers that we have in place that provide network and cloud and other services. And there is a lot of synergy between those communities and that's why the ecosystems seem to keep throwing up the value that they throw, and why it's important for us to continue to be able to provide that scalability, flexibility because we see an enormous amount of growth from the customers that we bring into the ecosystem, and the growth they drop to other people that are already in the ecosystem.
Michael Rollins: And one another follow up on the numbers. Is there any reason why that growth the power in the quarter sequentially significantly [56:50] in the quarter.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Mike this is Jeff. I've mentioned earlier it really relates to some of our larger wholesale deployments specifically at SV7 that deployed and those deals commenced I guess in early Q4 of 2016. Those customers are deploying gear at this time and it really just ultimately the power generally might lag the increase in rent associated with those deployments, because it takes a little while to get their gear deployed and ultimately start power - power that those deployments are going to need and that we sold into those particular customers.
Paul Szurek: The other qualifier I would add there or beyond just to the revenue portion is the margin that goes along with that power obviously those larger deployments typically those are metered type of deployments which are traditionally pass through power and not necessarily bring a lot margin to us as far as the power margins associated with it. So just to provide some clarity there.
Michael Rollins: Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Matt Heinz with Stifel, please state your question.
Matt Heinz: Thanks. You highlighted particular strengths in demand from the network vertical - I was hoping maybe you could highlight any specific region where you're seeing that strength, is it kind of [indiscernible].
Steve Smith: Hi, Matt, this is Steve. I would say it's really varies from network provider to network provider and really region to region, so it's hard to give you some general around where we are seeing more strength from a network perspective, a lot of it just depends on the maturity of the facility. And how we see the - eventually choose to build natively into those buildings. L.A2 probably a great example of that where our initial strategy which is still work very well for us, has been leveraging the dark fiber tether [ph] between LA1 and LA2 is still a great way for us to provide customers the scalability and performance that they see at LA1 but in a more scalable campus in LA2. At the same time, that building has matured and we've seen more customers deploy their - networks have also chosen to deploy their natively as well to be more efficient for them they see the same benefits and so you see that happen as we - you see buildings mature over time and we're seeing the same thing in NY2 as well as that as it matures over time. I think you just see that across the markets as we start to get better synergies in our ecosystem in each of our facilities. But overall, networks tend to coalesce around one another and we see that continue to mature as we experience our strategy.
Matt Heinz: Okay, thank you. And there is a follow up to that, I think you mentioned fiber volume growth outpaced [indiscernible] by about 100 basis point per quarter, I guess that flattening - I was wondering if you could add some color to that - and I also missed the growth in the logical - interconnect.
Jeff Finnin: Hi Matt, this is Jeff. Let me give you some color. Steve gave a little bit of this on his script but overall cross connect volume growth for the quarter was 10.3%. The fiber as you just alluded to was 15% of that so blended - I'm sorry a 10.3% volume growth overall, and as you just alluded to overall revenue growth was about 13.9 %. So I still think there is some pricing strength there, it has not decreased but that 10.3 was overall volume growth.
Steve Smith: Then just to give you a bit more color around the overall growth numbers. The fiber cross connects the traditional go to for customers are looking to do approximates with their facilities. Some of the decrease that you see is really related to the mix that we've seen over the past several quarters, we look at to larger wholesale deployments versus smaller retailed deployments, and the larger deployments obviously get little bit more diluted because they're leveraging more square footage for maybe a smaller number cross connects than a traditional enterprise might for the same sized footprint. So that's just why you see it a little bit of a decline in that regard. I do think that some customers the networks are starting to explore a bit around 100 gig which they get a bit more efficiencies around but at the same time a connection is the connection they need to - where they need to connect a cloud provider or a network that's still a physical connection or in some cases a logical one.
Matt Heinz: Are you still disclosing the growth in last quarter connection services [indiscernible]?
Jeff Finnin: My apologies Matt, overall volume growth on the logical interconnection this quarter year-over-year was 6.5% I think that's actually deceleration from where we were in a previous two quarters and that's largely attributable to a couple of customers where we had some churn in those particular abundance but overall this quarter was 6.5% year-over-year.
Matt Heinz: Okay, thanks very much guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please state your question.
Lukas Hartwich: Thank you. I know you guys don't play a lot in the wholesale arena, but I'm just curious what are your thoughts on the supply and demand dynamics there?
Steve Smith: Hey, this sis Steve, I can give you my sense on it and I'm sure Paul and Jeff would chime in as well. Wholesale can [ph] in a lot of different ways and as we stated in our strategy it's really opportunistic as far as CoreSite is concerned and that opportunity comes with not only new builds that we may be doing in the market, but also how they fit into our ecosystem and our overall strategy relative to those three pillars around enterprise, cloud and network. So in the typically the wholesale deal that we've been engaged in, we do have a new bill that's going on but they will also contribute to that overarching strategy. We have typically now participated in the hyper-scale type of deployments that you see in less interconnect sense of type of markets, we don't see a dramatic change in that strategy.
Paul Szurek: We do in that market see the same things that we've commented on by some of the analysts that that hyper-scale market does tend to be somewhat lumpy, a lot of procurement and then growing into procurement. But then there will be another stage of procurement expected down the road, and we think that's going to continue for some period of years as far as we can see. Consistent with the overall growth in data and data traffic and all the different things people do with data right now.
Steve Smith: I would say one of the areas that we have seen an increase in what you would probably traditionally call wholesale is published early in his remarks around the edge and how those edge type of deployments may be sizable in some cases but are still very performance sensitive, the reason why they need to be close to the edge in order to provide a very performance sensitive type of response back to their customers or other applications that they may be delivering service to. So those are a bit unique in their deployments but we are seeing a bit of an uptick there.
Lukas Hartwich: That's helpful. And then my last questions around New York and the improvement there. Is that market related or is that more company just better company execution, what is kind of driving the uptick there.
Steve Smith: I think it's kind of a combination of both frankly. The team there is matured over time and we're seeing better results out of the team as we build there. I think the ecosystem there has strengthened over time so we've seen that in various markets as we get customers then ecosystems established there that they as Paul mentioned earlier, they start to throw up more value to other participants there, they continue to grow and that that helps drive more revenue, the market starts to find out more and more about the value that we provide in that space. So I think it's a combination of a lot of that and I think them overall the market is maturing there as well. We are optimistic about the outlook and we continue to work hard every day to keep it going.
Lukas Hartwich: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you that does conclude our question and answer session. At this time I will now turn it back Mr. Paul Szurek for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: Thanks everybody on the call for your interest in the company. We are - as we mentioned we're very pleased with this quarter and pleased with what we see going forward, I would like to thank all of our colleagues at CoreSite to work really hard every day to take good care of their customers and try to stay ahead of costumer demand and we look forward to the rest of the year, thanks very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-02-10 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to CoreSite Realty’s Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Greer Aviv. Thank you. You may begin.
Greer Aviv: Thank you. And thank you everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I’m joined here today by Paul Szurek, our President and CEO; Steve Smith, our Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today’s call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans, or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management’s judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for taking the time to join us today. I’m glad to be here to share our fourth quarter financial and operational results with you as well as some highlights regarding our full-year 2016 performance. We finished the year strongly reporting record levels of fourth quarter revenues, FFO per share and cash flow while continuing to grow, expand and improve across the organization. We also executed well on our strategic priorities in Q4 completing the development of our largest multi-tenant data center, acquiring extensive capacity for future growth and attracting numerous key customers to our data center communities. Compared to Q4 2015, we reported 33% growth in FFO per share driven by 22% growth in revenue and 27% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Since CoreSite’s IPO in 2010, we have been on a journey to profitably expand and deepen our footprint in the essential data center markets we serve across the nation. We believe that this strategy and its execution, has enabled us to create sustainable value for our customers and shareholders. With that in mind, I want to share some highlights of our performance since our IPO. Based on Q4 annualized amounts, we have nearly tripled total operating revenues to a run rate of approximately $440 million exiting 2016. Both FFO per share and adjusted EBITDA have increased at a compound annual rate of 27% while our adjusted EBITDA margin has expanded nearly 1,600 basis points from 37% to 53%. We have increased our dividend annually and the current level reflects a compound annual growth rate of 35%. We have also increased the size of our operating data center portfolio at a 12% compound annual growth rate almost all of which has been organic growth. And we ended 2016 with almost 1,100 customers compared to approximately 630 at the end of 2010. We have been able to achieve these results due to our unwavering focus on the execution of our business strategy based on the needs of our customers and our financial discipline. An important piece of our strategy has been to deepen our presence in existing markets, to increase our operational scale and strengthen our competitive positioning within these markets. Our data center campuses are thoughtfully located and designed to provide the greatest possible appeal to and flexibility for our diverse customer base. CoreSite’s eight markets are centers of population density, business activity and economic health and currently comprised 20% of the U.S. population and 27% of U.S. GDP. We believe these markets contain a large and diverse pool of customer prospects which require access to network dense data center facilities, to support their performance sensitive applications and to interconnect securely and reliably with their business partners. Additionally, our markets contain a large and generally growing list of enterprises with increasing data center demands and increasing sophistication about outsourcing their IT architecture. Our industry is fortunate to be exposed to very strong underlying demand trends which we believe should sustain double-digit growth for a number of years. Our full-year 2016 performance demonstrates consistent execution and efficient go-to-market strategy and the robust customer communities we have built across our platform as evidenced by the strong sales results for the year with 579 new and expansion leases executed totaling $49 million in annualized GAAP rent, a 6% increase over 2015. In addition, we commenced a record 443,000 square feet of data center space in 2016 due in part to better than expected leasing performance at SV7. This translates to $59 million in annualized GAAP rent commenced during the year, a 37% year-over-year increase. We continue to see consistent demand across our markets from customers requiring high-performance, low-latency co-location solutions which, is well distributed across each of our key verticals of network providers, cloud service providers and enterprises. Supply and demand seemed generally in balance on the wholesale side in most of our markets. However, we are mindful of reports of increased appetite from privately funded developers. As it relates to our largest markets, we’re seeing steady demand and a consistent balance with supply in Los Angeles. In the Bay area, capacity across the market remains relatively lean while demand remains quite healthy, with pricing remaining firm. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 80,000 unoccupied square feet available across the Silicon Valley market, and we continue to explore opportunities for expansion in this market. Regarding Northern Virginia and DC, we continue to see robust demand particularly from the enterprise vertical. Although supply appears to be increasing, the current environment remains well balanced and our leasing pipeline is healthy. We’re looking forward to commencing construction on our Reston campus expansion this year. Lastly, we have seen some positive momentum in the New York, New Jersey market with an increase in the pace of leasing in Q4. Demand continues to be concentrated among smaller customer requirements with very good traction among enterprises and more specifically the financial services industry. While the sales cycle remains somewhat extended relative to other markets, we’re optimistic about the recent moment and our funnel. In summary, 2016 was another solid year of growth and investment as we continue to enhance our platform and customer experience. We remain focused on executing this business model which has served our customers and shareholders well. As you will hear from Jeff later in the call, we continue to expect solid growth this year and are optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks Paul. I will begin by reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activities during the fourth quarter, and then I discuss in more detail our vertical and geographic results. Our Q4 new and expansion sales totaled $7.4 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 35,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $212 per square foot. These results completed a record sales year of $49 million in annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases, comprised of 246,000 square feet at a weighted average GAAP rental rate of $198 per square foot. Regarding the composition of our new and expansion leasing by deployment size, leased signed of 5,000 square feet or less totaled $5.8 million in annualized GAAP rent and accounted for 126 of the 127 transactions signed in Q4. During the fourth quarter we signed one lease greater than 5,000 square feet, which was an expansion of the existing multi-site customer. For the full year, we signed 579 new and expansion leases, a record level and an increase of 10% compared to 2015. As we continue to refine our efforts to attract performances that require us to our data centers, we also continue to enhance the already thriving customer communities across our footprint. And therefore, our attractiveness to cloud, network and other service providers will collectively benefit from this diverse customer base. Further to that point, we had another successful quarter attracting new logos to our four largest data center campuses, where 91% of our new logos in Q4 distributed across these markets. As it relates to our vertical distribution, 64% of our new logos were in the enterprise vertical. This group of new enterprise customers includes a cutting edge technology company, specializing and designing and developing high-performance electric vehicles for large international law firm, a leading accounting and management consulting firm and the largest graduate school of education in the United States. The net of customer churn, we added 30 net new logos in Q4 and 83 net new logos in 2016. Beyond our new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q4 resulted in renewals totaling approximately 52,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $183 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 2.9% on a cash basis and 5.5% on a GAAP basis. For the full-year, our cash rent growth is 3.9% in-line with the mid-point of our guidance. Churn in the fourth quarter was 1.9% which included approximately 135 basis points of churn related to the previously announced multi-site customer that vacated certain elements of these deployments across our platform. For the full-year, churn was 7.8% and in-line with our guidance. Turning to interconnection performance, Q4 interconnection revenue increased 16% over the prior year fourth quarter. For the full-year, interconnection revenue is up 20% year-over-year, slightly ahead of the high-end of guidance. Q4, total interconnection volume growth of 11.6% was comprised of 16% growth in fiber cross-connects and 11% growth in logical interconnection services, which includes CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange and our Any2 Exchange for Internet peering. Before diving into our vertical performance, I wanted to point out that in Q4 and moving forward, we have simplified how we report on our vertical classifications. As such, we will now report on only three verticals, network, cloud and enterprise. Visual content providers, system integrators and managed service providers remain under the enterprise umbrella but will no longer be independently broken out. With respect to our vertical mix, during Q4, network and cloud customers accounted for 34% of annualized GAAP rents signed. Within our cloud vertical, we had strong positive activity correlating to a number of new logos, including multi-site public on-ramps with a leading cloud provider that signed with us in two markets. In addition, during the quarter, we signed expansions with software driven cloud networking solutions provider and additional public cloud on-ramp in Los Angeles and a hosted global cloud provider of business applications. In the network vertical, we continue to see expansions with existing customers as well as new logos joining the thriving carrier community. Notably, we recently announced the CoreSite’s Los Angeles campus would be the North American access point for the CUS Transpacific Cable System which should begin operating in Q2 2017. This will be sixth sub-sea cable to offer direct access from our Los Angeles campus, augmenting the importance of CoreSite’s data center platform and providing transpacific connectivity to the Indonesian and Asian markets. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, we continue to see good momentum with this vertical accounting for 66% of annualized GAAP rent. Specifically in Q4, we signed a sizeable expansion of a large global financial services organization as well as a new mobile content customer that moved from its existing third party data center in Los Angeles to support the launch of a new product. In addition, we signed leases with a leading interactive entertainment company, a large international bank and an international ad exchange. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases during Q4 were Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and Northern Virginia DC, collectively representing nearly 80% of annualized GAAP rents signed in the quarter. Demand remains very consistent in our Los Angeles market, with a good pace of leasing amongst small to mid-size customer requirements. Related, we continue to see a healthy amount of leasing at our LA2 facility. In Q4, signings of that facility accounted for 66% of annualized GAAP rents signed in Los Angeles markets, as many customers are seeking to cost effective option in that market that will allow them to scale their deployments while still easily accessing the strong distributor networks made of LA1. In terms of verticals, enterprise was the strongest in this market, followed by network and cloud. Stabilized occupancy in the Los Angeles campus was 92.6% at the end of Q4, up 250 basis points compared to Q3 while pre-stabilized occupancy increased to 24.3% from 15.6% last quarter. Leasing on the Bay Area continues to be dynamic, where lease is executed across all of our multi-tenant data centers in this market, and especially strong demand for our new facility at SV7. As you know, we saw strong pre-leasing at SV7 during construction and opened the facility at 62% leased. Including incremental leasing in Q4, we ended the quarter at 75% leased. Stabilized occupancy across the Silicon Valley market increased 110 basis points to 96.7%.In terms of verticals, Q4 lease executions in this market were weighted towards cloud deployments followed by enterprise deployments. Northern Virginia DC, transaction volume remains healthy with good demand among smaller and mid-size requirements. Enterprise demand remained strong with these customers accounting for 50% of our new logos signed in the Northern Virginia DC market. Stabilized occupancy across the market now stands at 96.1%, a decrease of 10 basis points on a sequential basis. We have been successful, in fact filling two thirds of the space with churned out view one in the Q3 and remain optimistic about our ability to re-lease the remainder of that space at favorable economics. 2016 was a strong year for leasing activity at CoreSite. We will continue to focus on driving increased diversity across our footprint and work to deliver value and addressing the growing needs of our customers. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q4 financial results followed by an updated of our development CapEx and our leverage and liquidity capacity. I will then conclude my remarks with an overview of our 2017 guidance. Q4 financial results resulted in total operating revenues of $110.5 million, a 9.1% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 21.5% increase over the prior year period. Q4 operating revenue consisted of $91.8 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 10.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 22.9% year-over-year. Interconnection services revenue contributed $14 million to operating revenues in Q4, an increase of 4.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 16.3% year-over-year. And tenant reimbursement and other revenues were $2.1 million. Office and light industrial revenue was $2.6 million, which includes revenue associated with our recently closed acquisition of the light industrial office park in Reston Virginia. Q4 FFO was $1.06 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 17.8% on a sequential quarter basis and 32.5% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $16.6 million increased 16.3% on a sequential quarter basis and 27.1% over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 240 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter to a record level of 54.9% and expanded 200 basis points to 53% for the full-year 2016. Related, for the full-year, our revenue flow-through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 63% and 61% respectively. As it relates to our reported AFFO results in the quarter, we had a significant increase in straight-line rent which was $5.4 million in Q4. This increase relates to contractual rent relief adjustments resulting from the modestly delayed delivery of SV7. We expect straight-line rent to return to normalized levels in the first quarter. Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $4.3 million or 3.9% of total operating revenues. For the full-year sales and marketing expenses correlated to 4.4% of total operating revenues, 40 basis points below the 2015 level as we continue to focus on increasing efficiency and productivity across the sales and marketing organization. General and administrative expenses were $8.4 million in Q4 correlating to 7.6% of total operating revenues. For the full-year, G&A expenses correlated to 8.8% of total operating revenues, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to 2015 and slightly below our guidance. Regarding our same-store metrics, Q4 same-store turnkey data center occupancy increased 140 basis points to 90% from 88.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 7.5% year-over-year and 0.7% sequentially to $1,529. Similar to what we saw last quarter, on a per unit basis growth in our interconnection and power revenues are driving the solid year-over-year increase in MRR per cab-E. In Q4, we completed construction of SV7 and placed into service 227,000 net rentable square feet across three floors. Two of the three floors are 100% leased and occupied and therefore are reflected on our stabilized operating portfolio. The third floor consisting of 77,000 square feet is reflected in our pre-stabilized pool and is 26% occupied. As we have discussed previously, we define stabilization as the earlier to occur of 85% occupancy or 24 months after we place an asset into service. Lastly, we commenced 189,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $185 per square foot which represents $34.9 million of annualized GAAP rent. This record level of commencements reflects the previously discussed backlog of leases at SV7, which account for approximately 80% of the annualized GAAP rent commenced in Q4. We ended the fourth quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 94.5% an increase of 80 basis points compared to the third quarter, and an increase of 200 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Turning now to backlog. Projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $5.7 million as of December 31, 2016, or $15 million on a cash basis. We expect almost the entire GAAP backlog to commence during the first quarter. Turning to our development activity, we had a total of 27,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity under construction as of December 31, 2016, with expansion projects in Los Angeles, Denver and Boston. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we have spent $7.7 million of the estimated $22.3 million required to complete the expansions. As shown on Page 21 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized in Q4 was 11%, and for the full-year it was 24.6% in line with our guidance. For 2017, we expect a percent of interest capitalized to be in the range of 10% to 15% reflecting the lower level of development relative to increases in interest expense. Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016, our ratio of net principal debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.8 times including preferred stock, the ratio was 3.3 times, in line with the Q3 level and still below our stated target ratio of approximately 4 times. Including preferred stock, the year-end level correlates to incremental debt capacity of approximately $165 million at December 31 based upon Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. As you can see from our guidance, for capital expenditures in the supplemental, we expect to deploy capital of $257 million in 2017 with $220 million associated with data center expansion projects. As a result, we expect to add incremental debt financing during the first half of 2017 to increase liquidity and extend term on existing debt drawn on our credit facility. Timing, pricing and the type of debt are dependent on market conditions and we’ve targeted a total issuance amount of $150 million to $250 million which will be used to pay down our credit facility and fund development, with the intent of maintaining a healthy balance between our fixed and variable price debt. This anticipated debt issuance is included in our guidance, which I will discuss in more detail later. As it relates to our dividend, during the fourth quarter we announced an increase in our dividend to $0.80 per share on a quarterly basis or $3.20 per share on an annual basis. This correlates to a 51% increase over the prior year dividend rate and is in line with our AFFO growth of 46% in 2016. We modestly increased our dividend payout ratio to 74% of FFO based on the mid-point of our 2017 guidance. We believe this aligns us with the best performing REITs historically and reflects our cumulative growth in cash flow, scale and operating effectiveness since our IPO. Now in closing, I would like to address guidance for 2017. I will remind you that our guidance reflects our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our market as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor any changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions, or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on Page 23 of our Q4 earnings supplemental, our guidance for 2017 is as follows. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $470 million to $480 million. Based on the mid-point of guidance, this implies 18.6% year-over-year revenue growth. As it relates to interconnection revenue growth, we expect the 2017 growth rate to be between 13% and 16% which at the lower end is generally in line with overall projected volume growth. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $37 million to $39 million or approximately 8% of total operating revenue. This correlates to a 7% increase in G&A expenses over 2016, reflecting our ongoing focus on increasing productivity and efficiency across the organization. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $253 million to $258 million, this correlates to 20% year-over-year growth based on the mid-point of the range and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 53.8% and revenue flow-through to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 58%. FFO per share in OP unit is estimated to be $4.25 to $4.35. This implies 16% year-over-year FFO growth based on the mid-point of the range and the $3.71 per share we reported in 2016. As a reminder, the FFO per share guidance includes the debt financing that we expect to complete in the first half of the year. In addition, due to the expected timing and amount of the financing, we expect FFO per share results to be fairly balanced in the first and second halves of the year. And therefore, FFO growth to be weighted towards the first half of the year. This is due to the anticipated incremental interest expense resulting from higher priced fixed debt as compared to current variable price debt. We also anticipate this to result in a decreased revenue flow-through to FFO, which we estimate at approximately 40% based on the mid-point of 2017 FFO guidance. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows. Estimated annual churn rate of 6% to 8% for 2017, keep in mind, that we expect an elevated level of churn in the second quarter of 2017 due to the final portion of rent associated with the original full-building customer at SV3. The amount is equal to $4.2 million in annualized rent or an incremental 180 basis points of churn. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 2% to 4% for the full year. We expect cash rent growth to be weighted towards the second half of the year due to expected renewals of strategic deployments resulting in lower mark-to-market rent increases in the first half of the year. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $243 million to $271 million. The components are comprised of data center expansion cost, estimated to be $212 million to $228 million, this includes the expansion capital related to the first phase of the Reston campus expansion, the previously mentioned expansion projects in Los Angeles, Denver and Boston as well as incremental turnkey data center expansions across the portfolio as needed based on demand. Non-recurring investments are estimated to be $14 million to $18 million and include amounts related to investments in our IT architecture, facilities upgrades and other capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures are estimated to be $13 million to $17 million, and tenant improvements are estimated to be $4 million to $8 million. Now, we’d like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, and good morning. Can you elaborate a little bit on I guess, Paul, your opening remarks you talked about strength you’re starting to see in financial services. But it sounded like the lead time was not exactly short. I’m just trying to get a sense of how that may have changed sequentially if these are new requirements that have popped up? And if lead times are consistent or if you’re saying that there is lengthening out?
Paul Szurek: Thanks for giving an opportunity to clarify. I don’t think and we’re specifically talking about the New York market. I don’t think that there has been any change in the lead times relates to these financial services types of deployments. They just continue to be longer than lead times for typical lease negotiations. I think what we’re seeing is consistent with what we’re seeing in other segments of the enterprise vertical which is an increased interest in outsourcing elements of the IT architectures for these organizations, specifically to improve cost performance and to provide more efficient access to cloud services. Steve, would you add anything to that?
Steve Smith: No, I think exactly Paul. I think the one thing that I would add is that we have seen a bit of an uptick as far as overall interest from the financial services community. And the New York area obviously there is a large density of those types of customers there. And I think that they are getting more sophisticated and really reaching a critical point in their internal architecture that is having them look to alternatives, part of that is cloud, part of that is outsourcing to co-location providers and really segmenting how they divide that architecture across different co-location facilities in its own right, whether it’s high frequency trading or internal IT requirements, but we’re seeing a lot more I guess a measured amount of more interest from that sector.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that’s helpful. And then, I had a question regarding sort of expansion - capital expansion opportunity. I heard obviously of the $212 million to $228 million Jeff that you touched on, you’ve, got Reston campus expansion and some others in there. But I also figured based on prior discussions that you guys would continue to look to for opportunities in some of your core markets to court for, including Chicago, Santa Clara, as you’re running out of capacity in those? Can you maybe talk about the progress there or the plans?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, let me just touch on what leads, what’s on our balance sheet and then Paul can touch on a little bit more broad in terms of where we’re looking to add incremental capacity. But in general, we’re looking at various components of our portfolio in terms of where we need to add incremental capacity. We don’t have a lot of it put into development as we ended the year and largely because of the amount of development we had being finalized and finishing up in Q4. Having said that, I think when you look across the portfolio beyond what we’ve talked about with Denver, Boston, and LA, in construction we’ve also mentioned the Reston campus. And there are a couple other markets that we’re closely looking at based on our visibility in terms of the sales funnel. And we’ll continue to evaluate those options and then ultimately put things into construction as we see fit. Beyond that maybe Paul can comment on just more broadly what we’re looking at in terms of other markets based on the need for just added capacity.
Paul Szurek: Jordan, I touched on this in my comments. We’re looking at additional capacity in the other big four markets. We’ve got Northern Virginia taken care of pretty well. Historically we follow the discipline of not announcing anything until we actually have a specific contract or similar development to announce. I think generally you can that we’re always making progress but we’ll announce it when we have something firm.
Steve Smith: Jordan, the only other thing I was going to add just to give you some numbers, just a quantification standpoint. Our estimate for what we think we might spend in Reston for 2017, it’s about $100 million, that’s largely going to be dependent on when we take that under full construction. But that gives you some idea about where we’re thinking in terms of heading into the year.
Jordan Sadler: That’s helpful. And then lastly if I may, just a point of clarification on the straight-line rent number in the quarter. So, was that an abatement that was given for the delay and can you quantify the amount of the abatement and then sequentially I guess we’d get the change from that?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Jordan, you’re correct. The increase in that straight-line rent, on average in any given quarter our straight-line rent amounts usually somewhere between $1 million to $2 million. So you can take the delta of that mid-point of that number and you can see that the overall increase was about $4 million. And that was largely attributed to the delay in delivering SV7 and an abatement that we gave as a result of that delay.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: Okay, thank you. You mentioned you were going to, you’re intending to raise $150 million to $250 million in debt. I’m just curious what interest rate you assumed in the guidance that you’ve provided today. Obviously I think your revolver is something just above 2%, it’s going to be something higher than that. Anyway, to kind of frame out how we should think about that potential rate to kind of work into our model? And then secondly, when I look at your EBITDA guidance margin the 53.8%, excuse me - that’s up about 80 basis points I think versus the last two years it’s been up roughly 200 basis points. I’m just trying to get a sense, if there are any of the items that go into that that could be changing in terms of how you’re thinking about that. Is it sales or marketing or maybe we’ll see a bump relative to percentage of revenue? Is it something perhaps in the property of rent, just any color that helps us back into the slowdown in the contribution margin? Thanks.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Colby, let me address to your first question as it relates to interest rates. Today if you look at our pricing on our revolving credit facility we’re paying about 230 basis points on our debt. Based upon the debt we placed last year and based on where market sit today, I think largely we will expect to pay about 250 basis points higher than 230, call it somewhere around 475, 480 if you went with a pure fixed price instrument. I’d give a term somewhere around 7 or 8 eight years for that level of pricing. As it relates to the second question, as it relates to our EBITDA margins, I think if you look at over the last couple of years, I do think looking at a 12-year period of time in terms of what improvement we’re making in our EBITDA margins is a good way to look at it. We increase those spread by about 200 basis points, ‘16 over ‘15 and we’re guiding to about 80 basis points increase in ‘17 over ‘16. We’re trying to continue to manage as I mentioned in our comments around our expense growth and that’s something that Paul, Steve and I and the entire management work closely around just to manage and continue to scale the business. And hopefully we can outperform but that is largely driven by continuing to manage our expense growth and leverage as much as profitability as we can to the bottom line.
Colby Synesael: As it relates to sales and marketing in particular, any reason to think that, as a percentage of revenue, that might be different in 2017 versus 2016?
Paul Szurek: No, I think we’ve typically guided to right around 4% of revenue and I think that’s fairly consistent with where we think we’ll end up in 2017 as well.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you.
Paul Szurek: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great. Thanks for taking the questions this afternoon. So I just wanted to ask a couple on the enterprise side. Paul, Steve, you guys were talking about the strength there, and even in one of the earlier questions you came, sort of referenced back to that. And I just wanted to understand the dynamic of what these enterprises are doing inside your data center. And I guess it would be helpful maybe to layer in sort of two, sort of ideas as you go through that. One is when I look at the interconnect growth projection for the year, it’s actually slower than your top line growth projection for the year, so implies a mild reduction as a percent of revenue coming from interconnect. And I guess that would have sort of been intuitively the opposite of what I’d expect in accelerating enterprise cloud adoption scenario. And then secondly, you guys added PacketFabric to, I think, 11 of your data centers in the quarter, and I’m just wondering about how that helps in terms of driving that enterprise demand over time? Thanks.
Steve Smith: Sure, hi Jonathan, this is Steve. I’ll start off and then let Paul fill in some color there. I guess, the first thing relative to the cross-connect growth and the pacing versus top-line, part of that I think is attributable to some of the larger leases that we closed over time. And as you look at the size of those leases and relative cross-connects that connect those spaces it gets a bit diluted there. So, I think that’s part of the driver. Overall, as far as the enterprise is concerned, we do see them, it’s connecting more and more to networks and clouds. And how they do that is a bit variable, whether they do it through physical cross connects or through Oracle cloud exchange and some of the other types of services that are available there. But overall I would say that that’s the primary contributor there, just the mix of leasing that we’ve seen over time. As you look at some of the other providers that have come into the building, you mentioned PacketFabric, we have a couple of others in the form of Megaport and a few others as well as some of the larger carriers that provide similar type of SDN services. Overall, we feel like that’s a positive thing for our customer base, it gives them better connectivity options. And frankly, we’ll attract more customers and more cloud and content providers to want to come to our data centers. So, on balance, yes, there may-be some interconnection services that use that SDN type of offering in order to connect to multiple other services whether its cloud or other networks. But on balance we feel like it’s overall a positive thing for us.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Awesome. If I could ask just one more follow-up. I was just wondering what the impact from the Reston acquisition was to the top line in the fourth quarter and whether we should think about that revenue as we look into ‘17 sort of going away as you guys re-purpose the asset for data center space and maybe away from office? Thanks.
Jeff Finnin: Jonathan, as it relates to the fourth quarter, just based on the timing on which we acquire that, you can see on the property table. The annualized rent associated with that particular development at 12/31 is $4 million, we closed it mid-November. So the top-line growth was about $600,000. Important, as you look at your models going forward, there is a certain element of that particular rent that will be terminating at March 31, it’s about $800,000. I mean, that’s going to be terminating so that we can commence development on the first phase of that particular development.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Awesome. Thanks, Jeff.
Paul Szurek: Hi Jonathan, this is Paul. You did raise a couple of questions in your research note a day or two ago that, if you don’t mind I thought I’d clarify so that you can go away from this call with that answered.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thank you.
Paul Szurek: You quoted Jones Lang LaSalle report about One Wilshire. And I can only surmise that that report related to the landlord’s ability to develop and lease new data center space in the building and provide conduit and fiber to our meet-me room. I do want to make sure that you’re aware however that once the fiber gets to our meet-me room, we have the ability to economically benefit from any connection by charging fees for cross-connects. More precisely, in order to access the meet-me, room ecosystem, the landlord’s tenants must enter into a separate agreement with CoreSite governing our provision of, meet-me room services to that tenant. We also have the ability to protect ourselves against any free riding or other behavior that would be detrimental to the value we created in that interconnection node in the meet-me room. And furthermore we also have right to first offer on much of the space, in fact probably most of the space that the landlord could potentially develop to supply additional power and cooling. I just want to finish the same, we have a great relationship with both the owner and the management company at One Wilshire. We worked together really well over the years to create an outstanding data center ecosystem there. And we feel very good about our ability to continue to enjoy the mutual benefits of that relationship while providing a very valuable co-location and interconnection platform for our customers there. And I hope that kind of covers all the questions you had on that subject?
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thanks a lot, Paul. That’s super helpful. I didn’t think I could ask four questions, so that was really good.
Paul Szurek: I think Jeff’s kind of already covered the question you raised with the dividend. REITs have historically financed expansion opportunities with outside financing. The tax structure we have requires us and investor expectations encourage us to dividend out as much as we safely can, what is defined as kind of true operating cash flow. And I know people take different measures. But we kind of look at something we call cash available for distribution to common equity which is basically AFFO minus non-recurring capital expenditures. We have raised our dividend payout ratio to kind of catch up with the growth in our performance over the years. But we still retain a cash cushion between that measure of operating cash flow and what our dividend is. So, technically we will not be borrowing to pay the dividend as you questioned in your report. I know that there are different ways that different analysts look at it, I just wanted to clarify the math.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. So, a couple of quick ones. I wanted to find out about your interconnect growth expectations for 2017, and of that growth, if you can describe how much in your guidance is predicated on bilateral fiber cross-connects versus exchange port type connections - the logical connections, kind of the composition of that or how much each of those accelerates. And then related to that, on Slide 14 the MRR per cabinet - I wondered if you could provide a little bit more detail. You have a little bit in the script, but maybe quantify how much of the growth that you saw in 4Q was from interconnect versus tower versus escalator? Thanks.
Jeff Finnin: Hello Jonathan, let me see if I can hit both of those for you. As it relates to the interconnection business, if you just look at full-year ‘16 over ‘15, I think Steve commented on his script that our overall volume growth was just shy of 12% for the full-year. And as I said in my script, our guidance is somewhere between 13% to 16% of overall revenue but we’d expect volume to be on the lower end of that. So, just call it an implied volume growth of about 13%. As it relates to fiber versus other, fiber generated overall increases in ‘16 over ‘15 of 16.4%. And we would expect that number to be fairly consistent as we go into ‘17 as well. So maybe give up just a little bit but overall we would expect it to be right around that 16% maybe just north of 16%. As it relates to your second question on the MRR per cab-E. If you look at the overall year-over-year growth of 7.5% and the components, the overall increase from an, interconnect and power is really what drove the increases. And my recollection is on interconnection that year-over-year growth is about 11%, maybe just slightly ahead of 11%. And the power increases were about 9%. And then the remainder was the rent component.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay. And then interested, you talk a lot about enterprise, and I’m interested in the indirect channel and the contribution of that to your new leasing, because you have a lot of retail big prototype leases. And how much of that funnel is coming from indirect, and is that changing at all?
Steve Smith: Yes, I can probably take that for you, this is Steve. From an overall transaction perspective, it ranges anywhere from about 13% to about 20% as far as the overall indirect channel and the amount of contributions they bring to us. So that’s remained fairly consistent over time and we haven’t seen a dramatic change in that over the 12 months I would say.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay. And then finally, of your incremental leases, how much involve metered power versus circuit-based? I’m assuming it’s mostly the latter, but just wanted to make sure I’m, understanding that correctly.
Paul Szurek: Hi, Jon, I apologize, I was writing something can you repeat what the question was?
Jonathan Atkin: Right. So, the incremental leases that you saw during the quarter, how much of that involved - I’m asking about the power pricing model, right? So how much of the incremental leasing is involving metered power versus circuit-based power?
Paul Szurek: Yes, I’m sorry, I got you. I would say overall a majority of the leases will contain a breaker powered model and less than majority would be on a metered basis. To give you some idea, if you look at just our overall power revenue we’ve been anywhere between 55% and 60% of our power revenue is earned on a breaker basis. And therefore the remaining portion is earned on a metered basis. And that is consistent with where we ended 2016 as well.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Heinz with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Matt Heinz: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to hit on a couple of the guidance items. I think Jonathan hit a little bit on this with the Reston question. But how much of the incremental of $75 million of implied revenue growth is attributable to existing rents on the Reston campus? It sounds like you’re terminating some of that OLI revenue in the first quarter, but if you could just provide kind of the magnitude of rents on the existing leases that’s in the guidance.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, I think it’s about, we got like I said it was an annualized amount of $4 million resulting from that new campus. And that will be in place through $3.31 million and then it will drop down to $3.2 million for the last nine months ballpark.
Matt Heinz: Okay. That’s perfect. Thanks. And then any color you could provide on leasing assumptions that are baked into the revenue in terms of volumes you’re expecting relative to last year and the mix of leasing by deal size?
Jeff Finnin: Great question Matt. I think as Paul alluded to and I think Steve might have alluded to this a little bit as it relates to our commencements for 2016. We had the largest amount of commencements we’ve had as an organization, I think that total $59 million ballpark for the full year of 2016, which as you know, largely led to the 50% cash growth ‘16 over ‘15. I think if you look at where we have been historically and if you look at over the last 4 to 5 years, taking out a couple of large wholesale deals that we’ve done over that period of time, I would say on average, our lease commencements in any given has averaged over that 4-year period, about $26 million in total. We believe we can exceed that in 2017. And we’re estimating somewhere around $30 million of annualized commencements for rent in 2017 to give you an idea.
Matt Heinz: That’s awesome. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up on the - your relationship with the switch fabric, kind of cloud fabric providers, I’m just wondering kind of what’s the economic relationship there? Are you charging them rent or do you see them as a magnet that is bringing in, is helping to bring in incremental customers? And you talked about the value proposition of how you see that as being net accretive of to your business, but with a lot of those cloud providers already in the buildings and on many of your campuses, I’m just wondering why isn’t that a solution that you can provide directly for your customers, and where does a Megaport kind of fit into that equation?
Steve Smith: So, I guess, I can kind of start with - answer that question and then I’ll let Paul or Jeff kind of fill-in there. Overall as far as the likes of SDN providers in our buildings and the value that they bring there, I guess first question I guess is, relatively economic relationship we have there. I don’t think I can really get into too much detail there other than just letting you know that’s similar to other providers and carriers that are in our facilities. And we’re continuing to evolve that relationship. But it’s very important to us to maintain the strategy that we’ve had going forward which is really to provide a carrier neutral type of facility that provides our customers choice and flexibility as to how they interconnect to other networks as well as other cloud providers. And we look at those SDN providers as an extension of that. As to the value that they provide in our data centers, while we do have many of our direct on-ramps from many of the big cloud providers made up in our data centers feel like that brings significant value and differentiation in the marketplace. Having other connectivity options, we feel like it also benefits not only in providing access to those clouds and other networks but from campus to campus and just to other facilities around the world. So, it really just gives them more choice and more flexibility. And we feel like that’s a positive thing in just providing them more attractive options for those customers.
Paul Szurek: I would only add to what Steve said, reiterate our strategy of having ecosystems that provide all the options, all the business partners, all the various ways of interconnecting and getting around the world that our customers might conceivably need that openness has benefited us strategically. And we believe it will continue to do so going forward.
Matt Heinz: Okay. Thank you very much.
Steve Smith: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Some of your peers have discussed some business opportunities they continue to see in Europe and potentially there. What is your thinking as far as outside of the U.S. or see geographical needs, and at what point do you think that becomes more of a necessity for you?
Paul Szurek: To the extent we’re involved in international activities already, we’ve seen a large number of non-U.S. companies coming into our data centers. We do have a small percentage of our customers that like our platform, like our service levels and agreements and have asked us to look outside the U.S. But they also have a very cost conscious approach to it. So, we tried to address that with a curetted referral program and we continue to evolve and improve that. And that seems to be going well and seems to have an opportunity for improvement going forward. Perhaps more importantly we’re seeing an increasing volume of our customers who are going global via cloud or content providers or similar companies that are in our data centers that already have a global platform. And so we focus tremendously on making sure that they have the facilities and business partners they need in our data centers to go global, do that methodology.
Frank Louthan: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just quick follow-up. You mentioned the enterprise demand. When you’re looking at your pipeline, any particular verticals that you’re seeing more or less activity that we would expect if we look a year from now on this call that might have expanded as far as your exposure to any particular industries?
Steve Smith: Hi Frank, this is Steve, I’ll try to answer that for you. Just to kind of piggy-back on what Paul had just mentioned regarding whether it’s international expansion, or even domestic expansion. I think what we’re seeing is that customers are getting more and more sophisticated on how they evaluate and select a data center provider. And as such, as long as they’re looking for a deployment in our markets, we feel like we stand a very competitive opportunity to win that business and not being in more markets where even international business seems to be slowing us down winning those deployments. So just to give you a little bit of color there. Relative to industries and vertical strength across the board, I would say it’s very market-driven. As you look at industries that are most interested in New York are very different than they might be in LA versus the Bay Area versus even Virginia. So, we try to take a very pointed approach to ensure that we have a geographical focus into those markets trying to ensure that our data center as well as our operating there resonates well with the key industries that happen to be present there. And we continue to refine those efforts. But it’s just different from market to market.
Frank Louthan: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Rollins: Hi, good morning, and thanks. A couple if I could. First, as you’re looking at the development activity particularly in the newer campuses like Reston, how are you thinking about the interest to push in another strategic anchor tenant versus just building around the communities that you already have in the market? And then secondly, just from an M&A context, with the activity that’s been in the marketplace globally over the last year, are there any new thoughts in terms of what your aspirations are to participate in M&A to accelerate scale or accelerate the strategy, either as a buyer or a seller? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Thanks. Let me try to address those. The first question, I think as you saw both our VA2 expansion and our SV7 expansion, we have moved to a model of pre-leasing of new developments and new construction. And our preference for that type of pre-leasing is to find and sign out strategic anchors for those new developments, it’s worked very well in both of those cases. And we expect to continue to follow that model going forward including for the Reston expansion. As it relates to M&A, we believe we have a business model and a platform that has consistently delivered opportunities for attractive organic growth. And that’s how we design the company. And I think that’s consistent with how most studies have companies have guided for the best long-term shareholder value. I think this approach also enables us to provide more value to our customers because we deploy our capital where there are, growth and expansion needs are consistent with the scale that we have. Having said that we recognize that there are occasionally opportunities when M&A or other inorganic growth avenues can be very attractive. So, we study the vast majority of the opportunities that are out there with an open mind. We’re trying to discover opportunities to accelerate our ability to deliver value to customers and shareholders. Any transaction however would have to make sense strategically, culturally and mathematically, meaning, it would be good for our customers and would most likely be accretive to share value on a risk adjusted basis. I think I’ve kind of just restated what we’ve said at every quarterly call for the last couple of years. So I don’t think that indicates any real change in our approach. But I did want to make sure the philosophy behind it was well understood. And assure you that we don’t, we do look at this stuff and if good opportunities out there, we wouldn’t be averse to taking advantage of it.
Michael Rollins: Is, there any expectations that with some of the activity to date that that might help or hurt your sales funnel and ability to close deals?
Paul Szurek: Nothing that we have seen so far appears to be any threat to our sales funnel or our ability to close deals. Please remember we are focused our scale and our strength in these eight very strong markets. And we provide a fairly unique value proposition as well as kind of the hybrid flexibility for customers that need to scale in those markets. And we don’t see that changing with the M&A activity we’ve seen out there.
Michael Rollins: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.
Lukas Hartwich: My first question relates to the same-property results. I’m just looking at sequential MRR and occupancy growth, and it looked like it slowed down a little bit from the recent pace. And I’m just curious, is that noise, or are you running into a ceiling, particularly on the occupancy side of things, or what’s going on there?
Jeff Finnin: Hi Lukas, it’s Jeff. I would say that I don’t think we see anything that would prohibit us from continuing to lease up our same-store to beyond the 90% that we’re at today. There is nothing that physically limits us, the space is still there power and cooling capabilities are still there. So, there is nothing there that limits us from an infrastructure standpoint to continue to increase that leasing. As it relates to the overall growth on call it MRR per cab-E basis, you can see that overall based on the same-store pool we had an effect for 2016, produced very good results, increasing call it, 6% to 8% on average year-over-year. I think as you look forward, we would expect that MRR per cab-E growth to moderate a little bit just based upon the type of sales activity we had in the previous 12 months. But still healthy somewhere between 5% to 7% year-over-year, growth as we look forward just to give you some idea where we think it’s headed.
Lukas Hartwich: That’s really helpful. And then secondly, the development funding, the roughly $200 million there, is that going to come from additional debt issuance or how do you plan on funding that development?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, it’s just right in line with our prepared remarks. We’ve had about $165 million of debt capacity today and about $150 million of liquidity as we sit here at year-end. And so, obviously it will fund the development needed in the near term but we’re going to have to term-out some level of our credit facility. And we’ve guided to $150 million to $250 million of additional debt sometime here in the first half of 2017.
Lukas Hartwich: Right. So there’s like roughly a $200 million balance in the line right now. So the future debt issuance, I was thinking, was terming out that, and then you would add an additional $200 million. So is it basically there will still be I guess, yearend 2017 there will be a $200 million roughly balance on the line?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, ballpark just depending upon the pace of development. And you could see our CapEx that would give you some idea about where we would end up, that’s correct.
Lukas Hartwich: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Jon Petersen: Great. Thanks. A lot of people asked about M&A and your acquisition appetite. But I’m just kind of curious, whether it’s big deals or whether it’s just growing organically, your thoughts on being in Tier 2 markets versus Tier 1 markets. I think you’re generally kind of in the major markets. You are in Denver and Boston, you’ve had success there, and those are probably characterized as Tier 2 markets. How do you guys think about those markets within your portfolio and your appetite to further expand into other markets similar to like Denver and Boston?
Paul Szurek: I don’t know that I can add much to what I said earlier. The size of the market is important because of the scale that you can achieve. And also the resilience that you have going forward via diversity of customer base and kind of how tech reliant and data reliant the economy in a particular market is. Boston and Denver are both very strong tech and data economies. And because of their proximity to headquarters, in one case and our northeastern operations in the other case, we’re able to have a chief scale about the sales and the operating organizations in those markets. And we expect good growth in them in the future. Probably as important we were able to enter those markets at very attractive price points and begin the scale accordingly. So, when you think about scale and data dependence in the economy and the ability to have economies of scale in a market, Tier 2 markets are just harder to make the numbers work. And as you go down in the tiers, it gets progressively harder.
Jon Petersen: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Steve Smith: I would just add Jon is, if you look at our strategy around really the three pillars of enterprise, cloud and network, having a heavy density of all three of those factors is important. And as Paul mentioned in Denver and Boston, those are hi-tech centric and fast growing markets already. So, we see good growth there. But also interconnection is critical too and Denver specifically being the intersection of fiber back-bone that crisscrosses the country speaks to that well as far as the attractiveness to cloud and network providers providing services here as well as Boston. So, they’re a bit unique in that regard.
Jon Petersen: Okay. And I don’t think I’ve heard you guys talk about this, but your recurring CapEx mid-point is $15 million this year. That’s more than double what it was in 2016 or kind of higher than it’s ever been. What’s the driver for that in 2017?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, Jon this is Jeff. It’s one of those areas where we just believe as the number of kilowatts that we have in our portfolio increase, it is going to drive an increased level of recurring CapEx, that’s just the expectation that we have. And that’s kind of how we manage and model it. But it’s slowly driven on the number of kilowatts we have deployed out through our portfolio. When you look at how much of those kilowatts commenced during 2016, we’re just expecting to have some recurring CapEx increase over prior years.
Jon Petersen: Okay. And then just one more. I think you guys talked about this, but I just want to make sure I understand it. So, last quarter on the call you talked about how there would be 125 basis points of churn in the fourth quarter. I think in your prepared remarks you talked about how there would be some in early 2017. I’m trying to figure out, did the 125 basis points you talked about last quarter - did that actually occur this quarter? Is it part of the 1.9%, or did it get pushed to next year?
Jeff Finnin: It did occur and Steve alluded to it in his prepared remarks. We actually ended up having a total on that particular customer of 135 basis points. So just slightly higher than what we had anticipated. But that did actually occur in Q4. So absent that customer, actually churn results were fairly good in Q4 when you look at our long-term average to somewhere between 1% to 2%. The other component that you’re probably referring to and I alluded to, it some elevated churn in Q2, which is about an incremental 180 basis points which is the last component of our original customer at SV3 that will burn off. And that is about $4.2 million of annualized rent that will terminate in the second quarter of ‘17.
Paul Szurek: And that’s not new churn. We preannounced that churn in other calls.
Jeff Finnin: Yes.
Jon Petersen: Right, okay. Got it. All right, thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
Jeff Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is a follow-up from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Finnin: Hi Jordan, we can’t hear you. If you’re talking you might check your mute button.
Jordan Sadler: Sorry about that. I tried to queue out. But while I’m here, you guys mentioned, I think, $30 million of commencements are basically what’s budgeted into the guidance for next year. Is that the right number?
Jeff Finnin: That’s accurate.
Jordan Sadler: And so I guess the right way to think about that from a modeling perspective is a ratable commencement schedule throughout the year with that 40% flow-through that you guys mentioned to FFO?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, I think that’s fair Jordan. The only real visibility we have as we sit here today, as we mentioned. When we look at our backlog, GAAP backlog of $5 million at the end of the year, and we expect substantially all of that to commence in the first half - the first quarter of the year. So, then everything else would commence subsequent to that.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. I guess the one I was curious about the delta between the cash and the GAAP this quarter. It seems pretty significant. The cash is an extra $10 million. And then separately I thought it was a little bit striking, $35 million of commencements this quarter alone, and for the full year next year you’re modeling $30 million in commencements. I know SV7 was a huge part of that. You don’t have another one of those in the till. But I guess the question really is, is there another CSP out there potentially that you’re not baking into the number but certainly could hit this year?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, I think the number, the decrease in the number, just look back at our backlog and just go back to where we started 2016. And as we migrated through the year those backlog numbers were very substantial and that’s largely due to the fact of the preleasing that occurred at SV7 and some of our other developments and as Paul alluded to earlier. As we sit here today, you just look at what we have under development. We just don’t have enormous amount of space under development right now. We’re obviously planning things as it relates to Reston and as Paul and Steve both, alluded to we would look to try and drive some anchor customer there to help kick-start the cash flow soon upon completion of that construction. So, I just think as we sit here today I can’t give you that golden, we’re looking forward but we hope to find it somewhere as we migrate through the year and we’ll see how we operate here.
Paul Szurek: Jordan I’m glad you asked that question because it’s probably worth reminding everybody. I know that it’s real important the way most of you look at companies and do your job. And we, as we see reporting we all have to report quarter-by-quarter. And in those results are important. But this business doesn’t really run on a quarter-to-quarter cycle. I mean the transaction engine does and that stays pretty consistent from quarter-to-quarter and it’s generally been on an upward trend for the last three years. But other parts of the business, the hybrid part of our business where we take on larger deployments is lumpy and also less predictable. So as you look at the business going forward, I think Jeff’s given you the best guidance we can give. And we continue to believe that there will be good opportunities that may enable us to outperform. But we can’t predict those.
Jordan Sadler: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks Jordan.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time I will now turn the floor back to Mr. Paul Szurek for closing comments.
Paul Szurek: First I’d like to thank all of you for your interest in the company and participating in this call. And we appreciate it very much. Steve and Jeff and I would like to thank our colleague for a great 2016 and congratulate them on an excellent year. We’re looking forward to the rest of 2017. We have many opportunities and a lot of work ahead of us. And again, thank you for your interest. And have a great rest of your day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-10-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to CoreSite Realty Corporation Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Greer Aviv. Thank you. You may now begin.
Greer Aviv: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, our President and CEO; Steve Smith, our Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans, or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Szurek: Good morning and thank you for taking time to join us today. I'm glad to be here this morning to share our third quarter financial and operational results with you. Before we jump into those results, I wanted to take a few minutes to share some thoughts with you on my first CoreSite earnings call. First, let me start by thanking the CoreSite team for all of its dedication and hard work which is reflected in our solid third quarter performance. The continued execution and accomplishments of this organization are a tribute to the team and culture recruited and cultivated by Tom Ray during his 15 years at the helm of CoreSite and its predecessors. Our continued success will be driven by the strength of this team and the power of our strategy. CoreSite will continue to focus on being a differentiated hybrid provider of performance sensitive turnkey co-location in major markets with strong and diverse growth drivers and sustainable demand. We have the efficiency to accommodate high volumes of smaller deployments and the scalability for larger deployments that are performance or market sensitive. Our strategy takes advantage of our deep footprint in existing markets where we have scale and operating efficiencies which provide a template for incremental opportunities to deploy capital consistent with our strategic and economic value adding discipline. Additionally on behalf of the Board of Directors and the rest of the CoreSite team, I would like to warmly welcome Kelly Chambliss to our board. Kelly is currently the General Manager and Managing Partner of the distribution sector within IBM, Global Business Services, North America. And prior to that she served as the Global Chief Technology Officer to IBM Global Business Services with a focus on the development, marketing, sales, and delivery of cloud based solutions. We are excited to have Kelly join the CoreSite board as her leadership and expertise in the technology industry will further strengthen our board's breadth of talent and experience. Additionally, her in-depth knowledge of the enterprise market will be a wonderful asset to CoreSite as we continue to enhance our go-to-market strategy around this vertical. With that I will now turn to our third quarter results. In Q3, we delivered another quarter of solid financial and operational performance. Compared to Q3 2015 we reported 22% growth in FFO per share, driven by 17% growth in revenue and 90% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Our margins continue to show expansion in the third quarter with our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 52.4% measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q3 2016. This represents an increase of 205 basis points over the comparable period ending with and including Q3 2015 and is a record level for CoreSite. With regard to leasing during the third quarter we executed new and expansion leases totaling 60,000 square feet representing $11.2 million in annualized GAAP rent at an average GAAP rental rate of $187 per square foot. We are pleased with the composition of leasing this quarter which saw a record amount of leasing in our core retail co-location business consisting of leases that are 5,000 square feet or less. Steve will provide some additional detail around the lease size when he reviews our sales results. Regarding the geographic composition of our new and expansion leasing in the quarter, lease executions were well distributed across our portfolio. With our strongest signings in terms of annualized GAAP rent, occurring in Los Angeles, Northern Virginia, DC, and Silicon Valley. The number of leases signed in the quarter was also well distributed across our three verticals with our network, cloud, and enterprise verticals representing 30%, 26%, and 44% of leases signed respectively. Transaction count in Q3 was strong again with 162 new and expansion leases signed. At a high level 91% of new and expansion leases were for less than 1,000 square feet each in line with the historical average of 90% to 95%. We will continue to focus on increasing the number of transactions amongst solid deployments tend to drive increased cost to net volume and revenue per square foot and per kilowatt. Turning to our interconnection results, Q3 interconnection revenue increased 17% over the prior year third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, interconnection revenue is up 21% versus the comparable year ago period slightly ahead of the high-end of our full year guidance of an increase of 17% to 19%. Third quarter interconnection revenue was again driven by solid growth in the volume of fiber cross connects as well as strong growth in cross connects related to the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange and our blended IP offering. Specifically Q3 total interconnection volume growth of 12.5% is comprised of 18% growth in fiber cross connects and 15% growth in logical interconnection services including the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange and our Any2 Exchange for Internet peering which increased 46% and 12% year-over-year respectively. We believe that the market continues to positively respond to the strong and accelerating network density across our platform as well as our diverse communities of interest that make up our customer base which should continue to drive interconnection volume growth. The momentum that we've seen within our cloud vertical continued in the third quarter with 42 new and expansion leases signed approximately 15% of which were new logos as we continue to attract cloud service providers to our already robust community. We generally see increased volume of edge deployments with public cloud providers which served as a magnet for enterprises looking to establish a hybrid or multi-cloud architecture for their IT needs and which drive further cross connect volume growth. In Q3, we experienced nearly 50% year-over-year growth in interconnections generated by our public cloud partners. To that point, during Q3 we announced the availability of direct private connectivity into Microsoft Azure via ExpressRoute from our New York data center campus. This is in addition to the direct connectivity at our Los Angeles campus that we announced earlier in the year. Customers in Los Angeles and New York can now connect directly to Microsoft Azure via the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange which provides private security enhanced virtual connections and on-demand provisioning with increased reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies. Steve will provide additional detail on the activity we are seeing in the cloud vertical which remains very healthy across our platform. We continue to provide our customers with easy and flexible solutions to integrate their existing architecture with public and private cloud services. I will now move on to provide our outlook for our key markets. Our high level view of total supply and demand is consistent with that of last quarter. While we have seen puts and takes in certain markets, we believe that the overall picture in our markets remains well balanced. Regarding our core co-location market segment, we continue to see consistent growth in terms of the pace of leasing, while pricing remains stable to slightly up across our eight markets. We have seen solid demand for performance sensitive co-location solutions from each of our key verticals of network providers, cloud service providers, and enterprises. More specifically, the Bay area continues to benefit from strong underlying demand trends. We have recently announced the opening of SV7 in early Q4 with 62% of the 230,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity leased the highest lease percentage with which we have ever opened a new multi-tenant building. SV7 represents the largest ground up development in our history and it's a job well done by our construction team. As of the end of Q3, we had 110,000 square feet available across the Silicon Valley market correlating to approximately two years of available supply at normalized absorption rates. We remain encouraged by the demand we are seeing across our Silicon Valley assets and continue to look at future expansion in this market. In Northern Virginia demand continues to be extremely strong, our pace of leasing investing continues to be steady bringing stabilized occupancy at that campus to 96.8%. As of the end of Q3, we had approximately 67,000 square feet available for lease investing while our typical annual absorption in that market has been between 32,000 and 45,000 square feet. With this in mind, we are looking forward to closing on our acquisition of Sunrise Technology Park in the fourth quarter with commencement later in 2017 of construction of Phase 1 of the master plan development. We anticipate that Phase 1 will be comprised of redeveloping an existing 48,000 square foot industrial building for data center use, building a ground up 92,000 square foot data center shell, and building a 92,000 square foot structure to house centralized infrastructure intended to support leads across the planned four build-out of campus. With a solid leasing pipeline, we are excited about the expansion of our Reston campus as we leverage the scale, management team and customer base at our existing assets. We have started development on 8,000 square feet of space at our DE1 facility in Denver where demand has been strong with market absorption in the first half of 2016 estimated to have increased 40% over the first half of 2015. We have been in full occupancy at DE1 for few quarters now and this expansion should allow us to successfully meet the needs of the performance sensitive co-location requirements in the Denver market. Chicago also continues to see solid demand. One market we continue to watch closely is the New York, New Jersey market which has seen a decline in absorption through the first six months of 2016. However, we do see steady demand from smaller customer requirements with the majority of these deployments consisting of customers that fall into our enterprise verticals. In summary, we are pleased to report another solid quarter. We continue to execute our business plan efficiently and effectively in terms of leasing momentum, development, and increasing the value of our network dense cloud enabled platform of assets by enhancing and diversifying our customer base. We are pleased that the achievements of our strong organization are reflected in our financial and operational results and we remain committed to generating strong returns for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks, Paul. I will be reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activities during the third quarter, and then I discuss in more detail our vertical and geographic results. Our Q3 new and expansion sales totaled $11.2 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 60,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $187 per square foot. Regarding the composition of our new and expansion leasing our deployment size we have added incremental disclosures in the Q3 earnings supplemental to give you more insight into the performance of both the core retail co-location leasing as well as larger leases. We're looking at new and expansion leases signed of 5,000 square feet or less, total annualized GAAP rent was $9.1 million in Q3, a company record for this category and an increase of 60% compared to the trailing 12-month average. This category represents our core leasing activity which tends to be more consistent from quarter-to-quarter. The larger wholesale deals which we opportunistically pursue tend to be signed in volumes which vary more greatly from quarter-to-quarter. The detailed disclosure around leasing by deployment size can be seen in the third quarter earnings supplemental on Page 15. Transaction count for the quarter was 162 leases, 9% ahead of the trailing 12-months average. Q3 new and expansion signings were again weighted towards our core retail co-location business, with 148 leases executed at less than 1,000 square feet each. We also saw consistent pace of leasing amongst mid-sized customer requirements in Q3 when compared to Q2 with 12 new and expansion leases signed are between 1,000 and 5,000 square feet and two leases in excess of 5,000 square feet each. Our overarching strategy remains intact as we continue our efforts to attract customers that value high performance, low latency solutions, which can contribute to and benefit from our diverse communities of interest across our data center platform. To that end, our targeted efforts to diversify and expand our customer base have been bearing fruit, with nearly 80% of our new logos in Q3 distributed across our four largest markets. As it relates to our vertical diversification, 66% of our new logos were in enterprise vertical. Included within this group of new enterprise customers was a large international financial institution, a leading national healthcare organization, and a leading international news agency. The other customer churn we added 10 net new logos in Q3 and 54 net new logos year-to-date. Beyond our new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q3 was also solid as renewals totaled approximately 76,700 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $142 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 4% on a cash basis and 6.8% on a GAAP basis. Year-to-date our cash rent growth is 4.2% slightly ahead of mid-point of our guidance. Churn in the quarter was 2.2% which included 160 basis points of churn related to an expected customer move-out of VA1 where the customer's application had reached end of life. This customer's lease was set to expire in January of 2017 and we mutually agreed to accelerate that expiration to accommodate the customer's needs. We are also able to retain favorable economics associated with the initial lease while freeing out needed space at VA1 given demand in that market. Since then, we already have backfilled approximately 30% of vacated space and believe we will be able to release remaining space in a timely and profitable manner. Excluding those move-out churn would have been 0.6%. Regarding our vertical mix during Q3 network and cloud customers signed 90 new and expansion leases representing 56% of our total transaction count. In addition to the expansion of Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute connectivity announced earlier this quarter, another leading public cloud provider deployed new data node in our Boston facility. And another one of the top four public cloud providers established a new edge node in our Virginia campus enabling private, secure, low-latency, connectivity to its cloud platform. Also in Virginia, we signed an expansion for a new edge node with a leading video platform for the gaming community. Lastly, we signed an expansion with a large enterprise content management platform in the Bay area supporting its production operation. Once again, these applications reflect the best of our cloud service community, the robust number of participants, and the value of these leading cloud on our technology partners provide to the ecosystem and enterprise within our data centers. Regarding our network vertical, similar to Q2 and Q3 we saw strong performance with new and expansion leasing distributed across every market and almost every available data center. In Q3, the majority of our executive leases came from expansion of existing number of deployments which speaks to our ecosystem continuing to grow and provide opportunities for networks to deliver solutions to our enterprises, content, and cloud customers. We believe this trend reinforces the importance of network density as our non-network customers' benefit from the robust set of solutions and services available from the network community that we have built over time. Turning to our enterprise vertical, we saw strong performance in the quarter, with this vertical accounting for 44% of new and expansion leases signed. This strength was led by general enterprises and digital content including a large public utility which is relocating its existing private on-premise production data center to CoreSite's Los Angeles campus in order to gain better power efficiency, reliability, and higher densities for its refreshed infrastructure. In addition, we signed an expansion with a leading ad exchange and a new healthcare provider chose CoreSite in part to enable direct connection to IDM software at our Los Angeles campus. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases during Q3 were Los Angeles, Northern Virginia DC, and Silicon Valley collectively representing 87% of annualized GAAP rent signed and 73% of leases executed in the quarter. In Los Angeles demand was solid and we continue to see favorable pricing dynamics. Similar to last quarter, lease signings at LA2 accounted for 60% of new and expansion leases executed in Q3 in the Los Angeles market, while 87% of our annualized GAAP rent signed in Q3 was generated from this building. In terms of verticals network was our strongest in this market accounting for 36% of leases executed followed by digital content and cloud. Same way as occupancy across the LA campus was 9% at the end of Q3 up 190 basis points compared to Q2, while pre-stabilized occupancy increased to 15.6% from 3.6% last quarter. We currently have an incremental 4,700 net rentable square feet under construction at LA2 which is 100% preleased to a new enterprise customer. Turning attention to the Bay Area, it also remained strong with new and expansion leases signed in all of our buildings that have available space in this market. Stabilized occupancy across the Silicon Valley market increased 350 basis points to 95.6%. As Paul mentioned, SV7 opened in early Q4 had 62% leased. In terms of verticals, Q3 lease executions in this market were weighted towards cloud deployments followed by networks and general enterprises. In Northern Virginia DC, we continue to see very good transaction volume with 37 new and expansion leases signed across the market which is a record level in that market. Good demand among smaller requirements continued with 84% of new and expansion leases signed in this market below 1,000 square feet, with the remainder of the leases executed for mid-sized deployments. Demand was driven by enterprise customers followed by digital content and networks which continued new logo growth at the campus and reaching the overall customer community. Stabilized occupancy across the market now stands at 96.2%, a decrease of 70 basis points on a sequential basis primarily related to the customer move-out at VA1 I discussed earlier. In the New York, New Jersey market, we continue to see consistent demand for smaller requirements with all 11 leases signed in the quarter below 1,000 square feet. Leasing was driven by network customers followed by digital content and enterprise including three new enterprise logos. Stabilized occupancy across the campus increased 80 basis points sequentially to 85.2% with increases at both NY1 and NY2. Pre-stabilized occupancy at NY2 is now 44.4% compared to 27.8% last quarter. In summary, our Q3 sales performance was solid and we believe it demonstrates the strength and health of our core retail co-location business. We believe that CoreSite remains favorably positioned with our industry and that our supply and demand dynamics across our markets are ideally well balanced. We remain focused on enhancing our value to our customers, partners, and shareholders by providing network diversity, cloud density, and superior customer service in support of performance sensitive applications. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. I will begin by remarks today by reviewing our Q3 financial results. Second I will update you on our development CapEx and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And third, I will discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Q3 financial performance reflects total operating revenues of $101.3 million correlating to a 5.4% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 17.2% increase over the prior year quarter. Q3 operating revenue consisted of $83.1 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 5.5% on a sequential quarter basis and 17.5% year-over-year. Interconnection contributed $13.3 million to operating revenues in Q3, an increase of 3.1% on a sequential quarter basis and 17.3% year-over-year. And tenant reimbursement and other revenues were $2.8 million including the $1 million lease termination fees Steve mentioned earlier. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million. Q3 FFO was $0.90 per diluted share in unit an increase of 1.1% on a sequential quarter basis and 21.6% year-over-year. As it relates to FFO, in the third quarter we recorded two items that impacted FFO. One related to revenue and the other associated with expenses. On the revenue side, we received $1 million or $0.02 per share from the lease termination agreement executed in connection with the VA1 customer move-out. A majority of the revenue was offset by expenses associated with the CEO transition, including travel and introductory meetings with stakeholders, new director recruitment and related manners, as well as transaction and legal costs in Q3 amounting to approximately $0.015 per share during Q3. Adjusted EBITDA of $52.1 million increased 1.9% on a sequential quarter basis and 19.3% over the same quarter last year. Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter totaled $4.5 million or 4.4% of total operating revenues. General and administrative expenses were $9.4 million in Q3 correlating to 9.3% of total operating revenues slightly ahead of our guidance for the year and reflecting the additional expenses I just mentioned. Regarding our same-store metrics, Q3 same-store turnkey data center occupancy increased 650 basis points to 89.6% from 83.1% in the third quarter of 2015. Additionally same-store MRR for cabinet equivalent increased 7.6% year-over-year and 2.8% sequentially to $1,519. On a per unit basis year-over-year growth is largely being driven by growth in our interconnection and power revenues. Lastly, we commenced 50,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $148 per square foot which represents $7.5 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the third quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 93.7% an increase of a 170 basis points compared to the second quarter, with increases in occupancy across nearly all of our data centers. Including leases that were signed but not yet commenced stabilized data center occupancy would be 94.3%. As we have previously discussed we define stabilization as the earlier to occur of 85% occupancy and 24 months after an asset is placed into service. As of the end of the third quarter, 11,600 square feet at Chicago 1 moved into our stabilized core at 87% occupancy. Turning now to backlog. Projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $33 million as of September 30, 2016, or $36 million on a cash basis. Approximately 89% or $29.4 million of the GAAP backlog is expected to commence in the fourth quarter with the impact of the commencing leases weighted to the last two-thirds of the quarter. Turning to our development activity, we had a total of 243,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity under construction as of September 30, 2016, the majority of which was at SV7 in Santa Clara. We estimated total investment of $225.5 million required to complete these projects of which $210.5 million have been incurred through the end of Q3. SV7 opened in early Q4 with a total expected cost of $211 million, higher than our initial estimated project cost of $190 million. This increase was primarily driven by the acceleration of the development of the entire building based on the strong pre-leasing we executed at SV7. As of the end of the third quarter we had approximately 8,000 net rentable square feet of turnkey data centre capacity under development at DE1 and we had incurred $2 million of the estimated $12.5 million required to complete this expansion and expect to substantially complete construction in the second quarter of 2017. At LA2, we had 4,700 net rentable square feet under construction which is 100% pre-leased. As of September 30, we had incurred approximately $0.4 million of the estimated $2 million required to complete this project and expected to deliver the capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016 with the lease associated with this build-out to commence in late Q4. As shown on page 23 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized in Q3 was 32.9%. Through the first nine months of 2016 the percentage of interest capitalized was approximately 31% and we expect the percentage of interest capitalized for the full year to be approximately 25%. Turning to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, our ratio of net principal debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.8 times including preferred stock, the ratio was 3.4 times. While this is above the Q2 level, it remains below our stated target ratio of approximately four times. Including preferred stock, the Q3 level correlates to incremental debt capacity of approximately $130 million at September 30 based upon Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Finally, we are increasing our 2016 FFO guidance to a range of $3.61 to $3.65 per share in OP unit compared to the previous range of $3.56 to $3.64 per share in OP unit, an increase of approximately 1% based on the mid-point of both ranges. The increased guidance reflects our performance year-to-date as well as the expectation for improved revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and favorable product mix. We now expect revenue to be $396 million to $400 million while adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be $208 million to $212 million compared to the previous range of $205 million to $213 million. This updated guidance now implies a full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 52.8%, 20 basis points above the previous guidance. We have maintained our guidance for general and administrative expenses as we continue to leverage the scale of our current footprint. Churn for the full year is now estimated to be 6.5% to 8.5%, an increase of 50 basis points at the mid-point as compared to previous guidance. This increase is being driven by multi-site customer that is expected to vacate a number of their deployments with us during the fourth quarter with expected churn of approximately 125 basis points, in addition to our normal quarterly churn of 1% to 2%. If this customer does vacate as expected in Q4, our full year churns will be at the upper end of our guidance range. Regarding these specific deployments, we believe we can re-lease the space at favorable economics. We are increasing our guidance for 2016 total capital expenditures by $80 million to a range of $322.5 million to $367.5 million primarily to reflect the expected closing of the previously discussed acquisition for the expansion of the Reston campus. All other guidance metrics remain unchanged and a detailed summary of our 2016 guidance items can be found on Page 25 of the third quarter earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our market as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor any changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions, or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. Now we would like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead with your questions.
Colby Synesael: Great. Paul I think you can give us a little bit of color on your view of the company's current capital structure and when I look at where I think your leverage is going to go over the next year may be 18 months, it seems like you will be under-levered relative to what your stated goal is around that fortune mark. Is there any way to potentially accelerate the capital return to shareholders and just how do you think about that perhaps now that you're obviously in the CEO spot? And then my second question has to do with expansions, relative to where you guys are seeing demand across your strongest markets, how comfortable are you right now with the land banks that you have and your ability to build-out fast and ultimately to sustain the level of growth that you would like to for the company? Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Colby, thanks for the questions. As it relates to our capital structure, I think we're tracking consistent with our strategy as you can see from our portfolio and the activities that we have ongoing, we have some very good opportunities to deploy capital in our markets. I think we are very careful and thoughtful with our dividend strategy. We announced that later on in this quarter but I think that you won't see us do anything with our balance sheet that is inconsistent with our historical practice.
Jeff Finnin: Colby, let me just add a little bit of commentary on that as you think about our leverage obviously we've given you visibility the on CapEx through the end of this year and obviously we'll give you more visibility as it relates to 2017 in February. But the biggest lever they get told associated with that ultimate leverage is the pace in which we deploy capital. We'll obviously give you more visibility into that in our February call. On to the next one which relate to expansion in land bank.
Paul Szurek: We as you look across our market and you see in the supplemental we have significant capacity within our existing portfolio to expand not counting the new acquisition in Reston; we can expand within our existing footprint approximately 50% in terms of occupied data center space. Including the Reston land which we expect to close in the next couple of weeks that increases to about 76%. We do have some markets as I mentioned where we see our supply lasting for up to two years and in those markets we will continue to look for opportunities to expand beyond the that two-year period. I hope that helps with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great, thank you.
Steve Smith: Hey, Colby one more thing to think about as you look at our land bank, we have provided some information, it's not in our supplemental but it is on our Investor Presentation it's on our website and we'll put in the updated information here soon before we head on the road to NAREIT and other conferences. But it does give you a very good idea based on the pace of our absorption over the last two or four years by market expected how much remaining capacity we have in each of those marketplaces. It's a very good reference point as you think about our expansion as we move forward by market.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you for taking the question. Good morning.
Paul Szurek: Good morning.
Jordan Sadler: So my first question relates to the company's strategic position Paul this is, our first call with you hosting and I'm curious as you look at across the company's product portfolio and/or markets, if you are comfortable with how the company is positioned and/or if there any changes or tweaks that you'd like to see?
Paul Szurek: Jordan, we are very comfortable. The strategy that we have been deploying and following of having scale in major markets with diverse drivers, data center demand, coupled with our teams ability to execute and meet the requirements of those customers and the effectiveness of our go-to-market team that Steve leads has generated very good results so far and we're optimistic about what it means going forward. We're in very good markets with the right product we are able to meet both retail co-location demand and the needs of those customers that need to scale in those markets, and is driven by that the population and the enterprise strength and the numbers in growth of both the universe of enterprises and growth within enterprises in those markets. And the leasing results for the quarter were really strong, forward-looking. We've got a great base to build from this quarter as Jeff mentioned we've got $29.4 million of lease revenues commencing in this quarter. We just finished SV7 and demand for the remaining space there seems very strong in that market. And in our other markets we continue to see very good strength and we gave you a good overview where we are with those. So I think the strategy of being in the right markets and having the scale to be meaningful and relevant to those -- to customers in those markets and having the ability to meet their needs is continuing to work and we'll continue to work.
Jordan Sadler: Along as a follow-up along similar lines geographically the company has added markets over time and has contemplated international expansion now and again but has never really stepping to that domain. What are your thoughts on the need to be a global player?
Paul Szurek: I don't think we need that to be successful as a company. I think being in the right U.S. markets with the right scale and the right ability to produce is sufficient to be a very strong company for many, many years to come.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Manny Korchman with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.
Manny Korchman: Hi everyone. If we look at your -- the newest announcement of Reston or the prime announcement of Reston, it seems like you're doing a lot of development upfront, why retrofit is building and build another two buildings rather than sort of taking a step at a time, you already have tenant requirements that facilitate that or need that?
Paul Szurek: Well I think the way that we're planning out the new addition of the Reston campus is based on a long-term view of the most efficient way to build and deliver power and give us advantages in leasing where cost and distribution of power and cooling are very important. And that's the reason why we're at including this 92,000 square foot infrastructure building at the beginning of the project. We have to get that in place at the front end. We do see very good demand in that market. As you know we will get some leasing in place before we start commencement -- before we commence construction of this project and we're optimistic about that.
Manny Korchman: Great and then the customer you mentioned is probably moving out in 4Q, can you just give us an idea of what's going on in their business they have chosen not to renew with you?
Paul Szurek: It's -- this happened in the data center business deployment people sign up for data center space for specific deployments frequently not all the time and when those deployments reach their end of life unless there is another purpose for that customer to use that space they move on and that's part of the churn that we have, we have periodically throughout our portfolio and more often than not and I think as Steve mentioned in this case, we see as presenting opportunities as supposed to problems.
Steve Smith: And Manny, this is Steve. I will just add little bit of color there relative to the customer we've been working with them for quite some time and been a good customer over time but as they've matured and we've matured, we have seen opportunity to improve our situation and based off the market conditions and potentially improve our economics on that space and they also have all their alternatives as well. So it's no surprise, something we've been working at over time and we think it's in the best interest of both parties.
Manny Korchman: Steve, if you were to rent that space on a like-to-like basis, what would the change in rent be just not doing anything else not making smaller or bigger et cetera?
Steve Smith: Yes I really can't get into the specifics around current leases or future leasing but we're optimistic on the outcome.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes I had a couple of kind of micro questions on a couple of markets and then a question on cross connects. So in Santa Clara the SV7 opening was delayed by just may be two to three weeks, I just wonder with some of the factors were there as it just spillover from late 3Q into 4Q. And then on VA3 I just wondered your thoughts do you look for a larger anchor or do you just sort of see as a continuation of VA1 and 2 and go with smaller deals? And then with respect to expansion in other markets, I was interested in Chicago for which there is obviously a lot of demand, what the sector at large is seeing and as you think about adding another locations would you be thinking about Downtown or Suburbs or any kind of pre-elections there. And then just a kind of turning to my last question which is around cross connects you mentioned ExpressRoute and direct connect and Open Cloud Exchanges and so forth and I just wondered can you remind us are you partnering with Megaport or Console or any of those types of companies, are they competitors would you potentially be a host or partner with one of them any thoughts around that I would appreciate? Thank you.
Paul Szurek: Thanks, John. As it relates to SV7 you are right there was a slight delay there I suspect that is the primary driver of a -- the miss on the consensus. Two reasons for that delay the best and good reason was that we had a significant change and scope due to extensive pre-leasing, so we had to change the construction plan in mid course which is hard to do without some delay. There was one also one municipal issue that we work through and that caused a couple weeks delay itself. So those were the reasons. Really pleased with that building I hope you have chance to come out and tour it sometime in the not too distant future.
Jonathan Atkin: I drove by it and it's bursting at the same, I can tell you. Thanks.
Paul Szurek: Good thanks for that endorsement. VA3 the source of the tenant for that will be a combination of spillover demand from tenants in our existing Virginia campus along with new tenants of various sizes and we will have space where we will continue to be able to push our core retail co-location business in that part of the campus. As it relates to Chicago a very good market for us. We've continued to grow in that space. We have some additional capacity to grow there. Beyond that we tend to not to get too much into future plans in specific markets and I think we're going to stick with that but we do like that market and it's a good market. In terms of the cross connection I'm going to turn that over to Jeff and Steve and let them give you the specifics regarding the dynamics there.
Steve Smith: Hey Jonathan if you don't mind could you just repeat your question on cross connects. I think it was referenced to cross connects and cloud providers whether we're partnering with anyone?
Jonathan Atkin: Yes, I mean there is companies out there like what Megaport and Console that basically stitch together these sort of the interconnect platforms and I think some of your competitors are leveraging these tools to better position their own data centers for connectivity and I wasn't sure whether you also do that or view that as an opportunity or not?
Paul Szurek: Yes, we have Brian Warren SVP of Product take that.
Brian Warren: Yes, Jonathan, let me just address that so number of those folks are here referencing our customers of CoreSite. And when you look at their service offering and frankly the service offering in many of the carriers they are deployed in our sites whether that be the global carriers national or regional, they are offering a sort of lack of Ethernet connectivity platform that's what kind of Megaport and Console are doing. I guess I'll do that as complementary in product line similar to like I say those other global and national carriers. They are deployed with CoreSite. We have our customer base that leverages them for secure connectivity into the cloud that's a component of offering of the multi-tenant data center. So I just think it's a very complimentary offering.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Barry McCarver with Stephens. Please state your question
Barry McCarver: Hey good morning guys and thanks for taking questions. I guess I want to focus little bit on just your guidance for the full year. If I take that the mid-point of your guidance range for revenue and EBITDA it certainly looks like you are expecting a pretty big 4Q in terms of sequential revenue growth in margins. Can you give us a little bit more color about what revenue segments might provide that? Thanks.
JeffFinnin: Yes, good morning Barry, it's Jeff and yes, I think key to Q4 I think you just look at the guidance and our results year-to-date taking the mid-point from a FFO perspective I think gives an implied FFO per share of $0.98. If most importantly related to the growth in our revenues and ultimately our earnings is the backlog that we currently have of which $29.4 million on an annualized basis will be commencing in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind on my prepared remarks I did say of that amount about it will be back in order in the quarter, so assuming it's got about the last two-thirds of the quarter in terms of its commencement timing. But that is largely attributable to the leases and customers we've signed up at SV7 which ultimately the completion was obviously, the commencement was dependent upon the completion of the building. So that gives you some idea in terms of what that is unless Steve will add any incremental color to the customers.
Steve Smith: I think you said it well Jeff and while we had just come out of commencements and we had strong sales results for the last quarter as well as the prior quarter but really opening up SV7 and getting those leases commenced as well and some other leases is really what's attributing to the difference.
Barry McCarver: Would you think this rental revenue bucket is where most of that fall or would you see any kind of change in cloud revenue or interconnection as well?
Paul Szurek: Well the numbers we give you in terms of the backlog that $29.4 million that is all rental revenue. So annualize that and take, I'm sorry that's an annualized amount, so just take a pro rate share for the last two of -- two months out of that quarter. Obviously to the extent they do deploy and get their gearing, there will be some incremental revenue associated with power draws on those deployments. Most of that is a metered model and so you will see some revenue associated with that but most of that power revenue won't be dropped into the bottom-line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Louthan: Great, thank you. You mentioned that 50% growth in cross connect and your cloud customers where do you think that has room to grow and going forward and how long should we continue to see growth like that with cross connect?
Jeff Finnin: Hi Frank I think it's a little bit choppy but I think you're asking about our 12.5% volume growth on cross connects, it is that accurate? I will assume it is. As it relates to the quarter we did have volume growth of 12.5%. Our overall revenue growth Q3 over the Q3 of the previous year were 17.3%. If you look at where we've been historically, if you take full year of 2015 over 2014 that volume growth was 12.9%. So that the volume growth we had this quarter is consistent with where it was full year 2015 over 2014 and that growth in the third quarter is lower than what it was in Q1 and Q2 of this year but the first half of this year we had, I think outperformed based upon where we thought it was going to be. So how much longer does it have to go? We hope for a while but a lot of that is dependent upon Steve and his team are continuing to attract and address those deployments to drive that cross connect entity which obviously relates back to the strategy Paul alluded to earlier.
Steve Smith: And Frank if I'm not sure if you dropped or not but I think part of your question was related to Cloud, cross connect growth and 50% is that sustainable? I think that depends well and a couple of factors are playing into that. One is that from a overall cloud maturity perspective that market is still fairly early in the innings. So we're seeing strong growth there and we're also seeing it on a fairly low number, so as that number gets bigger maintaining that growth rate gets more challenging. However we are seeing pretty significant growth overall in the cloud space as you've seen across the market and we're encouraged with the growth in that setting. So early innings but we're optimistic and we don't see diminishing in the near-term.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Lukas Hartwich, Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Lukas Hartwich: Hey I just have a quick one, the OpEx line was up fair amount this quarter was that related to the SV7 or was there anything else going on there was driving that?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, if we did have some of the some repair and maintenance expense during the quarter related to a couple items we had to care of. If you just look at some of the disclosures in our supplemental you can see was up about $700,000 or about 25% over the trailing 12-months so that largely contributed to some of that. In addition you also get in that third quarter you get typically get a little bit higher power expense because it's got the seasonality in the rates in the third quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Jordan Sadler: Hi just circling back on Reston for a second if I may, what is the nature of the targeted tenancy for campus of that scale and the targeted return?
Paul Szurek: Jordan, as of latter, we kind of typically expressed a target of a exceeding 12% return on cost on an adjusted EBITDA basis once we get to stabilization of assets. We tended to better than that but that's our target. In terms of the tenant mix I think you will see a mix very similar to what you're seeing throughout our major markets both in California and Chicago and Northern Virginia and that will be primarily driven by smaller deployments and retail co-location overtime but it will include a fair amount of leasing to customers that have the need to scale and is driven by all the demand factors in that market and as you know that is a fantastic market for data center demand both in terms of volume and in terms of the diversity of the demand.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And what is the proximity of this campus relative to your existing holdings?
Paul Szurek: Three or four 500 yards down the street will be connected by diverse redundant fiber and so we'll essentially be the same campuses what we currently have.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I would turn the floor back to Paul Szurek for closing remarks.
Paul Szurek: Thank you for listening to us this quarter and thanks for all those questions. As you can see we are fortunate to enjoy some very supportive elements going forward, a healthy market, a strongly performing team, a great new asset that's just come online, and a very strong volume of new leases and revenues. We really look forward to continuing to execute well on behalf of our customers and our shareholders and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks very much and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

Tom Ray: Good morning and thank you for taking the time to join us today. Before I dive into Q2 results, I’ll take a few minutes to share some thought about this morning’s announcement of my upcoming retirement in CoreSite. First, I would like to thank the investor community and our shareholders, for the support they have shown over our past six years as a public company. I also want to thank our Board for support of the investments we made, not only in our facilities, but also in our organization. Finally, I want to thank my CoreSite colleagues, it’s been a privilege to have served alongside you over the past fifteen years. Being a part of this organization as it is grown and matured has been enormously joyful and fulfilling. And I’m humbled by what this team has accomplished in building a successful company and delivering on our commitments to our investors, customers and each other. I’m confident that the Company has a strong team in place and a solid platform for growth. With that, I believe now is the right time for me to move on, and I look forward to spending more time with my family. Importantly, I feel confident leaving CoreSite in the capable hands of Paul Szurek and the deep bench of talent present through our all levels of the Company. Paul has been an active and engage member of our Board and he has the strong understanding of our strategy and management team. He brings over 25 years of executive experience in almost every aspect of real estate company governance, operations, developments and management. Much of it with largest public companies, and he possesses a strong skillset to ensure the CoreSite's current momentum and growth continue. With that, I’ll now turn to our second quarter results. In Q2, our efforts and execution produced another quarter of solid financial and operational performance. Looking at Q2 2016 over Q2 2015, we reported 31% growth in FFO per share, driven by 18% growth in revenue and 26% growth in adjusted EBITDA. We continued to expand on margins with our adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 52.2%, measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q2 2016. This represents an increase of 283 basis points over the comparable period ending with and including Q2 2015. With regard to leasing, during the second quarter we executed new and expansion leases totaling 48,000 square feet, representing $7.7 million in annualized GAAP rent, in correlating to an average annual GAAP rental rate of a $159 per square foot. Regarding the compotation of our new and expansion lease in the quarter, lease executions were well distributed across our portfolio with our strongest signings in terms of the annual GAAP rent occurring in Silicon Valley, Los Angelis and Northern Virginia D.C. The number of leases signed in the quarter was well distributed across our three verticals as well, with our network, cloud and enterprise verticals representing 29%, 22% and 49% of leases signed respectively. Transaction count in Q2 was strong with 171 new and expansion leases signed in the quarter, representing a record level of lease executions for our company. Steve will provide more color regarding the mix of leasing in the quarter, but at the high level, I'll note that 92% of new and expansion leases signed were from less than 1,000 square feet each. As we have discussed previously, performance sensitive retail collocation is the core of our business and we remain focused on increasing transaction counts in this segment. We are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter and will work to keep driving further improvement. Leasing results in the second quarter may serve as a good representation at the shape of leasing going forward, with the bulk of transactions consisting of smaller deployments. Historically, 90% to 95% of our new and expansions transactions on a quarterly basis have been from leases less than 1,000 square feet. In the past, we participated in the wholesale segment on an opportunistic basis in two different scenarios. First, when we place a large amount of new capacity into service; and second when market conditions and pricing are favorable for us. We’ve seen a healthy level of wholesale leasing over the past 18 to 24 months, driven by our new developments in the Bay Area, New York-New Jersey, and Northern Virginia. Looking ahead to the next 6 to 12 months though, it is unlikely we will replicate the trailing pace of wholesale leasing given that the majority of our current capacity is targeted toward our core collocation business. Regarding our interconnection services, Q2 interconnection revenue continue to show strong growth, increasing 22% over the prior year quarter. The strength in second quarter interconnection revenue was again driven first by strong growth in the volume of fiber cross connects and then by an attractive product mix including strong growth in logical interconnections. Specifically Q2 reflected at 14.8% growth in total points of interconnection, driven by 21% growth in fiber cross connects and 32% growth in logical interconnection services including the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange and our any two exchange for internet peering. Importantly, we continue to see indications of growing enterprise adoption of cloud services with cloud to network connections increasing strongly as cloud providers build up a backbone to support connections via private WAN architectures. Related in Q2, we continue to make progress on enhancing our community of cloud service providers, signing 10 new logos across our platform. In addition, we announced several important wins with key public cloud providers, extending their reach and availability to a greater number of our customers. First, we announced the expansion of needed AWS Direct Connect deployments to our campuses in the Bay Area in Northern Virginia. With these recent expansions, AWS Direct Connect is now directly available in each of our big four markets with deployments in Los Angeles, New York-New Jersey, Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia. Additionally, CoreSite customers can connect to AWS from our Boston facility via our CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange and can connect from the rest of our data centers via network service providers. Second, during the quarter, we announced direct access to the Google cloud platform in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles. This is an important addition to our cloud service provider community and reflects our continued focus to provide our customers access to leading cloud providers in a secure, reliable and cost-efficient environment, streamlining their hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. I'll now move onto provide our outlook for our key markets and segments. With regard to our collocation market segment, we continue to see consistent growth in terms of the pace of leasing while pricing remain stable to slightly up across our markets. Demand for performance sensitive collocations solutions remains well distributed among our key verticals of network providers, cloud service providers and enterprises. Regarding the wholesale market segment, our outlook for supply and demand is substantially consistent with that of last quarter with the exception of the Bay Area. We see an increasing pipeline of new supply coming to market in the Bay Area over the next several quarters from a number of different data center providers. And we expect went rents to soften in the market over the next year. We will continue to closely monitor the supply demand dynamic across all of our markets including demand from hyper-scale cloud companies as we go forward throughout this year. With regard to our development and SV7 at the end of Q2, we were 59% preleased and what we view as attractive rental rates, as it relates to our other markets New York-New Jersey wholesale market remain soft while supply and demand are more equilibrium in our other markets. With regards to growth, we believe that we have ample opportunity to continue to drive meaningful organic growth through the lease up of existing available TKD inventory across our platform to build out of additional TKD capacity in our existing powered shells and the new data center capacity currently under construction. First, regarding existing available TKD inventory, we ended Q2 with approximately 300,000 square feet of operating data center capacity available per lease correlating to 18% of our leased data centers per footage at the end of quarter. This available capacity is currently well distributed across our footprint and included in available capacity is the recently completely build out of TKD capacity at VA2 and LA2 totaling 91,000 square feet across these two key markets. As of the end of Q2, we are nearly completion of construction on our largest development in the Bay Area with 230,000 square feet of TKD capacity at SV7. Together our operating data center capacity available for lease and our data center capacity under construction correlates to 31% of our leased data center capacity at the end of Q2, supporting future organic growth. During the second quarter, we extended our lease on the remaining approximately 20,700 rentable square feet of office and data center space at our LA1 facility through 2022. The extended space includes 10,400 rentable square feet of undeveloped data center capacity to support continued sales momentum at the facility. As we near capacity within the existing stores, we anticipate developing the space to support new customer deployments as well as growth of existing customers requiring a presence at LA1. Following this more recent expansion, we now have more than 150,000 square feet leased at LA1 through July 2022 with three 5 year renewal options ensuring uninterrupted control of our rentable space through 2037. In addition, we continue to evaluate our options regarding opportunistic external growth including the acquisition of additional land and/or data centers to leverage off of the scale we've already created. To that point early in the third quarter, we executed on lease providing for expansion at our DE1 facility, the 10-year lease with renewal rights of four 5 year extensions of fixed rental rates is for 23,000 square of shell capacity to support our build out of TKD capacity into remote basis. We expect to substantially complete construction of the initial phase of 8,000 square feet in Q1 2017 at a cost of 40 million. We will evaluate building out our additional capacity based upon leasing results in Phase 1. While the cost per net rentable square foot is Phase 1 is relatively high, in that phase we will construct infrastructure design to support further build out in the remaining 1,500 square feet of shells space. This should enable us to build incremental capacities in follow-on phases at a unit cost substantially below that associated with the Phase 1. We are excited about expanding in Denver where we now have more than 70 network, cloud and IT service providers supporting a broader array of enterprises. We believe this expansion favorably positions us to continue to serve our current and new customers to value high performance collocation and interconnection solutions. Looking forward to the rest of 2016 and beyond, we remain focused upon continuing to execute our business plan, keeping our eyes on five key areas; continuing to improve asset utilization by driving occupancy; strengthening the differentiated value proposition of our platform by continuing to add anchor networks and cloud providers; driving operational excellence across our organization; investing in expansion to support ongoing growth; and consistently and continuously working to increase returns on invested capital. In summary, our financial and operating results for the second quarter reflect our focus and execution on the items I just mentioned as well as our commitment to delivering superior returns for our shareholders. We believe that our core business delivering performance sensitive collocations and interconnection solutions is strong and is a differentiator within the marketplace. And we will continue to work to strengthen the value of our communities of interest across our network reach, cloud-enabled data center platform. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Smith: Thanks, Tom. I'll start by reviewing our overall sales activity during the quarter. As Tom noted, Q2 new and expansion sales totaled $7.7 million in annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 48,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $159 per square foot. Transaction count for the quarter totaled 171 new and expansion leases, 26% above the trailing 12 month average and 45% higher than the prior quarter. As Tom mentioned, Q2 was collocation concentrated quarter which is the primary focus of our efforts as a sales and marketing organization. To that point, new and expansion leasing consisting of 158 leases less than 1,000 square feet each, 12 mid sizes leases between 1,000 to 5,000 square feet each and one large lease greater than 5,000 square feet. We are pleased with the sequential trend and transaction count as well as the strength in midsized leasing and we'll continue to focus on attracting smaller performance sensitive applications which were additive to our customer and service provider communities of interest. Related, we continue to diversify our customer base adding 31 net new logos this quarter, which were well distributed across our platform. In terms of verticals, new logos were also well distributed with 40% coming from network and cloud service providers 60% from enterprise customers. Within our embedded days, we have also seen strong growth in general enterprise category including financial services and healthcare, increasing from 12% in Q2 2014 to nearly 19% in Q3 2016. As we see further adoption of collocation solutions for enterprise IT needs. Beyond our new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q2 was also solid as renewals totaled approximately 70,000 square feet at annualized GAAP rate of $122 per square. This reflects mark-to-market growth of 5.2% on a cash basis and 9.4% on a GAAP basis. Q2 renewals reflect a large multimarket customer which renewed approximately half of its base with us, and we expect the other half to trend up by the end of 2016. Churn in the quarter was 2.1%, which included 100 basis points of churn related to the restructured lease agreement with our original full building customer at SV3 as expected. As reminder, we continue to forecast approximately 190 basis points of churn related to the final exploration of this customer lease agreement in Q2 2017. Regarding our vertical mix, during Q2 network and cloud customers signed 87 new and expansion leases representing 51% of our total transaction count. As Tom mentioned, specific to the cloud we saw AWS announced two new Direct Connect nodes at our Santa Clara and Reston campuses, further differentiating those markets with a secure high performance connectivity option for our customers. The addition of Direct Connect availability of these campuses is especially important due to explosive growth in these key markets, bolstered by the density of high-tech and start-up companies leveraging both collocation and cloud. Beyond the AWS expansion during the quarter, we also entered into agreements with another cloud provider to expand its on-ramp services into additional markets, further enhancing the cloud community within the CoreSite platform. Additionally, during Q2 we signed leases for two new edge locations with the leading video platform for the gaming community, representing one of the most highly traffic websites. These applications reflect the value of our low latency, connectivity reached approach to servicing the market. Regarding our network vertical, we saw strong performance with new and expansion leasing distributed across every market and almost every available building. In Q2, we signed two new Tier 1 IP network deployments with the leading international carrier as well as 15 new core network nodes and 7 expansions to existing major network nodes. All of this speaks to the long held strategy to drive CoreSite locations as leading points of interconnection. Turning to the enterprise vertical, we continued to see solid momentum in the quarter with this segment accounting for 49% of new and expansion leases signed. Strength in this market was led by general enterprises and digital content including a leading global retailer, a large financial services organization, a large biotechnology company and 30 new logos. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases in Q2 were Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Northern Virginia DC, Chicago, and New York-New Jersey collectively representing 95% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter and 86% of leases executed. As it relates to SV7, we are now 59% preleased and expect to open the building in the third quarter. We remain optimistic about our investment in SV7 given our strong leasing to date coupled with what we believe to be near-term opportunities to lease at attractive rates. We all more cautious about the Bay Area looking past the coming three quarters in light of the pipeline of new construction we see in the market. In Los Angeles, demand remain steady and we continue to make good leasing progress at LA2 with 60% of leases and 84% our annualized GAAP signed into market during Q2 coming from this building. Over the last five years, we have increased customer count at LA2 from 75 to 175 and continue to strengthen the value of the campus with 20 native network and cloud service providers now deployed. In terms of verticals, digital content was our strongest followed by network and cloud. Stabilized occupancy across the LA campus was 87.9% at the end of Q3, up 20 basis points compared to Q1 with approximately 18,000 square feet moving from the pre-stabilized pool to the stabilized pool. In Northern Virginia DC, we continue to see good transaction volume among smaller requirements with 33 new and expansion leases signed below 1,000 square feet. Demand was driven by enterprise customers followed by networks and digital content with 16 new logos joining the campus. As it relates to capacity across the campus, during the second quarter we completed construction on Phase 4 at VA2 with 48,000 incremental square feet now on a pre-stabilized pool, stabilized occupancy in Reston now stands at 97.5%. In the New York-New Jersey market, we continued to see consistent demand for smaller requirements while the wholesale market remains somewhat soft. In Q2, we executed 13 new and expansion leases across our New York campus, with one 1,300 square foot lease and remaining 12 under 1,000 square feet. Leasing was driven by enterprise and network customers including the four new net enterprise logos. In summary, we are pleased with our sales performance in Q2 as well as the progress we've made and increasing our transaction count to smaller collocation requirements. Q2 results were in line with our expectation given our focus on the performance-sensitive collocations segment of the business. As we look forward, we continue to view our position in the market favorably and are committed to executing against our strategic plan to create value for our customers, partners and shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q2 financial results. Second, I will update you on the development CapEx and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And third, I will discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Q2 financial performance reflects total operating revenues of $96.1 million, correlating to a 3.9% increase on a sequential quarter basis and an 18.1% increase over the prior year quarter. Q2 operating revenue consisted of $78.8 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 3.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 18.5% year-over-year. I want to point out a few items related to data center rental revenue. First as Steve noted, during Q2 another tranche of rental revenue related to our original full building customer at SV3 expired, reducing annualized GAAP rent by $1.9 million. The remaining $4.2 million in annualized GAAP rent related to this restructured lease agreement is scheduled expire in Q2 2017. Second, during the quarter we completed construction on SV6, the powered shell build-to-suit and that lease commenced as of May 1st. Moving on interconnection revenue contributed $13 million to revenue in Q2, an increase of 1.8% on the sequential quarter basis and 22.2% year-over-year, and tenant reimbursement another revenues were $2.3 million. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million. Moving to earnings, Q2 FFO was $0.89 per diluted share and unit, an increase of 3.5% on a sequential quarter basis and 30.9% year-over-year. Net income for diluted share of $0.37 was flat with the prior quarter, an increase 68.2% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $51.1 million increased 5.4% on a sequential quarter basis and 26% over the same quarter last year. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter totaled $4.5 million or 4.7% of total operating revenues. General and administrative expenses were $8.8 million in Q2, correlating to 9.2% of total operating revenues in line with our guidance for the year. Regarding our same-store metrics, Q2 same-store turn-key data center occupancy increased 700 basis points to 88.9% from 81.9% in the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, same-store MRR per cabinet to equivalent increased 6.6% year-over-year and 1.2% sequentially to $1,478. In Q2, we finished development of 48,000 square feet of turn-key data center capacity at VA2 in Reston as well as 43,000 square feet of turn-key data center capacity at LA2 in Los Angeles, which are both reflected in our pre-stabilized pool. As we have previously discussed, we defined stabilization as the earlier to occur between 85% occupancy and 24 months after an asset is placed into service. As of the end of the second quarter, 17,500 square feet of LA2 and 12,000 square feet at CH1 moved into our stabilized pool at 85.9% occupancy each. In addition, 23,000 square feet at VA2 moved into the stabilized pool at 100% occupancy. Lastly, we commenced 158,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $55 per square foot, which represents $8.7 million of annualized GAAP rent. As I mentioned earlier, Q2 lease commencements include the 136,500 square feet build-to-suit as SV6 which impacted the rate this quarter. We ended the second quarter without stabilized data center occupancy at 92%, an increase of 140 basis points compare to the first quarter with increases in occupancy at nearly all of our data centers. NY1 was our only data center to show a decline in occupancy from 76.7% in Q1 to 70.7 in Q2. This move out was due to a customer's application reaching end of life. Turning now to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $29.4 million as of June 30, 2016, or $33.8 million on a cash basis. Importantly, approximately 88% of our GAAP backlog relates to leases which will commence once construction is complete, reflecting the pre-leasing at SV7, approximately 75% or $22.1 million of our GAAP backlog is anticipated to commence in the late Q3 with a large portion depended upon completing construction at SV7, an addition 12% or $3.6 million is expected to commence in Q4. Turning to our development activity, we had a total of 230,000 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction as of June 30, 2016, all of which is at SB7 in Santa Clara. We estimate as total investment of $190 million required to complete this project of which $151.6 million had been incurred at the end of Q2. As shown on Page 23 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized in Q2 was 24.6%. For 2016, we now expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be between 20% and 25% based on improved visibility into the second half of the year and our development pipeline. Turning to our balance sheet, as of June 30, 2016, our ratio of net principal debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.4 times. Including preferred stock, the ratio was 3 times, below our stated target ratio of approximately 4 times. This correlates to incremental debt capacity of approximately $205 million at June 30th based upon Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA. In addition, after we announced in mid June, we successfully raised a $150 million through a private placement bond offering. These bonds represent a diverse source of capital, and we're excited about the relationship that we developed with new investors during this process which provide us optionality for incremental capital to scale our operations in the future. We used the bond proceeds to fully repay the balance of our revolving credit facility, leaving the entire 350 million available to fund near-term growth. Finally, we're increasing our 2016 FFO guidance to a range of $3.56 to $3.64 per share in OP unit from the previous range of $3.52 to $3.60 per share in OP unit, an increase of 1.1% based on the midpoint of both ranges. The increased guidance reflects our performance year-to-date, an increase approximately $0.01 per share in charges during Q3 associated with the management transition that was announced this morning. Therefore keep in mind, the Q3 results will be impacted by this charge as well as the estimated timing of completion of construction in customer commencements at SV7. We now expect total operating revenue to be in the range of $392.5 million to $402.5 million compare to the previous range of $391 million to $401 million. We continue to expect generation and administrative expenses to be $35 million to $37 million correlating to 9.1% of total operating revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $205 million to $213 million, up from the previous range of $203 million to $211 million, implying an adjusted EBITDA margin of 52.6% for the full year. All above guided metrics remain unchanged and a detailed summary of all 2016 guidance items can be found on Page 25 of the second quarter earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics on our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities other than what we've discussed today. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore ISI. Please state your question.
Michael Hart: This is Michael Hart on the line for Jonathan. I wanted to focus first on the interconnection revenue growth. It looked like it was a little slower this quarter and I was wondering if you could maybe give us some incremental color about sort of what drove that deceleration down from 1.8% sequential growth from 6% last quarter. And do you see any trends that have implications on your outlook for future interconnection growth?
Jeff Finnin: This is Jeff. I guess couple of things as you may recall from the first quarter, we had very strong growth, at my recollection it was somewhere around 24% so the change this quarter -- I should say the growth last quarter was strong and ultimately led to us increasing our guidance on the interconnection growth last quarter. My recollection is today our guidance related to interconnection revenue growth is 17% to 19% for the full year. I think based on our visibility today and performance in the first half, we would expect our overall growth this year to be at that top of that range or slightly ahead of it. So just keep that in mind as you factor in the rest of the year.
Michael Hart: And then I guess along those lines I think you talked a lot about the demand you’re seeing from cloud and enterprises for performance sensitive deployments which are presumably more interconnect rich. I was wondering when I said you’re seeing a sort of bridge with cycle where the incremental nodes you get from major cloud platforms are attracting additional enterprise and cloud customers, if you think that that could drive high teens or 20% interconnection growth in next year and beyond? Thank you.
Tom Ray: Yes, I think no change to our past comments over the last several quarters. For the larger public clouds that are more mature in the marketplace, we have seen consistent acceleration and that continues. And I’d say the larger main brand public clouds that are newer in rolling out into the marketplace certainly appear to be following the same trajectory of the larger clouds that came in earlier. So the signs are positive for the newer entrants. The momentum of the established folks is very, very solid and it's continuing. And so we’re optimistic that, that virtual cycle will continue. There is reason to have faith that it will.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Rodgers with Baird. Please state your question.
David Rodgers: Tom, sorry to see that announcement this morning, and certainly wish you all the best. You’ve done an incredible job with CoreSite over the last couple of year. I guess Jeff you mentioned in your comments about NY1 and the application kind of hitting end of life, I didn’t hear if there was any commentary about the impact of that might have had on power or cross connect revenues either sequentially from 1Q to 2Q or 2Q into 3Q, and any more color on that, that you can provide?
Jeff Finnin: Dave, I don’t think it's going to have a significant impact. Obviously, it's incorporated into our guidance for the rest of the year, but nothing significant that would stand out.
David Rodgers: Okay, that's good. I guess there's been a little bit of commentary out there about Akamai and maybe some churn or some issues with them in the data center business, any commentary around that that we need to be concerned about or aware of from the CoreSite perspective?
Tom Ray: Well, certainly nothing specific to Akamai. I think in the CDN space in general, the impact on the data center world is, I think, largely a shift. You see dedicated CDNs losing some share to other integrated providers, such as the telcos moving more to the CDN space, as well as enterprises becoming more active on their own CDN platforms. So, somewhere that information needs to connect to the rest of the world and the servers that host it and process it need a place to be fired up. So, I think the overall demand from CDN activities is in the marketplace, you know, continues to be meaningful and continues to grow meaningfully. I do think some of it could be in the hands of what historically were not traditional providers. And we’ll see how that space shakes out. But I think the activity of CDN remains very solid for the multicenter data center world.
David Rodgers: And I guess -- okay maybe lastly for me then. In terms of the volume of cross connects -- and I know you gave the guidance for that. It was up 15%, I think you said. In the quarter overall, if I got it right, fiber up 21%, logical up 32%, are you seeing greater erosion in copper, I guess would be the first question. And then I guess is logical accelerating? I guess we haven't normally seen that breakdown from you. So I guess now that we have that breakdown, how should we think about kind of that as a separate category in there?
Tom Ray: The rate of deceleration in copper has remained very consistent. It's kind of 3% annual decline and still in that, around that number. On the logical side, the logical can be a little bit more lumpy because it's a smaller base. So we’ve had quarters where it's been 50%, 52%. This quarter was in the 30s. I wouldn’t draw much from that. It's a strongly growing product set and I think the all signs suggest that it has the opportunity to continue to grow very strongly. And on the fiber side, I saw somebody's note this morning saying hey, we really focus on the annual. And I would encourage people to do that. The Q-on-Q can have some, a little bit of lumpiness, not like the wholesale leasing. But in Q1, we had a larger move-in from one customer on fiber cross connection. In Q2, we had one customer turned down more than normal. And so there is two quarters just have a little bit of shift dissonance in them. We don’t read anything into that in a bigger picture, and we’ll leave it to everybody else to do what they think they need to do with that information.
Operator: Our next question comes from Barry McCarver with Stephens Inc. Please state your question.
Barry McCarver: Tom, first off, question for you, in your prepared remarks you mentioned little bit of excess supply in the Bay Area coming online in the second half of the year. I am curious if you could give some color around do you think some of your competitors are out there with spec builds? Or do you sense a rise in demand coming? I guess just on a scale one to 10. How concerned are you about the supply?
Tom Ray: Well, I think, there is a chunk of spec supply either on the drawing boards or permitted or breaking ground, ready to come into market. I think the volume of that isn’t frankly materially different than it's been over the average of the longer trail. So, I think the real question for the overall health in the Bay Area is this question of hyper-skilled demand, and we do think that will be lumpy, and if it continues unabated, as it has over the trailing 12 to 18 months, through the forward 12 to 18 months, probably going to see a steady healthy market. If some of the hyper-skilled cloud guys have a full belly at the moment and slow down for a little while and that’s not backfilled in the next 12 months by other uses at that same volume, then I think supply may get a little out in front of take up, and we’ll see some softening and that’s that.
Barry McCarver: And then a question I guess for Jeff on the margins, I continue to be impressed with the way your Company is able to drive margins higher. Looking at data center utilization capacity utilization, it's about as high as I think it's been in several years, maybe ever. Kind of your thought on EBITDA margins beyond the next couple of quarters. Would you expect those to be a little flatter, given the amount of building activity you have going on?
Jeff Finnin: Barry, when we entered the year, our guidance suggested that our adjusted EBITDA margins would be relatively flat as it was compared to 2015. When you look at the performance year-to-date, we have continued to expand those margins. And in largely that, that margin expansion is coming because of the greater than expected growth from our interconnection business. I guess as Tom suggested that can be a little bit lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but it's obviously something we continue to focus on and watch. And if we can continue to expand those margins for the rest of the year, I think we’d be pleasantly pleased I guess in that outcome. It's something we’re watching closely. But the guidance as you sit here today suggest year-end, I guess, overall margins I think at 52.6% and that’s where the guidance is to give you some idea as you look forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Jordan Sadler: Tom, I guess, the announcement this morning caught us a bit by surprise. I assume others as well wish you well in the next stage for sure. But with all due respect here, I had one question on the topic. Any -- I guess because the lead time seems a little bit short. Should we expect any change in strategic direction at the Company?
Tom Ray: I don’t believe so, Jordan. I mean, you’ve seen the comments from Rob Stuckey and from Paul. And these are people who’ve been with company for a long time and guiding and helping form the strategy. The Board remains intact. The senior leadership team remains intact. And I think everybody is just looking forward to roll in the same direction and everybody believes in what the Company has accomplished in the past. So look, I’d be really surprised if there were anything off the beam going forward.
Jordan Sadler: And in terms of the appointment of Paul, it looks like that’s a permanent position. Can you confirm that? And then was there a broader process run was he just appointed as one of the permanent President and CEO?
Tom Ray: Paul is the permanently appointed President and CEO. And I think the process is -- it's internal to the Board. It’s I think very well considered, very well thought through. Our succession planning across the organization and in the CEO spot has been I think a constant effort by the Board and the leadership team. And very mindful of that practices and there you have it. I mean, I think the Board’s decision was enormously well considered and thoughtful, and Paul is the guy going forward.
Jordan Sadler: As far as any expansion opportunities that you outline in terms of the focus of the Company and new investment, you’ve got Denver, which you’ve identified you’ve done first quarter. And anything else in the till that you can point to? How difficult is it to procure additional land these days?
Tom Ray: Well, I think consistent with our comments on the trail. The areas that are of the highest consideration are North Virginia and the Bay Area. North Virginia I think leading that. We have less available inventory relative to our trailing absorption there than the Bay area. So, those are two of our largest markets. And obviously they are a key source of interest and opportunity going forward. And as we’ve said in the past I think there are several opportunities in each market to continue a position and continue the platform for growth in the organization. And we’ve been working purposely as we’ve said and we’re optimistic about finding and executing upon additional growth opportunities for the organization. As I said last quarter, I am not concerned that we’re going to wake up and go gee, why don’t, we have any ability to grow in these markets. We’re conducting ourselves accordingly and we’ll keep everybody posted as anything definitely comes up.
Jordan Sadler: And one last if I may, just in terms of increasing asset utilization, driving occupancy higher, this has been a trend for several quarters now. And I am just curious there, in conjunction with your commentary of not really expecting you to do a lot of wholesale in the next six to 12 months. What is the objective here versus the lower occupancies and the greater availability that you used to run that, let's say, in the first three-four years, post IPO? Why are we running at higher level of occupancy?
Tom Ray: Really, circle back to what we shared on the IPO road show. We really look in terms of how many kilowatts or square feet are available in our inventory as opposed to what our occupancy percentage is. So, six years ago with a very small base in the market, 15% availability might have met, we have just enough to do couple of 1.5 meg deals and to continue to feed our co-location program. With a much bigger base in a given market, we might be able to accomplish those same growth objectives with a much higher occupancy ratio. And so it's really about kilowatts and square feet than percent, and that the organization gets larger and we have more mass in markets and we’re getting more scale and efficiency by market. We have the opportunity to drive up our 50 percentage and I think that’s going to continue to be a focus for the Company.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks, Tom. I appreciate the years of insight and friendship and wish you the best.
Tom Ray: Thank you very much, Jordan. I appreciate for you as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please state your question.
Manny Korchman: Maybe similar to Jordan’s question a different. Any desire to go more wholesale, take advantage of the demand from the hyperscale side, use your experience and ability to build out the larger spaces and offer one-stop shop for customers at least for now? And then what to do with that part of the business going forward later?
Tom Ray: I think at a high level, circle back to what the strategy going forward I think it's very consistent with the strategy in the past. And as you’ve seen the Company’s trading behavior, we’ve hit the wholesale market when spot pricing was very attractive, or when we had new larger developments in any given market. And as I’ve talked in my prepared remarks about the next six to 12 months, we still have another big building hitting the market in that time frame. Pricing is still favorable at the moment in the Bay Area, but we’ve done a fair amount of wholesale there. And I do believe supply is coming. So I think that the Company is going to continue to execute and work towards the same behavior that you’ve seen in the past. I am optimistic that there will be opportunities for wholesale in the future based upon the same criteria that we’ve applied in the past. And as you look at the next 6-12s we’re not in that position from an inventory perspective and we are in the markets to try and expand our opportunities for growth, and some of those moves up might have a follow on wholesale associate with them base on our trailing criteria.
Manny Korchman: Jeff, if we think about your development spend longer term looking forward as we try to model out a few more years. How should we think about that number?
Jeff Finnin: Well, I think if you look back over the past five plus years since going public, our average spend and total CapEx has ranged -- or on average is probably been around $140 million to $150 million. There are couple of years, 2016 been one, where we’re guiding to about $265 million where we clearly spent well more than that average. But I think that long-term average is something better to look at as you think about capital for 2017. And obviously we’ll give further and full guidance probably in connection with our Q4 call, probably in February. But I think that’s a good way to look at it based on what we’ve done historically.
Manny Korchman: Thanks Jeff. And Michael has question for you guys as well.
Michael Bilerman: Tom, it seems like yesterday we’re looking on the IPO, so I too share some thoughts and wish you well as you spend more time with your family. Just curious can you help us a little bit on the time line. What was the process that when did you notify the Board? I assume that this was something that you notified to the Board, because you wanted to retire. Maybe the Board notified you, but there want to be a change looking. What the timing of all this was and the interactions and the decision making process?
Tom Ray: It's been very collaborative, and I did reach out during this month. And say we should talk more seriously about succession over time, let's spend more time on it and no decision was made then. And I’ve been with this organization and with our Board for a very long time and wanted to support an orderly transition, give everybody lots of time. And so that was very collaborative process. And it really finalized over the last couple of days. So it's been a process of people who’ve worked together for quite a while, saying we would meet then, what’s big more about the future over the next year or two. And we’ve got Paul in a great position. And I’d say from my perspective once you start thinking about that, I need to honour my commitment to give 110% to this organization as long as I am here and frankly fresh legs right now I think come and ensure that continuity of just incredible excitement and drive. And glad Paul is ready willing and able to take this forward.
Michael Bilerman: And then you’ve been advisor until next year. Are you going to remain on the Board of Directors? And if not, do you have a non-compete at all and what the tail of that is?
Tom Ray: I am going to remain as a consultant and advisor. I am very much looking forward to supporting the transition. I am not going to remain on the Board. And I do have a non-compete.
Michael Bilerman: And how long does that non-compete run till?
Tom Ray: 12 months after the end of the consulting arrangement.
Michael Bilerman: And then just the backdrop here was, you may have mentioned you wanted to spend more time with your family, but is there -- I mean, is there something else that’s behind the decision?
Tom Ray: No, I just leave it at, and I am very excited looking ahead to spend more time with the family and I am very, very honoured and grateful for my time here with the organization.
Michael Bilerman: And then just in terms of the process of selecting, and a little bit to what Jordan was going after in terms of what process the Board ran. I am curious as your advice to the Board, and I am sure Peter having been involved with the Board for a number of years and as lead Independent Director has a lot of sense for what the Company does, but doesn’t carry to data canter experience day-to-day in terms of running the Company like you have. I am curious what your view was getting either an internal person that’s been doing -- promoted from someone within versus going out and getting someone with data center experience? Or emerging the Company is an alternative as well?
Tom Ray: Look, circling back to the succession planning process. It’s not an event it's a process and really I think for healthy companies it's a process that’s ongoing every year, year-after-year. And that’s been the case at CoreSite. We’ve been very thoughtful about succession in every senior part of the Company. As part of that, we have wonderful candidates internally right now, so Paul to continue mentor and groom, and terrific people with great skills and tremendous upside in their career. So I think the Board was I think fortunate but you make your own luck. The Board has been thoughtful about CEO transition and succession for a long time. There are number of candidates and I know that they were very well considered in their selection of Paul. And as per my view I completely support Paul, and I am looking forward to helping him burn into the Company and taking to the next level and the next leg of its journey.
Michael Bilerman: I appreciate all the color. Just it's important I think as investors and analysts to understand how decisions are made, why decisions are made, what was considered. We certainly seen a lot of Board members become CEO, so then a process being run and that is somewhat of a concern from the investment community that we want to better understand. So I appreciate the openness.
Tom Ray: Thanks Michael. And thanks for your support and collegiality over the years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please state your question.
Colby Synesael: I just want to echo congratulations, Tom, and best of luck. Two questions for you. You guys mentioned in your prepared remarks that the second-quarter leasing represented a good shape of leasing going forward. And I think the leasing numbers were little bit lower than what we've seen for the last few quarters. And I'm just curious: is that really indicative of a lack of supply that you might have relative to where the market opportunity is? Is it that the opportunity itself is actually perhaps lower than what it's been the last few quarters, or is it really maybe a shift perhaps in the strategy to some degree. Maybe I'll let you comment on that. And also I guess my second question is Tom, I'm assuming this is the last time we'll have you on an earnings call. And I'm just curious. How do you think of the health of the industry at this point or at this juncture, particularly in terms of where a lot of the demand has been coming from? And I guess even more specifically as it relates to the wholesale business? Thanks.
Tom Ray: Sure. As to the shape of leasing, we would again encourage everybody to think about our business the way we think about our business. And I don’t think there is any change in the strategy related to how we’ve been thinking about the business. And that is we have our core co-location business, and frankly Q2 was terrific. It was the total annualized GAAP rate on the Q2 was 21% above the trailing 12, very, very solid performance. I think our second highest posting in all-time. We had a highest posting of transactions recorded in all time and Steve and his team did a phenomenal job, executing on the business plan in co-location. In addition to that we’ve always maintained this opportunistic approach to wholesale leasing. And if you look at our trailing wholesale leasing, most of our larger wholesale deals have been getting done Virginia and Santa Clara, where we’re lighter on inventory at the moment. And so we are active in looking for opportunities to grow further. I am confident in our ability to do that in those markets. But over the next six to 12 months, I think you’ll see a greater -- greater proportion of the mix will be in co-location. But the total dollars in that has been trending up nicely and the Company is very focused on trying to help support that continued. And I don’t believe, of course about the wholesale business. So I think Paul is extremely well versed in this as is significant -- if you look at the number of the people in the management team, very capable of executing in that space and I think with more land and more buildings actually down the road, you will see the company maintain its strategy and see that lumpiness in wholesale growth and hopefully continued growth in co-location sales. And we’re extremely pleased with Q2.
Operator: Our final question comes from Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please state your question.
Matthew Heinz: First question is for Tom. First off, just wanted to reiterate best wishes in the future and congratulations on everything you’ve achieved of course out over the years. I can appreciate that your reasons for retiring maybe personal. But I was just curious if there was any friction between yourself and the Board that may have accelerated this announcement.
Tom Ray: I think our relationship has been enormously professional and I think the record is clear for the enormously productive. I’ve been pleased and honored to be a part of this entire journey from suit to nuts. And we have smart caring committed professional people on the Board and in the organization. And together we’ve accomplished things that we feel good about.
Matthew Heinz: And then there is a follow up for Jeff. I was hoping you could just provide some more specific commentary on the drivers of your guidance increase, particularly on the revenue side. I think you had mentioned stronger year-to-date performance in the prepared comments. But just on the bookings, relative to trend, I can appreciate there is a difference in mix there. But was a little lower in dollar terms. And just curious if there any implied uptick there or what was the moving parts in the guidance?
Jeff Finnin: Good morning Matt. If you just look at the guidance, I’ll just walk you through the increases in revenue. If you look at it on a per share counts, we’re up $0.03 per share in the revenue guidance. That’s largely attributable to the interconnection product and the growth of that business that we’ve messaged. As I mentioned earlier, our guidance coming to this quarter was we expected growth of somewhere around 17% to 19% as you continue to think of the business and the next six months, we believe that that growth will be at the top end or slightly ahead of that, top end of that range. And so that’s largely attributing to the outperformance on the revenue. Secondly on adjusted EBITDA and then FFO, you can see the increase is equal about $0.04 per share, which ultimately is our increase at the midpoint of guidance. And that’s largely because we’re contributing and have the revenue growth flow through higher than anticipated coming to this year, and that’s based on some product mix and getting better margins than what we anticipated through various of our products. And so all that combined leads you to the $0.04 increase at the FFO line.
Operator: This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Thomas Ray for closing remarks.
Tom Ray: Thank you. To wrap things up, I’d like to just take a minute to offer a few more words, and thanks to more of the people who helped CoreSite to become what it is today. Forgive me if it's a bit like in the county towards beach, but these people deserve our recognition. And I am going to take this brief moment as it presents itself. In addition to our investors, our coverage analyst and the Board, as I thank you at the beginning of the call, I’d like to thank the Carlyle Group, including Jim Attwood for his service to and support of the Company. And in particular Rob Stuckey, for making the founding investments in what became CoreSite, sharing the vision of what the Company could become, and giving me the opportunity to lead the organization. My wife and then my family are changed because of that, and I am grateful. I’d also like to thank colleagues who helped forge this CoreSite and we moved on to forming, including Deedee Beckman, David John, Billie Haggard, John Savago and Rob Rockwood, among many others. And finally I’d like to thank the men and women of today’s CoreSite. I’ve learned a great deal from and have deeply enjoyed working with some of the best leaders I’ve ever known. This includes our team members, Geoff Danheiser, Jeff Dorr, Jeff Finnin, Derek McCandless, Ryan Oro, Steve Smith, Dominic Tobin, and Brian Warren. As well as some long time and newer colleagues, Julie Brewer, Eric Brownfield, Therese Kerfoot, Matt Mill, and again many, many others, to each of you and many more talented and hardworking people who helped build this Company. It’s been my privilege and honor to serve with you to share CoreSite’s wonderful journey and to call you friend. I am better person for our time together, and I am grateful to and grateful for each of you. With that, I’ll certainly turn over to Paul and I am confident he’ll bring extraordinary intelligence, strong business acumen, and principal guided leadership to the Company on the next leg of the security. Thank you very much and best wishes to all.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-29 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Derek McCandless. Thank you. You may begin.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. I'm joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; Steve Smith, our Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the investor relations pages of our Web-site at coresite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Ray: Good morning and welcome to our first quarter call. In Q1, we continued to execute our business plan, resulting in solid financial and operational performance. Looking at Q1 2016 over Q1 2015, we reported 34% growth in FFO per share driven by 24% growth in revenue and 28% growth in adjusted EBITDA. We continued to expand our margins with our adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 51.4%, measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q1 2016. This represents an increase of 285 basis points over the comparable period ending with and including Q1 2015. With regard to leasing, during the quarter we executed new and expansion leases totaling 103,000 square feet, representing $22.5 million in annualized GAAP rent. Our average GAAP rental rate associated with this leasing was strong at $219 per square foot. This rate was influenced by power density and Steve will put this into context a bit later in the call. As previously announced, our Q1 leasing results include 80,000 square feet under one lease at our SV7 facility currently under construction. Regarding the rest of our new and expansion leasing in the quarter, lease executions were well distributed across our portfolio with our strongest signings in terms of annualized GAAP rent occurring in Los Angeles, New York, New Jersey and Boston. The number of leases signed in the quarter was well distributed across our three verticals, with our network, cloud and enterprise verticals representing 26%, 21% and 53% of leases signed respectively. Regarding our interconnection services, Q1 interconnection revenue exceeded our expectations, reflecting 6% growth over Q4 2015 and 25% growth over the prior year quarter. This growth in revenue was predominantly driven by greater than expected growth in volume of products generating more favorable unit revenues. Specifically, Q1 reflected 15.2% growth in total points of interconnection, but that growth was comprised of 21% growth in fiber cross connects and 35% growth in our logical interconnection product set. This growth was offset to a limited extent by a 3% decrease in volume of copper cross connects. The 21% growth rate in fiber cross connects exceeded our recent trailing growth rate for this product, which was 18% for calendar 2015 over 2014. We are pleased to see the growth rate of our fiber cross connects exceed our forecast for the quarter and we will continue to watch this metric as the year progresses. Regarding our activities around the cloud, we continued to make progress with key public cloud providers, signing several new and expansion agreements with these partners during the first quarter. Additionally, we believe that our platform is well positioned in terms of having network partners offer the latest in private LAN capabilities at our data centers which we believe creates differentiated value relative to most other data center solutions. Finally, we believe that our Open Cloud Exchange in combination with our collaboration with network and cloud providers around APIs supports enterprise adoption of cloud and the private LAN services connecting to the cloud. Supported by these capabilities, we expect to continue to see solid growth in our cloud vertical as enterprises leverage our network and cloud rich platform to accelerate cloud adoption, particularly with hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. I'll now move on to provide our outlook for our key markets. Our top line view of supply and demand is consistent with that of last quarter. With regard to the performance sensitive market segment, we continue to see consistent to slightly accelerating lease pacing and pricing, in line with growth over prior years. Demand remains well distributed among carriers, cloud companies and enterprise communities of interest. Regarding the wholesale market segment, we continue to believe that balance between supply and demand remains favorable in the Bay Area, less favorable in New Jersey, and is more at equilibrium in our other markets. More specific to the Bay Area, we see limited current supply of large blocks of capacity juxtaposed against consistent demand, resulting in firming wholesale rents. Reflecting these conditions, we've seen strong pre-leasing at SV7, the largest among our development of projects currently underway, and we elected to accelerate our TKD buildout in the remainder of that building. As such, we are now under construction on the entire 230,000 square foot facility which was 54% pre-leased at the end of Q1. Regarding our organic growth plans, we are energized by the growth capacity inherent in our portfolio comprised of both currently available capacity and new data center capacity currently under construction. Concerning currently available capacity, we closed Q1 with over 218,000 square feet of operating data center capacity available for lease, correlating to 15% of our leased data center square footage at the end of the Q. As we look at the availability of data center capacity across our platform, we are pleased with its distribution and we believe we have adequate supply in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Boston and Miami. This points us to the Bay Area and Virginia, which in turn points us to our pipeline of new capacity currently under construction. Specifically, we closed Q1 with 458,000 square feet of data center capacity under construction, with the majority of this construction in the Bay Area and Virginia. In a few minutes, Jeff will walk you through our specific current development projects and provide an overview of when we expect this capacity will be placed into service. Importantly, in the context of our growth plans, this pipeline of data center capacity currently under construction correlates to 30% of our leased data center square footage at the end of the first quarter. Together, our operating data center capacity available for lease and our data center capacity under construction correlate to 45% of our leased data center capacity at the end of Q1, providing the opportunity for continued strong growth. Looking ahead to the rest of 2016 and beyond, we remain focused upon continuing to execute our business plan, keeping our eyes on five key areas; continuing to improve asset utilization by driving occupancy; strengthening the differentiated value proposition of our platform by continuing to add anchor networks and cloud providers; driving operational excellence across our organization; investing in expansion to support ongoing growth; and consistently and continuously working to increase returns on invested capital. In summary, our operating results for the first quarter reflect the continued systematic execution of our business plan. We believe that our Company remains favorably positioned within our industry and that the supply and demand dynamics inherent in the performance sensitive segment of the data center market remain favorable. We remain focused upon further differentiating our Company and driving enhanced value to our customers by providing network-rich cloud-enabled data center solutions to support our customers' performance sensitive requirements. Finally, we believe we have a strong opportunity to grow and we are excited about working to execute upon that opportunity. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Smith: Thanks, Tom. I'd like to start by reviewing our sales activity during the quarter. As Tom noted, Q1 new and expansion sales totaled $22.5 million in annualized GAAP rent, reflecting a new record for our Company. Our sales total is comprised of 103,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $219 per square foot. The rental rate of $219 per square foot was influenced by power density. Specifically, power density in Q1 was approximately 32% above the trailing 12 month average. When adjusted for power density, our Q1 rental rate represents a 7% increase over the trailing 12 month period. Transaction count for the quarter totaled 119 new and expansion leases, comprised of 114 leases of less than 1,000 square feet each, four midsized leases between 1,000 and 5,000 square feet each, and one large lease at SV7 which was previously announced of 80,000 square feet. Q1 transaction count was below that of Q4 2015 and 19% greater than Q1 2015. We will remain focused upon this area of our business and we retain our objective to increase the transaction count in 2016 over that of 2015. Beyond our new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q1 was solid as renewals totaled approximately 56,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $173 per square foot. This reflects mark-to-market growth of 3.7% on a cash basis and 9.2% on a GAAP basis. Churn in the quarter was 1.6%. Regarding our vertical mix, during Q1 networking cloud customers signed 56 new and expansion leases, representing 47% of our total. Related to the cloud, during the quarter we added valuable new logos including a SaaS database [indiscernible] provider for enabling hybrid cloud and a leading cloud-based healthcare company. We continue to see strong demand among cloud related requirements across our platform and particularly in the Bay Area. Regarding our network vertical, we saw solid performance across our portfolio with particular strength at our New York campus. In Q1 we signed three key new network deployments in our New York campus, including a large international network added at NY2. This brings the number of networks at or committed to serving NY2 to 23, providing strong network options for our cloud and enterprise customers. Turning to our enterprise vertical, we continued to see solid momentum in the quarter, with this segment accounting for 53% of new and expansion leases signed. Strength in this market was led by general enterprises and digital content, including an equity trading platform, two global healthcare organizations, a large online retailer and 24 new logos. We continue to focus on leveraging the growth within our network and cloud community to provide enterprises with industry-leading connectivity and cloud solutions restricting the foundation of our platform and [indiscernible] our data centers. From a geographic perspective, excluding the 80,000 square foot lease signed at SV7, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases in Q1 were Los Angeles, New York and Boston. As it relates to SV7, we have accelerated and are now under construction on all 230,000 square feet, which is 54% pre-leased. We are optimistic about our investment in SV7 given the positive absorption trends in the market as well as the limited availability on large blocks of capacity in the market. In Los Angeles, demand remained steady. Importantly, our drive to increase the value of LA2 continues to bear fruit, with leasing at LA2 representing 56% of leases signed in Q1 across our LA campus. In terms of verticals, digital content was our strongest, followed by network and cloud. Stabilized occupancy across the LA campus was 87.7% at the end of Q1, down 160 basis points compared to Q4, as a result of 34,000 square feet moving from the pre-stabilized to stabilized pool. In the New York-New Jersey market, we continued to see improving demand for smaller requirements. In Q1 we executed 12 new and expansion leases across our New York campus, with one 5,000 square foot lease and the remainder under 1,000 square feet. Leasing at NY2 accounted for 58% of signings with NY1 accounting for 42%. Our enterprise vertical represented 42% of signings. Lastly, in Northern Virginia DC, we saw good transaction volume among smaller requirements with 17 leases below 1,000 square feet. We had a soft quarter in terms of total dollars leased due to lack of leases above 1,000 square feet, which we attribute to normal lumpiness associated with large leases. As it relates to capacity, during the first quarter we completed construction on Phase 3 at VA2 and anticipate completing construction on the remaining 48,000 square feet of Phase 4 in early Q2. Including the Phase 4 capacity under construction, at March 31, 2016 we had approximately 93,000 square feet available in Virginia, providing an attractive runway for growth in the market. As Tom mentioned, we have seen significant growth in our interconnection services year-over-year. We continue to see strong cross connect growth involving the enterprise and cloud segments, now representing approximately half of our installed interconnections with a growth rate nearly double that of our network to network interconnections. In summary, we are pleased with our sales performance in Q1. As we look forward, we are optimistic about the current market strength and our pipeline health and are committed to executing against our strategic plan to create value for our customers, partners and shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q1 financial results. Second, I will update you on the development CapEx and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And third, I will discuss our updated guidance for the year. Q1 financial performance reflects total operating revenues of $92.5 million, correlating to a 1.7% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 23.9% increase over the prior year quarter. Our 1.7% sequential quarter growth in Q1 was compressed due to churn realized from the original full building customer at SV3 expiring at the end of the prior quarter, consistent with our guidance over the past year. Q1 operating revenue consisted of $75.9 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 1.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 24.7% year-over-year; $12.7 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 6% on a sequential quarter basis and 24.7% year-over-year; and $1.8 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million. Moving to earnings, Q1 FFO was $0.86 per diluted share and unit, an increase of 7.5% on a sequential quarter basis and 34.4% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $48.5 million increased 1.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 27.8% over the same quarter last year. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter totaled $4.2 million or 4.6% of total operating revenues. General and administrative expenses were $8.7 million in Q1, correlating to 9.4% of total operating revenues, in line with our guidance. Regarding our same-store metrics, Q1 same store turn-key data center occupancy increased 660 basis points to 87.2% from 80.6% in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, same-store MRR per Cabinet Equivalent increased 6% year-over-year and 2.7% sequentially to $1,461. As a reminder, our same-store pool is redefined annually in the first quarter and only includes turn-key data center space that was leased or available to be leased to our colocation customers as of December 31, 2014 at each of our properties and excludes powered shell data center space. In Q1, we finished development of 14,000 square feet of turn-key data center capacity at BO1 in Boston, which is now reflected in our pre-stabilized pool. As of March 31, 2016, this space was 31% occupied. During the first quarter, we also finished construction on Phase 3 at VA2 comprised of two computer rooms. The first is a 25,000 square foot computer room which is in our pre-stabilized pool, and the second, a 23,000 square foot computer room moved directly to our stabilized pool as it was 100% occupied at the end of Q1. As we have previously discussed, we define stabilization as the earlier to occur between 85% occupancy and 24 months after an asset is placed into service. As of the end of the first quarter, two rooms at LA2 measuring 12,000 and 22,000 square feet moved into our stabilized pool at 42% and 76% occupancy respectively. In addition, 16,000 square feet of turn-key data center capacity at NY2 entered the stabilized pool at 73% occupancy. Lastly, we commenced 46,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $164 per square foot, which represents $7.5 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the first quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 90.6%, a decrease of 190 basis points compared to the fourth quarter, largely due to the addition of the turn-key data center capacity to our stabilized pool that I just discussed. Turning now to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $31 million as of March 31, 2016, or $38.4 million on a cash basis, both approximately 2x greater than the levels a year ago. Importantly, approximately 94% of our GAAP backlog relates to leases which will commence once construction is complete, reflecting a significant amount of pre-leasing. Due to estimated construction completion dates as outlined on Page 20 of our supplemental, approximately 90% of our GAAP backlog commences in fiscal 2016 with approximately 20% or $6 million to commence in the second quarter of 2016, including rent associated with the powered shell built-to-suit at SV6. Another 70% or approximately $22 million is expected to commence in the back half of 2016, including a portion of the rent associated with the previously announced SV7 pre-leases. Turning to our development activity, we had a total of 458,000 square feet of capacity under construction as of March 31, 2016, consisting of both turn-key data center and powered shell space. We estimate a total investment of $253.6 million is required to complete these projects, of which $110.7 million had been incurred at the end of Q1. These amounts are comprised from the following projects. In Santa Clara, we had 230,000 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at SV7. Given the recent pace of pre-leasing at SV7, we accelerated construction on all remaining phases in the building. As of March 31, 2016, we had incurred $58.5 million of the estimated $190 million required to complete this project and expect to complete construction during the middle part of 2016. Also in Santa Clara, we had 136,580 square feet of built-to-suit powered shell under construction at SV6. As of the end of Q1, we had incurred $26.9 million of the estimated $30 million required to complete the development and we expect to complete it in Q2 of 2016. In Northern Virginia, we had 48,000 square feet of data center space under construction in Phase 4 at VA2 and had incurred $5.6 million of the estimated $8 million required to complete this project as of March 31, 2016. We expect to complete construction of Phase 4 during the second quarter of 2016. Finally, in Los Angeles we had 43,000 square feet under construction at LA2 and had incurred $15.6 million of the estimated $18 million required to complete this project as of March 31, 2016. Construction at LA2 is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2016. As shown on Page 23 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized in Q1 was 35%. For 2016, we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be between 15% and 25%, weighted towards the first half of the year based on our current outlook and the development pipeline. Turning to our balance sheet, as of March 31, 2016, our ratio of net principal debt to Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.4x. Including preferred stock, the ratio was 3x, below our stated target ratio of approximately 4x. This correlates to incremental debt capacity of approximately $200 million at March 31, 2016 based upon Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Based on 2016 total estimated capital expenditures of $265 million at the midpoint, less the $71 million spent in Q1, we had approximately $40 million in uncommitted liquidity as of March 31, 2016. As a result, we expect to execute upon an additional debt financing in 2016 to increase liquidity. Timing is dependent on market conditions and the expected issuance amount is $100 million to $150 million. This debt issuance is included in our guidance which I will now discuss in more detail. We are increasing our 2016 FFO guidance to a range of $3.52 to $3.60 per share and OP unit from the previous range of $3.37 to $3.47, an increase of 4.1% based on the midpoint of both ranges. The increased guidance reflects the previously announced pre-lease at SV7, better than expected leasing across the remainder of the portfolio in Q1 as well as our current view of the pipeline. More specifically, we now expect total operating revenue to be $391 million to $401 million, compared to the previous range of $380 million to $396 million, driven primarily by our stronger than expected leasing results in Q1. In addition, we expect our interconnection revenue growth for 2016 to be 17% to 19%, up from our previous guidance of 15% to 17%, driven by higher than expected volume growth in the first quarter. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be $203 million to $211 million, up from our previous guidance of $196 million to $202 million, implying a full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin of 52.3% based on the midpoint of guidance. Remember that our guidance suggest a relatively flat margin compared to full-year 2015, reflecting the greater proportion of GAAP rent leased associated with our wholesale leasing over the trailing 12 month period. We expect capital expenditures to be $250 million to $280 million, up from the previous range of $210 million to $240 million, primarily reflecting the additional capital resulting from the accelerated construction of SV7. A more detailed summary of 2016 guidance items can be found on Page 25 of the first quarter earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, other than what we've discussed today. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Schildkraut: I guess let me start with some questions on demand. Breaking apart the larger footprint and the performance sensitive stuff, on the large footprint side I think for yourselves and industry-wide we've seen a fairly large increase in pre-leasing or built-to-suit, sort of the same thing. And Tom, I'd love to get your perspective on whether we're seeing sort of a secular change in the way the buyers are entering the market or if this represents just sort of incremental demand that is finding a difficult place getting a home given industry-wide vacancy rates. And then secondly, on the performance sensitive side, last quarter you eloquently described almost a virtuous cycle of cloud and enterprise demand that cloud brings in, smaller cloud providers bringing in enterprise, bringing in cloud, and you talked this quarter about the strong volume on interconnect, but I'd love to get any incremental color on that sort of virtuous cycle. Thank you.
Tom Ray: Sure. As to the first question, Jonathan, I think that – and Steve will dive in here in a second as well – I guess I would say that I think the pattern of the industry is consistent currently with the last five years. We've seen – you saw the social guys come in strong five, six, seven years ago and need a fair amount of space in a reasonably short amount of time, and that created a favorable supply dynamic in some markets for the service providers. I think we are seeing the same thing right now with the large cloud guys, and I know you see that and write about it extensively. What we've seen over the last handful of years is, any given segment can be cyclical, or any given segment of demand, whether it would be social or cloud, would not surprise me if the cloud demand follows the path of the social demand from five or six years ago, but generally speaking we've also seen new segments and new customers, new demand sources come-in in the next cycle with any given segment. So, our general sense is that current climate seems to have some of the flavor of the social climate several years ago, but here we are again with a new segment and it would not surprise me if that pattern continues. Steve, any color around that, any thoughts?
Steven Smith: Yes, Jonathan, and the thing I guess I would add is, when you look at the large cloud providers out there, they are providing a lot of their backend data centers on their own and what they are really deploying with us is typically more of their edge or network nodes and caching nodes that really kind of you answered that part of the question with your second question, which is they want to be as close as they possibly can to the enterprise just in order to maximize that experience and make it as seamless to them as possible. So that's what we see at least from the larger cloud providers, is that they are deploying those edge and network and caching nodes closer to the enterprise, which also lives in our data center. So I think that's part of it. And then I think you also see, and what we've seen, even over this last quarter, is the smaller cloud providers that are choosing to deploy it right in our data centers so that they can have that interconnection that we've invested in over the past several years as well as those other enterprise customers to connect to. So it's really kind of a combination of all those things, but the large compute from the big guys is still happening typically outside of our TKD space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: So, Steve, just given what you just said about cloud edge node, from a nomenclatures perspective, is the SV7 pre-lease, is that considered performance sensitive or not?
Tom Ray: Jonathan, it's Tom. I would think that that could go in a number of different locations. I think you need to go in the Bay Area, but I think that that application could backhaul a mile and not see a meaningful performance or economic degradation. Does that answer your question clearly enough?
Jonathan Atkin: Yes, I mean you defined performance-sensitive requirements versus non-performance-sensitive requirements. I just wondered in which bucket you will consider that piece of business.
Steven Smith: I guess just I'll give you a little bit of color on it. My sense is, yes, it is performance sensitive and that's why they need to put it in Santa Clara in order to have the performance characteristics required of the applications that are driven out of that and to those enterprise customers versus backhauling it to someplace in the desert or someplace up north.
Tom Ray: And [indiscernible] on a tradition at CoreSite of open communication, I'd probably come down on the other side, and it's just definitional, Jon. I think if you define performances, it's got to be within a certain metro or within a certain radius, limited radius of a point of interconnection, then I would fall right where Steve just fell. I would define performance sensitive as really needs to be inside a campus with a provider to obtain performance capabilities more because of economics. And under that definition, I would not call the large deployment performance-sensitive.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay, that's an interesting set of answers. And I guess then just moving topics to Open Cloud Exchange and I'm interested in the contribution to revenues from that platform, and then just anecdotally, what's the average number of cloud connections that a typical enterprise is taking off of that platform?
Tom Ray: The revenue is inconsequential, it's tiny, and it's high-growth extremely small base from every metric, whether it's revenue or customers' reports or traffic. It's growing very well but it's very, very small right now on all measures.
Jonathan Atkin: Okay. And then I've got just two more. One is, based on where you see demand tracking and the development pipeline that you communicated, mostly in Jeff's comments, I just wondered which metros are coming up where you might need to make some decisions on additional off-campus or additional campus [indiscernible] locations within a given metro. You've got a lot of demand and you've got different levels of capacity remaining to develop, but then you've got to kind of square that with demand. So I just wondered if you could help us out. Will it be Virginia and Santa Clara where you may need to kind of make that decision sooner than Chicago or what would be the kind of the pecking order of markets?
Tom Ray: I think, look, we feel good about our ability to grow earnings and our available inventory over the next call it 12 to 24 months depending on the market throughout the portfolio. I think you start to get out 12 or 24 months, you've got Virginia, Santa Clara, Chicago, where if you look at the trailing pace of net absorption relative to the amount of capacity we're bringing online, those metrics line up toward needing additional capacity. And I think probably each of those three markets is similarly situated in terms of timing. And so I just said on the last call, we are actively looking at expansion opportunities, we feel good about our ability to expand and we are working on picking the best ways to do it. As we said a quarter ago, we don't expect ourselves to be sitting here two years from now going, oh golly, if only we knew we needed more space in Santa Clara and Virginia. We realize where we are and we're working on it. But I think in the three of the largest markets in our portfolio, they are going to need some more capacity in the mid-term, Bay Area, Virginia, Chicago.
Jonathan Atkin: Got it. And then lastly, if you could just kind of refresh for us what your discipline is, what are the strategic criteria and the financial criteria around M&A and buying additional assets or platforms?
Tom Ray: Pretty simple Finance 101 and Strategy 101 combined. The strategy has to be consistent with ours. We are not working to dramatically change the business we're in, so very similar business, complementary geographic reach. Obviously interconnection density is very important to us. And then the math needs to make sense, not only going in but over some period of time. There is positive arbitrage day one, you really have to look at a model for a good five years and feel good that things are accretive to the CoreSite shareholder over that timeframe. I mean that hasn't changed in forever.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: First question regarding visibility, I think last quarter you might have sort of characterized the outlook through the first half as being consistent or very good relative to the prior couple of quarters. Can you maybe give is the crystal ball for the rest of 2016 as you see it today?
Steven Smith: Sure, Jordan. This is Steve. The demand that we've seen come in at least for Q1 has been consistent. So I wouldn't say that there's a whole lot of surprises from the last call that we had, and as responsible for sales for Tom and our shareholders, I take it very seriously and we're out just laying it out every single day. So I wouldn't say that you will see any dramatic changes, but we have to work at it every single day and so far we see good system performance and we just try to get better at it every single day, but overall demand seems to be improving with the market and we anticipate [indiscernible] interest and taking more than our fair share of it.
Tom Ray: And I would just layer on top of that, we want to encourage everybody to consistently think about our business as having this core more transactional colocation oriented business and some moderate degree of midsized sales and leases layered on top of that, and then an opportunistic approach to much larger leases layered on top of that. And I think if you look back over a two-year trail and you strip out a couple of built-to-suits and a recent large lease at SV7, that average probably gives you a better read of that core business. And so I think Steve said it all well, I just want to remind everybody that the kind of leasing we saw in Q1 has a large lease layered on top of that, and that's an extremely lumpy category for our Company, and you really need to think about the target as a trailing average excluding those opportunities.
Jordan Sadler: That's helpful. I guess when looking at the transactions for the quarter and going back to prior conversations, I guess the thing I notice is, you previously were targeting sort of a growing number of transactions. Did we ebb a little bit here in the first quarter in terms of number of transactions, was that just the lumpiness of that business, or anything to report there?
Steven Smith: I'll answer that, and then Tom obviously can add some color there, but as you look at Q4 to Q1, we did see a slight drop between those quarters. As you look at Q1 over Q1 last year, we saw an increase of about 19%. So we did see a good push towards the end of last year and I think there were some customers that were looking to get budgets in and close out business before the end of the year. So we saw a nice rise in that. And then as we come into Q1, we've also seen – I think we picked up on where that momentum left off, it's just we're now starting from a bit of a softer place just given it's a new year, a new market, and so forth. So, coming in at 19% ahead of where we were last year in the same quarter, we'd like to always do better but we're showing strength from where we were last year, and that's important.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, thank you. Last one quickly on SV7, Tom, you decided to go with the rest of it speculatively or at least build out the rest of it and I assume that reflects obviously that you leased up a big chunk right after last quarter's report as well as what you've seen in the funnel there, but who are you targeting and how are the returns on that overall development affected by the larger collection of leases?
Tom Ray: We are targeting, and I think growing the base of business at the Santa Clara campus with the target, and those are the cloud on-ramps, the private WAN network operators, all designed to bring in more of that enterprise user who finds differentiated value in our location. So that's the target. And I think that's continuing to move in the right direction. We have more networks than we had two years ago and three years ago and we have more on-ramps, we have more commitments from the larger public cloud guys, so we think that's moving in the right direction. As to the yield, we've always said, we do view wholesale leasing opportunistically and we did the first larger wholesale deal in SV7 as an anchor lease on IRR based math solely. The ramp was at market at a time when the market was fine, but we did that based on IRR math, and I would say, now the market has tightened considerably and the more recent wholesale leasing is more opportunistic in terms of yield and we are pleased with the return on where that asset is headed.
Jordan Sadler: It's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
David Rodgers: Maybe just follow up on some of the earlier comments that Tom I think you said in your prepared remarks that interconnect has really exceeded your own expectations to start the year, and maybe to simplify it a little bit, where are you seeing it beat your own expectations? You know the customers you are bringing in, you kind of know the verticals that they are in. Are they just adapting much more quickly to the environment, are they taking more cross connects per customer? That was kind of the first question.
Tom Ray: So where we were pleasantly surprised is really the core of the business, and that is net adds of fiber cross connects. The churn on the copper side has remained consistent and this Q was consistent with the trail. Adds in the logical interconnection set were pretty consistent with the trail. We really saw outperformance in net fiber adds. And honestly, it was very well distributed. There were a couple of specific carrier customers who added more than you might see in a given quarter, but we had pretty good growth across the business with regard to net adds of fiber. And sincerely, it outperformed our expectations and I think it's premature to dramatically write up our forecast of cross connect revenue growth from where we've been, [messing the history] [ph]. You saw that we increased guidance 2 points at the mid. But we're watching it and we're pleased, but I can't say this Q gives you enough information to define exactly what and why. It's just one Q and we have to keep assessing it.
David Rodgers: And then maybe second question, I think I missed probably what was some commentary that you made during the prepared comments as well on the power density and how that impacted your rates. I'll go back and read that, but I guess in terms of the trend towards seeing greater power density, the demand to see that space, is that something you're seeing more regularly or is that just very unique in a couple of circumstances?
Tom Ray: I think densities are going up in general and I think they have been, but adjusted for density, if you adjust to look at density on the trailing 12 or trailing 24 months…
Jeff Finnin: Trailing 12.
Tom Ray: Trailing 12 months, the rental rate per foot achieved in Q1 was 7% greater than the rental rate averaging over the trailing 12. So there was real rent growth on a power adjusted basis. And that lines up I think with the increase in MRR per Cabi. You saw a 6 point growth in MRR per Cabi. Of that, about half of that was due to increasing rent, 38% was due to cross connect per cabi and the rest was power, and that rent component reflects a 5.7% growth rate. And so on a power adjusted basis, we've picked up 7 points in Q1 over the trail. On an MRR per Cabi basis, that seems to line up pretty well looking back over the last year. And so I think that in the current environment, we're seeing that additional favorable pricing per unit.
Operator: The next question comes from Manny Korchman from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman: Maybe if we could just go back to your comments on LA and I want to try to reconcile two things that you guys said. I think Tom in your prepared remarks, or maybe of Steve, you talked about strength in that market. You've also got new development there, which seems to be doing okay. But then I guess Jeff spoke about a couple of pre-stabilized developments coming into the stabilized pool at only in the 40% leased. And I was just wondering how do I sort of reconcile those two ideas that you've had a project on the books for 24 months per your definition that's only gone to 40% leased, but you're talking about a strong market with development there?
Tom Ray: Yes, and that's such a good and fair question, Manny, and I've been talking about that with our general manager in LA as well. Look, the short strokes are, part of the soft occupancy in what's being transferred from the pre-stabilized pool in stabilized was under rights of first refusal and first offer with others and they didn't exercise them the way we thought they would have. So that sat on inventory that isn't occupied but we couldn't sell. I would also say that when we made the decision to move forward on the most recent build, the funnel was incredibly strong and we just hit bust on more of those opportunities than we expected. If I had perfect information, frankly I wouldn't have built that most recent tranche and it's a constant mathematical assessment and probabilistic assessment of the funnel of you don't want to run out of inventory, you don't want to be too long, and I think on this most recent whatever it was $12 million or $15 million build in LA, building another 20,000 feet, we jumped the gun and I would say that we're – I don't think we jumped it by much. We feel really good about the funnel in LA and in particular LA2, and we don't think this imbalance will last all that long. But yes, I think [indiscernible] on behalf of the Company on that call.
Emmanuel Korchman: Great. And then if I look at your largest customer list here in the supplemental, you've got this footnote that's recurred from the last quarter on one of your digital content enterprise customers talking about having being in lease negotiations with them and then potentially vacating. With only four months left of average lease term remaining, you think that you'd have clarity sort of by now or is that one of those things that might go into hold over something else by the end of the year?
Tom Ray: So there are already pieces of their position with us are in holdover and that wakes that four months down. They have leases in every single one of our markets. They are very broadly distributed geographically and they are very broadly distributed in terms of lease terms. So this isn't a lease that's set to roll in four months. It's a very, very different animal. And we do have I think now substantial clarity, and my guess is over a three-year period, plus or minus, somewhere between two and four, they will probably move out of half of their capacity. Some of that is in buildings where frankly rather that happens sooner than later, and some of that isn't, but there will be some move-outs in the near-term, I'd say probably half their capacity over a few years, and we think we have visibility with them and understanding hopefully going to documents that retains another chunk for a longer period of time. In general, I just want to talk about this concentration, the key to that question, Manny. Look, of our top 10 customers, they are represented by 53 different leases, and I'll introduce a term called customer buildings, we might have a customer in a building that has three leases in that building. If I count that as one, I've got customer X in building A, that's one; I've got customer Y in building B, that's two; these leases are spread across 36 customer buildings and two different buildings represent between 2% and 3% of our rent, five represent between 1% and 2% and 29 of those are less than 1 point. And so the point of that is, our top 10 list is very diversified geographically and in terms of term and even beyond buildings, number of leases. So this customer that we just spoke about a minute ago, I think is fairly representative of the meat of the portfolio around this issue, and I wanted to offer that data because it helps describe our business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz: I'd like to just go back to the comments that Steve made in his prepared remarks on enterprise interconnect. Just wanted to clarify the enterprise to cloud connections at 50% of the total and that that was 2x the number of network to network connections, was that for the overall base or just for incremental bookings in the first quarter?
Steven Smith: As far as the incremental bookings are concerned, the growth that we've seen has been in the enterprise to cloud and cloud to enterprise. That's where we've really seen the growth of that. The 50% represents the overall base. So as you look at the overall base of cross connects, that's where we are seeing those cross connects happen between clouds and enterprises.
Tom Ray: And just an important clarification, the enterprise and cloud component are cross connects involving an enterprise or a cloud. They may involve a network on the other end but they are not network to network. That component of our business that involves a cloud or a network in the cross connect used to be far less, I don't remember the stats, and it's close to half now and it's growing at double the rate of our network to network business.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then as a follow-on, I was hoping you could compare the dynamics between single cross connects and Cloud Exchange ports for sort of the enterprise customer? Are you actively steering customers towards multi-cloud ports or is the demand for that type of product just kind of not very mature yet?
Steven Smith: We're really trying to provide customers choice and options so they can dependent upon the flexibility, bandwidth, a lot of different factors, weigh into why they make one decision versus the other, but it's really about choice. Up until now and even including now, we see more and more customers still elect to go the cross connect route, but we're seeing a lot more interest and more take rate frankly around things like Open Cloud Exchange given the ability to change the connections on the fly, do it a little bit more dynamically and do it with better economics.
Tom Ray: It has a lot to do with how the cloud provider is coming to market as well with regard to the interconnection. So Azure is coming to market via logical connections, and so they are on our OCX and that's how they are coming to market for their target market. AWS has a different coming-to-market model. Direct Connect is a cross-connect into their DX architecture. So how the cloud is coming to market plays a significant role and how the OCX fits in as well.
Matthew Heinz: Helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Petersen: I think in answer of one of the earlier questions, Steve talked about kind of the edge markets and how the cloud has been moving to be closer to customers. I was hoping you guys could expand on that a little bit and maybe talk about I guess the demand you're seeing, what sort of opportunity there might be for data center operators to play in those markets? I know you guys are in Denver and Boston, which might be considered edge markets, but are there other opportunities since that seems to be where there is a lot of growth right now?
Tom Ray: Obviously. I don't think we want to get too specific around that. We don't want to say where we're doing really well or what Tier 2 markets we think of disproportionate and attractiveness.
Jonathan Petersen: You don't have to get specific. I'm just talking in general, because historically I mean it seems like at least all the public guys want to be in the Bay Area, LA, Chicago, Dallas, all the major markets, but are we going to see a shift in demand towards secondary market? You don't have to get market specific but just where you guys are seeing [indiscernible] trend?
Tom Ray: Look, my view and I think the data supports it over the last 24, 36 months or so is that the global and regional gateways have retained their rates of growth and the Tier 2 markets are growing even faster, which is an advent over the last several years. It's as caching is pushed out to the edge and the router, the interconnect is pushed out to the edge, that is growing at a faster clip than the global gateways. The global gateways have not lost share or lost their growth rate. So I hope that helps, I hope that answers the question, but yes, we see a faster growth rate closer to the edge now than any other segment.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay, all right. And then just a question on LA, you guys talked about, you guys obviously had developments in LA2 and I know historically you've talked about moving, trying to move networks from LA1 to LA2, can you guys give us any numbers around how many networks are currently in LA2?
Tom Ray: I don't have [indiscernible] we have several subsea cables there now. But that really speaks to the fact that it's a campus and we manage it as a campus. It's massive networks and massive interconnections distributed 11 blocks apart.
Steven Smith: Just anecdotally, I will tell you that we are seeing more and more networks build directly into LA2. So I don't have the stat off the top of my head as to numbers, but it is increasing and we see more and more of those networks not only build into LA1 but also into LA2, and then that's also connected with our fiber [indiscernible] obviously.
Tom Ray: And Steve made a note in his remarks that I think is meaningful for us anyway. This quarter we signed more leases in LA2 than we did in LA1. So that might sound like a little thing but it's actually a pretty big deal. So the rate of adds at least in this Q was higher over to LA2 and that trend toward that dynamic has been underway but it was gratifying to see it happen this quarter.
Jonathan Petersen: And obviously it's fair to say that's strategic, right, you guys are pointing customers towards LA2 since that's the building you actually own rather than lease?
Tom Ray: We really do serve out of the campus and different needs have different requirements, but there is clearly a segment of demand that is well met at LA2 and is a good fit there.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay. And then just one more question, either for Jeff or Tom, whichever of you guys want to take it, a lot of your peers have been tapping the equity markets recently. Obviously you guys have stock trade at an extremely attractive multiple in terms of raising equity. Your debt to EBITDA is up to 3x. I know you guys have talked previously, I think your peak is 4x. But just kind of your thoughts around issuing equity in the near term just to give yourself a little cushion as you are increasing your development pipeline?
Tom Ray: Go ahead, Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Jon, I think as you just pointed out, our leverage at the end of the quarter is 3x and basically a turn below our targeted leverage of 4x. As I gave some color on the call, when you look at our capital needs through the rest of this year, I did give some color around us looking at going out and tapping the debt markets for another $100 million to $150 million, and I think that gives us liquidity in the near-term as we look out in terms of where we're headed for the rest of 2016. I think to the extent that will change, it's really going to be driven by increased development and we increased our development spend this quarter, but going out and tapping the debt markets should take care of what we need for the remainder of this year.
Operator: Next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Colby Synesael: I had a question on the cost to build. Can you just talk about how much you are spending maybe not on explicits but what you've seen in terms of the trend line for the cost to build out your facilities? Is that coming down and do you foresee that coming down even further perhaps over the next year or two? And then I guess as part of that question, returns, do you think that the returns for the business with pricing going up, the demand what it is, perhaps with the cost to build going down, that the returns are much greater now on the build that you're looking at doing versus what they were maybe just two or three years ago?
Tom Ray: Look, I think as to the latter, yes, cost is down and in some markets rents in the bucket of rent and power and interconnect is increasing. So yields have improved in the current climate over that of three years ago in select markets. I'd say in other markets, yields have improved as well but predominantly on the cost side, on the basis side, rather than the numerator and the denominator. So our cost to build, I'm joined here by Brian Warren, our Senior Vice President of Engineering & Product, were probably down 15% one year and 10% the next, so probably an aggregate of 25% over the last couple of years.
Colby Synesael: And when you look at the design that you have in place on the new facilities to what you're building now, would you anticipate that to continue to trail off or come down or do you think that that kind of starts to stabilize around the rate to which you're at right now?
Tom Ray: I think it's going to start to stabilize. We've had an initiative over the last couple of years to really make a push on this. I don't think that we're completely done, but I do think we've made large progress. It's a never ending review of every time you build, you look at the design, and can we do it smarter and can we design it more efficiently.
Colby Synesael: And I guess just the last follow-up to that is, as the returns in this sector do go up, one can make the argument that that could increase the desire for competition to move into the space, but the reductions that you're seeing in the cost to build, how replicable are those, how much of that is CoreSite special sauce, if you will, versus something that someone else will be able to come into the market and do the same thing and achieve the same low cost if you will on a per megawatt or a per square foot basis?
Tom Ray: Not to eliminate exuberance but we just don't believe in special sauce with regard to construction, we just don't buy it. On a new build, in a new moment, somebody might have a little bit better idea, but ultimately these generators, concrete, steel, land, labor, these are big warehouses with power and cooling, and you design a product as flexibly as you can, you do build in a modular fashion with as big of swing to the bat as you can to get your efficiencies, but there's nothing special about that sauce. And I do think if you peel the onion around fully turn-key leased capitalized interest, land, everything, I think if you look at cost basis on an apples to apples, from an apples to apples viewpoint across the industry, I think that the lack of special sauce thesis might be validated.
Colby Synesael: Meaning that the returns are fairly similar across the space?
Tom Ray: Meaning that the all-in cost structure is reasonably similar.
Colby Synesael: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: I wanted to actually touch on that very last topic in the context of average power density requirement increasing, and I wondered, is that more for wholesale or more for retail or is it kind of across the board in terms of power density requirements going up, and what implications does that have for the product [indiscernible] in future expansion?
Tom Ray: I think it's more for wholesale but the retail component, if five years ago you never saw a requirement at 300 plus a foot, probably 10% of the market now on the colo business is that dense. Even then very unlikely for like the five cabinet or smaller deployment. I'm talking to Brian now. Have you seen power density change in the very small colo requirement?
Brian Warren: No, not in the very small colo requirement. You do in the midsized requirements, kind of server based midsized requirements as these folks are pushing the densities up. But again that's, as Tom said, a smaller portion of the total TKD [indiscernible] right now.
Jonathan Atkin: So the product in terms of resiliency that you're delivering to the customers who are asking for it, has that changed at all?
Tom Ray: We've gone down the past pretty extensively with if somebody wants to buy the +1 on an N+1 configuration and looking at productizing different pieces of resiliency, really how we've driven cost down is by simplification and standardization and replication. So, no, we certainly looked hard at productization of different pieces of the resiliency stack. We do work with customers who say, I want N on UPS and we might build to that, but that's still a fairly small part of our business. But look at a year ago, we did have a view of productizing different pieces of the capital stack that was out there, and candidly at the end of a lot of analysis, we didn't see huge returns on that relative to other dynamics that we are challenging. But there are consequences…
Jonathan Atkin: And cost to develop – so the improvements that you alluded to in the previous question are cost to develop going down. Was that on a per square foot basis with these 10%, 15% type numbers? I assume that's more square foot than megawatts, or is there anything in particular you had in mind when you gave those numbers?
Tom Ray: We were communicating on a power adjusted basis.
Jonathan Atkin: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heinz: Just one follow-up for Jeff on the model, does the high end of your guidance range assumes some leasing activity of the next phase of SV1? I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of what drives the delta between the midpoint and the high end of the range.
Jeff Finnin: I think in general our guidance will include some assumed leasing across the portfolio. Whether or not it's specific to SV1 or not, but we would assume it's across the portfolio. Is there something specific in SV1 you're looking at?
Matthew Heinz: No, I guess just sort of generally where you're expecting demand, but that kind of answers the question, more distributed across the portfolio. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
Tom Ray: We want to thank everybody for being on the call and taking time, and again, working hard to understand the Company. Special thanks to employees and customers for another good quarter and continuing to help build a good company. I would offer that the management team here and our Board, we're being I think extremely thoughtful about the best ways to grow and drive returns for our shareholders, and this is an attractive time in the market and a good time for us to just keep building a better and better company and organization, and that's what we're focused on and we believe we have opportunities to keep doing that to get better, to get more profitable and to keep growing. So, thanks for staying on the story so far and we'll do whatever we can to help you guys understand us in any way possible. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-12 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Derek McCandless, Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 conference call. I’m joined here today by Tom Ray our President and CEO, Steve Smith, our Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today’s call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management’s judgment.

And now I’ll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Ray: Good morning and welcome to our Q4 call. We’re pleased to report continued execution of our business plan in the fourth quarter, delivering solid growth and finishing out 2015 as another strong year for our company. Looking at Q4, ‘15 over Q4 ‘14, we reported 31% growth and FFO per share driven by 25% growth in revenue and 32% growth in adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see solid margin performance with our calendar 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 51%. This represents an increase of 340 basis points over our margin in 2014. In addition to our solid financial results for the quarter, we finished 2015 and began 2016 with positive leasing momentum. Signing in the fourth quarter 155 new and expansion leases reflecting record transaction count for our company. We’re pleased that in 2015, we increased transaction count each quarter with Q4 ‘15 signings more than 60% greater than the same period a year ago. We attribute this growth to three key factors. First: staffing across our sales and marketing teams were steady in 2015, being largely intact for more than a year now with minimal voluntary churn compared to 2014. Second: we made material improvements to our front-end technology systems in 2015, with the first phase of our technology systems investment focused upon our sales activities and launching to strong success in Q2 of this past year. Finally, we believe that enterprise adoption of cloud services, maybe seeing an inflexion point with an accelerating number of customers connecting to cloud providers across our portfolio. Regarding our interconnection services, interconnection revenues saw another quarter of solid growth at 26% over the prior year quarter, with calendar ‘15 reflecting 25% growth over 2014. And looking at interconnection volumes, Q4 results reflect a similar story to the rest of 2015 as compared to 2014. First, 2015 saw a continued decrease in lower priced copper cross-connection volume of 3% over 2014. Second: we saw a continued strong increase in cyber cross connections with 2015 recording 15.8% growth over ‘14. Finally, in 2015, we saw over 50% growth in interconnections made over our higher value logical interconnection product set comprised predominantly of our Any2 Internet Exchange, Blended IP and the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange. In looking at this shifting mix, we’re pleased to see the sales mix in our interconnection products, points where the high bandwidth latency sensitive workloads we work to enable our platform to support. Related to this, we were pleased in 2015 to launch 100 gig service on our Any2 Exchange in both Los Angeles and Denver in direct response to articulated customer demand. We anticipate scaling our 100 gig platform across other markets in 2016 as our customers increasingly rely upon us to serve high bandwidth requirements. In addition to strong leasing and growth in interconnection revenue, in 2015, our company executed upon several key operational objectives we had for the year. First, 2015 marked the fifth consecutive year that we achieved Six 9s and portfolio wide-up time, providing our customers with the performance and the liability they need to run their mission critical applications and support performance centered workloads. Additionally, in 2015, we obtained ISO 27001 Certification for our Data Center Colocation services across all of our operating data centers. This certification underscores our focus around our information security controls and our commitment to providing our customers with secure, reliable and high-performance data center colocation solutions. ISO Certification joined the robust mix of additional operational certifications in areas of compliance support that our company brings to the world’s most demanding enterprises including many among the Global 1000 which represents over 30% of our revenue. Finally, as previously mentioned, in 2015 we delivered the first operational phase of our investment in technology systems, designed to simplify our company for our customers and employees. Beyond enabling our sales and marketing teams to move faster and more efficiently, we successfully laid the building block to support to further technology improvements across our company, many of which are currently in-flight and targeted to become operational in 2016. In summary, we are pleased with the operational advancements our team has made across our company in 2015. And even more strongly encouraged about the prospect of further advancement over this coming year. I’ll now move on to provide an update on our outlook for our key markets. With regard to the performance sensitive market segment, we remain encouraged by the demand we’ve been seen across our platform and we believe the trends we’ve seen will remain favorable throughout the coming year and beyond. Regarding the wholesale market segment, current activity in the market suggest to us that the first half of 2016 maybe as favorable as 2015 in terms of growth absorption with upside regarding rental rates in select markets due to a more favorable balance between supply and demand. We believe we have less visibility into demand for the second half of 2016 and we’ll continue to closely monitor demand dynamics as we progress through the year. Regarding our expansion activities, 2015 marked another year of significant capital investment for our company, specifically we invested $133 million in expansion capital during the year, completing construction of 185,000 net rentable square feet across our markets. At year-end, we had a number of additional projects underway which will increase our footprint by 370,000 square feet including two new buildings in the Bay area, additional capacity at VA2 in Northern Virginia, further build-out of LA2 in Los Angeles and expansion at BO1 in Boston. We estimate all of this capacity will be placed into service by the middle of 2016. The largest among our investments currently underway in the largest ground-up data center development in our history is our 230,000-square foot ft.7 project in Santa Clara. We are encouraged by current supply demand dynamics in the Bay area, and we believe that wholesale rents have returned to equilibrium increasing over 20% from the trough five years ago. With more rational and healthy rents now in the market for larger requirements, we are hopeful that we will bring ft.7 to market at a favorable time. As a reminder, our first phase of TKD delivery at ft.7 comprises 80,000 square feet and with 48% pre-leased to an anchor customer as of December 31, 2015. Turning to Northern Virginia, although there is ample supply in the market, demand remains steady and we saw solid leasing momentum at our Reston campus during 2015. We are now under construction at VA2 to convert the remaining 96,000 square feet of shell space into TKD capacity, which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2016. This capacity is currently 24% pre-leased. In Los Angeles, leasing activity across our campus has been robust with particular strength at LA2, where stabilized occupancy increased 120 basis points to 90% in Q4 compared to Q3. In light of the steady demand we’re seeing in the market, in Q4 we commence construction of incremental capacity at LA2, which we expect to substantially complete during the first half of 2016. In summary, we’re pleased with our financial and operational performance in 2015, and we remain focused upon executing our business plan. We believe that we are making important investments to support the future growth and continued evolution of our company, and that our national platform continues to grow in its ability to demonstrate added value to our customers. We entered 2016 with high morale and high energy and we will work hard to further strengthen CoreSite’s position in nourishing key communities of interest and bringing differentiated value to the market. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Smith: Thanks Tom. I’d like to start by reviewing our sales activity during the quarter. Q4, new and expansion sales totaled $8.9 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 42,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $211 per square foot of TKD capacity. As it relates to pricing, the Q4 rental rates of $211 per square foot represents a 44% increase over the average rental rate over the first three quarters of this year. Most of this increase was driven by increased power density in Q4. When adjusted for power density, our Q4 rental rates represents an 8% increase over the first three quarters of this year. While we have seen demand for high density requirements increase over time, this quarter was uniquely heavy in its way and therefore does not represent a marked change in our projected outlook. Overall, our Q4 and 2015 sales results reflect our broad appeal across our key U.S. markets as well as the progress our sales organization is making in targeted industry verticals. At the new and expansion transaction counts, we continue to see steady progress against our goal of increasing quarterly volume, with a specific focus on targeting small customer requirements. Regarding Q4, we executed a new company record of 155 new and expansion leases for TKD capacity. In terms of size distribution, 147 leases were for smaller requirements of less than 1,000 square feet, seven leases were for mid-sized requirements of 1,000 and 5,000 square feet and one lease was for 8,300 square feet for an average of lease size signed in the quarter of 272 square feet. Importantly, Q4 leasing represents continued strengthening in our transaction engine producing smaller leases, correlating to a 7% increase and a number of leases smaller than 1,000 square feet compared to Q3 and a 36% increase over the average of the trailing four quarters. Looking more broadly at our leasing results for all of 2015, we had a strong year across all metrics. Regarding new and expansion sales, we signed a record 526 leases totaling 404,000 net rentable square feet correlating to $46 million in annualized GAAP rent. The $46 million in GAAP rent leased reflects an increase of 39% over 2014 and represents the highest level of rents signed in our history. Related, we continue to make good progress in diversifying our customer base and enhancing the value of our communities of interest across the portfolio. In Q4, we added net new logos and cumulatively added 95 net new logos in 2015. This represents an increase of 16% compared to the number of new logos added in 2014. Among the logos, there were new to our base in Q4, 63% were in the enterprise vertical. As such, we continue to focus on enhancing the long-term value created in our data centers by the high quality of customers and applications attracted to our national platform and global customer base. In addition to strengthen new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q4 was solid as renewals totaled approximately 50,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $204 per square foot reflecting mark-to-market growth of 3.8% on a cash basis and 6.7% on a GAAP basis. On a full-year basis, cash rent growth was 4.6% in-line with our guidance of 4% to 5%. Q4 churn was 2.3% in the fourth quarter and includes the reduction in annualized rent of $2.6 million or 150 basis points of churn related to the original full-building customer at SV3 of which we’ve been forecasting throughout the year. For all of 2015, churn was 7.5% below our guidance of 8% to 9%, and adjusting for the SV3 customer, it was 6%. Regarding vertical mix, during Q4, networking cloud deployments accounted for 46% of new and expansion leases signed. Within the network vertical we saw solid performance across our national platform with particular strength at our Reston campus, with new network deployments from six carriers including both domestic and international providers, as well as the completion of new fiber builds by two large providers. We believe these key wins highlight the continued interest in growth of the network ecosystem, we have dealt at a competitive enterprise alternative to the Ashburn market. Differently, in a cloud vertical, we continue to see strong demand for small ecosystem cloud services around the big cloud deployments across our platform, reinforcing our belief that the large cloud providers will continue to attract incremental customers and support future enterprise adoption. Additionally in Q4, we executed a new network edge node deployment for major file sharing platform at our LA campus, remaining positive about good momentum we have built around our cloud offerings in our portfolio in a variety of options for connectivity and diversity we provide our customers. Turning to our enterprise vertical, leasing in Q4 was strong again, with this vertical accounting for 54% of new and expansion leases signed in the quarter. Strength in this segment was led by digital content and other general enterprises. We signed 35 new logos in the enterprise vertical including a large international global asset management company for multi-market deployment with a leading provider of technology products and services and a leading social media platform. For the full year of 2015, we continue to see strong leasing momentum across both our network and cloud verticals as defined by transaction volumes as well as the type of deployments we’ve been able to attract, increasing the value of our network dense in cloud enabled data centers. Specifically in 2015, the number of new and expansion leases signed in our networking cloud verticals accounted for 48% of leases signed, and we ended the year with more than 300 network service providers and more than 200 cloud providers across our platform. Also in 2015, we saw solid enterprise momentum with broad-based strength across a number of industries and verticals including digital content, healthcare and financial services. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in Q4 were Los Angeles, the Bay area, Chicago and Northern Virginia, D.C. Together, these four markets accounted for 80% of the new and expansion leases signed in Q4 and 95% of our annualized GAAP rent in the quarter. In Los Angeles, we continue to see consistent demand and leasing continues to be well distributed between the two buildings comprising our One Wilshire campus. In terms of verticals, digital content remains solid accounting for 40% of leases executed in LA, while networking cloud deployments represented 48% of leases in LA in Q4. Stabilized occupancy across the LA campus was 89.3% at the end of Q4, an increase of 280 basis points compared to Q3, driven by increases at both LA1 and LA2. Absorption in the Bay area has been remarkably strong in 2015, and the fourth quarter was no exception as demand from the networking cloud verticals accounted for approximately half of the new and expansion leases executed in this market, with general enterprises falling closely behind. Stabilized occupancy across this market is now approaching 95%, while our Santa Clara campus is now 97% occupied. With limited supply in the market and the outlook for continued strong absorption, we are very encouraged for the opportunity regarding our investment in SV7. We expect 80,000 square feet of TKD capacity of Phase 1 to be completed in the middle of this year. In Chicago, leasing was driven by the enterprise vertical including a multi-market lease with global technology services organization. In addition, we saw demand from the digital content and network verticals, stabilized occupancy at CH1 is now almost 92% while our recently completed pre-stabilized phase is now 80% leased and occupied. As we discussed last quarter, in the New York, New Jersey market, we saw an up-tick in funnel volume but we have not seen that translate into net absorption. For the year, net absorption in this market was in line with the prior three-year average but significantly below the 2014 level, primarily driven by lower demand for wholesale requirements. In 2015, we did continue to see solid demand for smaller deployments as well as good enterprise penetration. In Q4, we executed 10 leases at NY2 all under 1,000 square feet including seven new logos. Of those leases, 70% were in the enterprise vertical. In addition to enterprise, we continue to focus on building the network and cloud density of our NY campus. To that end, we now cap 24 networks available at NY2 and our seamless connection to the carriers in cloud that NY1 continues to drive demand between the two locations. In Q4, we also completed another new fiber build into NY2 from a leading global network enhancing our ability to serve enterprise and contact companies in this market. Lastly, in Northern Virginia, D.C. leasing was strong at VA1, which accounted for the majority of signings in this market during Q4. Network and cloud deployments accounted for nearly 40% of new and expansion leasing, with stabilized occupancy at 92.5% at VA1, we look forward to delivering the new capacity associated with phases 3 and 4 at VA2 in Q1 and believe that will be well timed to meet market demand. In summary, we closed out 2015 with solid momentum and will continue to focus on executing against our stated targets as we go into 2016. We will continue to enhance the diversity and value of our platform while continuing to provide our customers with superior customer service. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. I’ll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q4 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development CapEx and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity and third, I will introduce our guidance for the year. Q4 financial results were strong with total operating revenues of $90.9 million, a 5.3% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 25.4% increase over the prior year quarter. Q4 operating revenue consisted of $74.7 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 5.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.4% year-over-year. $12 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 5.5% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.1% year-over-year and $2.2 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $1.9 million. Q4 FFO was $0.80 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 8.1% on a sequential quarter basis and a 31.1% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $47.7 million increased 9.2% on a sequential quarter basis and 31.5% over the same quarter last year. Related, for the full-year 2015, our revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 66% and 54% respectively adjusted for unusual items in 2014. Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $4.1 million or 4.5% of total operating revenues. For the full-year, sales and marketing expenses correlated to 4.8% of total operating revenues, 50 basis points below the 2014 level and slightly below the low-end of our guidance range. General and administrative expenses were $9.7 million dollars in Q4 correlating to 10.7% of total operating revenues. For the full-year, G&A expenses correlated to 10.3% of total operating revenues in-line with our guidance. Regarding our same store metrics, Q4 same store turn-key data center occupancy increased 770 basis points to 87.9% from 80.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, same store MRR per cabinet equivalent increased 3.2% year-over-year and 1.2% sequentially to $1,459. In Q4, two rooms of 18,000 square feet each at NY2 moved into the stabilized operating pool as both rooms exceeded 85% occupancy. As we have discussed previously, we define stabilization as the earlier to occur between 85% occupancy in 24 months after an asset is placed into service. Lastly, we commenced 54,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $172 per square foot which represents $9.3 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 with our stabilized data center occupancy increasing 510 basis points to 92.5% compared to 87.4% at the end of 2014. 390 of the 510-basis point increase was driven by lease commencements over the trialing year. The remaining 120 of the 510-basis point increase reflects Q4 ‘15 adjustments to factors we use to convert cage usable square feet to net rentable square feet based primarily upon three elements, namely, estimated cage usable square feet, critical power consumption and the associated cooling relative to the data center’s capacity. From this evaluation, we adjust our conversion factors and the resulting occupancy based on the limiting resource of space, power or cooling. Turning now to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $15.9 million as of December 31, 2015 or $27.2 million on a cash basis. We expect nearly 60% or $9.1 million of the GAAP backlog to commence in the first half of 2016, which includes rent associated with the powered shell built to suit at SV6. Another 21% is expected to commence in the back half of 2016, which includes a portion of the rent associated with the SV7 pre-lease. Turning to our development activity in the fourth quarter, we had a total of 370,000 square feet of capacity under construction consisting of both turnkey data center and power shell space. In addition, we have deferred capital projects under construction which relate to operating data-center square feet previously constructed and placed into service that following development completion requires incremental capital when a customer’s density or space requirements exceed our initial development. We estimate a total investment of $211 million is required to complete these projects of which $86.2 million had been incurred at the end of Q4. These amounts are comprised of the following projects. In Santa Clara, we had 80,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity plus 150,000 square feet of power shell under construction at SV7. As of December 31, 2015, we had incurred $23.8 million of the estimated $110 million required to complete this project and expect to complete construction of Phase 1 near mid-year of 2016. Also on Santa Clara, we had 136,580 square feet of build-to-suit powered shell at SV6. As of the end of Q4, we had incurred $18.1 million of the estimated $30 million required to complete the development and we expect to complete it late in Q1 or early in Q2 of 2016. In Northern Virginia, we had 96,000 square feet of data center space under construction in Phase 3 and Phase 4 at VA2, and had incurred $22 million of the estimated $32.5 million required to complete these projects. We expect to complete construction of both Phase 3 and Phase 4 during the first quarter of 2016. In Boston, we had 14,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity under construction at BO1. At the end of Q4, we had incurred $9.4 million of the estimated $11 million required to complete this project and expect to complete construction in Q1. Finally, in Los Angeles, we commenced construction of 43,000 square feet at LA2 and had incurred $7.6 million of the estimated $18 million required to complete this process. Construction at LA2 is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. Moving on to other CapEx matter. This quarter, we had added disclosures in our earnings supplemental regarding potential deferred capital projects and expenses. While we have historically disclosed the expenditures related to these projects and our guidance regarding capital expenditures and data center expansion, the timing at which we make some portion of these investments can be uncertain. And in some cases, ultimately we may not invest a portion of the total cost that we initially disclosed as being associated with a given expansion project. Regarding these projects, at times, we do not complete the full build-out of new data center infrastructure to deliver all power and cooling capacity in accordance with our full design. And rather defer investment of a component of planned capital until customer utilization warrants such investment. Once a project is substantially complete, we define as deferred expansion capital, the difference between the amount, of capital then invested and the amount of capital we estimate would be required to fully build out this space in accordance with full build-out depending upon our assessment of future customer requirements and our plans to add capacity to our data centers. Again, the timing by which we might invest in deferred expansion capital and in fact whether we ultimately invested at all is subject to uncertainty based upon customer utilization. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had deferred expansion capital projects under construction in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and the Bay area, which should all be completed during the first quarter of 2016. We estimate the total cost of these projects to be $9.5 million as reflected on Page 20 of the Q4 earnings supplemental. On Page 21, we have provided an estimated range of longer term deferred expansion capital. We currently estimate this amount to be $30 million to $40 million, if, when and to the extent we determine that we will commence construction on any project representing any portion of deferred expansion capital, we will update our disclosures and add it to our current projects under construction reflecting the project as a deferred expansion capital project. As a reminder, when we complete development projects, we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real-estate taxes and insurance resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. As shown on Page 23 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized in Q4 was 29% and for the full-year it was 34%, in line with our estimate. For 2016, we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be between 15% and 25%, weighted towards the first half of the year based on our current outlook and the development pipeline. We forecasted this reduction in capitalized interest what correlate to an increase of interest expense of $1.5 million or $0.03 per share of reduction in FFO in 2016. Turning to our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2015, our ratio of net principle debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA was two times, including preferred stock ratio was 2.6 times, below our stated target ratio of approximately four times. This correlates to incremental debt capacity of $264 million at December 31, 2015 based upon Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we entered into a new five-year $100 million term loan by exercising a portion of the accordion under our $500 million senior unsecured credit facility. We used the term loan proceeds to pay down a portion of the balance on the existing revolving credit facility as well as for general corporate purposes. The execution of this incremental $100 million term loan further extends and staggers our debt maturity profile and increases our liquidity to support our business objectives and fund growth. To that point, following the execution of the term loan, we have approximately $300 million of available liquidity which is more than sufficient to fund our current development plans. As it relates to our dividend, during the fourth quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend to $0.53 per share on a quarterly basis or $2.12 per share on an annual basis, a 26% increase over the prior year. This dividend rate equals 62% of the mid-point of our FFO per share guidance, in-line with our historical FFO payout ratio which has been in the range of 59% to 63%. Historically and again in 2015, the composition of our dividend has been 100% ordinary income, due to the Carlisle conversions in April and October 2015, and the associated increase of tax expense from the conversions, some portion of our 2016 dividend maybe a return of capital. As always, we remain focused on maintaining our dividend payout levels to comply with our REIT requirements, balance with our opportunity to retain cash to invest in future growth. And now, in closing, I’d like to address guidance for 2016. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes on our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we’ve discussed today. As detailed on page 25 of our Q4 earnings supplemental, our guidance for 2016 is as follows. FFO per share in OP unit is estimated to be $3.37 to $3.47. This implies 20% year-over-year FFO growth based on the mid-point of the range and the $2.86 per share we reported in 2015. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $380 million to $396 million. Based on the mid-point of guidance, this implies 16% year-over-year revenue growth. As it relates to interconnection revenue growth, we expect that 2016 growth rate to be between 15% and 17% which is more closely aligned with overall volume growth. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $35 million to $37 million or approximately 9.3% of total operating revenue. This correlates to a 5% increase in G&A expenses over 2015 reflecting our efforts to scale our business and operate it more efficiently. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $196 million to $202 million. This correlates to 17% year-over-year growth based on the mid-point of the range and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 51%. Last quarter, we noted our expectation for moderation in the rate of expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin primarily due to product mix. Our guidance suggest that relatively flat margin compared to full-year 2015 reflecting the volume of larger leases signed over the trialing 12-month period as well as the increase in metered power associated with these deployments. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows. Estimated annual churn rate of 6% to 8% for 2016, keep in mind that we expect an elevated level of churn in the second quarter of 2016, due to another portion of rent associated with the original full-building customer at SV3 expiring. The amount is equal to $1.9 million in annualized rent or an incremental 90 basis points of churn. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 3% to 5% for the full year. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $210 million to $240 million. The components are comprised of data center expansion cost, estimated to be $185 million to $200 million, this includes the expansion capital related to the final phases of VA2, the build-out of both SV6 and SV7 as well as incremental turnkey data center capacity across the portfolio as needed. Non-recurring investments are estimated to be $15 million to $20 million, and include amounts related to our IT initiatives, facilities upgrades and other capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures and tenant improvements are each estimated to be $5 million to $10 million. Now, we’d like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from the line of Jonathan [sic] Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut: You can call me Thomas. But, listen, a couple of questions here, I guess, first, Tom, you mentioned in both the press release and in your prepared comments some of the momentum from ‘15 as continued into the early part of the year. And I guess that sort of asks us to ask you precisely what you’re seeing in the early part of the year and for a little bit more color. And then, sort of a second question, one of the things that Tom, you and I have talked about historically has been sort of the increase in the average sort of size of the performance sensitive deals that were coming in. Now, you guys report on square feet and I think our conversation was more about power density. And so, I was wondering if you might give us little sort of color around that and maybe what some of the drivers are if it is in fact still recurring? Thanks.
Tom Ray: Sure, I’m going to take the first and give Steve the second. On the - that’s the second, the first was markets. Yes, Jonathan, I think what we’re trying to make clear is we see continued firm demand in the funnel right now, pretty consistent with last year. As always, three or four quarters out, it’s harder to see and there is certainly lot more chop in the macro environment right now. So, we’ll be paying attention to where, to signs around longer term demand. But what we see right now is a good steady funnel in-line with that of last year. And that’s it, there is no other message than that.
Jonathan Schildkraut: All right, great. And then, on the sort of average size of the performance sensitive deployments that you’re seeing?
Steve Smith: Yes, this is Steve. As far as performance sensitive I think that can cover a broad range, anywhere from network providers to some of the more financial institutions, some of those that are very more inter-parted base. But have a latency since the requirement. And we’ve seen increases across the board for more performance sensitive type of requirements. But I would say, as far as how that shows up as far as deal size is concerned, I think deal size has remained relatively consistently. As I pointed out in my comments, earlier in the call, we have seen density requirements increase over time. This quarter was uniquely heavy in its weighting. But we have seen equipment providers come out with you that is requiring more power and more cooling. And that’s just to drive some of this heavy workloads.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great, I’ll circle back into the queue. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, it’s Stephen Dye [ph] here with Dave. What are the prospects for interconnection growth in 2016? 2015 you saw a keep-up with the recent trend and you’ve discussed on past calls just in general the network density improving. Can we expect more of the same in 2016?
Steve Smith: Well, we’ve been consistent, in the past couple of years seeing that it at some point revenue growth is going to start to converge with unit count growth plus maybe there is 2% or 3% annual pricing bump on top of that. But what we pay most attention to is the rate of our fiber growth and our fiber growth is kind of been in that 16% to 18% range, more up in the not. And we don’t know exactly when that revenue growth trend is going to converge closer to that unit cap growth trend. But we do believe that that’s likely and I don’t know, if you think of that happening over a few years that’s probably not a bad way to model.
Tom Ray: And Steve, and the only thing I would add to that is, right towards the end of my prepared remarks I did give some color around revenue growth in 2016 specifically unrecognized when we, I simply said we expected to be somewhere between 15% to 17% revenue growth in ‘16 largely due to what Tom just talked about.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. And then, for G&A in 2016, we think a similar pattern in terms of seasonality as 2015, I’m just trying to get a better sense on that going forward given a bit of a bump in 4Q.
Tom Ray: Yes, Stephen [ph], I think just address me with a bump in the fourth quarter as you get a chance to read this supplemental. Inside there you’ll see that we ended up recording about $1.75 million in the fourth quarter. It was specifically associated with two legal issues that we are dealing with, we talked briefly about it in the third quarter call. That amount was expensed during the fourth quarter. And as we sit here today, we’re estimating on those two cases that we expect to resolve them for somewhere between zero and $3 million. We’ve accrued $2.7 million as we sit here today, which we’re comfortable with. But as we move forward into 2016, we’re obviously incurring some level of legal expenses on a quarterly basis just to defend those suits. But that gives you the spike in the fourth quarter of ‘15.
Steve Smith: I think in general it’s probably reasonable to straight line.
Tom Ray: Yes, I think it’s fairly flat as you think about it for 2016.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you. Can you expand on the inflexion point Tom that you commented on regarding enterprise adoption of the cloud in your prepared remarks, you generally not prone type pre-release. So what specifically are you seeing?
Tom Ray: Well, there are two things that are behind that comment, one is funnel, and so perhaps there is more high-probably that might be our norm. But the funnel is to us demonstrably showing more interest in connecting to cloud. But second, we try not to just talk about the funnel and hopes and dreams and wishes. So, our interconnections to cloud and enterprise customers, over the last two years have increased meaningfully, that growth rate has increased meaningfully relative to interconnections to all other providers. And we saw a further increase in the slope of that line in 2015 over ‘14. So, we’re really just tracking the growth of interconnections involving enterprise and cloud customers. And that growth rate has increased very measurably over the last two years and that rate of increase accelerated over the trailing 12 months. And the pace of that acceleration causes us to say, we’ve been saying for some time, it’s early days, it’s very early we’re working off of very small numbers. We’re still working off of relatively small numbers related to the cloud but not miniscule any longer. And the growth rate continues to accelerate. So, that has a saying, something is strengthening around that cloud vertical.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Now, can you bridge that comment and sentiment around the slowdown in the interconnection growth, I realize that question was just asked. But you’re going from 26% year-over-year in the quarter to 16% for next year, and there seems to be a disconnect there.
Tom Ray: Well, I think you just see less growth in unit pricing going forward. We’ll see how we’re able to navigate through that and we’ve also been clear that we’re seeing growth in higher priced interconnection products and contraction obviously in the lower priced copper products. And the highest pricing among all of our products is within a logical interconnection set. That has the highest growth rate. So, look, we’re going to hope to drive strengthening enterprise adoption around the higher priced product set and see where that takes us in terms of revenue growth. But it’s really too early to tell. And we wanted to put out there some numbers that we felt good about people modeling.
Jordan Sadler: It’s great, thank you. Can you give us the latest on Cross Connect and the portfolio?
Steve Smith: We’re just over 20,000.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, we disclosed last quarter, Jordan, it was over 20,000, and it’s consistent with where we are today obviously.
Jordan Sadler: Still over 20,000, excellent. Thank you.
Steve Smith: Yes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question today is coming from Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Jon Petersen: Great, thank you. I just wanted to touch on future development. I mean, I guess the first thing was NY2, you guys have done a great job of leasing up the first couple of phases there. It’s at 95% now. But they’ve got nothing in the pipeline, so I’m curious when we see phases 3 through 5 start to enter the construction phase?
Tom Ray: It’s all dependent on leasing. And the bottom-line is, we are, as I think most of the industry is now very good at building in modular fashion and assets delivering new inventory fairly rapidly. We tend to think of the ability to deliver new product in existing Core and Shell in a range of 60 to 90 days. So, we just don’t know. And when we have clear absorption, you’ll see more space enter into the development pipeline. But there is no reason to point the bat around that right now and we’ll see where demand takes us.
Jon Petersen: So, I mean, so are you saying that you are pretty confident you’ll be able to pre-lease it before you start construction or like the significant portion of it, is that what you’re waiting for to 95%?
Tom Ray: Not at all. We’re just saying, we can build very rapidly so we’d like to continue to push occupancy pretty high. And that’s it, we’re not saying anything more or less than that.
Jon Petersen: Okay.
Steve Smith: This is Steve, just to give you a little bit more color around that. As we went through in the earlier remarks, we’re seeing a lot better transaction around the enterprise phase and those smaller individual deployments which does allow us to drive greater density before we’re, having to fill that additional capacity. So that’s what really allows us to kind of push the envelope further there where we’ve had little bit lighter absorption relative to wholesale which I think is.
Tom Ray: It’s lumpy.
Steve Smith: It’s lumpy and that’s really indicative of the market in that area.
Jon Petersen: Okay. And then just one more question on future developments, so I’m just looking at page 21, the hope for development. You guys are pretty much maxed out in Chicago, and once you finish Northern Virginia, you kind of maxed out. But once you finish VA2, this seems like you maxed out there. So, I guess, what’s the plan for future expansion of market?
Steve Smith: We’re aware of both of those facts and are thinking accordingly.
Jon Petersen: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Barry McCarver from Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Hawthorne: Hi, this is Brian Hawthorne filling in for Barry McCarver. And first question, can you talk about the growth that comes from current customers versus new customers?
Tom Ray: You want to answer that Jeff?
Jeff Finnin: Yes, I think in general, it varies a little bit from quarter to quarter. But when you look at the volume of leases and Steve commented a little bit in terms of the logos. But as you look at it from a rents perspective, I think historically we have been around 20% has come from new in any given quarter and the other of it is coming from the existing customers.
Steve Smith: And that seems to have kind of stabilized out over the last couple of years, it’s pretty consistent since we’ve reached a level of mass.
Jeff Finnin: Yes.
Brian Hawthorne: Okay. And then, on the pricing, you talked about on the new expansion leases is going to be little bit higher, it’s going to be lot higher this quarter, but that was driven by power. I guess, kind of how should we think about that then going forward through this year and kind of how much of that was driven by power?
Tom Ray: Well, as Steve said, on a power adjusted basis, we saw the rent in Q4 up about 8% over the trial. So, what, in general, the markets are healthier, we’re seeing reasonable rent growth, in some markets more so than others. But things are healthier, we’re expecting yields to go up a bit this year. And that’s it.
Brian Hawthorne: All right, thank you guys.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Rashim [ph] in for Jon. Can you update us on the strategic front and internationally do you feel it would benefit you to enter Europe? And then domestically, it seems a number of your public and private peers are entering new markets. Is this something you also feel inclined to do more or less? Thanks.
Tom Ray: Sure, no change really to what we were saying for a long, long, long time. On the margin, we see some value and greater reach, greater breadth in terms of serving the customer, we see some value and scale in terms of internal operations. But we do believe that our existing platform has appropriate and very meaningful reach in North America which we view as a very big vibrant market. And so, we believe we’re highly effective in increasing the value of our business, doing just what we’ve been doing. And that sets a baseline, that belief and that expectation around growth and earnings sets a baseline against which we compare any other activities. And we do look, we do pay attention, we’re the hardworking pragmatic people. We don’t have any natural aversion or drive to grow for growth sake. The growth that we want to see is in earnings per share for the common shareholder, that’s where we focus. And we don’t anticipate that changing one bit.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matthew Heinz from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Heinz: Thank you, good afternoon. Regarding the footnote disclosure on your third largest customer in the customer table. So, I was wondering if you could give us a bit more detail around the product mix of their deployments as well as your expectations for mark-to-market and then kind of the contribution for the expected churn there in your overall churn guidance?
Steve Smith: Sure, I’m just going to give you get some color from a sales perspective. That customer continues to mature with us, frankly, we’ve seen them level out to some degree as far as their overall growth release within our portfolio. And we continue to look at how we can evolve that relationship. But overall it’s stable and it’s continuing to evolve.
Tom Ray: Let me just give you some color Matt, I guess on the churn and the mark-to-market. Obviously, both of those numbers that we’ve given for guidance reflect where we think that customer will ultimately end up as it relates to lease renewals as well as some churn. We do expect some churn to result. But we’re still working with the customer and we anticipate some of that in the back half of the year. But again, those amounts are included in our annual guidance as it relates to both churn and the mark-to-market.
Steve Smith: And I’d say, that customer is very widely distributed across our portfolio, in a lot of different locations, in lot of different leases with a lot of different expiration dates. And the churn and mark-to-market are related. And we just, as everybody has pointed out, there are some markets where we’re not sitting on a bunch of vacant space. And we’re not inclined to, we’re here to drive the returns on our investment and there will be times when that will contribute to churn. If we believe that we should, we paid more for space in certain markets or is there another set of customers, we’ll create more value for our shareholders than you can expect to see churn in those markets. And we think that’s just to divine and often good.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, that’s helpful commentary. Thank you. And then, if I could just follow-up one more on the interconnection piece. I guess, it seems like there has been about six or seven points of call it pricing or mix growth, that’s benefited revenues versus what you site as fiber volumes in the last several quarters. And I suppose the 2016 guide kind of implies that that goes away. I guess, I’m just looking for a little more color on, is it the mix of copper and fiber and that transition is largely over with or is it just kind of that you’ve sort of reached the plateau in terms of how you can price fiber? Thanks.
Tom Ray: I just think the upside on fiber pricing is less than it was a couple of years ago.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, so, less driven by mix, transitioning more to fiber from copper?
Tom Ray: Yes, I mean, look, the mix continues to support, and we believe the mix will continue to support revenue growth exceeding interconnection, total interconnection growth, because the mix is increasingly at a higher revenue per unit, pointed toward more units that are higher revenue per unit. Over the last several years, we’ve moved our pricing closer to where we’ve seen market, I think we deeply discounted the market, handful of years ago, we’ve moved that up. I think we’re still below that of probably the two larger interconnection incumbent. So we feel like there is still room but less though than before. And we don’t expect to lean in on pricing as heavily in the next year as we did in some of the past years.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks Matt.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Manny Korchman from Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Manny Korchman: Hi Jeff, just a quick one for you. The impairment of internal used software that you guys took in the quarter, is that related to the same software package that you’ve taken impairments on in the past and if so, are we sort of done with those and that’s a product that you just, or a project that you just shelved at this point?
Tom Ray: I’ll hit it Jeff, I mean, I own that step. That right up in Q4 was from a new initiative this year that we drew or drive well on. That’s fixed, we’ve got, as we’ve said and as I said in my remarks, the technology platform we delivered in Q2, really focused on sales and marketing, the front-end of our business went very, very, very well. Also during ‘15, we started several other technology projects internally that are leveraging off of that Q2 delivery, one of those we pulled the plug on this year in Q4. Then we’re going to take a different approach on it. So that’s it.
Manny Korchman: Thanks Tom.
Tom Ray: Yes.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks Manny.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great, I have two. So just wanted to go back initially to, I think it might have been in Jonathan’s question to start off. You mentioned in your prepared remarks you had better visibility on the retail oriented or small deployment type product. And you said you felt that guidance or the visibility was good through the course, you thought that the demand wouldn’t perspective be similar to what you saw in 2015. But you said for wholesale you only had good visibility through I think the first half of this year. Can you just kind of walk us through, why you might have better visibility on the smaller retail part versus wholesale? I would think that the lead times that are required for wholesale that might have actually been flipped. And then I also have a question on AFFO, I know you don’t give guidance for AFFO, but I was wondering if you guys can give us some color on your expectation there particularly that might relate to the straight line rent adjustment line item as well as capitalized leasing commissions? Thank you.
Steve Smith: Hi, this is Steve, maybe I’ll just take the first part of that question relative to pipeline strength and momentum coming into 2016. As far as the retail business is concerned, that tends to be more of a run rate type of business. So, as we look at how we finish the year and coming into 2016, we’re just looking at the overall pipeline, it seems to be more consistent. As far as distance and visibility into the future, that can change these types of market conditions and everything else, right. So, that’s TBD, I think as far as overall long-term 2016 view is concerned but overall pipeline and run-rate seems to be in line. Relative to wholesale, I think those type of opportunities do have a bit more I would call it six-months’ worth of visibility. You do see those opportunity that take a little bit longer sales cycle, those kind of customers are a little bit more pragmatic and thoughtful about their planning and when they look to deploy. So that just gives us a little bit better visibility as to at least the next six months.
Colby Synesael: I guess, the point there that was that, your comments you have better visibility on retail versus wholesale isn’t necessarily a reflection of trends in the market as much as a function those types of specific services?
Tom Ray: Yes, I mean, it’s Tom, but look, retail, certainly for the performance sensitive and the colocation absorption in our business has been remarkably consistent for years and years and years. And we’ve I think obtained a degree of comfort that that will continue in large measure for certainly for the next 12 months, we’re giving visibility for a year around that and it feels very solid. And on the wholesale side, you’re right, there are deals in the market and lots of people indicating the need space. Forgive us for being old and Maudlinly after living through several cycles, you just never know. So we just won’t point the bat too far into the future around wholesale. You just never know. So, we’re going to pay attention like we always do.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, on your second question, just to give you some historical thoughts, you’re right, we don’t guide to AFFO. But if you just look at where we’ve been over the past several years as a public company, our AFFO, it does become a little volatile, just it largely depends on leasing commissions as well as straight line rent as you point it out. I think if you look at us historically, we’ve been, our AFFO as a percentage of FFO has been anywhere between 80%, to 85%, I think that’s a good range to use as you think about modeling it for 2016. And then specifically around straight-line rent, straight-line rent increased during 2015 and that’s largely due to some of the wholesale larger deployments we saw which typically have ran some and as a result have a greater proportion of straight-line rents associated with them. We would expect that number to come down and moderate slightly in 2016 just due to those ramping in the cash continuing to be paid, and the straight line amount decreasing. Secondly, on leasing commissions, you could see obviously the amount we paid in 2015 being about $21.5 million, we would expect that to moderate meaningfully in 2016, again what drives that are larger wholesale deployments. And we would expect that to be down in 2016 just due to the deployments we’re selling in - anticipate selling in 2016 versus what we did last year.
Tom Ray: But that’s where the uncertainty is.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, that’s really where there uncertainty is.
Tom Ray: Instant commissions.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, absolutely, that’s where it’s going to be driven by what we sell.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you. And congratulations on the results.
Tom Ray: Thank you.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks Colby.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks, I just wanted to come back to the availability of product that was touched on Chicago, Northern Virginia, potentially Santa Clara, you’ve got some there now. But if you sign some of these, so this is kind of two parts, one if you opportunistically sign some of these wholesale tenants that are in the market, I would imagine some of this availability would dissipate even quicker potentially. So, one: I’m curious about that appetite to sign the wholesale guys versus the smaller retail tenants. And then separately, do you see opportunity to do new De Novo builds out there given land pricing in those markets?
Tom Ray: Well, that’s the first, our appetite for wholesale, it’s just driven by spot market pricing. There is no more magic to it than that. And again, we would lean more heavily when we have a lot of new inventory. How we think about that, hasn’t changed over all the years. As we talked about it a minute ago, we feel like we have a pretty good read on the field rate from the really good colocation business, and that’s a pretty steady line. And in a big new building such as Santa Clara, for one, when you have that big of a building, then some degree of wholesale, leasing is interesting. But again, the math has to work. The rent has to be attractive. And then, can we build more in these markets, I think that on the one hand, this kind of development is more challenging than other types of development, I do believe that with regard to power in particular. But on the other hand, its non-insurmountable, I think we’ve proven for a long, long time that we’re a highly capable land buyer and developer. We do stay on top of market opportunities, and we just continue to feel good about our ability to grow the company and to serve our customers and to take good care of our shareholders. And maybe we just don’t feel under any form of duress, we think we can execute and continue to grow.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that’s helpful. Just lastly, I look at and you guys have executed well on development obviously, but I also look at your portfolio today and how highly utilized it is in a sort of longer-term context basically, as long as I’m sort of tracking the company. It’s much higher, your stock price also much in terms of valuation looks good, and pretty rich relative to some of the peers. I mean, how do you think about that your valuation and using your currency opportunistically?
Tom Ray: Well, we just think about our valuation mathematically on the trial, we’ve tried to produce strong growth and we feel like we have. And on the forward, we view our valuation as a maniacal drive to under-promise and over-perform, nothing is going to change. We are going to work like hell to deliver on the promise that’s inside this company and we still think that promise is pretty significant. With regard to using as a currency for M&A, I mean, again no change, and I know you don’t expect anything other than that from us Jordan. It’s, I’m a firm believer that every decision needs to be accretive to what else you could have done. And maybe sometimes you’re multiple is high because you’re not using your currency in a manner that is dilutive or people believe you have discipline around how to use the currency. Maybe we should be running about as happy spread investors but that’s not how we’re made. Again we view our equity extremely dearly and we believe we have a really good run in front of us more to accomplish. And that sets a baseline against we measure everything else. And that’s just not going to change.
Jordan Sadler: I think we all appreciate that. Thanks Tom.
Tom Ray: All right.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Jordan.
Operator: Thank you. We’ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Ray for any further or closing comments.
Tom Ray: Thank you very much. And thanks to everybody for being on the call. I would depart from our norm, we have we think a really good relationship with everybody in the community. But I do need to call everybody on the phone out on this one, absolutely no proper for Year 2016 Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos. We’re hurt, we’re stunned but we’re going to still love you. We’re back to business. That’s just it, back to business. We have a lot we believe we’re going to accomplish. We feel like we’re still very well positioned to drive growth and drive earnings. And we’re going to stay focused on that. So, thanks for taking the time to understand our company. We appreciate it. We’ll be available to help anybody going forward to understand the company. And we’ll put a wrap on it. Thank you again.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-22 11:00:00) =====

And now I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Ray: Good morning and welcome to our Q3 call. Financial results for the quarter reflect continued steady growth reporting year-over-year increases in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share of 23%, 33% and 35% respectively. We continue to see solid margin performance with our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 50.3% measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q3 2015. This represents an increase of 370 basis points over the comparable period ending with and including Q3 2014. Regarding sales, our momentum carried into the second half of the year and supported strong production in Q3. Further, we are pleased with our progress across our three primary objectives for 2015, namely, to increase transaction count, further drive network value and bring more leading global public clouds under our platform and on to our CoreSite open cloud exchange. Regarding transaction count, we again increased the number of leases signed and specifically the number of smaller leases targeted to increase interconnections and drive ROI. In Q3, total transaction count of new and expansion leases reached 149, which is a record for us as a public company. 93% or 138 of the new and expansion leases executed this quarter were for deployments measuring less than 1,000 square feet each. Regarding network value, in Q3 we signed leases to add 37 new network deployments to our platform. Network wins in the quarter include companies in the subsea, satellite, cable, and mobility sectors in addition to a broad array of fully integrated network service providers. Additionally, new network agreements signed in the quarter represent service providers from around the world including global providers based in North America as well as providers based in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden, and United Arab emirates. More broadly over the past four quarters we signed agreements to add 130 network deployments to our platform from all over the globe further cementing our national platforms ability to provide high-performance, low latency solutions to requirements of businesses from a wide array of industries and conducting activities around the world. Beyond our network activities, we're pleased with our progress with major cloud providers as well as the broad set of company's supporting cloud adoption by the enterprise whether in a public, private or hybrid delivery model. To that, during the quarter we executed 56 leases with cloud system integrator and MSP partners. Included among these is our recently announced initial agreement with Microsoft to provide direct connectivity to Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute within our LA campus representing the only native Azure ExpressRoute deployment in the Los Angeles market. Azure ExpressRoute is now available to our customers via the CoreSite open cloud exchange and we expect to soon support the service with an API being developed in collaboration with Microsoft. We are excited to launch this partnership with Microsoft and we look forward to expanding the relationship to other markets across our platform. With regard to new and expansion leases with company's supporting cloud adoption by the enterprise, during the quarter we meaningfully expanded our relationship with a leading global file hosting service provider as well as two Fortune 100 providers of technology services. Among the key capabilities of the cloud, SI and MSP customers with which we executed leases in the quarter, our that FedRamp compliance, security, storage, multivendor service orchestration, software defined networking and other areas of technology support that help make the communities within CoreSite's platform accessible and valuable to enterprises from nearly all walks of life. With our focus on increasing the networking and cloud density across our platform and attracting performance sensitive deployments, our Q3 interconnection revenue grew more than 24% in Q3 2013 over Q3 2014. Related, we continue to see fiber cross-connect volume growth increasing 16% year-over-year in Q3 with total cross-connect volume growing 12%. With regard to supply and demand, there been no meaningful changes compared to the update we provided during our second quarter call. Supply and demand dynamics in our industry remain largely in balance and we view the environment favorably as absorption has remained strong in the majority of our markets. In the performance sensitive segment of the market, supply has remained disciplined with just in time delivery, a standard practice by us and our public peers, supported by steady demand, the performance sensitive market segment continues to see consistent pricing trends. As it relates to the wholesale segment of the market, absorption has remained steady in major markets including Northern Virginia and the Bay Area. Although supply remains robust in Northern Virginia, existing supply of large blocks of capacity is currently more constrained in the Bay Area resulting in incrementally positive pricing. In New York, New Jersey, we continue to see an uptick in funnel volume, but we have not yet seen a material increase in net absorption. Regarding our development activity, we have a number of projects underway or recently completed which we believe support continued growth. In Northern Virginia, demand remain steady and we're seeing solid leasing momentum at our Reston campus. As a component of our leasing in Reston, in Q3 we signed agreements to add three new network providers to the campus bringing the total number of network providers at the location to 32 We believe that the network community established in our Reston campus has helped to support an attractive pipeline of leasing opportunities with social media, digital content and cloud providers. Given the solid pace of leasing at our Reston campus coupled with support from our current funnel, we're under construction on both phase 3 and phase 4 at VA2 representing the remaining components of VA2 targeted for build-out of TKD capacity. These phases are expected to be delivered in late 2015 and early 2016 respectively. Each phase is approximately 48,000 square feet with 50% of phase 3 pre-leased to our anchor customer at the facility. In Chicago, we completed construction on 12,000 square feet of TKD capacity in Q3 of which we've preleased 54% with a targeted commencement date in Q4. In Santa Clara, we are under construction on the previously announced powered shell build-to-suit at SV6 and we expect to deliver that building in the first half of 2016. We also commence construction on our 230,000 square foot SV7 building with an estimated completion of phase 1 in mid 2016. We remain encouraged by the pace of demand in the Bay Area and are optimistic about our opportunity with this investment. In summary, we are pleased with our team's execution in Q3 and optimistic about our market opportunity closing out 2015 and looking ahead to 2016. We believe the growth potential of our business is attractive and we believe in our ability to continue to execute our business plan. Our focus remains clear, to provide our customers with differentiated high-performance solutions and industry leading customer service and by so doing continue to deliver strong growth and superior returns for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Smith: Thanks, Tom. I'd like to start by reviewing our sales activity during the quarter. Q3, new and expansion sales totaled $8.8 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 64,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $138 per square foot. As it relates to pricing in the quarter, annualized GAAP rent per square foot on new and expansion leases was slightly below the trailing 12-month rate primarily due to lower power density sold in the quarter. Looking at the performance sensitive segment, the rate per square foot was in line with the trailing 12-month average. As Tom mentioned, we made good progress on our goal to increase leasing volume to smaller customer requirements, executing 138 new and expansion leases of less than 1,000 square feet in Q3, a 25% increase over Q2. We also saw continued strength in leasing among mid-sized opportunities across our platform signing nine new and expansion leases between 1,000 and 5,000 square feet compared to two mid-sized leases signed in the first quarter and five signed in last quarter. The solid leasing activity particularly the increased volume of smaller deployments contributed to the 53 new logos signed in Q3, a record since CoreSite became a public company. This continues to be a key focus as we look to further diversify our customer base. In addition to strengthened new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q3 was similarly strong as renewals totaled approximately 72,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $145 per square foot reflecting mark-to-market growth of 4.2% on a cash basis and 9.7% on a GAAP basis. On a year-to-date basis, cash rent growth is 4.9%. Churn was 1.4% in the third quarter and is 5.1% year-to-date. Jeff will update you on our outlook for mark-to-market growth and churn for the full year later in the call. Regarding vertical mix, networking cloud deployments accounted for nearly 60% of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases led by significant strength in the cloud vertical. The network vertical reflected similar strength including key wins with a large global provider deploying new fiber builds in multiple locations across our platform as well as a number of domestic and international carriers deploying new network nodes at LA2, all strengthening the network density and attractiveness of our LA campus. Following a very strong performance in our enterprise vertical in Q2, we continue to see increased penetration into this key market segment. Specifically, in Q3, leasing in the enterprise vertical accounted for approximately 40% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. Strength in this segment was led by the digital content and other general enterprises while the number of leases signed by SI and MSP customers increased materially on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in Q3 were Northern Virginia, DC, Los Angeles and New York. Performance in Northern Virginia/DC was driven by three key factors. First, we saw a robust leasing activity at VA1 among smaller deployments with 24 new and expansion leases signed of less than 1,000 square feet each, which is two times the average number of leases in this segment signed in the trailing 12-month period. This activity helped increase stabilized occupancy at VA1 to 92.5% at the end of Q3. Second, we realized continued leasing momentum at VA2 among larger deployments. A sizable component of the leasing at that building during Q3 consisted of an expansion by our original anchor tenant. The rental rate associated with this final expansion rate was below our average rate of the campus does negatively impacting the total leverage. Occupancy at VA2 is now 87.4% consisting of 100% occupancy in the stabilized space and 50% occupancy in our pre-stabilized space. Finally, we saw increased strength in the network and cloud communities across our Reston campus. Notably, we have seen steady demand in network-centric applications in the third quarter as well as a steady pipeline of social media, digital media, storage and cloud providers seeking to deploy interconnection hubs at the campus. At a high level, we are pleased with our progress in the Northern Virginia/DC market during Q3 with over 30 networks now deployed within our Reston campus. Moving to the West Coast, leasing in Los Angeles continue to be well distributed between the two buildings comprising our one Wilshire campus as well as among verticals. Network and cloud customers accounted for 50% of leasing with digital content representing 30% of leases signed. We also saw very good leasing activity related to our recently completed capacity at LA2. In Q3, the number of new and expansion transactions were 14% ahead of the trailing 12-month average and annualized GAAP rents signed was more than two times that signed over the same period. Additionally, we recently signed an agreement making LA1 the site of the newly announced faster transpacific submarine cable landing station in LA directly connecting the West Coast of the U.S. with Japan and the Pacific Rim. The faster transpacific submarine cable deployment represents the seventh subsea cable to offer direct access from our Los Angeles campus to Asian markets increasing our value proposition and providing our customers with enhanced connectivity options. Further, we continue to bolster our cloud capabilities at our LA campus with the availability of AWS direct connect and now the availability of the only native Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute deployment in the market. In New York, leasing activity picked up from last quarter with 22 new and expansion leases signed, including 10 new logos. As it relates to distribution of leasing, we signed three leases exceeding 1,000 square feet while the pace of leasing amongst smaller deployments remain solid. Enterprise leasing also picked up in Q3 with nine new and expansion leases signed in this vertical compared to an average of four leases signed in the trailing 12-month period leveraging the network and cloud density we have built across our New York campus. Related, we have seen significant fiber capacity added from a large cloud provider to support even greater on-ramp capabilities. In summary, we are pleased with our sales momentum in Q3 and our progress on our key priorities, including a solid increase in transaction count and attracting key network and cloud deployments, which enhance our customer communities. We continue to focus on differentiating the value of our platform and the solutions we provide to our customers supported by best in class customer service. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q3 financial results followed by an update on our development CapEx and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity and last, I will discuss our revised outlook and guidance for the remainder of the year. Turning to our financial performance in the third quarter, data center revenues were $84.6 million, a 6.4% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 23.5% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Q3 data center revenue consisted of $70.9 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 6.4% on a sequential quarter basis and 24.3% year-over-year. $11.4 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 7.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 24.3% year-over-year and $2.4 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $1.9 million. Our third quarter FFO was $0.74 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 8.8% on a sequential quarter basis and a 34.5% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $43.7 million increased 7.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 33% over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.5% increased 390 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. Related, on a year-to-date basis, our revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO is 67% and 56% respectively adjusted for unusual items in 2014. Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter totaled $3.8 million, 10% less than the prior quarter, but in line with the trailing four quarter average. We expect sales and marketing expenses to be in line with the lower end of our guidance of approximately 5% to 5.5% of total operating revenues for the full year. General and administrative expenses were $8.6 million dollars in Q3 correlating to 10% of total operating revenues. We expect G&A for 2015 to come in at the higher end of our guidance range of 9.5% to 10% of total operating revenue. Regarding our same store metrics, Q3 same store turn-key data center occupancy increased 760 basis points to 86% from 78.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, same store MRR per cabinet equivalent increased 3.7% year-over-year and 1.5% sequentially to $1,441. Lastly, we commenced 66,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $139 per square foot, which represents $9.3 million of annualized GAAP rent. Turning now to backlog, our projected annualized GAAP rent from signed, but not yet commenced leases is $17.8 million as of September 30, 2015 or $28.2 million on a cash basis. We expect approximately 30% or $5.4 million of the GAAP backlog to commence in the fourth quarter, another 50% is expected to commence throughout 2016. As a reminder, within the total backlog amount is rent associated with the build-to-suit at SV6 as well as the SV7 pre-lease each forecasted to commence in the latter half of 2016. Turning to development activity and expansion CapEx, during the third quarter we placed into service two projects at CH1 and LA2 with 11, 700 and 12,500 square feet now reflected in our pre-stabilized approval respectively. We have seen good leasing activity in our pre-stabilized assets, which were 52% lease and 39% occupied as of the end of Q3 compared to 33% leased and 27% occupied at the end of the second quarter. During the third quarter, we began construction on Phase 4 the last Phase of VA2 with 48,000 square feet under development, which along with 48,000 square feet at Phase 3 is expected to be completed over the next two quarters. As a reminder, when we complete development projects we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. As shown on page 21 of the supplemental a percentage of interest capitalized in Q3 was 22% and year to date is 36%. Based on our current development pipeline we would expect the percentage of capitalized interest for the full year to be in line with the year-to-date your today percentage. Turning to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2015, our net debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.0 times and if you include our preferred stock it is 2.7 times. As we mentioned last quarter, based on the current and expected development projects disclosed on page 19 of the supplemental, we would expect our leverage to increase by year end to approximately 3 times, including preferred stock comfortably below our stated target ratio of approximately 4 times. Finally with regard to our outlook, we are increasing our 2015 FFO guidance to a range of $2.82 to $2.86 per share in OP unit from the previous range of $2.75 to $2.83. The increased guidance reflects our performance through the first nine months of the year and increased visibility into the fourth quarter. More specifically, we now expect total operating revenue to be $329 million to $333 million compared to the previous range of $325 million to $330 million. Data center revenue is now expected to be $321 million to $325, up from the previous range of $317 million to $322 million. Adjusted EBITDA is not expected to be $165 million to $169 million up from our previous guidance of $162 million to $167 million implying a full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.5% based on the midpoint of guidance. As it relates to churn, we now expect full year 2015 turn to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Year-to-date churn at the end of Q3 was 5.1% and as we have previously communicated, we expect an incremental 150 basis points of churn at the end of Q4 related to the lease amendment debt SV3. In addition, we expect some churn related to a particular customer deployment in Chicago in either Q4 2015 or Q1 2016. Cash rent mark to market growth is now expected to be 4% to 5% for 2015, up from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. This reflects our year to date performance of 4.9% and improve visibility into Q4. While we will provide formal 2016 guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings call in February, I want to highlight a few items as you begin to think about your models and the Outlook for growth next year. First, as it relates to our adjusted EBITDA and FFO margins as we go forward, we would expect to see a moderation in the rate of expansion, primarily due to product mix. As we have discussed previously, the volume of larger leases signed over the trailing 12 month period impacts our earnings margin given the greater proportion of metered power associated with these deployments. While we mentioned on previous calls this year that we expected to see limited margin expansion in 2015 with greater opportunity to expand margins in 2016, the build-out and power draw are still ramping in from several of our newer wholesale deployments. As such, we have seen attractive margin expansion in 2015, but now expect more limited opportunity from margin expansion in 2016. We will provide more detail around us on our Q4 call in February. Next, our available capacity under the credit facility plus cash at the end of Q3 is $243 million. Based on the development projects as reflected on page 19 of the supplemental, we anticipate spending $116 million of expansion capital through June 30, 2016 leaving us with current uncommitted liquidity of approximately $80 million. Based on this development pace plus the potential opportunity to fund additional investments, we're currently assessing the capital markets to decide the timing, amount, and the type of debt instrument to increase our liquidity to support future growth. Last, as it relates to churn for 2016, we would remind you that we expect an incremental 90 basis points of churn in Q2 2016, due to the SV3 lease amendment and as disclosed in our supplemental and 10-Q to be filed tomorrow. A more detailed summary of 2015 guidance items can be found on page 23 of the third quarter earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. Now we’d like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you good morning. First question is, I guess also looks at into the future a little bit leaving off where Jeff, you wrapped up your prepared remarks. I guess I’m curious a little bit about capacity and as you’ve been very successful over the last four quarters or so leasing up the portfolio I’m curious about while you’re in the process of assessing your capital needs, the process in assessing the need for additional capacity across the portfolio and how we should think about that either geographically or from a product perspective?
Derek McCandless: Thanks Jordan. I think at a high level, just pays to think of what we’ve been communicating in terms of our priorities for capital. So, really if you look at the markets we're in right now and where we’ve had the most absorption, then do that math and look at how much is remaining to be available to either be developed or remain to be sold right now that’s already turnkey that points you to where we’re focused. I think we’ve had accelerated leasing in Virginia VA2. The SV7 building is the last building available to be built on our current landholdings in Santa Clara. It’s a big building, but it is the last one. We're running short in Chicago. So, same list of suspects and we’re just evaluating what are the opportunities for investment and what are our returns and we're just working through all that with our board, but I think the easiest way to think of where we’re going to spend our time is in line with those capital deployment priorities that we’ve been articulating. And we just don’t have anything specific to say right now other than, we're 2.9 times levered. We have capacity to keep growing. We have some markets where we’ve had success that we’re getting lean and we're just trying to be economically rational about what to do about that picture.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And geographically, any thoughts or need to expand beyond the current footprint or like the way you are situated today?
Derek McCandless: Well, no change to Pat's comments. All things being equal, more markets are better, but I don't think that’s a hugely meaningful driver for us. And in particular, if you look at this Q, which I think is not that different from past Qs we are attracting a global customer base here in the States. I think we’re effective with platform requirements and we just don't feel meaningfully disadvantaged because of the market coverage. We feel like we’re in the best places in the U.S. with a vast majority of them with the most data center demand in the country that we’re addressing through our portfolio. So, we are pleased with our ability to keep growing in the markets we are currently in and on a risk-adjusted basis that’s highly attractive. That’s not to say that something else might be attractive at some point in time, but the table that is set before us is good and plentiful.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then on the mark-to-market increase, I’m curious if that’s coming from market rent growth or if it’s a combination of market rent growth and the focus on the smaller transaction, what exactly is driving that?
Steven Smith: Yeah, Jordan this is Steve. It’s really a combination of both of those things. We're seeing obviously strength in the marketplace that allows us to hold rent and that’s encouraging, but we're also seeing better traction in those smaller deployments which we built in some other renewals that help us in that regard, but overall renewals seem to be solid so we’re pleased with both sides of the equation.
Derek McCandless: And keep in mind Jordan that the mark-to-market stat is leases that were in the portfolio at the end of the Q and that renewed so that stat does not pick up selling to new customers.
Jordan Sadler: Right, right okay. I get that, I get that. Lastly, just more housekeeping oriented, there was a transaction costs in litigation, it showed up as two different numbers in two different places and I was wondering what might have driven the Delta litigation seems to be added to the second spot in the supplemental and what the nature of those expenditures might have been.
Jeffrey Finnin: Yeah, Jordan, you're probably referencing roughly $650,000 in the quarter and those costs are largely attributable to some certain legal issues that we’re working through a couple of situations and that’s substantially what those costs relate to.
Derek McCandless: I think those accruals are for two different items and when you look at the amounts, I don't think they are game changers for the company but we felt it appropriate to take some reserves against two different items. And they are unrelated.
Jordan Sadler: Should they be recurring or is this hard to predict?
Derek McCandless: I think it’s difficult to predict. In general, we don’t have much litigation at the same time you have some the bigger a company gets you’ve got slip and falls, you’ve got all kinds of stuff out there and it is hard to predict. I think it’s rare that a company of any size never has anything and I think it’s equally rare that we’ve had anything material.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.
Jeffrey Finnin: Thanks, Jordon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thank you for taking the questions. First, I just want to follow up on the development of your cloud communities, obviously you guys have made a lot of progress in getting Microsoft as your on ramp in LA. It was an exciting announcement. Can you give us a little bit of perspective on the development of the other side of putting together these cloud ecosystems that is, where are we as a company or as an industry in terms of seeing enterprises come into plug-in to the multi cloud environment or into the cloud ecosystems that you’re developing and then I’d like to follow up with maybe a couple of detail-related questions, thanks.
Steven Smith: Sure, Jonathan. This is Steve. I’ll give you my comments and then I'll let Tom wrap up, but in general I would say that it’s of greater interest for the enterprises to want to have that connectivity flexibility within our data center. So, we work to provide that flexibility across our open cloud exchange and with the reconnect and various other providers, so that’s driving a lot of activity on our end to make sure that we accommodate that from an enterprise perspective. But we’re also seeing greater interest from the other side from the cloud providers wanting to connect back into those enterprises so between the two, we’re at a very nice place in the marketplace where we’re in between those two and being able to provide those connections. So, we look at it to be a continued focus for us as we go forward in part of the value proposition that we built into our data centers. So, I think it will continue to materialize and something will be continued focus for us as we go forward.
Jonathan Schildkraut: But if you had but - go ahead Tom, I’m sorry.
Thomas Ray: I think it’s very early innings still, we’re just measured by cross connection to what extent our enterprise is connecting into the clouds. We’ve had one of the large public clouds, their providers who’s been with us longer than others and I’d say the first year they didn't, we didn't see a lot of enterprise take up around that offering. I see over the last year, we’ve seen it connections accelerate pretty meaningfully. That said it’s still relatively small compared to the size of our company or all cross connects here, so I would say that we are starting to see it in the more mature deployments, but I still think it’s very early.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great, thanks Tom. Ironically I was going to ask you what inning we were in, but you seemed to have nailed that one. A couple of detailed questions here, there was a $8.8 million of capitalized commissions in the quarter. I think that was somewhat of an anomaly from what we were expecting. Is there any incremental color around that?
Steven Smith: Yeah, Jonathan, just to give you a little bit of color around the $8 million, I would say roughly 60% of that amount relates to external commissions, the rest of it are internal and of that external piece, a major component of that related to a single multi-market new logo that we signed during the quarter and anticipate commencing in Q4.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Okay.
Thomas Ray: I think it’s important to understand the cash around that as well.
Steven Smith: Yeah, I guess just to give you a little bit more color, that particular, for the one particular transaction is a transaction whereby the lease or the commission amounts will be paid out over the life of the particular term of that deployment as we collect cash from our particular customer. And so while it will be paid over a period of the customers’ term, the supplemental reflects the entire amount that we anticipate paying out over that period of term just so you have an understanding of how that works. We provided some additional disclosure inside the supplemental in our definition just to make sure that gets cleared up for people.
Thomas Ray: Jonathan, just the simple I guess the clearest thing we can say is the meaningful transaction to which Jeff referred is with an agent rather than a real estate broker, it’s more of the telecom based agent on a longer-term multi-market deal and our work with our auditors and internally with our team pointed toward capitalizing all of those payments even though we paid that agent as we received the money over a longer term, capitalizing that and then accruing it as a liability since we haven't paid the cash. So, if you are trying to, as I think most people are trying to look at AFFO on a cash basis, a big chunk of the AFFO is frankly a noncash item in this quarter.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Yeah, all right, thanks for that extra color. I’ll just ask one more here and then I’ll circle back in the line, but look it was a very solid quarter again for you guys and you’re able to bring up the guidance. It’s interesting to me that where we are in the year and the fact that there's usually a fairly decent lag time between the time deals are signed and they start to generate revenue to see you be able to take up numbers and so I’m wondering as we look at your guidance increase this late in the year if this had to do with faster leasing or faster commencements or delayed churn like what are the factors that roll together to allow you to move the numbers here? Thanks.
Thomas Ray: It’s leasing. Our churn has been in line, our mark-to-market has been in line, so it’s really leasing. There you have it.
Jonathan Schildkraut: All right. Thanks guys, really appreciate you taking the questions.
Thomas Ray: Yeah.
Steven Smith: Thanks, Jonathan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. So I was interested in any noticeable change in the demand or activity in your business as a result of the large M&A deal that recently closed and then, related to the commissions question, overall if you could talk about how much of your leasing is a result of direct sales to customers versus indirect channels? Thanks.
Derek McCandless: What’s the M&A deal you’re just talking about? I have no idea. I’m sorry, I’m kidding there. Steve do you want to talk about what you’ve seen?
Steven Smith: Yeah, I would say from the M&A deal that you’re discussing, I haven't seen a whole lot of difference in the marketplace relative to how we’re competing and how they're showing up as of yet. That may change over time but as it sits today, nothing material.
Derek McCandless: I just think it’s too early.
Steven Smith: And then Jonathan on the second one, I think in terms of I guess what the number of deals that would be coming through I think you said the channel and/or broker, I think on average it’s going to vary based on and it’s good to be driven by the size of those leases, but on average it’s anywhere between 10% to 20% is what we would typically see. That’s typically what we’ve seen over the last several years in terms of number of leases.
Jonathan Atkin: Number of leases, okay, got it. And then I'm interested in the growth, not the absolute volumes of interconnect revenues but just the growth you’re seen in interconnect and how much of that would you characterize as coming from customer to carrier versus a customer to customer within your data centers? Any sort of change in the mixed shift and what should be the predominant driver?
Thomas Ray: I think you are seeing some increase in the share that is non- carrier related or put differently enterprise to enterprise, enterprise to cloud, but the majority still remains involving a carrier.
Jonathan Atkin: And then related to that, there is open cloud exchange and then there is design wins that can ExpressRoute and Direct Connect and if we isolate cloud related activities into those two buckets, which would be the more meaningful incremental driver that you’re seeing right now?
Thomas Ray: Between what John?
Jonathan Atkin: Open cloud exchange versus the cloud specific on-ramps that you’ve got like an ExpressRoute and Direct Connect and then perhaps a few others.
Thomas Ray: We are kind of the same. ExpressRoute with us is number one, [indiscernible] the number two and it’s currently only on the exchange and that’s the request of the service provider. So I'm not sure how to answer it. There is a fair amount of – sorry.
Jonathan Atkin: Go-ahead. I thought that those might be separate particularly in the case of say Direct Connect where some of that might come directly from the customer onto that cloud rather than through your CS platform.
Thomas Ray: And with Direct Connect, that’s accurate. The majority of connections into Direct Connect are via Cross Connect. And with [indiscernible] to different animal right now because of how they have come to market in our portfolio.
Jonathan Atkin: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Rodgers: Hey, good morning, Tom. I had a question for you I guess around the network wins. You talked about 37 I think network wins in the quarter, 130 in the trailing 12 months if I got the numbers right. I'm just kind of curious that the market is experiencing the same type of growth if you think within your markets you’re just winning a tremendous amount of share in that business. I guess I just love a little bit of more color around the network side of the business if you could.
Steven Smith: Yeah, sure. This is Steve. I'm going to start off here. I think we are attracting a fair share or maybe more than our fair share of the activity in that marketplace driven by increased strength in the enterprise space and just increasing the value in our hubs in LA and DC and so forth. But I think just the overall industry is seeing significant growth as you've seen in recent reports on the news that the value of Cross Connects and the interconnection strengthen the marketplace. So that’s just driving more and more connectivity to the data centers in general but I think we’re seeing a pretty good share of that come to our data centers which is great.
Dave Rodgers: Great, thanks. Second question maybe around the Cross Connect side of the business, can you give a lot of details about fiber and total connect volume but I guess I was curious more on the market pricing that you are seeing out there with regard to Cross Connects? I know you’re continuing to inch up and mark-to-market in that business, but I’d like to know a little bit more about market pricing if you could comment on that? And then a second to that was, you talked about a large cloud customer impacting the Cross Connect volumes, was that a meaningful change, will that continue to be or is that something that we should see ebb in the next quarter maybe I didn't get that clearly.
Thomas Ray: First on pricing, Dave, I think we haven't seen material changes in the market and as such we have been as you've said inching and marking our portfolio closer and closer to market but I haven't seen the market change a lot. So that's - that one. And regarding the cloud, Cross Connect to the cloud, I think that was in the context of may be responding to Jonathan around, to what extent is the enterprise really adopting the cloud? So we’ve had - one of our early cloud partners, we have seen significant growth in Cross Connects for that partner from enterprise over the last year. That total volume is still not tremendously, it is still not material I think related to our total Cross Connect base. So if you think about the Cross Connect business I wouldn’t describe anything material to that, it’s a higher growth rate but often the smaller base.
Dave Rodgers: Okay, that’s helpful. Last question maybe for Jeff. Jeff, you talked about churn, it looks like the churn for the fourth quarter is 3.5% to 4% plus or minus. You mentioned the extra customer in Chicago. If that customer I guess were to leave in the fourth quarter would that take churn above that number or is that embedded in the number and it could come in lower if it slips to the first quarter?
Jeffrey Finnin: Yes, Dave. The guidance we’ve given for Q4 includes the possible churn of that particular customer. So again while we are not certain of the timing or of the amount, we wanted to make sure people were at least aware of it at this point in time, especially if we have visibility into it. So we’ve included that in our Q4 churn.
Dave Rodgers: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Jeffrey Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great, thanks. Two if I may. Just wanted to follow-up on the initial question regarding pipeline, so when you are looking for space, are you still seeing there's a lot of space available in the markets where you are going to need it that you’ll be comfortable taking on and be able to turn into a type of facility that you’ll be happy with I guess starting as far as just going to the land itself. And if you look at over the next 12 months, do you see any markets where you guys could be capacity constrained relative to demand that you're seeing today to the point where that could actually start to impact your top line growth at least for a brief period of time until you get that space brought on? And then my second line of questioning is, recently there has been some talk whether it came from Cisco or Intel around some weakness in data center demand and I very much appreciate the term data center is a very broad term and very much appreciate that there has been a debate for many years now about does cloud ultimately eat Colo. But I would love to get your take on what you see happening and is there any risk you see longer-term from some of your for example digital media customers shifting from a Colo-type model to perhaps more of a cloud model and how that might impact you? Thank you.
Thomas Ray: Sure. I guess related to the capacity and room to run inside the portfolio, first we focus on earnings and for the extent capacity is a component of that, it is certainly is a component but we are really focused on earnings growth and I would say over the last couple of years we have had spots where we have been very tight in some markets and more capacity in others. I don’t expect that to change. I think there may be some markets where we get reasonably thin but we really do look at our planning and we try to look pretty hard out five years, what is the growth of earnings of the company and in the near term, we believe there remains a good opportunity for the organization, a good market opportunity and a good physical platform and a good balance sheet inside the company to maintain healthy growth rates. That is our belief. We are certainly not trying to – we are very aware of not running out of space everywhere and not being able to grow. We are measured and we plan pretty carefully and there are soft spots from time to time in some markets and over the years we have been able to navigate that pretty well.
Colby Synesael: And weakness in demand overall, rumors out there.
Thomas Ray: Let our sales speak for themselves. I did see the note from Intel and the weakness in data center demand I guess they’ve been putting their gear into data centers as opposed to demand for their data centers. I know they have some type of third-party products, but I guess we can only see what we see. Steve, any comments on that?
Steven Smith: Yeah, I would just say that we haven’t seen that shelf in our pipeline as of yet, so we keep a close eye on it and we monitor and try to adjust to it but all those factors are important. But at this point we haven't seen them show up in our pipeline.
Colby Synesael: Thanks.
Thomas Ray: Thanks, Colby.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Heinz: Thank you. Good afternoon. If I could go back to the cloud exchange concept and just think about our cloud providers over provisioned today given what they anticipate in terms of future enterprise demand or would you think it is more of an add-on affect when the enterprise starts to meaningfully adopt the product or the solution, and how meaningful could that add-on affect be from the service providers standpoint?
Steven Smith: Sure. I’ll start off with give you my perspective. This is Steve. I think it varies pretty broadly across the various cloud providers out there. We’ve seen over the past several years cloud providers come and go, some that have over provisioned and not seen the demand and had their gear be antiquated and not competitive and we’ve seen others be much more measured and seen better adoption. So the big players out there are much better at it and they will come in and build out and then plan on scaling from there and that is part of our value proposition is being able to accommodate that scale. It has been a mix but I think many of the cloud providers have gotten much smarter over the past couple of years as to what they deploy and how they measure that growth and as adoption comes along with it. so it seem to be maturing and with that maturity we’ve seen more consistency.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then I'm not sure I’ve heard you guys talk much about escalators built into your contracts and I’m just kind of trying to get a sense of, as I look at that same-store MRR per cab growth of 4% to 5% and that’s been pretty consistent, how much of that is a base rent or cash rent escalator versus just overall growth in the cross connects?
Thomas Ray: Matt, is going to really be a combination of the two I think. When you look at the overall growth in the MRR per cab-e, historically we’ve talked a little bit about and we haven’t seen a meaningful change that typically about 75% of that growth from the MMR per cab-e comes from increases in power and cross connects. The other 25% is coming from the rent component. And so while there are escalations, cash escalations inside most of our contracts or I should say majority of our contracts that helps drive that to some extent but the lion’s share of that growth continues to come from both increases in power and cross connects.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, thanks. And can you quantify what the average escalator is written in?
Thomas Ray: I think overall I’d say ballpark-ish is 3% of a relatively on an annual basis a relatively good data point.
Matthew Heinz: Okay, thanks guys.
Thomas Ray: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Jon Petersen: Great. Thank you. I am curious about the [indiscernible] connection, a lot of people have asked question kind of about what it means in terms of demand and all that stuff. What I'm more curious about is how do you guys get these deals to start with? What is the negotiation process? Is it something that you have to pay for? I'm sure it is something that you and all your competitors want as well so how does it end up in a CoreSite facility and what are the contracts like? How long are you locked up in terms of having the only connection in the market or could that change tomorrow?
Thomas Ray: I guess first, bringing them in actually - Steve, do you want to talk about how the process?
Steven Smith: Go ahead.
Thomas Ray: In bringing them in, I don’t recall that we’ve ever paid a cloud provider to launch inside our platform and it really just comes from how do we get them but we have long-standing relationships with these companies. We have people who work together with their people for years. And I just think those discussions start fairly early in the product planning cycle and it is a – that’s the process, that is it. We have not signed anything, CoreSite has not signed anything that locks any cloud provider out of announcing or working with other parties in the marketplace so that dynamic does not apply to CoreSite.
Steven Smith: The other thing I would add is, we do have very good relationships with many of the largest cloud providers and we do work with them on a continual basis. As far as how we start and ultimately formalize those relationships, it is a mutual interest so they want to have access to our customers, we want to have access to their cloud and as I mentioned earlier that makes pretty easy conversation, how we get there varies from cloud provider to provider but we are all interested in the same thing.
Jon Petersen: Gotcha, okay. And then lot of people have talked about capacity and the runway in new markets and all of that stuff, I'm just kind of curious I know you have nothing new to announce in terms of plans for new markets but just internally how much time do you guys spend amongst yourselves or meetings with the board talking about potential markets you would want to be in whether it is domestic or international, how much of your strategic planning time do you spend thinking about that?
Thomas Ray: How we deploy capital and how we think about our investment returns is certainly a key topic for the Board and for the Executive Team as we think about the strategy. There are times when that strategy is pretty well set for the next year, year and a half and as such we don't talk about it quite as much. There are times when there is more to talk about but we maintain a good discipline around thinking about how to invest, we are a capital intensive business and our Board is very rigorous and disciplined about staying up to speed on our strategies and helping us think through those things. So I can’t quantify - it ebbs and flows with the needs of the company but it never goes away because we never stop thinking about it.
Jon Petersen: Gotcha, okay. That makes sense. And then just one other question for Jeff, it sounds like to fund development spending with the pipeline you have right now I think you had about 160 million-ish left and it sounds like there is going to be some new debt issued. Can you give us any indication of the timing around that, what kind of routes you would use on that and then I'm also just curious with your leverage levels as low as they are, you guys have a fairly diversified portfolio, you’re now a larger company than you were at the IPO, what kind of conversations you had with the ratings agencies about moving towards investment grade rating?
Thomas Ray: Yes, let me see if I can give you some color as best as I can Jon. I guess somewhat as I said in my prepared remarks as we look out over the next call at nine months through June 30 of next year is kind of where we're looking from a timing perspective between now and then and ultimately it’s going to depend on the things that really matter to us which is maintaining flexibility so that we can continue to trend towards that investment grade rating. And maintaining an unsecured instrument is obviously key from our perspective. As you’ve seen we like to maintain a balance between fixed versus variable price debt and then obviously maintain an appropriate debt maturity stack in whatever it is we do. In terms of conversations with rating agencies, we meet with the rating agencies at least once a year with each of them, the main ones to make sure that we stay in front of them. We learn from how they are looking at things, how they look at the industry and importantly so they also understand what CoreSite is doing, has done and ultimately probably more importantly where we are headed. And so we have those conversations in terms of actually timing around a rating. That will really depend on when it is needed or sometime before it is needed but nothing at this point in time is concrete.
Jon Petersen: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Thomas Ray: You bet. I just want to respond to the prior question or about the growth rates and escalators built into our contracts et cetera. I want to make sure we are clear. You could hear what we shared as – if you have 3% escalators on rent and you are getting four on your mark-to-market and how can you be getting any more than a point on power and interconnection, and I think that would be - if we’ve led towards that I think we’ve misled you guys. It has been an incorrect analysis. What is key inside the MMR per cab-e is we’ve been adding a lot of wholesale into the mix over the last couple of years, so the escalators are in the smaller agreements and the wholesale is typically at a lower MMR per cab-e than the rest of our business. So I think in general when you see wholesale, a flag of wholesale coming in because of a round of new development but you are still seeing reasonable strength in the MMR per cab-e. Generally speaking I think what you have is very solid strength in MMR per cab-e inside the transaction engine in the performance sensitive side of our business being diluted by wholesale. And so I just want to make sure we're super clear about the component of MMR per cab-e. It is a moving base with more wholesale having come in over the last couple of years and that has muted what you might have otherwise seen from the rest of the portfolio, escalators, cross connects, break or power et cetera. I just wanted to touch on that to make sure we are clear.
Thomas Ray: So with that, I think we’ll wrap it up and just want to say thank you to everybody for taking time with us on the call today and for following the company and working hard to understand what we're doing and where we're trying to go. We will keep working hard. We are very grateful for our people here at CoreSite to drive our success and for the customers to keep putting their faith in us. Thanks again, we will talk to you soon.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-07-24 11:00:00) =====
Derek S. McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; Steve Smith, our Senior Vice President, Sales and Sales Operations; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectation will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Good morning, and welcome to our Q2 call. Financial results for the quarter reflect continued steady growth, recording year-over-year increases in revenue of 24% and adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 19% each. Importantly, our financial results reflect an increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 49.3%, measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q2 2015. This represents an increase of 163 basis points over the comparable period ending with and including Q2 2014. Second quarter new and expansion leasing activity was exceptionally strong with record leasing totaling $19.6 million in annualized GAAP rents and 244,000 net rentable square feet. Our Q2 results reflect continued systematic growth in our core performance sensitive co-location activities with accelerating execution of smaller leases driving attainment of a milestone for our company. Specifically, at the end of Q2, our portfolio was comprised of over 1,500 leases of 5,000 net rentable square feet or less, representing over 90% of all leases in place in our company. We estimate that our leases in this size range correlate to an average size of less than 30 kilowatts per lease and we believe this size segment represents the most profitable segment in our company. Supported by our success around these smaller transactions, interconnection revenue in Q2 reflects more than 23% growth over Q2 of the prior year, adding to prior quarters of consistently strong growth in this revenue segment. Further, Q2 sales include strong performance in our network and cloud verticals, including a key win with execution of an agreement with a globally recognized provider of technology solutions regarding its recently launched public cloud service. Steve will discuss our cloud network and enterprise wins and provide a deeper dive around our sales activities more broadly later in the call. Even with our strong performance in our co-location activities, it is important to put Q2 new and expansion leasing results into context. In addition to the previously noted strength in smaller co-location leasing, a material component of new and expansion leasing in Q2 was driven by two wholesale leases we signed in Santa Clara. First in Q2, we announced the construction of SV7 along with execution of a pre-lease for 35,000 square feet in Phase 1 of that development. We view execution of this lease as consistent with our past practice of signing some degree of wholesale leasing to accelerate the cash flow generation in a larger new development. Second, in Q2, we signed the previously announced 136,500 square foot powered shell build-to-suit at SV6, representing our second build-to-suit project since becoming a public company almost five years ago. As with our prior build-to-suit, in executing this new lease, we served a strategic customer, earned an attractive return on incremental capital, and accelerated the monetization of a portion of one of our larger land position. All while ensuring we retain land and balance sheet capacity to support our performance sensitive co-location objectives. Looking forward, we expect our quarterly new and expansion leasing to moderate to a more historical pace. Our expectation is driven first by our objective to remain focused upon our performance sensitive co-location business plan, and second by the fact that we do not have any new larger developments currently planned to commence construction in the near-term. We believe our focus upon our performance sensitive co-location business plan will lead to an increase in the number of smaller new and expansion leases we signed, in turn driving an attractive product mix, comprised of an increase in breakthrough power revenue and higher cross-connect volume and associated revenue. With regard to supply and demand, we believe that the overall picture of our market is substantially consistent with how we saw them at the time of our call three months ago, steadily attractive in the performance sensitive end of the market, and slightly improving in the wholesale end. Specifically, and as we've discussed in the past, with regard to larger wholesale requirements, competition remains significant in general but accelerating demand in certain markets is pointing toward moderate increases in rents in select areas. In our core focus around the performance sensitive market segment, the location, network and cloud strengths of our facilities has supported and continues to support steady and favorable pricing dynamics. And looking at our big four markets more specifically, we're encouraged by the strength of demand in the Bay Area, as trailing 12-month absorption is approximately 3% to 4% ahead of the 2014 level and materially above that of 2013. In Northern Virginia, industry data suggests that net absorption in 2014 increased by roughly 50% over 2013. And that net absorption in the first half of 2015 has accelerated meaningfully over the average from last year. As such, although there is ample supply in the market, we believe accelerating demand has led to stabilizing rents in the wholesale sector. Finally, the Los Angeles market remains steady, while the New York, New Jersey market continues to be somewhat soft with regard to larger customer requirements. Reflecting our overall positive view of the industry dynamics, we have a number of development projects underway or scheduled to commence in Santa Clara, Northern Virginia, Los Angeles and Chicago. In Santa Clara, we expect to begin site construction on our 230,000 square foot SV7 building in the third quarter, with an estimated completion of Phase 1 in the second quarter of 2016. As noted a moment ago, we have preleased 35,000 square feet of our first phase of construction in this development. In Northern Virginia, we are building out an additional 48,000 square feet of data center space as part of Phase 3 of VA2, 50% of the new capacity in Phase 3 is pre-leased to our anchor customer at VA2 as that customer executed its expansion rights under its original lease. Beyond this pre-lease, we have a solid pipeline of activity, reflecting the value we've created at our Reston campus with more than 140 customers currently deployed, including over 50 network carriers and cloud providers. In Los Angeles, we've commenced the build out of 12,500 square feet of capacity at LA2 where our attractive cost basis associated with incremental expansions have supported what we see as attractive returns. Finally, in Chicago, we are under construction on 12,000 square feet of data center space where demand has been steady and supply remains limited in the downtown market. As it relates to future growth, we view our opportunity optimistically. We remain focused upon executing against our stated business plan as we continue to grow organically. As we have shared with you previously, we are focused on deepening our penetration in current markets where we can leverage our established ecosystems and gain efficiencies with added local scale. While we evaluate expansion opportunities beyond our current markets as well as other avenues of external growth, we do not feel compelled to alter our business plan and we believe strongly in our ability to execute upon the attractive growth opportunity we see before us. Our objective is to continue to make investments across our portfolio that lead to continued strong growth and increased returns on invested capital. We remain committed to systematically enhancing CoreSite's strength in providing differentiated value in supporting our customers' requirements for high-performance data center solutions supported by industry-leading customer service. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steven J. Smith: Thanks, Tom. I'd like to start by reviewing our sales activity during the quarter. As Tom mentioned, Q2 new and expansion sales totaled $19.6 million in annualized GAAP rent, a record for our company. Importantly, we made further progress on our goal to increase leasing volume to smaller customer requirements executing 110 new and expansion leases of less than 1,000 square feet in Q2, a 16% increase over Q1. We also saw continued strength in leasing among mid-sized opportunities across our platform, starting five new and expansion leases between 1,000 square feet and 5,000 square feet, compared to two mid-sized leases signed in the first quarter. The combined leasing in the small and mid-sized categories drove solid total transaction count during the quarter as we signed 122 new and expansion leases, a 22% increase over the prior quarter. Also driven by strength in our smaller and mid-sized leasing activity, we continue to broaden and diversify our customer base, adding 44 new logos during the quarter and 143 new logos over the trailing 12-month period, including Q2. We continue to see strength in our network and cloud verticals, together accounting for 45% of new and expansion leases executed in Q2 including seven key cloud deployments. Importantly, during Q2, we also executed an agreement with one the world's leading providers of cloud services to the enterprise. We are excited about the opportunity to roll out those deployments across our portfolio going forward. Further, we added more global cloud providers to our CoreSite open cloud exchange, increasing density on that exchange fabric and further fueling momentum around enterprises, clouds and networks coming to our company to solve performances requirements. Driven by these successes, Q2 fiber cross-connect volume increased 17% year-over-year and total connections grew by 12%, both growth rates in line with recent trends. Considering our drive to increase penetration in enterprise vertical including digital content, we saw significant strength building off our strong success in Q1, specifically in Q2 leasing and the enterprise vertical accounted for 55% of known expansion leases executed and 59% of annualized GAAP rents signed in the quarter, well distributed across our national footprint and among a healthy mix of industries. Concerning lease rental rates, Q2 new and expansion leasing reflects an average annualized GAAP rental rate of $81 per square foot. This GAAP rate reflects the 136,500 square foot powered shell build-to-suit with a strategic cloud customer at SV6 in Santa Clara. While an excellent win with favorable returns, this also negatively impacts the total average rate per square foot when compared to our core retail co-location product. Excluding the build-to-suit at SV6, our Q2 pricing was in line with our trailing 12-month average rental rate. In addition to new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q2 was similarly strong, as renewals total approximately 35,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $185 per square foot, reflecting a mark-to-market growth of 5.7% on a cash basis and 9.1% on a GAAP basis. Churn was 1.6 % in the second quarter, better than our expectations as one of our expected moveouts renewed a portion of this deployment in the second quarter as well as the timing of expected moveouts being pushed to subsequent quarters. Approximately 50 basis points or one-third of our Q2 churn is related to SV3, where over last year we have been proactively re-tenanting the building prior to the anticipated move out of the full building customer that originally leased the asset. In Q2 of this year, we completed retenanting the remaining 25% of the building. We continue to retain some economic benefit of the prior customers lease and that benefit will turn out of our portfolio over time. Jeff will provide more detail around this later on the call. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in Q2 were the Bay Area, Northern Virginia DC, Chicago and Los Angeles. Leasing in the Bay Area were driven by demand at our Santa Clara campus and includes 35,000 square foot lease with an anchored customer at our new SV7 development. The Northern Virginia DC, our anchor tenant VA2 expanded and we continue to see solid leasing at VA1 where occupancy is now at 91.8%. In Chicago, Q2 leasing activity includes a new logo signed with a large global financial services enterprise. Leasing in Los Angeles continues to be well distributed between the two buildings comprising our One Wilshire campus. We note that we recorded minimal Q2 leasing in our New York market. This was driven by what we believe as normal lumpiness among large leases. Specifically, our leasing in the market among smaller deployments were steady to prior quarters with 12 new leases signed in Q2, including five new logos with all leases smaller than 1,000 square feet. However, in Q2, we signed no leases exceeding 1,000 square feet, whereas in the trailing 12-month period, we signed six leases exceeding 1,000 square feet each for a total of 43,000 square feet. We don't describe a meaningful change to the market dynamics or our position in the market and bolstered by our current pipeline activity, we believe prospective leasing volume will be more in line with the past trailing 12-month period than Q2. In summary, we are making progress on our goal to increase the effectiveness of our transaction engine while providing our customers with the best-in-class customer experience supported by our high performance data center solutions. We believe our Q2 sales demonstrate the value inherent in our platform as we continue to focus on enhancing the robust customer communities and our high performance network-dense cloud enabled data centers. We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth across our platform, enhancing our customer communities and diversifying our customer base. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q2 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development CapEx and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity and, third, I will discuss our revised outlook and guidance for the remainder of the year. Turning to our financial performance in the second quarter, data center revenues were $79.5 million, a 9.5% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 24.7% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Q2 data center revenue consisted of $66.6 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 9.2% on a sequential quarter basis and 24.5% year-over-year, $10.6 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 3.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 23.3% year-over-year, and $2.3 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million. Our second quarter FFO was $0.68 per diluted share and unit, an increase of 6.3% on a sequential quarter basis and a 33.3% increase year-over-year, excluding non-recurring items in Q2 2014. As Tom mentioned, FFO per diluted share and unit increased 19.3% year-over-year as reported in unadjusted. Adjusted EBITDA of $40.6 million increased 6.9% on a sequential quarter basis and 33.2% over the same quarter of last year, excluding non-recurring items. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 49.8% increased 340 basis points year-over-year and declined 100 basis points sequentially. If you recall, our adjusted EBITDA has historically shown a seasonal decline on a sequential basis in both the second and third quarters, generally related to seasonal increases in the cost of power. Related, our Q2 results represent revenue growth flow through to annualized adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 64% and 51% respectively, which is a significant improvement on a year-over-year basis. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter totaled $4.3 million or approximately 5.2% of total operating revenues, up 10 basis points compared to last quarter and in line with our guidance of approximately 5% to 5.5% of total operating revenues for the full year. General and administrative expenses were $7.9 million in Q2 correlating to 9.8% of total operating revenues. We expect G&A for 2015 to correlate to approximately 9.5% to 10% of total operating revenue. Regarding our same-store metrics, Q2 same-store turnkey data center occupancy increased 850 basis points to 84.9% from 76.4% in the second quarter of 2014. Additionally, same-store MRR per cabinet equivalent increased 4.1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. As Steve discussed, we have now fully backfilled customer leasing at SV3. As we have communicated previously, we executed a restructured lease agreement with the original customer in order to meet current demand and backfill the space at SV3. Under the amended agreement, the original customer is making payments discounted from its original lease amount that maybe applied to new leases with us on a dollar-for-dollar basis until the staggered terms of the new agreement expire. Revenue associated with the restructured lease agreement is included in our financial results and the annualized rent reflected on the operating table shown on page 14 of the second quarter earnings supplemental. This revenue stream is scheduled to decline in increments and expire over the next two years, reflecting associated churn related to each expiring increment. We currently forecast that these expirations will be approximately $2.6 million in Q4 of 2015, $1.9 million in Q2 of 2016, and $4.2 million in Q2 of 2017. In turn, correlating to churn of approximately 150 basis points, 100 basis points, and 190 basis points respectively, absent any such amounts applied to new leases. Lastly, we commenced a 123,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $123 per square foot, which represents $15.1 million of annualized GAAP rent. Turning now to backlog. Our projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $18.5 million as of June 30, 2015 or $29.8 million on a cash basis. We expect approximately 37% or $6.8 million of the GAAP backlog to commence in the second half of 2015. Another 30% is expected to commence in the first half of 2016 and 15% of the GAAP backlog expected to commence in the second half of 2016. Within the total backlog amount is rents associated with the build-to-suit at SV6 as well as the SV7 pre-lease each forecasted to commence upon completion of construction in the first half of 2016. In the second quarter, we increased stabilized data center occupancy by approximately 160 basis points sequentially to 89.9%. Stabilized data center occupancy now reflects the addition of 44,000 square feet at VA2, which commenced on April 1, and is 100% leased and occupied by a single acre tenant. I would remind everyone that the recently developed data center projects that are in the initial lease up phase are classified as pre-stabilized until you reach 85% occupancy or have been in service for 24 months. To that point, in the second quarter 15,000 square feet at SV4 and 20,000 square feet at CH1 in Chicago moved from this pre-stabilized pool into our stabilized pool as they have now been in service for two years. Additionally, 16,000 square feet at NY2 associated with Phase 2 has been placed into our stabilized data center pool as it was 100% leased and occupied by a single customer as of June 30, 2015. Turning to development activity and expansion CapEx. During the second quarter, we placed into service Phase 2 at both NY2 and VA2 with 33,000 square feet and 48,000 square feet, now reflected in our pre-stabilized pool respectively. During the second quarter, we began construction of VA2 Phase 3 with 48,000 square feet under development, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the second quarter, we also began construction on the powered shell build-to-suit at SV6. As we announced in early June, we expect to begin construction on SV7 in the third quarter with the first phase expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2016. Based on all of the development projects currently under construction and the expected construction of Phase 1 of SV7, we expect to spend approximately $140 million in incremental expansion CapEx, most of which will be spent through the first half of 2016. In a few moments, I will update you on our estimated capital expenditures for 2015. As a reminder, when we complete development projects we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes, and insurance, resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. For 2015, we estimate the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 30% to 35%, depending on the volume and pace of development during the year, including the expected commencement of construction on SV7 in the back half of the year. As shown on page 22 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized year-to-date is 43%. Turning to our balance sheet, as of June 30, 2015, our net debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.1 times, and if you include our preferred stock, it is 2.8 times. Based on the current and expected development projects disclosed on page 20 of the supplemental, we would expect our leverage to increase by year-end to approximately 3.1 times, comfortably within our stated target ratio of approximately 4 times. During the second quarter, we executed and amended and expanded $500 million senior unsecured credit facility, extending and staggering our debt maturity profile, lowering our overall borrowing cost and continuing to balance our mix between fixed and variable rate debt, including our preferred stock. The amended unsecured credit facility is comprised of a four-year $350 million revolving credit facility and a five-year $150 million term loan. Subsequent to the transaction, we used the term loan proceeds to pay down a portion of the existing revolving credit facility balance. The execution of the amended and expanded credit facility supports our goals of maintaining the liquidity and available capital necessary to execute our business plans and support growth. To that point, as of June 30, 2015, we had $102.3 million drawn on our revolver and approximately $241 million of available capacity. Finally, with regard to our outlook, we are increasing our 2015 FFO guidance to a range of $2.75 to $2.83 per share in OP unit, from the previous range of $2.55 to $2.65, an increase of 7.3% based on the midpoint of both ranges. The increased guidance reflects our performance in the first half of the year, increased visibility into financial and operating performance in the second half of 2015, and improved revenue growth flow through to both adjusted EBITDA and FFO as we continue to gain efficiencies as we scale the business. More specifically, we now expect total operating revenue to be $325 million to $330 million compared to the previous range of $313 million to $323 million. Data center revenue is now expected to be $317 million to $322 million, up from the previous range of $305 million to $315 million, driven primarily by our sales execution in the first half of 2015 and our expectations for solid growth in rental revenue, continued positive mark-to-market rent growth and increases in our interconnection revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $162 million to $167 million, up from our previous guidance of $153 million to $158 million, implying a full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.2% based on the midpoint of guidance. As I mentioned, we estimate improved revenue growth flow through to adjusted EBITDA as our guidance for general and administrative expenses remains unchanged. We now expect cash rent growth on renewals to be in the range of 3% to 5% for the full year, taking into account the cash rent growth in the first half of the year of 5.5%. Our guidance for annual churn is unchanged at 6% to 8% for the full year. We are increasing our guidance for 2015, total capital expenditures by $20 million to a range of $135 million to $165 million, primarily to reflect the development of the recently announced construction of SV7 in Santa Clara. A more detailed summary of 2015 guidance items can be found on page 24 of the second quarter earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics and our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio, resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we've discussed today. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you, and good morning out there. The first question is just on the continued accelerated monetization, I believe you referred to of sort of land bank and really of capacity, and just maybe you could speak to the plans to backfill and if any of that is factored at this point into your 2015 guidance?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure, Jordan. I think, the location where we've monetized land in the powered shell build-to-suit is both of those leases were in Santa Clara, on our Santa Clara campus, where we had a significant amount of land. We thought long and hard about the most recent build-to-suit, it was a very attractive return on incremental capital and a good use of the land asset sitting there. We probably – what helped us make that decision to feel good about that deal was the size of SV7, which is more than double the size of SV5. So in kicking off our last building, we have a lot of runway there, the biggest building by far we've put on that site. So that gives us, we think, plenty of time to look in the market and look for the right next path of growth, but I think we have several years to figure that out. Santa Clara is – the Bay Area has been a very powerful market for us, so we appreciate that as we think about our long-term planning. So there you go, the bottom-line is, we still have a lot of room to run with SV7 and there you have it.
Jordan Sadler: But your guidance, you're not anticipating taking down any additional land or buildings per se in your guidance for 2015?
Thomas M. Ray: That's right, not in the guidance.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then, interconnection, not to – I might not have caught the exact details there, but I just heard a plus 17% year-over-year number on cross connects, and I was curious obviously one quarter. There can be some volatility but relative to your previous growth, I think it's a little bit slower. I'm just curious about the thoughts on cross-connect and interconnection revenue growth going forward? And then, maybe if you can provide some context in terms of what you see your view as the outlook, if any, in terms of a shift at all as a result of the change in the capitalization or ownership of one-year larger competitors in that space?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure. Well, as to the cross connect, the growth rate of cross-connect revenue, we've said on the – at least one past call and we just reiterate over time that that growth rate should begin to align with the growth rate of volume plus whatever annual mark-to-market there is in the market. But we've been – and we really think it will align with the growth rate of the volume of fiber cross connects. So our copper cross connects have been a declining business for some time as it is in all parts of the communications landscape. Our fiber cross-connect volume has been growing organically pretty nicely at 17%. So if you think of over a couple years and it's really hard to predict the pacing, but if you think that at some point your growth rate in revenue is got to align with the growth rate in volume. And then if you add 2%, 3% a year, for inflation mark-to-market, that kind of thing, that's how we view it. So we'd just encourage people to align their models accordingly. So I guess what we're saying is we expect the growth rate to moderate to some extent, further over the next couple of years, but really you would expect – I would expect the growth rate of interconnection revenue to exceed that of rents on a same store basis. So hopefully that helps model. As to consolidation, look, I think with the Telx selling into DLRs footprint, there should be at some point over time, a little bit greater competition. At the same time, Telx has been in business a very long time. We've been here for a while, Equinix has been here for a while, and we've posted very consistent, very solid cross-connect growth. And we frankly expect that to continue. So it's a big market. The United States is a big place, and we expect to continue to be successful.
Jordan Sadler: All right. Thank you. Last cleanup item here, just do you disclose your total number of cross-connects?
Thomas M. Ray: We have in the past.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yeah. I think traditionally, Jordon, we've typically said that we're in excess of 15,000. We haven't given a more precise number other than that at this point.
Thomas M. Ray: It is something we're looking at in terms of trying to update just so you guys have better visibility. It's been that way for few years, but we haven't given anything beyond that.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Atkins with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Yeah. I wanted to just see if you can discuss a little bit about the opportunities, threats from the Digital Realty, Telx combination, not just with respect to cross-connects, but in the retail business, in the wholesale segment and so forth, how do you kind of view that? And then I was interested in just the new logo that you signed and which of the top four did you sign the greatest number of new logos? Was it Bay Area or LA or where were you seeing kind of the most success?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure. I think as to Telx and Digital, again our view – my sense is that over time, it will increase competition in the Colo segment. Just with a talented co-location sales platform and operating platform, now working on a larger base of assets. So I would expect that to result in some greater competition. There is certainly the theory that consolidation over a longer period may lead to more disciplined pricing. So you can put whatever stock into that theory you like. I just think that – I think there will be some period as they're integrating the Telx acquisition and rolling that operational capability out onto more assets. But they'll probably be reasonably aggressive in pricing.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: And Jonathan, in terms of the new logos, I think you've probably heard in Steve's remarks, we signed 44 new logos in the quarter. I apologize, I don't have the vertical which produced the most. We'll try and get that by the end of the call, if not we'll follow back up with you?
Thomas M. Ray: The geographic breakout, yeah.
Jonathan Atkin: But by metro. Okay. And then SV7, I'm just interested all-in, not just the initial phase for this one-acre customer, but just when all is said and done, how can we think about that project in terms of cost per megawatt? Is it going to be similar to what you've put up on some of your slides in the supplemental? Or is there any reason why it would be higher or lower? And then related to that, I'm just interested in demand that you may be seeing from your customers in any of your markets for an N (0:39:05) type products and any shifts in your design or product to accommodate that?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think you hit the big question about the ultimate cost basis in SV7. We – four comparable products, which we expect to comprise the bulk of SV7, that is a Tier 3, N+1, 2N (0:39:27) type product. We expect that to be most of SV7, and we expect the cost there to be very similar to that of SV4 and other new developments, nothing unusual. We do anticipate productizing, if you will, different levels of resiliency as other folks have done, and as there seems to be a market for. So with that, we might spend less capital on some portion of SV7 and as such the weighted average costs, the total – the cost per meg in that might decline a little bit from some other buildings. But that story has yet to be told. And like everybody else, we build modularly. We build to meet the demand in the marketplace. And I do think there is a segment of demand that is looking for better pricing with lower resiliency. And we're focused on ensuring we meet that market segment.
Jonathan Atkin: And then finally, I was just interested in, to what extent your customers have been asking about your entering new metros where you currently don't operate? I know you've been fairly disciplined from a financial standpoint. There is a lot of interesting things happening, not just in your – in some of your top markets, but in other markets where you are currently absent, and is there a customer push in that direction that you're seeing?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, look, we've been asked to go to new markets since before we were public, right. I mean almost every large customer who has multimarket needs wants to know if we can meet them in additional markets, and that's domestic and abroad. But you nailed it, Jon. We've just tried to be disciplined about the use of our balance sheet. And we're just allocating capital by rank ordering projects based on risk and return. And we've been consistent in saying, we believe our lower risk, higher return opportunities in the immediately visible future are adding product into markets where we already have a team and interconnection density and some scale. And so that's just how we've been allocating capital. We don't have a positive or negative previous position toward markets. We just rank order the deployment of capital on a risk adjusted basis.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: And Jonathan just as – Jonathan just as a follow-up to your previous question in terms of the breakout by geo for the new verticals, the top two markets were LA, followed closely by the Bay Area in terms of the distribution of the 44 new logos.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Hi, guys. Can you hear me?
Thomas M. Ray: Yeah.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yeah, Jonathan.
Jonathan Schildkraut: All right. Thank you for taking the questions. Couple if I may, so Tom, you offered some, I thought, pretty positive commentary about the overall state of demand in the marketplace. And I was wondering if there was anything sort of driving in your view the overall demand that is, has anything changed, has something come into place that has allowed an acceleration in demand or is it just short of seeing more maturation of some of the trends that we've seen recently? And I'll follow-up with the second question. Thanks.
Thomas M. Ray: Sharing my view and then I'll ask Steve to weigh in as well. I think it's some of both. I think that in the major markets where you've seen the largest acceleration of demand, I think a big component of that has been driven by the big clouds. They've been in this cycle recently, have much greater absorption, much bigger blocks of space than historically. In addition to that, that general steady drumbeat of the, kind of that, steady co-location business, the performance end of the business has also seen an acceleration of demand, I think, more moderate than these big blocks you're seeing, taken down by the cloud guys. So, I think it's a little bit of both. Steve, what are your thoughts?
Steven J. Smith: Yeah, I would agree, Tom. I think the maturation of the cloud industry, and the adoption in that space has driven obviously more absorption in our space, which has been positive. But, I think, that has also led to more adoption in just the enterprise. And as more enterprises go through their natural cycle of refreshing their hardware and their infrastructure that leads to more and more adoption of outsourcing and to co-location. So, I think we're starting to see more and more of that. So, I think it is primarily just more maturation in the market.
Jonathan Schildkraut: All right. Great. And then question for Jeff here. Jeff you know, you took us through some really good detail and through the financials. And I guess, I just had some questions around sort of the double dipping that's going on out on the West Coast. When you guys started the year, was it your expectation and was it in your initial guidance that you would be able to, sort of, both benefit from the exit of the customer out of the facility SV3, but also sort of backfill. So, just want to get a sense as to whether this is a change in expectation versus sort of where you were from a prior basis. And then, as a second question, in terms of the churn that you've pulled out for us, so for example $2.6 million in the fourth quarter, is that going to churn on sort of day one of the quarter, and that's the full quarter run rate or how should we think about that in terms of the quarter after the impact to that is?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yeah. Let me hit your second question first, Jonathan, see if that helps. In terms of that $2.6 million in Q4, that will churn out at the end of that quarter. I think that term actually expires December 31. And so factor that in, as you look at your models as you go into 2016, but that will come in right at the end of the quarter. In terms of where we were heading into the year for our overall guidance, as it relates to that Bay Area property, I would say that we anticipated some of that in our guidance. And I would say maybe about solving for maybe about 50% of that. And the other 50% obviously, as Steve alluded to in this call and we alluded to in the previous call, we have solved for in the first half of this year and obviously that's helping to drive some of that incremental revenue growth.
Thomas M. Ray: And to be clear, Jonathan, we entered into an agreement with a structure with this customer a year ago.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Yeah.
Thomas M. Ray: And that's when we did the first backfill lease at SV3 and we created a structure whereby we've encouraged the customer to redeploy in smaller and the target is more performance dependent deployments across our portfolio and to use some of this rent bank to support them doing that but also whereby we would get a little higher rate, a rack rate on the deployments and more term. So we've created a structure where you're trying to reconstruct a wholesale deal into a series of on-ramps and other things and to create an incentive to support the customer in doing that. So that tale has yet to be written, right. They – that some of this – the churn that we've talked about, the forecasted churn that's in the supp is really kind of a worst case scenario or we'd assume that the customer doesn't utilize any of their remaining available rent bank elsewhere in the portfolio. And we're working with them actively to encourage them to do that and that the extent to which that's successful for both parties may soften a component of that churn. I bring that up both to explain what's going on and to say, as we entered the beginning of the year as Jeff said, we'd already taken back half the building under the structure. We had a good structure in place to move forward with the customer, and we've been fortunate that that's worked out a little bit sooner than we anticipated for the rest of the building.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great. And those were annualized numbers, right? The churn, not quarterly?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: That's correct, those are annualized amounts. The only other thing, Jonathan, I'd add to your churn as you guys think about churn in total, we've obviously given guidance and that is unchanged at that 6% to 8% level for the full year. When you look at where we are in the first half, we're at 3.8%, the customer you're referring to in that $2.6 million at the end of the year, that adds an incremental 150 basis points to our churn. So, that combined with where we are year-to-date, you're at 5.3% you're all-in. If you think about our midpoint of typical guidance 1% to 2% per quarter, that's going to put you just up above the 8% churn for the year, I just want to – have guys think about that, it wouldn't surprise me that we end up at the higher end of our churn guidance for the year.
Jonathan Schildkraut: That makes sense. And if I can squeeze one more in here, the mark-to-marks, obviously great to see that you're able to take up the guide here. Is this a reflection of the pricing sort of things that you – the pricing dynamics that, Tom, you were talking about early in the call?
Thomas M. Ray: Yeah, I mean, I – look, I think, some markets pricing has firmed up and I think Steve and the team have just done a really good job of reinvigorating sales over the last couple of years and we've seen – as Steve's made it clear in his comments, you've seen acceleration in transactions. And as we've always talked about, think of our business as this core co-location business and there are times we elect to do wholesale on top and with the build-to-suit opportunity and then a new building SV7, we've layered that on top. So I think just execution from Steve, anything you want to add to the markets or the dynamics.
Steven J. Smith: No, I think the market is also helping, right, as you look at supply and demand out there and the stickiness of our customer base. We obviously want to be fair with our customers, but also be fair to the market and so I think we've done a healthy job in striking that balance.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thanks so much for taking the questions.
Thomas M. Ray: Thanks, Jonathan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Emmanuel Korchman: Hey guys, just wondering as both clients – tenants look for more flexibility and as you try to increase our interconnect opportunity. Are there any physical or design attributes that are changing in your new developments. You mentioned that SV7 will be much bigger than SV5. Is there anything else from just a building perceptive that we should watch for?
Thomas M. Ray: Not really, certainly nothing related to interconnection. That SV7 will leverage off of the interconnection already at the campus. It will be connected to the other buildings and have the advantage of all that carrier mass (0:50:40) day one. And so hopefully we'll just keep building off of that. But in terms of the physical construction of the building, no changes related to interconnection.
Emmanuel Korchman: And then Tom, you mentioned before, customers have asked you to go to new markets. When you think about that opportunity, do you look at it on an asset basis, buying existing assets, developing into markets or perhaps buying portfolios?
Thomas M. Ray: We sincerely look at all the above, right. I mean we just – we work extremely hard to just make good decisions for our shareholders, and that mandates that you pay attention to every opportunity in the target markets. Again, we focused on the top 12 markets in the U.S. There are a handful that we're not yet in. We've talked about those for five years now, and that's where we spend our time, so that's the line of our strategy. But we are open minded as to whether it's ground-up development or a redevelopment or an acquisition.
Emmanuel Korchman: Maybe if you can just give us a quick update on what you're seeing on the acquisition front in terms of valuations and types of properties coming to market?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I don't know. I think the deals recently announced and certainly the Telx valuation, I think is probably the biggest indicator for large portfolios with interconnection density. I think it's probably prudent to make adjustments for owned versus leased and implicit debt and things of that nature, but that was – I don't know, I've heard the 15.5% or so multiples, so there is probably the biggest most recent comp. I think for smaller deals, there is a pretty big range depending on the attractiveness of the asset and can you scale. I mean, I think you see things trading close to 6% if they are really, really good, and we see things go up pretty significantly from there.
Emmanuel Korchman: Great. Thank you very much.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Manny.
Operator: Our next question is from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Dave B. Rodgers: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Tom, I wanted to just dive in a little bit more on the New York, New Jersey markets. I think you characterized it as soft in your comments and Steve's comments obviously did give more color on the amount of leasing you're seeing, but I think you talked about a backlog pretty good about. So maybe just dive a little bit more on what you really are seeing in that market and how it's impacting you?
Thomas M. Ray: I think it's a continuation of what we've seen since we open the building, right. We've got out of the gate with very nice network traction, exceeded our expectations. We've had pretty consistent growth in smaller transaction co-location sales and this last quarter was no different. I think we signed 12 smaller deals and that drumbeat has been, I think over the last year accelerating. I mean this was the quarter where we didn't sign larger deals. We're not seeing a collection three to four multi-megawatt deals, but there is a pretty good funnel out there of kind of that 1 meg and down, 1.25 meg and down. So as you think about the opportunity to do the larger deals, I think it's still in the market and it's just difficult to predict when wholesale deal is signed. So we don't predict it. Anything to add?
Steven J. Smith: No. I think that's accurate, Tom and the larger leases are much more lumpy as you mentioned. And I think as we look at those leases, we just need to be diligent about what makes sense for the asset that we're trying to sell, the value that we provide in that asset, provide value back to that customer, do they recognize that value and there's a lot of competition in that market, but at the same time, we do get traction from the sales team and overall, we're optimistic as of the future of where it's headed.
Thomas M. Ray: I'm encouraged in that the – we've had what we've got over the gate more strongly than we'd even hoped with regard to networks, but I think we're having more success with major clouds, in that location as opposed to Manhattan. So what is landing in the building is in line with the strategy and the thesis. And we continue to be believers in where that assets and that market is headed, just fewer big deals dropped in Q2.
Dave B. Rodgers: And these smaller deals that you do and the pricing on those, I mean are they improving from the day you open the building, are they pretty stable, any color on that?
Steven J. Smith: Yeah, I think the pricing is generally improving, but it's pretty stable, it's a competitive market, but we're seeing the volume pick up and we're seeing pricing firm up somewhat.
Dave B. Rodgers: Okay.
Thomas M. Ray: Dave, I think from when we opened the building as we've done our first deal or two – larger deal or two, we were at very aggressive low rates and we kind of turned that off now. We're at market and as Steve said, I think it's fairly steady.
Dave B. Rodgers: Okay. Thanks. And, Tom, maybe shifting, one of your comments was stabilizing wholesale rents and I assume that part of that is just more control in competitive supply that's out there. But maybe talk a little bit about what you expect to see, are you seeing more permitting coming out, do you expect to see any kind of ramp in new construction, similar, I guess, we've seen in past years or is that landscape pretty stable as well?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think you see more stuff on – there's still a fair amount of ability to deliver inventory in Virginia. So I'd say shadow inventory of shelves that are ready to go or people that are in for permit. So, look I think Virginia can add supply more meaningfully, probably faster than any other market. I mean at the same time it still takes a year after you start swinging a hammer and that would suggest that the next year pricing there will probably firm up a little bit further, if demand continues the way it did in the first half of this year, which was exceedingly robust. So in the big picture, though, Dave, irrespective of permits and completed shelves over the next 12 months, I think anytime rents are firming up considerably, you'll see capital pour in, you'll see buildings get built and I think, wholesale rates will forever be somewhat cyclical.
Dave B. Rodgers: Okay, thanks. And then maybe finally for Jeff, I assume the answer, but I'll ask anyway, is in the expiration schedule, there's nothing in the expiration schedule for SV3 and the tenant that rolled out of there, right, this churn has kind of not embedded in that expiration schedule or is it?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: No, the expiration schedule in terms of what we've put inside the supplemental, it is included in the respective periods in which that rent will churn out.
Dave B. Rodgers: It is. Okay, great.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes.
Dave B. Rodgers: Thank you.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is from Colby Synesael, with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Colby A. Synesael: Great, thanks, two if I may. First one, I guess, just has to talk about cloud broadly speaking. As we've kind of started to see more of a shift from more public cloud type deployments in your facilities perhaps more to more enterprise oriented cloud deployments, maybe Oracle I guess being a good example, a company like that. Are you starting to see now a bigger pull through of enterprise type customers that are also now kind of coming to you whereas perhaps a year ago this just wasn't the type of customer that you were dealing with? And then the second question is, I know going into 2015, there was a pretty big focus on going after those smaller customers and also just more generally improving the efficiency return or contribution margin, I guess, in the – from an OpEx perspective. Is that largely done? And now, effectively the improvements we see on a go forward basis are going to be more one of scale or is there still some inefficiencies, if you will, that are inside the business that could lead to additional improvements beyond just kind of scaling up? Thanks.
Steven J. Smith: Yeah, sure, and I'll take your – this is Steve, I'll take your first question, and then I'll have Tom answer your second. Relative to cloud and enterprises coming to us for more enterprise cloud type solutions, we are seeing more interest in that. I think the adoption of that is still being vetted out by a lot of enterprises. But I think the benefit to companies such as CoreSite is that we do see a lot of interest that's coming to us and exploring that and very interested in our open cloud exchange and how that provide on-ramps to those type of cloud environments. So the adoption of that I think is still being vetted, but I think the demand that it's driving is very positive for us.
Thomas M. Ray: And regarding efficiencies, I remain maniacally confident that we can continue to do better. And you know we haven't talked a lot about something we started about three years ago Encore, which was really an ERP and an IT and software reinvention of the company, if you will. We did a bad job the first two years. We wrote off some money related to that bad job. And we're transparent about that with the street. We haven't said much about Encore, because we decided to shut up and just do our work. We're very, very pleased that in Q2, we launched quite successfully the first very powerful phase of that effort. And our team there led by our VP of Corporate Operations, Jeff Dorr has done a phenomenal job. So we've made progress there. And I think we'll see more efficiencies flow out of just that launch over the next nine months. And then we've moved on to Phase II of that efforts of the Encore effort. Jeff and team are driving that forward. So I think across the company, via technology and via just again relentlessly simplifying our business and making simpler and simpler decisions, I'm convinced that we can continue to improve our efficiency.
Colby A. Synesael: Yeah, I guess the other question to that, Tom, would be that as you start to see more of these enterprise type customers coming into your own facilities, I would think to some degree that there is some technological actual sophistication in products that might need to be made available to them to kind of hand hold and make it easier for them to adopt the type of services that you're selling. Is that something that you're seeing? Is that a focus for you? We've seeing obviously DLR as an example going higher, new CIO that's obviously been a focus for someone like for Equinix for some time, kind of where do you guys fit on that strategy or that thinking?
Thomas M. Ray: We're I think on the same page, DCIM or Data Center Infrastructure Management is, I think, a key component of any data center offering in the marketplace today. And I think this is going to get more and more important, so that's a key part of our Encore roadmap enabling the enterprise customer and all customers with a greater degree of visibility and self help and self provisioning and clarity supporting that relationship with us and with their capacity inside our data center. So that's a key part of our roadmap. And then I think also in the communications or the interconnection product set, the logical connections are open cloud exchange, you see the larger clouds wanting to align APIs and so that takes development cycles to line up with those guys and I think the folks who are out in front of that and have some scale and can make those investments tend to benefit from getting more and more of those cloud ramps and those relationships that support the hybrid cloud and the ability of the enterprise to meet different needs inside a data center. So, yeah, I mean we – in terms of our product developments around technology, both in the interconnection space and in the data center infrastructure management space, both those areas are key parts of our roadmap. We'd like to think we've been pretty good at them in the past frankly. But we're really working hard to continue to accelerate.
Colby A. Synesael: Great. Thank you so much.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Colby.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew S. Heinz: Hi. Good afternoon, thanks. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the commentary from Intel this quarter, who seemed to suggest that the weakness in enterprise server demand and simultaneous strength from hyper scale might reflect an acceleration in enterprise cloud migration as opposed to just an outright sort of decline in demand net-net, which seems to jive, I guess, with what you're saying around your business and major clouds. But the question is how do you see this playing out in the broader co-location space, and maybe if over time you expect more enterprises to come to you indirectly via service providers?
Steven J. Smith: Yeah, I'll just start and then I'm sure Tom could add some color. In general, I do see more adoption of, really about the hybrid environment, where we see a lot of customers come into our data center, deploying their own enterprise solutions within our data center, and then wanting to connect to either public cloud or private cloud. So, I see that continuing. As I look at just my history and dealing with enterprises across various industries, I see very few that would go to a complete cloud environment. There's always something unique about their systems and back office that they need to have that hybrid environment. So, I think that will continue for some time, but I do see more and more adoption towards those cloud environments, and I think that will continue.
Thomas M. Ray: Well I think just – I think we're all speaking toward the disaggregation of the enterprise IT architecture. And I think that's going to – Steve and I both believe strongly, our whole management team believes, that's going to continue. But that disaggregation – that old enterprise IT architecture reconstitutes into very, a lot of different things. You've got infrastructure service, you've got platform and service, you have SaaS. And within SaaS, you've got a lot of different solutions for different enterprise needs and then you have the enterprises' own, a dedicated private cloud for the enterprise, so with the public cloud capability on top of it. So I think we're going to see more and more of that. It's been happening, I think, it will continue to happen. So the big question in our view has always been around the cloud, is it good or bad for co-location? And we've been consistent in our thesis to the street that if the cloud ends up being dominated by two players or three players, who control 60% or 70% of the marketplace, that's going to be bad for the multi-tenant data center. You'll have a shift in those quarter's five factors that customer dominance will shift, and that won't be good. We just don't see that happening. And again, we use the analog to the communications landscape after the Bell's reconsolidated, and you have more communications providers, more applications, more devices, more networks than ever before. And we think cloud is another component of that wave. And if that thesis is sound, more applications, more networks, more devices, then we expect the dynamics throughout our business to remain very robust.
Matthew S. Heinz: That's helpful. Thanks. And then just a follow up if I may. Been hearing a lot of kind of a pickup in demand from cloud providers for build-to-suit projects with security compliance being a major factor, and particularly in areas where they can find cheap power and decent connectivity. You've done a number of these types of deals for strategics in the past, and it seems like your return experience has been improved a little. I'm just wondering, if you're seeing more of these opportunities pop up in your radar, and maybe if the returns are strong enough for you to consider doing more custom deals, that might be outside of your core footprint?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we've done two build-to-suits both in Santa Clara and both on land that we already owned. And as an old ProLogis guy from I think, a 137 years ago, I think, where you make premium returns in the build-to-suit business is off of your land. The incremental capital that goes into solving a build-to-suit with a large institution, that capital gets priced to the market, and with large companies with good credit and long-term leases, that market is highly competitive for cap rate. So you do see the build-to-suit business as a steady solid business out there, whether it be some infield locations like Santa Clara or the Pacific Northwest and Eastern Kentucky et cetera. Experience just suggests that where you make, the kind of returns we're really seeking is when you control an attractive infield land location.
Matthew S. Heinz: Okay, thanks very much.
Thomas M. Ray: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is from John Bejjani with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
John Bejjani: Good morning guys.
Thomas M. Ray: Good morning.
John Bejjani: I know you – Jeff, I know you just expanded your credit lines. But you guys now have around $350 million of net debt outstanding and a healthy amount of upcoming development spend? At what point or under what conditions would it make sense to look to tap the public debt markets and further diversify your funding sources?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yeah, I think, broadly speaking, when you think about the – some of the commentary we gave on the call, John, I think we said based on everything we've announced today we've got total CapEx of about $140 million that is queued up and obviously, we'll be spending through about the second quarter of 2016, with current liquidity of about $240 million, it gives us an incremental $100 million of liquidity. And as we go into 2016, it's obviously something we will look at and consider given the relevant pricing, the flexibility that we'd like to maintain inside the capital structure and obviously the size of the capital need. It's something we'll factor in every time we look at it. But it's clearly been on the table, it just hasn't been the financing of choice to date.
John Bejjani: Okay. And then just a couple of small income statement questions, I haven't had a chance to look into. First, is there anything one-time in nature driving the sequential increase in your real estate taxes and insurance? And then second, I noticed your rent expense ticked down a little bit over the quarter. Did you guys give back any space or renew any leases at lower rents or is there anything interesting there?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yeah. Two things on the real estate taxes and insurance. We did end up recording about, call it $600,000 of incremental property tax expense this quarter. As we continue to work through some of the challenges in the Bay Area around increases in value and ultimately, what is appropriate for them to be billing us, I think it's clear we have challenges every quarter and we're just working through that on a period-by-period basis. But there's about $600,000 in the quarter associated with that. In terms of rent expense, really the dip in this quarter really relates to some CAM reimbursements that came in lower than what was expected from one of our lessors.
John Bejjani: All right. That's it from me. Thanks.
Thomas M. Ray: You bet.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Jon M. Petersen: Hey actually it's Jon Petersen, here. Just a couple of quick questions. I hope I didn't miss this, but in terms of your lease volume, your new and expansion volume in the quarter obviously a lot higher because of the SV6 power base building and SV7 wholesale lease. Can you give us an indication of what the leasing volumes would be, what the $19.6 million would be if you took out those two leases.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: I think the combination, I guess, actually for purposes of what we can and can't disclose, Jon, I don't think we can actually give you the amounts just due to confidentiality purposes.
Jon M. Petersen: Okay, all right. And then maybe the same answer for this question, but maybe you can kind of dance around it, but earlier in response to a question, Tom, you talked about how with the power based lease, one of the reasons you did it is because the return on incremental capital was attractive. So when you say that, is that comparable to a normal co-location development, or you usually expect the 12% plus EBITDA yield. Should we expect a similar or more attractive yield on that investment?
Thomas M. Ray: Again, we can't speak to anything that would point too closely to the economics on that lease. But we're just not in the sub 12% business. I don't care what piece of our business it is, it's just not what we're trying to accomplish. And again we said we rank order opportunities based on risk-adjusted returns, build-to-suit preleased have a little bit lower risk, but we have a lot of investment opportunities with premium returns and we try to maintain that discipline no matter what we invest in.
Jon M. Petersen: Okay. That makes sense and then I guess outside of the economics of that deal, I mean you referred to that tenant as a strategic tenant. I'm curious whether their presence on your Santa Clara campus creates any sort of revenue synergies with the rest of your tenants, whether like you guys can do interconnection or any other reason that that would want people to be located in SV1 through SV5 and SV7?
Thomas M. Ray: Well. Look I think Santa Clara is, we all know, it's the heart of the data centers in the Bay Area. And I think that was important to this customer in their site selection criteria. And then in value to our portfolio, this is a larger customer. We have a broad relationship with and being able to serve them in ways that help their company just fosters a good relationship that has benefits for everybody quite broadly. So, excuse me, we're delighted to be of service.
Jon M. Petersen: Okay. All right. That makes sense. Thanks for your – thanks of the time.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Jonathan.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Thomas Ray for closing remarks.
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I just want to say again thanks to everybody for the interest in and support of the company and what we're trying to accomplish and special thanks to the people at CoreSite, working extremely hard and doing a very, very good job. We continue to believe we have a very bright future in front of us and we're going to keep working hard for our investors to execute upon that promise. Thanks again.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-23 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Derek McCandless, General Counsel. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Derek S. McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2015 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. CoreSite had a solid first quarter, both in financial results and operating performance. We continue to execute our business plan, and are pleased that we were able to further increase efficiency across our company and see our work reflected in our quantitative results. Specifically, our financial results reflect an increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 48.1%, measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q1 2015. This represents an increase of 166 basis points over the comparable period in the prior year. Additionally, we increased stabilized data center occupancy by 520 basis points over the last 12 months to 88.2%. Driven by these dynamics, our Q1 results reflect continued growth with increases in total operating revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and FFO of 17%, 26% and 27% respectively over Q1 2014. Leasing in Q1 was also solid with new and expansion leasing totaling $8.9 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 100 new and expansion leases totaling 54,000 net rentable square feet, at an average rental rate of $163 per square foot. During the quarter, we saw continued strength in leasing among mid-sized opportunities. Specifically in Q1, we executed five leases exceeding 1,000 square feet, totaling approximately 40,000 square feet for an average of 8,000 square feet each. Importantly, we also made progress towards our goal of increasing leasing volume to smaller customer requirements that we believe generate higher revenue per square foot than larger wholesale requirements. Specifically, in Q1 we executed 95 leases of less than 1,000 square feet, averaging a 152 square feet each. In total, we executed 100 new and expansion leases in Q1, representing a 4% increase in the number of leases signed over Q4 2014. As we communicated previously, we are focused upon increasing the total number of leases signed each quarter, and importantly, the number of small and mid-sized leases. While we are pleased to see an increase in total leases executed in Q1, going forward, we believe that we have an opportunity to drive additional growth in leasing volume among smaller deployments. In addition to strength in new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q1 was similarly strong, as renewals sold approximately 40,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $179 per square foot, reflecting mark-to-market growth of 5.3% on a cash basis and 11.4% on a GAAP basis. In terms of geography, Q1 leasing was well distributed across our portfolio with our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent being the Bay Area, New York, and Northern Virginia, D.C. In New York, we executed a lease in Q1 with a global financial services enterprise, but leased a computer room at NY2. This lease reflects a lower than typical rent per square foot, driven by lower power density requirements than it's typical in our portfolio. We believe the return on capital associated with this lease remains attractive. In the Bay Area, we leased an additional computer room at SV3, backfilling that room approximately two years before the scheduled expiration of the lease with the previous full building customer. As of the end of Q1, we have backfilled 75% of the capacity at SV3, with the remaining computer room occupied by the original customer through April 2016, and with solid demand for that space. Turning to our vertical performance, we saw significant strength in our enterprise vertical, accounting for 52% of new and expansion leases executed, and 85% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. We also continued to see strength in our network and cloud verticals, together accounting for 48% of new and expansion leases executed in Q1. We believe this reflects continued strong demand for network connectivity coming from carriers, content providers, and larger enterprises that are increasingly integrating their corporate communication networks partly driven by deployments of private and/or hybrid clouds. In addition to our Q1 leasing results, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we executed a lease for and began construction on the powered shell build-to-suit for 136,500 square feet on land we own on our Santa Clara campus. This building will be known as SV6, and the build-to-suit supports the needs of a strategic customer. We believe this project will add strategic value to our Santa Clara campus, while also producing a return on capital in line with our stated objectives. We expect to invest approximately $27 million to construct SV6, and anticipate that the lease will commence in the first half of 2016. Upon completion of SV6, we expect our Santa Clara campus to be comprised of four operating data centers, comprising approximately 390,000 square feet, plus an additional land site, upon which we anticipate being able to construct a new data center. Moving on to supply and demand conditions in our markets, we see the market substantially consistently with how we saw them at the time of our call two months ago. Regarding our plans for growth, we continue to build out additional TKD capacity in our existing powered shells. Two key projects currently under development are the second phases of both NY2 and VA2, each representing approximately 50,000 net rentable square feet of incremental TKD capacity, which we anticipate substantially completing and placing into service in Q2. We continue to view our internal growth opportunity optimistically, and believe it is driven by three key factors. First is our ability to continue to achieve positive mark-to-market on renewals across the portfolio. Second is the continued lease-up of our currently available 207,000 square feet of TKD capacity. And third is the steady execution of our development program on land and in buildings we currently own. To wrap-up, our operating results for the first quarter reflect continued execution of our business plan. We believe that CoreSite remains well-positioned within our industry, and that the supply and demand dynamics in the markets we serve remain favorable. We will continue to focus upon providing our customers with industry-leading solutions and service, running our business efficiently, and managing our capital prudently, all with the goal to generate strong returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Tom, and hello everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q1 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development activity and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And third, I will discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Turning to our financial performance in the first quarter, data center revenues were $72.6 million, a 2.8% increase on a sequential quarter basis, and a 17.7% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our Q1 data center revenue consisted of $61 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 3.2% on a sequential quarter basis, and 19.8% year-over-year; $10.2 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 7.1% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.8% year-over-year, and $1.4 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2.1 million. Our first quarter FFO was $0.64 per diluted share and unit, an increase of 4.9% on a sequential quarter basis, and a 25.5% increase year-over-year excluding non-recurring items in Q1 of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA of $38 million increased 4.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.3% over the same quarter last year. As Tom mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA margin continued to expand through Q1; related, our Q1 results represent revenue flow through to annualized adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 72% and 58% respectively, which is a significant improvement on a year-over-year basis. In thinking about our margins for the remainder of the year, keep in mind that our adjusted EBITDA margin has historically been negatively impacted by seasonal increases in our cost of power, which typically occurs in the second and third quarters. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter totaled $3.8 million, approximately 5.1% of total operating revenues, up 40 basis points, compared to last quarter, and in line with our guidance of approximately 5% to 5.5% of total operating revenues for the full year. General and administrative expenses were $7.9 million in Q1 correlating to 10.5% of total operating revenues. We continue to expect G&A for 2015 to correlate to approximately 10% of total operating revenue. Regarding our same-store metrics, Q1 same-store turn-key data center occupancy increased by more than 11 percentage points to 83.1% from 71.6% in the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, same-store MRR per cabinet equivalent increased by 5.1% year-over-year. That said, same-store MRR per cabi was essentially flat on a sequential basis, as we expected, due to the greater proportion of wholesale leasing relative to total leasing we completed in 2014, compared to prior years. We expect a similar dynamic in MRR per cabinet equivalent in the near future, and are focused upon executing leases with higher MRR per cabi in 2015, with a view towards returning to a higher growth rate in this metric in the mid-term. Remember that our same-store pool is redefined annually in the first quarter, and only includes turn-key data center space that was leased or available to be leased to our co-location customers as of December 31, 2013, at each of our properties and excludes powered shell and SV3 data center space. Also, as we communicated previously, churn in Q1 was elevated above that of the recent past. However, it was elevated for positive reasons, pointing to the health of our business. Specifically, churn in the first quarter was 2.2%, which includes 120 basis points related to two transactions at SV3, each accelerating the backfill of space in the building currently leased by the building's original full building customer. Excluding these two transactions, Q1 churn would have been 1% in line with recent experience for our company. We note as well that leases signed at SV3 also point towards incremental churn of approximately 150 basis points during the fourth quarter. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed, but not yet commenced leases is $14 million as of March 31, 2015 or $20.9 million on a cash basis. We expect approximately 87% or $12.2 million of the GAAP backlog to commence by the end of the second quarter of 2015. To that, leases representing approximately $5.7 million or 41% of the GAAP backlog commenced on April 1, 2015. The remaining GAAP backlog is expected to commence over the next four quarters. Please note that all of the preceding information related to our backlog excludes the impact of the build-to-suit lease at SV6 executed subsequent to the end of the quarter. As Tom noted, the combination of solid new leasing in the first quarter and high retention drove an increase in occupancy in our stabilized operating data center portfolio by 80 basis points over Q4 to close Q1 at 88.2%. Keep in mind that the recently developed data center projects that are in the initial lease up phase are classified as pre-stabilized until they reach 85% occupancy or have been in service for 24 months. To that point, in the first quarter, two rooms at LA2 totaling 29,000 square feet moved from the pre-stabilized pool into our stabilized pool as they have now been in service for two years. Additionally, as shown on page 19 of the supplemental 15,000 square feet at SV4 and 20,000 square feet at CH1 will move into our stabilized pool in the second quarter. Turning to development activity, as Tom mentioned, we began construction on the build-to-suit powered shell data center on the Santa Clara campus during the first quarter. Incremental to that, we had 48,000 square feet of data center space under construction at VA2 Phase 2. We expect to complete construction of this project in the second quarter of 2015. We also had 49,000 square feet under construction at NY2 Phase 2, which is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, we had 12,000 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at CH1 in Chicago. At the end of the first quarter, we had invested $19.6 million of the estimated $78.1 million required to complete all of the projects currently under construction. As a reminder, when we complete development projects, we realized a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. For 2015, we estimate the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 25% to 30% depending on the volume and pace of development during the year. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2015, our debt to Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.2 times. And if you include our preferred stock, it is three times. As we have discussed previously, we target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately four times. We remain focused upon maintaining the liquidity and available capital necessary to execute our business plans and support growth. In support of those goals, as of March 31, 2015, we had $233.8 million drawn on our credit facility, and approximately $164 million of available capacity under the facility. Finally, we are reiterating our 2015 FFO guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per share NOP unit. We are increasing our guidance for capital expenditures by $30 million to a range of $115 million to $145 million, primarily to account for the development of the powered shell build-to-suit on the Santa Clara campus. All other guidance metrics we disclosed in our fourth quarter earnings call remain unchanged, and a thorough summary of all 2015 guidance can found on page 24 of the first quarter earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we've discussed today. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave B. Rodgers: Hey, good morning out there guys. Tom, maybe first question for you; I understand the power revenue impact with regard to the leasing that you had done in 2014. I guess, I wanted to maybe dig in little bit on the MRR per cabi in your outlook for 2015. I mean, do we expect it to be flat? I thought the last commentary on the last call was kind of slower growth, but obviously we saw it drop a little bit sequentially. And then, maybe just to tag one more into that whole confusing question was; the cross-connect impact. I mean, should we expect to see cross-connect revenue growth then kind of slow later in the year, the same that power is seeing, but on a delayed basis?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, as to the power revenue, Dave, I think that, MRR per cabi – so just – the bottom line is, the MRR per cabi on these wholesale deals is typically lower, and in some cases substantially lower than on the more transactional deals – the smaller deals. And last year, we signed a much greater proportion of larger wholesale deals, as we were getting out of the gate and stabilizing some – getting traction at VA2 and NY2. So those – the MRR per cabi off of those big deals, because the big deals get factored into our MRR per cabinet equivalent. So the MRR per cabi off of those big deals is lower than the installed base. We've got this kind of anchor this year that's dragging it down a little bit. You also have lease up activity going on this year, that's countervailing, pushing things up, but I think the net for this year as these big deals ramp, commence and get going, especially in the first half of the year will be fairly flat, maybe it's down a little bit, maybe it's up a little bit, but I think it will be a fairly flat. After those leases commence, and provided we continue to execute in the transaction engine, we expect the MRR per cabi of new sales to be greater than the big wholesale deals done last year, and to be greater than the MRR per cabi in the installed base. So we would hope that we'll get – we'll see a return to growth in the MRR per cabi stat, maybe late this year, maybe it's next year, but those wholesale (21:47) deals are just kind of an anchor in there, what we told people to expect, and those rates are below that of the installed base. Regarding interconnection revenue, I just think, you need to look at that separately from the wholesales deals. Again, the interconnection revenue is more driven by network-dense deployments that are typically not very large, super large wholesale deals by cloud-based deployments and by certain enterprise deployments. And so, that business line, if you will, is just distinct from this wholesale business line. So we've been seeing consistent growth in the more transactional side of our business. Even while last year, we layered a bunch of wholesale on top. And so, that should point toward fairly consistent growth in interconnection revenue going forward, because that business that generates that growth is still healthy. What we're really saying is, in 2015, we expect to do less large wholesale than we did in 2014, but we should – our objectives is frankly to accelerate sales around the transaction engine, even if total sales in terms of megawatts decline this year because we're doing less wholesale. Does that answer your question?
Dave B. Rodgers: Yeah. I think, you got all the parts of it. So I do appreciate that. And then maybe a follow-up on that in terms of the sales force productivity, you spent last year building that out. Do you feel you're at, at the right run rate now, I mean, obviously there's always more to do, but are you pretty happy with the level of production now, where you're running the first quarter?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I guess, I think, we're fully staffed. We have people in the seats that we want to have – have in. I do think we can continue to improve in terms of productivity, you know, some of those people are still newer and fewer of them are on ramps in the end of the last year, but some are still on ramp. And even for some who are off ramp, they're probably not as productive as we would expect or hope, later in the year. So I don't think we need to add positions, but we do believe that we can do better than we're doing right now; we're not displeased, but we think we can continue to improve.
Dave B. Rodgers: Great. Last question from me. Jeff, with regard to your debt comments, I think it's clear that you're indicating you don't need the equity, but in terms of terming out some of that debt, if you did comment, I might have missed it. But any thoughts on timing or how you might go to market to take some of that off the line?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yeah, Dave. I think in general from the type, I think, in general, we would continue to do what we enjoy, or I guess what we prefer, which is ultimately trying to maintain as much flexibility in our capital structure as possible. That, combined with the size of the proceeds – if we were looking at something today, our revolver only has about $233 million drawn on it today. So we don't need an enormous amount of capital. So that combined with maintaining flexibility is – leans towards doing something else, probably akin to a term loan, similar to what we did a little over a year ago. Timing, I think we're closer to it today than we were a year ago, and it's something we're looking at and continuing to monitor around the exact timing on.
Dave B. Rodgers: All right. Thanks for the color, guys.
Thomas M. Ray: And Dave, really quickly, regarding leasing and productivity, I want to reinforce this – the comment around the distinction between wholesale leasing and what we think of as our transaction engine. So when I say we're working to increase productivity and production, it's really on the transaction end. So we don't want people on the phone to take that statement of we think we can get more productive, as we're going to see more wholesale leasing come in and more kilowatts and square footage being sold. That's not what we're trying to do this year. So I just want to underscore that distinction.
Dave B. Rodgers: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Emmanuel Korchman: Hey guys; just had a question for you on SV6. Is that lease at a set amount of power or do they have variable sort of uptake that they can take and they can expand their needs as they grow in the space.
Thomas M. Ray: It's a powered shell, Manny, with a maximum allocation from the substation onsite. They get their allocated share that they can use in the building. If they use less than that, fine, but they can't use more than that.
Emmanuel Korchman: And the reason I asked, if you – based on your schedules here in the held for development bucket, the range for the – the rest of the campus dropped to 12 megawatts to 18 megawatts from 20 megawatts to 35 megawatts. So, SV6 is going to be somewhere between 8 megawatts and 17 megawatts. Is that the right way to think about it?
Thomas M. Ray: We can't speak specifically to SV6, Manny, we just – we'll ask you to just interpret this up. We can't say anything about that lease.
Emmanuel Korchman: And then, it looked like you had a couple of leases drop out in NY2 – the lease percentage went down a little bit. Can you talk more about that?
Thomas M. Ray: We had a lease that we signed in the prior Q that we had targeted to commence inside the Phase 1 in that building – Phase 1 space. And some of the things the customer is looking for were a little bit different as we worked toward implementation. We put them in Phase 2. So you saw a square footage come out of Phase 1 and go into Phase 2. Phase 1...
Jeffrey S. Finnin: 68%.
Thomas M. Ray: Yeah, 68% Phase 2, 50%...
Jeffrey S. Finnin: 68%, it's about 40% range.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, the average is 53% I think.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: 54%, yeah.
Thomas M. Ray: 54%. But that's why Phase 1 bounced.
Emmanuel Korchman: Got it. That was it for me guys. Thank you.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: You bet. Thanks, Manny.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions.
Matthew S. Heinz: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for the incremental detail on the enterprise leasing activity this quarter. I'm just wondering if there are specific metros where you're seeing notable enterprise demand uptick or whether that's more of a broad-based function of your sales focused on smaller to mid-sized deployment?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: It's really broad based.
Matthew S. Heinz: Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, just sort of reconciling the flattish MRR per cabi, kind of this quarter and subsequent quarters with the strong uptick in rate per square foot booked this quarter. Just given the heavy enterprise mixed book this quarter, I'm wondering kind of what the underlying dynamics there are between metered versus breakered power and kind of the appetite for fiber connectivity within that enterprise base?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Well, I think we need to distinguish between enterprise and wholesale. You can sign wholesale deals with enterprises, you can sign more transactional deals with enterprises that are on a breakered amp as opposed to a metered power base (29:08) would generate more cross connects per square foot. So the dynamic that is unfolding at the moment in terms of more MRR per cabi is, the rent on the wholesale deals we signed last year is, though in some cases not – generally speaking is not bad rent, but it doesn't generate a lot of cross connects, and it's all sold on a metered basis. So your MRR per cabi is total revenue. So when you throw a couple of big wholesale deals in the pot in a given year, they might have a strong space rent, but they're not going to have MRR per cabi, total revenue, like the rest of your base. And then as to the enterprise vertical and going forward, I think the key to focus on with us is, as you already enquired, what percent of the leases are likely to be – and what percent of square footage sold is likely to be on a breakered amp basis versus metered. We're trying to give people some insight into that when we say; we signed five deals that were greater than 1,000 feet. Everything else was less than 1,000 feet. And generally speaking, less than 1,000 feet is more often going to be breakered, and end up generating more cross connects per square foot. So, that's the map and those are the dynamics. Does that help?
Matthew S. Heinz: That's helpful commentary. Thank you very much.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Barry McCarver with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.
Barry L. McCarver: Hey. Good morning, guys, and good quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess first off, Tom, would you speak kind of broadly to all of your markets, what you're seeing in terms of the demand, and then supply coming on from some of your competitors? Any big changes there?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, not big ones, I think that, that broadly spoken Barry, I think most of the markets are getting better, showing a little bit of a price strengthening over the last few quarters. I probably carve out Los Angeles, Boston, and Miami that are not negative; they're just reasonably flat or maybe showing that 2% to 3% annual inflation-related market adjustment. The rest of the markets in general, I think are showing a little more health in that. I wouldn't point to one that I think is measurably different than we said it was a quarter ago.
Barry L. McCarver: Are you seeing any kind of unusual speculative building in some of the bigger markets or is that pretty even with demand?
Thomas M. Ray: I think it's pretty even with demand at least in terms of permits and breaking ground. There are – anytime rents are rising, I think you see more people looking for dirt and thinking about doing more. I wouldn't say the behavior around that right now is outsized, but we see a little more interest. I would expect that to accelerate over the next couple of years. And – but we haven't seen any speculative behavior that we think is going to be meaningfully disruptive in the near-term.
Barry L. McCarver: Okay. And then just let me touch again on the sales productivity, which I know we've already kind of beat to death, but you've had several really strong quarters in a row. And then in your prepared remarks early on, you mentioned that the thought the total number of leases you sign each quarter could continue to go up. I mean what are your kind of targets or thoughts for this year on just the number of deals on a quarterly basis, you're going to ramp up to?
Thomas M. Ray: Yeah. And Barry, we're really just thinking more up into the right in the transactional engine. So again, if you think of it this way, much for wholesale last year, we have a – we would hope to have less wholesale this year relative to total leasing. And we're not going to work to try and do more wholesale than that might suggest. If the markets are favorable, and if we get more production out of our team, we want to get that in that smaller transactional bucket. And look, all we can say is, we were up 4% or 5% this quarter over last quarter. And we think we have – we've staffed, and we've invested such to do better, and go up into the right, it's really hard to predict the slope of that curve, we're just focused on up into the right.
Barry L. McCarver: And just so, I'm clear on the concept, and certainly, I understand the difference between, your transactional deals and the wholesale deals, but for this strategic customer that you've announced that you'll be building here. And that's really more driven by that customer's demand, I mean that's not really something you're out there, selling or avoiding the sale, it's a current customer that needs additional space, is that the way to think about that?
Thomas M. Ray: Well yeah, I mean – I think we are now established as a highly capable developer, and there are – there's a market for those development services, so we don't shy away from it. It's not traditionally been a big piece of our business. I think you see that business more active where you already have land. And so you see that from us in Santa Clara, this is our second build-to-suit. Our general view on build-to-suits is, as we've said in the past, to build a 100,000 square foot or 200,000 square foot building on a TKD basis at today's rate, probably does not make sense for our balance sheet, but if you can serve an important need, accelerate monetization of land you own, and get a good yield on the capital going to build the shell, that's a business we've executed successfully in the past. I think we have another one this quarter, and we don't shy away from it in the future as well, but it's – I think the growth of that business probably has more to do with land, and we're pretty happy where we're right now in terms of having spec land lying around.
Barry L. McCarver: Very good. Thanks, guys.
Thomas M. Ray: I'd just say if we – to the extent we buy any more land in the future, it's going to be with a view towards putting it to use in our TKD program and it's going to make that clarification. We're not trying to go long on land and build a gigantic development services business. Development services is a good business, we will not shy away from it, we'll do it when it's smart. But probably not going to be a big piece of our balance sheet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please go ahead with your questions.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. This Bob (35:53) for Jonathan. Pricing this quarter looked pretty good at $163 per square foot and above the trailing 12 month average. I was wondering if power density is a factor here or if this is just rising pricing on an apples-to-apples basis. And I was wondering also if you could just go through and reiterate the targeted stabilized trends for development project including SV6?
Thomas M. Ray: Thanks for the question. Regarding the increase in rates, power density for the Q is in line with the trail. So we just did see better rates in general, and better yield on the lease assigned in the last Q, that can be affected little bit by geography, and I just neglected to take that part of it apart this time, and compare it to the trail, we get higher rates in LA than we do in Miami. I think in terms of geographic distribution, it's reasonably consistent with the trail, nothing really anomalous. So that's the rent per foot answer. It was just a little bit better. And what was the other question, I'm sorry.
Unknown Speaker: Stabilized deals – targeted stabilized deals on the development project, and the new ones, BTS – any BTS project?
Thomas M. Ray: Same old story. We've been saying for four and a half years, we target north of a 12% (37:15) on the use of our capital, and there are times when we do a whole lot better than that. The – we believe the build-to-suit, the return on incremental capital, we're going to invest in that is in line with our objectives. And the range of yields we get on our respective elements, again, we shoot for north of 12% (37:40) we've been, I think pretty good at making that happen, and we've had some that are considerably higher. We just don't really like pointing at that. And over time, as you compare us to others, just look at the change in EBITDA, and you look at the change in the balance sheet and yields over three-year or four-year period will be crystal clear in the math. And we invite people to continue to perform that diligence on us.
Unknown Speaker: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you for taking the question. Regarding rents rising, you made a comment in the response to a question here, and you've also said that the supply/demand dynamic remains favorable, which make some sense. Can you maybe quantify what you're seeing in terms of market rent increases or what you expect to see?
Thomas M. Ray: My best quantification, Jordan would be poquito (38:49). It's – you're seeing some. Nothing is going to wild, right. The – it's tighter in most of the markets, but most of the markets still have the same number of competitors who are still out there with some degree of capacity. I think you just see more discipline across the industry now. People have learned what works and what doesn't work and start to say no to things that don't work. And markets are a little bit tighter. So look, yeah it's moving in the right direction. I just don't think we're going to see huge spikes, and we're not seeing those right now.
Jordan Sadler: Can it be more equilibrium oriented?
Thomas M. Ray: That's my guess. Yeah.
Jordan Sadler: (39:30) increases. Okay. Okay. Along the same lines, this build-to-suit, I noticed that the cost on a per square foot basis was plus 5% or so relative to SV5, and number one, I'm hoping, I'm comparing apples-to-apples in terms of what you're building, but separately would it be safe to assume that the rents would be up a similar amount?
Thomas M. Ray: Just can't speak to that lease at all, Jordan. We – I thought we met somebody's need in a way that was very good for our company last time. I think the markets are little bit more competitive right now and we're responsive to that, but we still felt very good about the new lease, and again our statements that we feel, it's in line with our hurdle is where we stand. But we can't point to anything about that lease in particular.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Okay, and that's fair, I guess I'm – I think, I'm curious more about you guys building PBB, and it seems like you're saying look we'll do PBB when everything makes sense. But I know, your land is inventory in a market like Silicon Valley or Santa Clara is kind of scarce or becoming increasingly scarce. How do you think about – and you have another lot of left, and I think you said, you'd build another data center on there; can you maybe talk about that, is that something you're looking to do on speculative basis?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, our comments in the prepared remarks were that we believe we have the opportunity to build another data center there, and it's certainly something we look at. We are getting very full in the Bay Area, and then it turns to a question of – discussions with our Board around what's the best use of the balance sheet, and what are the most attractive alternatives on not only return, but a risk adjusted return basis. And certainly Santa Clara is in the mix of things that we're looking hard at. But there are a lot of, we believe, intelligent things to do with our capital, and we're still working through that prioritization with our Board.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Can you just remind us what the cost of power is at Stender, roughly?
Thomas M. Ray: Going from $0.10 to close to $0.11 plus or minus. Yeah.
Jordan Sadler: Okay.
Thomas M. Ray: About $0.11 currently. It's gone up again in that whole area.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas M. Ray: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your questions.
Colby A. Synesael: Great. Thank you. When you look at the growth rate that you've been achieving, call it the last 12 months, and arguably the growth rate that you aspire to achieve the next 12 months, relative to your current development pipeline, how comfortably do you feel with the number and the timing – the number of projects and the timing to which those projects are expected to come online to effectively have enough capacity in the market, based on the type of demand that you're seeing in those markets, to continue at those growth rates? And then, I just wanted to go back to the question related to metered versus breakered. Certainly appreciate that you see the majority of call it sub-500 kW deals being breakered. But are you seeing an increasing number of those deals or those customers asking for metered? I guess, are we seeing a trend potentially developing there? Thank you.
Thomas M. Ray: Yeah. I mean, you do see more of the markets, sub-500 kW, and this is consistent with past statements over the last year, year and a half. There is clearly market pressure in that 130 kilowatts to 500 kilowatts range, for more of that to be either metered or a synthetic meter basis – a draw cap model or other models that have less return on them in terms of total revenue than a pure breakered model that is smaller. That threshold is pushed from 500 kilowatts down to 250 kilowatts to 130 kilowatts, and it's a little muddy in that 130 kilowatts to 500 kilowatts range, but you are seeing pressure – downward pressure.
Colby A. Synesael: Growth and development pipeline?
Thomas M. Ray: Yeah. I think on growth and development – look in the – certainly in the foreseeable future, we feel very good about our ability to grow the company. And if you look at how we've done that in the recent history, the last four and half years, a significant amount of our growth comes from the Bay Area, D.C./Virginia, LA. A year, year and a half ago, we added New York to that; so that's kind of our big four. Chicago and Boston have been kind of medium-sized growth contributors, and then Denver and Miami are frankly pretty small. And so, the key for us is continuing to fuel in these big markets. We've accomplished a significant growth rate really three out of those four markets over the years, because we didn't have NY2. Now we have NY2 and we have plenty of room to run in three markets: NY2, Virginia and LA, and we're certainly looking at the Bay Area, because that's where we are constrained. But even without that, I think we can continue to do a good job of growing the company.
Colby A. Synesael: If I can then Tom, just a follow-up to that line of questioning. What is the – what should we be expecting as it relates to announcements for newbuilds as we go into call it the middle or the back half of next year. Is it fair to assume that there should be another two or three announcements that we'll see come across the tape? Or is it something different?
Thomas M. Ray: Well look, we just – we – first we look at growth the way we've described it, with these four layers. And the first layer is depth inside markets we're currently active in. And we look at how much room is left to – how much capacity can we continue to deliver really in those big four markets, and to some extent the other two, Chicago and Boston, and we look at our balance sheet capability, and we match those things up. I'll encourage you guys to do the same. If there's a point where your forecast says we've delevered below where we are right now in terms of times EBITDA coverage, and your model says we're running out of inventory in Virginia, that's probably something we're going to – want to use that debt capacity to go address. But it's a dynamic relationship between these four prioritizations of capital, the first one being the markets we're in and our balance sheet and specifically our leverage capacity.
Colby A. Synesael: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas M. Ray: So we're toggling those two things all the time and encourage you guys to think about your models the same way.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your questions.
Tayo T. Okusanya: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Tayo.
Tayo T. Okusanya: Yeah. I'm just trying to reconcile the guidance versus results and your outlook. So you beat for the quarter, there's a focus left on wholesale going forward, which should improve margins. You have a strong development pipeline. So I'm just curious why guidance numbers did not go up given the positive momentum. I'm just – is there anything I'm kind of missing in the back-half of the year?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Hey, Tayo. It's Jeff. Thanks for the comments. I think just in general when you look at our results for Q1, obviously we're happy with the results, and that would equate out to a run rate of about $2.56 per share, that's obviously at the – right at the low end of our guidance for the year.
Tayo T. Okusanya: Right.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: I think as you think about your models going forward, I just want to point you to a couple of things that I mentioned on the prepared remarks. First, we always have margin compression around our power in the second quarter and third quarter of every year, that was at the times when the rates increased, so just focus a little bit on that. And then secondly, the other item is, as we're finishing development obviously, we finish development on the first phase at VA2 this quarter, and we'll finish the second phases of development at both NY2 and VA2 next quarter, that's going to lead to a lower amount of capitalized interest, taxes and insurance.
Tayo T. Okusanya: Right.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Broadly speaking, we've guided the last quarter to say that our percentage of capitalized interest would drop to somewhere between 25% and 30% for the year. In the first quarter, we are right at about 50%. So if you take that run rate for the quarter from the first quarter, that difference between the 50% actual and 30% where we think it'll be for the whole year is roughly $500,000 to $600,000 per quarter. So just factor that into your modeling as well.
Tayo T. Okusanya: Got it. All very helpful tidbits (49:05). Appreciated. Thank you.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew S. Heinz: Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. Just one last follow-up on the macro picture. So we're still presumably in the early innings here on the turn in – in industry pricing, and you talked about kind of a better discipline across the space in terms of spec development. But I guess, the last time we had bullish pricing cycle that didn't take long for the non-traditional capital to kind of come in and chase a little bit. Do you think it's different this time around and just given the maturation of the industry over the last several years or could we once again see more new non-traditional players coming into – to the space?
Thomas M. Ray: I do think, the highest level that real estate development cycles tend to repeat themselves, I think it's hard to get away from that. So – and again, I think that, that activity has a much greater impact on wholesale rents. We're really trying to really drive growth in the non-wholesale part of our business, but it takes time to get land, get power, get entitled and get built. So certainly over the next year or maybe even two years, you have pretty good visibility that – it's highly unlikely that supply is going to get out of hands. Two years or three years from now, I think if yields are gone up, I think alternative capital is going find its way back into the sector, and I think the wholesale business will remain somewhat cyclical.
Matthew S. Heinz: Okay.
Thomas M. Ray: Into the cycles – cycles is the amplitude, start to decrease a little bit as people get wiser or maybe as markets get bigger, maybe, but I still think you're going to see meaningful cyclicality in the wholesale sector over time.
Matthew S. Heinz: Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.
Thomas M. Ray: Sure.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to Tom Ray for closing remarks.
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we just want to say thank you to, again to everybody on the call, investors and the analyst community. Thanks for putting the time to trying to understand our company better and better. We want to say thanks to our employees who've been working incredibly hard and continuing to do so and continuing to get sharper, better, faster more productive. And we're going to keep trying to move that trend forward and generate returns for our investors. Thanks again for your time.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-13 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Derek McCandless. Thank you, Mr. McCandless. You may begin.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 conference call. I'm joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at CoreSite.com. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Ray: Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We're pleased to report continued execution of our business plan in Q4, delivering solid growth and finishing out 2014 as a strong year for our company. During the year, we worked to make our Organization leaner, more efficient and more productive and we believe that our work is reflect in our financial and operating results. Our financial results for 2014 reflect solid growth over 2013, with increases in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 16%, 20% and 20% respectively, all excluding the impact of non-recurring items from the first half of the year. We believe that in Q4, our momentum continued to accelerate, with our Q4 results compared to Q4 of the prior year reflecting stronger growth than our year-on-year results. Specifically, Q4 2014 over Q4 2013 results reflect growth of 18% in revenue, 28% in adjusted EBITDA and 25% in FFO. We achieved this strong top-line growth while simultaneously working to make our organization simpler and more efficient. Reflecting that work, G&A as a percent of revenue decreased by 140 basis points in calendar 2014 over 2013 and correspondingly, G&A as a percent of adjusted EBITDA and FFO declined by 400 and 500 basis points respectively. We believe that we accomplished stronger growth with lower relative expense by simplifying our internal structure, streamlining decision-making and enhancing clarity among our employees. A key component of our work in 2014 to simplify and increase clarity across our organization was to specifically address our sales and marketing functions. To that end, we view fixed and mobile networks, cloud and IT service providers and the enterprise as the three legs of the stool that support differentiated value in the data center. Early in 2014, we simplified our sales structure to organize our teams around these three mark segments and we believe our teams produced strong results. In Q4 we executed new and expansion leases representing $11.1 million of annualized GAAP rent, which represents record leasing of TKD capacity for our company. During the quarter, we signed 96 new and expansion leases, comprising approximately 92,000 net rentable square feet, at an average rate of $121 per square foot. Q4 leasing was well distributed among smaller and mid-sized leases, with only six leases exceeding 2000 square feet. Specifically, in the quarter, we executed five mid-sized new and expansion leases averaging approximately 7000 square feet each, plus one lease of 44,000 square feet. The 44,000 square-foot lease was with an anchor customer that leased 100% of our phase 1 TKD capacity at VA2. The GAAP rental rate on this lease was below our trailing average, which impacted our average rate per square foot for the quarter. Adjusting to exclude the impact of this lease from our broader Q4 results, the average rental rate associated with new and expansion leases signed in Q4 would have exceeded our trailing 12-month average. Looking more broadly at our leasing results for all of 2014, we believe that we had a solid year across all metrics. During the year, we signed new and expansion leases, representing $33 million in annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 245,000 square feet, at an average rental rate of $136 per foot. The $33 million in annualized GAAP rent leased reflect an increase of over 80% over 2013 and represents record new and expansion leasing for our company. A portion of the increase in the volume of annualized GAAP rent leased in 2014 stems from our decision to sign the wholesale lease at VA2. However, we believe that the dominant portion of the increase in leasing steps from two factors. First, our ability to increase transaction count, of which smaller co-location leases comprised the primary component and second, our renewed strength among mid-sized lease opportunities. Specifically, in 2014, we signed 466 new and expansion leases, also representing a record for our company. Beyond simple leasing volume, we believe that our leasing during the year produced strong results from a strategic perspective. To that, we meaningfully advanced the network and cloud capabilities in our portfolio, executing upon our strategy to provide solutions for high performance workloads and applications. During the year, our network and mobility and cloud and IT services verticals together accounted for 55% of transactions and 53% of annualized GAAP rent from new and expansion leases signed. Further, these two verticals represented 80 or 63% of the 127 new logos we signed in the year. We believe that this reflects continued growth in the number of service providers in the marketplace, as well as the attractiveness of our platform to those service providers. In addition to growth in our network and mobility and cloud and IT services verticals, we're pleased with our execution related to the third key component of our strategy, the enterprise. Within our enterprise segment, we continued to see solid performance in digital content, systems integrators and MSPs serving the enterprise, healthcare and other professional services. We also saw robust activity among financial services customers in our New York, Chicago and northern Virginia/DC campuses. In total, our enterprise segment represented 45% of the new and expansion leases signed during 2014, a 25% increase year-over-year. Regarding our interconnection product line, interconnection revenue increased 22% in 2014 over 2013, driven by strong growth in unit volume among our basket of interconnection products at higher price points. Specifically, we saw a 26.8% revenue growth across the products that we believe represent current architecture, namely, intra- and inter-building fiber cross connects, [inaudible] transport within the metro market, our blended IP product and our logical interconnection services comprised of our Any2 internet change and our ethernet-based CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange. This basket of high-growth, current architecture products compares to the lower price point and volume declines associated with our copper cross connect product, which we view as a legacy architecture. Specifically, in Q4 2014, our copper cross-connect product reflected unit pricing of 52% of that of the basket of current architecture products. Additionally, in-place unit volumes of our copper product reflect a decline at a 4.8% compounded annual rate from Q1 2013 through Q4 2014. We offer this more granular information regarding our interconnection products for two reasons. First, the dynamics in growth among our higher- and lower-priced products help inform a deeper understanding of the growth in our total interconnection revenue. Second, we believe that our strong growth in our basket of current architecture interconnection products provides insight into the true health and growth of our platform in serving high-performance computing workloads and networking requirements. In addition to growth in interconnection revenue and volume, 2014 saw meaningful progress from us in other areas related to our interconnection product line. In 2014, we saw new deployments from AMS-IX and DE-CIX, adding to our global and national peering partners, which already included LINX and NYIIX across our Bay Area, New York and Northern Virginia/DC campuses. Additionally, during the year, we secured new metro dark fiber partners and assets, with which we believe we can further enhance our solution set in our New York, Los Angeles and Northern Virginia-DC campuses. Looking forward into 2015 we anticipate continued port growth on our ethernet-based CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange. Further, we're seeing increasing demand for 100-gig services on our Any2 Internet exchange and we will be working in the year ahead to meet that demand. With 2014 behind us, we're focused upon our activities and growth plans for 2015. At a high level, we prioritize our activities and capital allocation according to our view of risk-adjusted return on incremental investment. As such, our top priority for 2015 is to lease existing available TKD inventory. To that, at December 31, 2014, our data center portfolio was 82.6% occupied and 85.9% leased, providing us with the ability to increase earnings from available capacity with a minimum investment of additional capital. Our second priority is to build out additional TKD capacity in our existing powered shelves. Key among these are NY2, VA2 and LA2, together representing the opportunity to build 480,000 square feet of new data center capacity, representing 39% of our occupied data center square footage at December 31. We forecast that our cost to develop this capacity will be substantially below full replacement cost and as such, that upon lease-up, this capacity will generate yields substantially above those on new ground-up construction. Our third priority is to build additional capacity in markets in which we currently have a presence. To this, we own land on our Santa Clara campus, upon which we believe we will be able to build two additional data centers, ranging from 135,000 square feet to 210,000 square feet. We also own land on our NY2 site in Secaucus, upon which we believe we will be able to build an additional building, as market conditions may warrant. Our fourth priority is what we refer to as opportunistic external growth which can take a variety of forms. We remain diligent in evaluating all such opportunities that we identify, but note that we view these opportunities as a fourth priority for our capital, given the attractiveness of other alternatives. With that landscape surrounding our capital priorities laid out, I will take a moment to offer insight into our leasing objectives for 2015. First, we entered 2015 with limited capacity available for lease in the Bay Area and no blocks of TKD capacity greater than 5000 square feet available in the area, which is roughly the equivalent of one-half of a computer room. As such, we expect leasing volume for TKD capacity in the Bay Area to be substantially lower in 2015 than in 2014, as we evaluate the potential of building more capacity in the market. Our limited availability of leasable capacity in the Bay Area may impact total leasing volume for the year, since the Bay Area represented approximately one-third of total leasing volume for us in 2014, defined in terms of annualized GAAP rent sold in new and expansion leases. Second, as we communicated early in 2014, when we build a large new development project, we may look for one or more larger leases to bring immediate income to the building. During 2014, we believe that we successfully accomplished this at both NY2 and VA2. With those large leases now in place, in 2015 we anticipate orienting our efforts more toward our more traditional co-location activities. Specifically, we will work to increase leasing volume in the small and mid-sized segment of the market, focused upon performance-sensitive workloads and customer requirements. Our objectives in sharpening our focus upon this segment of the market are to increase the profitability associated with new business, drive returns on invested capital and further cement our assets and company as having a sustainably differentiated value proposition. We finished 2014 and began 2015 with accelerating momentum and we will work to capitalize upon that momentum as we focus upon growing our company and generating strong returns on capital. Further, we will continue to focus upon enhancing the ecosystems across our platform as we work to provide an industry-leading solution for our customers' performance-sensitive requirements. Finally, we will continue to work to make our business leaner, simpler and more productive, with our goal to produce strong financial results and to continue to provide our customers with industry-leading customer service. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Tom and hello, everyone. I will begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q4 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development activity. Third, I will provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity and fourth, I will introduce our guidance for the year. Turning to our financial performance in the fourth quarter, data center revenues were $70.6 million, a 3.1% increase on a sequential basis and an 18.9% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our Q4 data center revenue consisted of $59.1 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 3.7% sequentially and 19% year-over-year; $9.5 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 4% sequentially and 21.2% year-over-year; and $2 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light-industrial revenue was $$1.9 million. Consistent with our performance in the first three quarters of 2014, we continued to drive solid growth in our same-store MRR per Cab E. During the fourth quarter, same-store turnkey MRR increased 7.1% year-over-year, while same-store data center occupancy increased 710 basis points to 81.7% year-over-year. Q4 lease commencements represented $4.9 million of annualized GAAP rent, comprised of approximately 34,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $145 per square foot. Renewals in the fourth quarter totaled approximately 44,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rental rate of $153 per square foot and represented mark-to-market growth of 2.6% and 5.2% on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively. For the full year, cash rent growth of 2.9% was in line with our guidance range. Churn in the fourth quarter was 1.4%, bringing the full-year rate to 5.6% or 1.4% on average per quarter, which is also in line with our guidance range. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $15.4 million or $18.8 million on a cash basis. For reference, this is more than 2.5 times our GAAP backlog entering 2014. We expect approximately 77% or $11.8 million of the current GAAP backlog to commence by the end of the second quarter of 2015. Another 5% is expected to commence in the second half of 2015. Our fourth quarter FFO was $0.61 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 10.9% on a sequential quarter basis and a 24.5% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $36.3 million increased 10.4% sequentially and 28% over the same quarter last year. Our full-year 2014 results reflect total operating revenue of $272.4 million, an increase of 16% over $234.8 million for 2013. Excluding non-recurring items recorded in the first half of the year, our adjusted EBITDA of $129.6 million increased 20.2% from $107.8 million in 2013. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points to 47.6% of revenue from 45.9% in 2013. FFO for the full year also excluding non-recurring items was $102.7 million, an increase of 20.4% over the 2013 amount of $85.3 million, while FFO per diluted share and unit increased 19.8% year-over-year to $2.18. This represents revenue flow-through-to-adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 58% and 46%, respectively. During the fourth quarter, approximately 52,000 square feet of land in an ancillary parking lot at our BO1 facility in Boston was acquired by The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, pursuant to an order of taking. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a $1.2 million gain on land disposal for GAAP purposes for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We exclude gains on sales of land or property from both our FFO and adjusted EBITDA calculations as shown in the reconciliations on page 13 of the earnings supplemental. Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $3.4 million, approximately 4.7% of total operating revenues, down 70 basis points compared to last quarter as we continued to focus on simplifying the business and increasing productivity throughout the sales organization. For 2015, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be approximately 5% to 5.5% of total operating revenues. As Tom stated, G&A as a percent of revenue decreased from 11.6% in 2013 to 10.2% in 2014. You may notice that for Q4 2014, G&A as a percent of revenue was 8.6%. The reduction in G&A during the fourth quarter was due in part to a $400,000 adjustment to our bad debt allowance due to favorable collections in the quarter and a seasonal decrease in travel costs due to the holidays. We expect G&A for 2015 to correlate to approximately 10% of total operating revenue. As of December 31, 2014, our stabilized operating data center portfolio was 87.4% occupied compared to 81.7% at the beginning of 2014. Including leases executed at the end of Q4 but not yet commenced, our stabilized data center occupancy rate would be 89.7%. Including pre-stabilized space, our total data center portfolio was 82.6% occupied at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of 530 basis points over the last 12 months. I would like to point out that we have enhanced our disclosures in our quarterly supplemental with a number of changes I will briefly discuss. First, on page 14, we have updated the layout of the operating properties table to provide a more comprehensive overview of the total data center portfolio by including pre-stabilized and total data center square footage and occupancy. We have separated the office and light-industrial portion, which can now be found at the bottom of the table. Additionally, we have separated the square feet currently under development from space held for development to provide more insight into our near-term construction projects. Second, on page 17, we supplemented the geographic diversification with a breakdown of vertical diversification, based on total annualized data center rent. Third on page 23, we have provided our view of the components of net asset value to provide more clarity around valuation. Lastly, we have enhanced the annual guidance on page 24 to include the implied growth ranges of our key financial metrics based on the midpoint of 2015 guidance. Note that the 2014 amounts are normalized for non-recurring items, which can be seen on the guidance page of the supplemental. Turning to development activity, we expect total capital expenditures in the range of $85 million to $115 million in 2015. We forecast to invest $65 million to $80 million in expansion capital in 2015, comprised of follow-on development project in key markets across our portfolio. This is in line with our prioritized capital expenditures Tom outlined. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 92,000 square feet of data center space under construction at VA2 related to Phases 1 and 2. This amount includes the 44,000 square feet associated with Phase 1 that was 100% leased as of December 31, 2014. We have seen good momentum at NY2 with Phase 1 75% leased at the end of the fourth quarter. With this in this mind, we began construction on Phase 2 at NY2 with a total of 49,000 square feet expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2015. Lastly, we had approximately 29,000 square feet of turnkey data center space under construction at three additional locations to add incremental capacity in Boston, Denver and Chicago. Through the end of the fourth quarter, we have spent $81 million out of the estimated $129 million required to complete all of the projects under construction. As we've discussed previously, as we complete development projects, we realize a reduction in our run-rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. At the end of 2014, the percentage of interest capitalized was approximately 48% for the full year. As we look ahead to 2015, we estimate this percentage could decrease to a range of 25% to 30%, depending on the volume and pace of development during the year. As a reminder, we have included the percentage of gross interest capitalized on page 22 of the supplemental and also in our Form 10-K to be filed tomorrow. Turning to our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2014, our debt-to-Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.2 times. If you include our preferred stock, it is 3 times. We remain focused on maintaining the liquidity and available capital necessary to execute our capital spending plans to support future growth. As we have discussed previously, we target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4 times. As of December 31, 2014, we had $218.5 million drawn on our credit facility and approximately $179 million of available capacity under the facility. During the fourth quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend, representing the fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth in the quarterly dividend rate and 34% compounded annual growth since becoming a public company. We increased our dividend by 20% to $0.42 per share on a quarterly basis or $1.68 per share on an annual basis. We remain focused on maintaining our dividend payout levels to comply with our REIT requirements, balanced with our need to retain cash to invest in and grow our portfolio. Now in closing, I would like to address guidance for 2015. I would remind you that our guidance is based on the current view of supply-and-demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we've discussed today. As detailed on page 24 of our supplemental, our guidance for 2015 is as follows. FFO per share and OP unit is estimated to be $2.55 to $2.65. This implies 19% year-over-year FFO growth based on the midpoint of the range and the $2.18 per share we reported in 2014, excluding the net benefit of $0.04 in non-recurring items recognized in the first half of 2014. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $313 million to $323 million. Based on the midpoint of guidance, this implies 17% year-over-year revenue growth. Data center revenue is estimated to be $305 million to $315 million, correlating to 17% year-over-year revenue growth. Keep in mind that the increased volume of larger leases in 2014 will likely correlate to a greater percentage of new power revenue from metered customers in 2015. As we have discussed in the past, metered revenue is a pure pass-through, which should be accounted for as you think about your models for 2015. Consistent with the goals Tom outlined to orient more toward co-location leasing in 2015, our objective is to return our mix of power revenue between metered and [inaudible] products to historical norms in 2016 and beyond. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $30 million to $32 million or approximately 10% of revenue. This implies an 11% increase in G&A expenses, well below the estimated increase in revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $153 million to $158 million. This implies 20% year-over-year growth based on the midpoint of the range, excluding the non-recurring items recognized in the first half of 2014. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows; estimated annual churn rate of 6% to 8% for 2015. Note, this is our expected churn for the full year and is different than the quarterly guidance we have provided in the past. Keep in mind, there is variability associated with the quarterly churn rate and in 2015, we would expect the first half of the year to have a higher churn rate compared to our historical results with more normalized levels in the back half. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 2% to 5% for the full year. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $85 million to $115 million. The components are comprised of data center expansion cost, estimated to be $65 million to $80 million. This includes the expansion capital related to the continued build out of VA2 and NY2, as well as incremental turnkey data center capacity discussed earlier. Non-recurring investments are estimated to be $10 million to $15 million and include amounts related to our IT initiatives, facilities upgrades and other capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures and tenant improvements are each estimated to be $5 million to $10 million. Now we would like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Dave Rodgers: Tom, maybe talk a little bit about the higher churn that Jeff mentioned here toward the end of the call. It sounds like it's pretty localized or specific, so wondering if there's a particular market or specific asset that's going to drive some of that churn and what the outcome you expect there is?
Tom Ray: Sure, Dave. There are really three specific items that we're thinking about as we guide to a little higher level of churn. First and we'd note we expect that to be happening in the first half of the year. Those three items are and the first item may occur at any time during the year, but we're hopeful that we can accelerate the backfill of some of the remaining space from the building at SB3, where we had formerly had one large customer and then we backfilled some of that. If we're able to accelerate the backfill of the rest, you will see an acceleration of the churn of that former single-tenant customer. The timing of that and the likelihood is uncertain, but we've built that into our model and the timing is equally uncertain, but we thought it prudent to say this might come about during the year. For that to happen, we would also have an offsetting backfill, so it shouldn't impact cash flow as to that piece of churn. The other two components are customer and customer-specific, one of our larger content customers has just changed part of their data center architecture to needing lower power. So we're working through refitting them in our portfolio where it is appropriate to do so, but we expect to see some contraction from that customer in a couple of locations. They're widely distributed. This change is not happening to all deployments all the way across our company, but we do expect some to come from that and we expect that to really take place more in the beginning of the year and then be worked through. The third dynamic in the churn guidance is we have a larger enterprise customer that acquired some businesses and assets in 2014, a component of which had fee-owned data centers in the stuff that they acquired. So they're going to move one component out of one of our LA buildings over to a fee-owned building that they just picked up that has a lot of spare capacity. So I don't think anybody should interpret our churn guidance as something endemically different about our business model or about the stickiness of the customers. These are, in general terms not the performance-sensitive, not the smaller stuff with high cross-connects. These are specific things and sometimes the ball bounces that way and we expect it to bounce that way in the first half of the year.
Dave Rodgers: Maybe a follow-up to that with regard to the leasing spread guidance for the year and where you expect rents to be. Looks like this year of expirations is a fairly high number for the expiration schedule for you in terms of dollars per foot or pricing, but can you talk about the guidance of up 2% to 5% maybe being a little bit more cautious than we've actually seen? Is some of this churn related to this pricing or is this just where market conditions are and are you seeing more pricing pressure in the market?
Tom Ray: That mark-to-market, number one, is distinct from churn, so to the extent somebody churns out, releasing that does not go into the market-market calc for us. That calc is only an in-place lease that renews. Secondly, the mark-to-market is on rent only. As we've been saying for a while now we're really working to increase the profitability of our business and returns on capital through product mix and so there are times when an in-place customer is rolling where we might move the needle more in mark-to-market we might get more uplift in the non-rent components of the product mix. So I would just say, Jeff leads that activity, he has done a great job in looking through what will happen. We feel good about the forecast for rental mark-to-market and we're going to try to improve on that in other areas, but as to leases that stay in place and renew, I would expect the improvements in other areas to be on the margin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Douglas with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Douglas: I guess two questions if I could. First, specifically on the wholesale customer at VA2, maybe for you Jeff, can you just provide a little bit more color in terms of how that ramp occurs, specifically on the power side? And then second question, maybe for Tom, just interested in your thoughts on the proposed Telecity Interxion deal both from a strategic standpoint and maybe as it relates to the existing cross-selling agreements you have there? Thanks.
Jeff Finnin: Overall, that customer ends up deploying into our VA2 data center in the second quarter of 2015. As you can expect with some of our larger wholesale deals, many of those deals, especially to the extent they are at the size in which this one is, they will ramp in over that over a period of time. For this particular customer, you can expect that to ramp in over about a two-year period of time.
Tom Ray: We're under a tight [inaudible] under that lease and we're not really able to give any information regarding the economics or give any information that would support backing into them. So for anybody out there, if that's one of your two questions, you might want to pick a different one. And Telecity and InterXion, it's consolidation among the three leading folks in Europe is to be expected and it makes a lot of sense. The consolidation in terms of just strategic platform will be good for both companies involved. We know that, that deal isn't done and other dynamics may be at play, but that - consolidation among the leading guys in Europe is healthy for Europe and for the industry. As to what that points toward elsewhere, my guess is in the immediate term, maybe not much. When two big companies merge, there is a lot of work to be done there. My guess is that, that deal is going to take its time to get completed and digested and that will be it for Europe. Our view of M&A in the states has not changed from the past several calls that we've addressed it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Jordan Sadler: First, just curious if you could address market rent expectations. I see that the first priority here is lease-up and it ties in well with, as you have discussed before, filling in around some of the hard work you've done over the last year in putting the anchor tenants in New York and here in Virginia. Just maybe curious just about market rents and the trends you are seeing and then what the impact might be of just the type of leasing that you're doing?
Tom Ray: Sure. Again, for our business, it's important to think about market rents but also, again, product mix. So with regard to market rents, for the same leasing opportunity with the same customer in 2015 as in 2014, we expect some further strengthening. I don't think it will be dramatic, but you will see some further strengthening, probably in most marks other than New York, New Jersey. We don't expect New York, New Jersey to go down, but nor do we expect it to strengthen meaningfully, but perhaps in Virginia, in the Bay Area even more likely, you will see some strengthening. LA will probably have that same 3% growth that's it's been in LA for quite some time. So for the same lease and the same requirement, that's our view of market rents. That said, what we're really focused on accomplishing in 2015, as we said, is to increase the volume of smaller transactions and importantly, increase - to take it from other industries, the ARPU of each square foot or each kilowatt that we sell. So as you said, Jordan, that dovetails into what we've already executed on in the east. We brought in some anchors. We really want to start driving ROI. That dovetails into being limited on the capacity in the Bay Area and frankly in LA, that's pretty much all we've been doing for quite some time, are those smaller and mid-sized transactions. With that orientation, with the eastern region, Virginia and New York with anchor leases in there, with limited inventory in the Bay Area, I would be surprised if we sold as much square footage volume in 2015 as we done 2014. But I would say, we're very focused on working to maintain the rate of earnings growth of the company. You can see, just the math of our industry, a 20% increase in ARPU can point toward a 40% increase in adjusted EBITDA per unit of capital deployed. So we're very focused on that relationship and we'll work hard during the year to take advantage of where we stand and our ability to increase ROI. I hope that's helpful.
Jordan Sadler: It is. As a follow-up and this is implicit in some of your comments in that you look to maintain the growth, is that while you may sign less square footage this year, it's safe to assume that your optimism and the comments surrounding the momentum into 2015 and that the revenue signed or the rent signed in 2015 could potentially meet or exceed what you did in 2014?
Tom Ray: I wouldn't say that. Frankly, that would surprise me if that happened, but the rate of growth of earnings - distributable cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, we're going to work hard to continue to drive that - but our objective, you will see in our objective for the year is to continue to drive that with fewer square feet and kilowatts sold and that will speak to likely a lower growth in rent, that's not to be unexpected. Don't it expect to be dramatic, but the fundamental message is, it would be natural for folks to look at CoreSite's year this year and say, they got sales running again, Q4 finished out really strongly in TKD sales, are we going to see a 5% or 10% growth rate on that in terms of rents sold and top-line revenue and we're saying no. We could, but I would be very surprised.
Jordan Sadler: What was the nature of the accelerating momentum comment then? What is that focused on? Is that EBITDA and cash flow and distributable--?
Tom Ray: Exactly. It's the bottom line. And again, our--
Jordan Sadler: That's all we care about.
Tom Ray: Yes. And especially related to how many capital dollars we consume to drive it. We're very focused on that relationship.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut: I thought the chart, Jeff that you provided on the breakdown of revenue from different customer verticals was interesting and I was wondering if you could give us a little perspective on that, because it's a new chart and maybe a year-over-year. Which verticals was the growth really coming from and will we see a notable change in the percent of revenue driven from those particular groups? In particular, I would love to get an update on your progress in building incremental on-ramps to some of the cloud service provider platforms? Thanks.
Jeff Finnin: On page 17 in the supplementals, which you are referring to and historically we have provided the breakout on a vertical basis, simply based on the number of customers we've had. So as we continued to receive questions, we thought this would be helpful in terms of the rent associated with each of the verticals. In terms of where has it changed as compared to 12 months ago, really where it has increased and I wouldn't say it's enormous, but where it has increased is really the work around networks and cloud. What that's driven by is again the sales execution during the year in terms of that being our two best verticals for the year, as Tom indicated in his prepared comments and so that's really where you saw some of the increase year-over-year.
Tom Ray: On the forward, you might see 2015 revenue, new-build revenue sold to the cloud and the content, go down a little bit from where it was in 2014 and some of the other areas go up. I would say I wouldn't expect network and mobility to change a ton. It could be that other - that the share of other enterprise gets a little bit larger relative to cloud and that really circles back to some of the larger deals we did in 2014. Sometimes the cloud and the content verticals take down bigger slugs of space. So if you're - if your leasing orientation for a coming year is to decelerate around that, you might see a deceleration in booked revenue in those two verticals. I hope that helps.
Jonathan Schildkraut: It certainly does. If I can ask a second question, just in terms of looking at the cash flow statement and the guidance for 2015, the guidance is better than we anticipated on the EBITDA side and FFO side and at the same time, capital is coming in a little bit lower. So we see a pathway here that the company will generate positive free cash flow. It's the first time, based on our model and while dividends are still going to be a drag on cash, as we think about the company's need for incremental financing, given this important inflection in the year is there any incremental commentary you can give us? Thanks.
Jeff Finnin: Yes. Jonathan, first and foremost as you look at our guidance and what we've laid out from a capital expenditure standpoint, given the liquidity we have and the capacity in our revolver, we've clearly got the liquidity to fund the business plan for the year. Having said that, we continue to look at the market and where rates are and the pricing of our instruments that we have in place and to see whether or not we can provide any incremental value by modifying those. As we look out into 2015, similar to what we've done in previous years, we would probably look to term out some portion of our debt. The only question is associated with how much and what type of instrument to use. As you know, we like to maintain as much flexibility in our capital structure as possible and obviously, that weighs in terms of what that decision ultimately would be. The timing of it obviously is uncertain at this point, but it's something we're watching closely and ultimately working internally and with our Board to figure out exactly what that next step looks like.
Tom Ray: Jon, I also want to circle back. I half-answered your first question and I want to ensure clarity to the extent I can around our view of leasing and sales in 2016, among the verticals. I said, the revenue sold into the cloud into the content may decline as a percent to total new revenue sold in the year, but again, that is because of the very small number of larger deals. Our focus and the part that I didn't answer as you asked about on ramps and our activity around that area - our focus is to increase the number of new leases signed in - certainly in the cloud vertical and perhaps also in the content vertical. That's really focused on these on ramps. We have attractive penetration among one of the leading public cloud providers. We have very attractive penetration among private clouds stood up through SIs and MSPs that are in a hybrid architecture with the public cloud. We're later in the game as you're very well aware with a couple of the other larger or what we expect to be larger public cloud providers. Some of those providers are later in the game, as well, but we're optimistic that in the year ahead, we'll start to see movement around those, while we also further our relationship and the on ramps with the leading group we're with right now. So we're very focused on driving not only the switch component of getting onto the cloud, but also the higher-value cashing component. We're just not super focused on trying to do longer-term storage. So I hope that color helps to give insight into how we're thinking about what we're trying to get done.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: So coming back to Tom's earlier comments about square feet sold, kilowatts sold, was interested is it competitive factors in the markets where you operate or just the contour of overall demand that led to you make those observations? And then was interested also in the occupancy analysis and maybe your new disclosure addresses some of this, but it looks like percentage occupancy in Chicago and New York has decreased. I just want to be clear of the reasons for that? Thanks.
Tom Ray: The first question Jon, are you saying, hey, Tom, you've said probably leased fewer square feet in kilowatts maybe this year than last year and more color around that? Is that the question?
Jonathan Atkin: Yes.
Tom Ray: It's not because of market dynamics. Again, I would expect rents to increase in most of the markets in which we compete. It's really because of how we're focused on running our business this year. Really that's no different than it has been for many years on the trail. We just hope that folks remember, 1 year, 1.5 years ago we said, we'll probably add a couple of large wholesale deals into the mix because on an IRR basis we think that's smart math on new big developments. Really what's underpinning my comments about the forward is we've accomplished that, so now we don't plan on - and those deals were done at lower ARPU and lower ROI than what I think of as our more day in and day out core business. So we're going to work hard this year to do less of those and more of the more profitable core business. But we see the market opportunity mainly getting better and as you have hopefully known from us for a long time, with regard to wholesale, we really hit the wholesale market for two reasons. One is IRR math around new developments and the other is spot market, opportunistic pricing. If we see significant spikes, we'll go hit that spot market, but the core of what we work to accomplish day in and day out is this higher value, higher ARPU component and we just expect that to be a greater portion of the sales in 2015.
Jeff Finnin: Jonathan, on your questions about Chicago and New York, when you look at Chicago quarter-over-quarter, the occupancy percentage actually has increased slightly. What you might be referring to in terms of occupied square feet actually came down. The reason for that, we had a customer that exited a part of a floor there in our data center and that floor has now been put into redevelopment. So you see that on the construction under development tables back on page 20 in our supplemental. So that space is being redeveloped and we'll put it back into our operating portfolio as soon as it gets completed. In terms of New York, we had a customer move out and that impacted our occupancy negatively for the quarter. Obviously, we're working to backfill that particular space at this point in time.
Tom Ray: I would say in New York, the move-out was about 2700 feet, between 2000 and 3000 feet at NY1. What we've seen during this year at NY1 is more and more transaction and more of the stuff we really want moving into that. In a year to trade out one 2000- to 3000 foot requirement and put in eight, 10, 15 more valuable ones, we like that trade, but that's what happened in New York, is we had to move out of a larger requirement.
Jonathan Atkin: And then on the lease expirations, you had the schedule for 2015 through 2017. Does anything jump out? Is it a lot of smaller leases or are there any years in which you're more indexed towards major or larger expirations occurring?
Jeff Finnin: Jonathan, obviously we gave some color around 2015 and that is obviously the area that we went into some granularity around. The only other thing you can think about is when you look out into 2016, you do have that customer at SB3 that ultimately will leave the premises there at SB3 and that is the space that has been backfilled, at least one-half of it at this point in time and we're working to solve for the rest of it. Keep that in mind, as you look through. That may drive the churn up, but keep in mind, as Tom mentioned, a large part of that has already been backfilled from a cash standpoint.
Jonathan Atkin: And then finally, the metered tower mix growing this year in terms of new business, is that just a reflection of the VA2 situation and therefore it would be weighted more towards 2Q, 3Q, 4Q or are there other dynamics going on?
Tom Ray: It's really three locations and a small number of deals. It all points to, in 2014 we did a handful of larger deals more than we usually do, so there's the large lease at VA2, the anchor lease, there's also the collection of mid-sized but metered leases at NY2 and then there's a larger backfill inside SB3. So you have a fair amount of metered activity among that group. The backfill in SB3 isn't - it's a metered deal replacing a metered deal, but on the east coast, in NY2 and VA2, just a significantly greater proportion of metered deals than is our norm in a typical year. You'll see that power come in the income statement this year, so you will see that dynamic. We expect to do a greater proportion of breakered deals or of smaller deals this year, new signings and we expect to see that come back into the income statement beginning in 2016. Hopefully that helps.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Emmanuel Korchman: Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned continuing to focus on simplifying the sales and marketing platform and that contributing to a lower expense run-rate there. Could you elaborate on what you mean by simplifying? Is it less heads? Is it a more a focused ask of each person working within that platform? Is it different incentives, depending on what type of leases they're doing?
Jeff Finnin: Emmanuel, I will give you some color around that and Tom can add to it, as well. But in general it is making sure that our productivity is increasing and productivity increasing goes to the standpoint, a little bit about what Tom comment on his comments around is streamlining, decision-making and making sure that we're as efficient and effective as possible there. The only thing I would had is that, as you saw, as a percentage of revenue come down a little bit in the quarter, we do expect it to go up a little bit as we've been adding some heads and we just didn't get them added in the fourth quarter, but they've come on here early in Q1 of this year. So expect that to come up around 5% to 5.5%, is what we guided to.
Tom Ray: We had positions [inaudible] and we did eliminate a few positions in 2014 really just to reduce the extent to which people were bumping into each other and to create a leaner operating environment and quicker decision-making. We're just fundamentally pleased that some pretty minor adjustments around those things has helped contribute to significantly greater sales. It's just communication, making communication simpler.
Emmanuel Korchman: Tom, in the past you have talked about how built out that organization is from a revenue production standpoint versus an expense load perspective, is the easiest way to think about it. Where would you say that is right now?
Tom Ray: We're pretty close to equilibrium, Emmanuel. Any given month, you might have more churn among quota-bearing positions. I don't think we've had that in the last month or two but it will oscillate over the coming year, but where we stand right now is pretty close to equilibrium. I would say that our view of compensation to the sales team and our view of measuring productivity among that team is a deeper view now than it was a year ago. A year ago, that view really stopped at the ARPU or the GAAP rent line and now we're really focused on exactly what we described a few minutes ago and that is the distributable profit to the investor related to sales force activity. So we're measuring that relationship and we're defining productivity based on that metric and we believe that we can continue to get better.
Emmanuel Korchman: Maybe another one for Jeff, it looks like some space came out of your office and light-industrial pool, but it doesn't look like that's had a major hit on rent, in 2014 nor in your guidance. How should we think about maybe what's going on in that bucket in 2015 and also do you plan to - you gave a new expiration schedule here for the office and light-industrial space, do you plan to renew those as they come due or are those all going to roll back into the development pool?
Jeff Finnin: At least in terms of what happened in the quarter, Emmanuel, we had a particular customer that was leasing one of our light-industrial buildings out on our Santa Clara campus and that customer's lease came to an end about midway through the fourth quarter. So at this point in time, that particular light-industrial building is vacant. It's similar to what we had to do when we ultimately ended up building SV5 which was to make sure that our customers are out of there so at some point we can tear down the building and get it ready for future development. That's what happened in the quarter. That's really what happened in terms of the OLI life of the space for the quarter. In terms of going forward, the important thing is when you look at ultimately the remaining square feet that exists inside that office portfolio, you will see that the lion's share of that is office portfolio at SV1. That particular space is leased on a long-term basis to a governmental entity and so that's not going to change at any point in the near-term. So give that some thought in terms of as you guys look at the office. Hopefully that helps.
Tom Ray: As Jeff said, as to that OLI building, the light-industrial building on the Santa Clara campus, we don't expect to attempt to re-lease that. It's available to be repurposed into a data center and the timing and the certainty of that is a discussion point, not decided, but we don't expect, within our guidance and within 2015, to rush out to market and try and backfill that with an industrial tenant.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Colby Synesael: Two questions, if I may. It seems like from an industry perspective there is an increasing focus on customers going to metered pricing as opposed to breakered. While I recognize that the company is going to focus more on smaller deals in 2015 versus 2014, can you just give us some color on where you think the line is in the sand these days in terms of customers who are still comfortable going to breakered power versus metered and maybe how that's been changing over time? And then the second question, as relates to 2016, which I recognize is obviously still a long ways out, but considering the planning process that's required to put new space on-line, how can we think about some things that might not be coming in guidance whether it's potential land purchases, M&A, you just talked about, for example, potentially reformatting some of your office space. How are you guys thinking about that right now, whether it's based on specific cities where you think you will need space or just more broadly how you are thinking about how you solve for that? Thanks.
Tom Ray: As to the latter, you look at the four priorities that we laid out for our capital and we just expect to honor that sequencing. So in markets where we have sold successfully and we could generate attractive returns on capital, if we're out or about to be out, those are the areas where we're discussing how to approach that. Is it a new building, how else do we think about those? We're not going to talk about exactly what we may or may not do until we've made decisions, but the guiding principles are firmly established in the four categories of capital priority and then you match that against our property table and say, where have they been successful and where do they seem to not have a lot left? And then we rank these different priorities and make decisions, but we can't point to any specifics until we make decisions. We haven't done that yet. What was the first question?
Jeff Finnin: Metered versus breakered.
Tom Ray: Metered versus breakered, at a high level, the industry seems to have settled in reasonably well around 130 kilowatts and smaller, tend to have a much greater percentage of non-metered pricing models or power pricing models. And then you have that 130 to 250 where there's a lot of hybrid models. There are draw-cap models, other pricing models that are hybrids between metered and breakered and that hybrid model sometimes reaches up close to 500 kilowatts. Above 500 kilowatts, it is predominantly a traditionally metered market. So one of the things for us is to - we hope we have studied very carefully the hybrid models and the kinds of customers and the kinds of customer deployments where it might be more attractive for us to sell under a hybrid model versus the kinds of customers and deployments where it's unattractive to us to sell into a hybrid model. So we just - it's all mathematics and we just try to have good statistical data, analyze it and then be thoughtful about our go-to-market approach around those things. But that's how we see it. We see 130 and below pretty much breakered, 130 to 250, hybrid and above 500, almost always metered.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Barry McCarver with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
Barry McCarver: You got most of them already covered. Back on the discussion around M&A, you talked about that internationally, but what about consolidation here in the U.S. some. We still have a pretty good number of mid and large providers with some unique footprints. Your thoughts on what we could see here this year or next?
Tom Ray: Over the very long haul, consolidation among providers is probably a healthy thing and maybe a natural outcome over a long period of time, but you also have different social dynamics going on and different multiples. It's very hard to determine what's going to happen among publics over the next year or two, that story might take longer to play out. Who knows? There are private assets that I think will come to market and you will see different among the publics going after those private assets. But even there, that the publics now have a pretty good view of what fits for them and there's, at least for us, we think there's a fairly logical outcome among some of the private assets and where those end up has more to do with the timing than anything else.
Barry McCarver: Okay. And then, Tom, you said in your prepared remarks that without that large wholesale customer in the quarter, average rental rates would have been above the previous 12 month average?
Tom Ray: Yes.
Barry McCarver: Can you give us an idea - can you give a little more color about exactly how much higher?
Tom Ray: I can't. We really want to but if we get specific then that leads to back solving into the VA lease and we're just prohibited from doing that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Heinz: I was just hoping to get back to your commentary around the composition of cloud and content bookings in the current year and your focus on signing a higher number of smaller-sized deals. Was just hoping to get some detail around the application or workload type you be targeting as compared to last couple of years and is that really more of a function of some demand shift you're seeing or is that something that's more strategic on your end?
Tom Ray: It's really what we're trying to get done. And it's the timing of when some of the other - what we think will be larger public clouds. Some of those organizations are going to be coming to market with more on-ramps and as such more caching in 2015 than the market saw in 2014. So we would like to grab our share of that and we think that will be greater than it was last year. So as to the larger, longer-term storage component of those companies' architectures, we did more of that in 2014 than we expect to 2015.
Matthew Heinz: And then just a follow-up. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how your same-store MRR per cab breaks down by its component, maybe in terms of the base co-lo rents versus the newer fiber connectivity and then the legacy copper connectivity?
Tom Ray: The best place to take it is right off the income statement. You've got data center revenues and you've got interconnection revenues.
Jeff Finnin: That's representative of what it is, Matt. When you look at, overall, when you look at the growth associated with the dollars year-over-year, I can tell that you roughly 75% of that growth is coming from our increase in power revenue and increase in interconnect business. In terms of the individual components, it's consistent with what you see on the income statement.
Tom Ray: To that, we've seen nice growth in MRR per cab over the last couple of years. Getting back to what we communicated about a greater proportion of metered power coming into the income statement in 2015 than the historical norm, you will see that MRR per cab growth slow down or - I don't know if it will flat-line for a Q. It is going to slow down, because of this metered dynamic and because of these larger deals with lower rent. You will see that moderate in 2015 and if we execute what we plan to execute in terms of new sales in 2015, we would expect to move that up at a faster rate beginning next year.
Matthew Heinz: Right, I was getting at the flattish nature of the MRR this quarter on a sequential basis. We've seen a trend of pretty steady quarter-over-quarter increases in that number and I was just wondering if - obviously the power dynamics have a lot to do with that, but I was wondering if there's anything else you are seeing in terms of conversions. I didn't notice that you gave us the fiber volume numbers this quarter in the prepared comments. Did I miss that?
Tom Ray: I thought we did. If we failed to, we'll certainly update those next quarter. There is no - the trend around fiber growth has been favorable.
Jeff Finnin: It's been consistent with what we saw in the previous quarters as well, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Tayo Okusanya: Most of my questions have been answered. Gentlemen, in light of what happened at DFT this quarter and the unpleasant surprise of a tenant basically now not paying rent, just wanted to ask questions about your overall tenant roster, whether there was anyone on your watch list, where over the next six to 12 months, you do have some concern about that company's viability, that maybe we should know about sooner than later?
Tom Ray: Not really. To the extent we have any views around that, it's reflected in the churn guidance and in the churn discussion around those three dynamics. We've got an enterprise in LA. We've got maybe the opportunity at some point during the year in SB3 and then you have a content person re-architecting to some extent, that's it. I just look at this dynamic as real estate 101. Look, there are times when just credit tenancies are fortresses in terms of churn. There are times when heavily, heavily multi-tenanted buildings with a good diverse rent roll are steadier. I'm not suggesting one business model is better than the other. I'm just saying those are both ways of managing disruption and our business model speaks to lots of customers, lots of leases, heavily, heavily multi-tenanted and that's another way of managing churn and disruption. So to the extent we think there's any out there, we've disclosed it on this call.
Tayo Okusanya: And then again, while I know on a near-term basis you guys are definitely focused on the markets you are already in and expanding those assets, I'm just curious with many of your other peers operating in, quote unquote, Tier 2 market, how attractive you find some of those Tier 2 marks whether a little bit, not at all?
Tom Ray: Tayo, I would just fit into it those four priorities and that would be in bucket number four.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Bejjani with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
John Bejjani: Most of my questions have been answered but just wanted to ask about G&A. In your guidance you've got a growing 10% year-over-year. Can you just offer some color as to what is driving the increase?
Tom Ray: Yes, large top-line growth. G&A is growing much more slowly than revenue and much more slowly than profit, but our business is still growing rapidly and you are going to see some G&A growth. The math says the G&A is getting more and more efficient every year, but as long as we keep growing, you will probably continue to see some growth in G&A. Our job is just to make that growth at a lower rate.
John Bejjani: Yes, I just figured most of the - as you guys grow, a lot of this would be at the sales and marketing level as opposed to corporate level, so just hence my question?
Jeff Finnin: Just in general, John, as Tom mentioned, continuing to grow some level of G&A at a much slower pace than what the top line is growing at is obviously something we continue to watch and it's really just necessitated on incremental individuals we need to support the office and to make sure we're supporting the go-to-mark platform, that's really what's driving that. They're not enormous increases in headcount, but there are obviously some amount in order to make sure that we're giving them the support they need as they go out and execute.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Thomas Ray for closing remarks.
Tom Ray: Thank you. Well, we want to say thanks to the investment community and to our Board and for everybody for helping make 2014 a great year and giving us optimism for running a better business, doing more with an investor's dollar of capital in 2015 than we did in 2014 and continuing to grow. More than anything, I want to also say thanks to the employees at CoreSite. People have worked incredibly hard. We've been through a lot of change and we've just gotten better and better and that's because of the heart and soul and hard work of the people, so thank you there as well. We're all going to continue to work hard to serve our investors. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Derek McCandless, General Counsel for CoreSite Realty Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Derek S. McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'll discuss highlights of our financial results, review our sales results for the third quarter, update our view of market conditions and provide insight into our view of our near-term growth opportunities. Jeff will then present a detailed review of our financial results and balance sheet position, and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The third quarter reflected continued execution and ongoing momentum throughout the organization, resulting in solid revenue and earnings growth. Total operating revenue increased 16% year-over-year, led by another quarter of 20% plus growth in interconnection revenue, coupled with 17% growth in power revenue. Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $32.9 million reflects a 20% increase year-over-year, while our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 46.6%. Q3 FFO per share and unit increased 17% year-over-year to $0.55. Regarding new and expansion TKD sales. In Q3, we executed 118 leases, representing annualized GAAP rental revenue of $7.6 million. This was comprised of approximately 54,000 square feet, at an average GAAP rental rate of $141 per square foot. This GAAP rental rate on new and expansion leases is in line with our trailing 12-month average. Third quarter sales were well distributed amongst smaller and midsized leases, with spot [ph] and midsized leases exceeding 2,000 square feet, and no lease exceeding 1 megawatt of power capacity. Driven by the execution of midsized leases, our average lease size executed in Q3 was 459 square feet compared to the trailing 12-month average lease size of 309 square feet. Regarding the geographic distribution of sales in the third quarter. Our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases were Silicon Valley, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. In the New York market, and more specifically NY2, we were pleased to see the funnel activity we discussed with you last quarter convert into executed leases in Q3. Specifically, we executed 5 new and expansion leases at NY2, including what we believe is a valuable midsized lease with a leading global network service provider. With this leasing, as of the end of Q3, we were approximately 60% leased in Phase 1 of NY2. In Northern Virginia, where we expect to deliver our VA2 facility into service this quarter, we continue to see healthy demand activity as it relates to both available capacity of VA1 and the capacity under construction at VA2. As we shared with you in the past, we are looking to maximize occupancy at VA1 in anticipation of delivering the first phase of TKD capacity at VA2. To that goal, in Q3, we executed 10 new and expansion leases at VA1 as we work to fill in the smaller spaces that remain in the building. As of the end of Q3, we had approximately 50,000 square feet available for lease at VA1 comprised of a range of products from a single cabinet up to 14,000 contiguous square feet. Turning to the performance of our verticals. Our network and cloud verticals together accounted for 68 new and expansion leases in the third quarter, correlating to 58% of leases and 38% of annualized GAAP rent signed, as we continue to focus on enhancing our portfolio of network-dense, cloud-enabled data centers. Our digital content vertical was strong again in Q3, representing 20% of leases signed and 50% of the annualized GAAP rent. Further, in the third quarter, we added 39 new logos to our customer base, with particular strength across the network, enterprise and cloud verticals. Regarding our interconnection product line. In the third quarter, we continued to see solid performance in net additions of fiber cross connections, with particular strength in Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia. Across the company, fiber cross-connect volume increased 20% year-over-year, with total interconnections growing by 11%. Both statistics reflect small increases over our trailing rates of growth. Regarding sales staffing. We are now substantially staffed, taking into account normal churn in terms of frontline reps onboard with the company. We believe that our execution in meeting our goals with regard to sales staffing reflects enhanced focus upon the fundamentals of running our business, and the greater simplicity that focus brings. Related, we've also seen improvements in sales productivity, as new hires ramped into their established quotas. Looking more broadly at our efforts to simplify our business and increase the productivity of our sales and marketing teams, we're pleased with our progress thus far this year. Specifically, over the first 3 quarters of 2014, our average quarterly sales in terms of annualized GAAP rent from new and expansion leases represents a 60% increase over our 2013 quarterly average, and is approximately double our average over the second half of 2013. Turning now to our view of the markets. Our outlook is substantially consistent with what we discussed last quarter. We've seen a pickup in demand activity in the New York, New Jersey market, although there remains a large supply of available capacity in that market. We are seeing rents solidify in the Bay Area as sublease space has been absorbed and demand has remained robust. The downtown Chicago market is exhibiting increasing rents as near-term supply remained somewhat limited. We continue to see Los Angeles, Boston and Miami as substantially consistent with last year. We've been more optimistic regarding the Northern Virginia market in recent quarters as our analysis of the market continues to suggest that available inventory could be absorbed by current demand in the market. While we've yet to see large leases executed to backfill sublease space in the market, market data suggests that larger leases may be executed in the fourth quarter. We will continually watch for contractual absorption of this sublease capacity. As we look ahead, we believe we continue to have a strong opportunity to drive internal growth from our current portfolio. Related, we currently plan to construct additional capacity in existing facilities in 5 of our markets over the coming year. Specifically, we anticipate building additional TKD capacity in each of Boston 1, which is now in preconstruction, Denver 1, Chicago 1, New York 2 and Virginia 2 by the end of 2015. Our plans for these projects total 130,000 square feet of additional capacity at an aggregate incremental cost of approximately $50 million to $60 million, correlating to a range of $380 to $460 per square foot. This reflects our ability to leverage off of existing core and shell infrastructure, and we believe enables us to drive premium returns on capital from these projects. Our ability to continue to grow our company at cost bases that we believe are attractive highlights the value of the growth opportunity embedded in our platform. Specifically, in total, we believe that we have the ability to more than double the amount of sold net rentable square footage in our portfolio solely from land and buildings we currently own, and in aggregate, at a cost basis that we believe will be highly attractive. In particular, we believe we have created significant embedded value at NY2 and VA2. We estimate that together, these 2 facilities enable us to build an additional 20 to 25 megawatts of salable capacity, with an associated investment of between $90 million and $120 million of incremental capital, all at highly attractive yields on incremental investment. We believe that our opportunities at NY2 and VA2 are augmented by our opportunities at our Coronado campus in Santa Clara, where we are currently entitled to build an additional 311,000 square feet. At LA2, where we can construct an additional 200,000 square feet. In Boston 1, where we can develop an incremental 73,000 square feet, in addition to the 15,000 square feet now under construction. We continue to evaluate the timing and associated capital requirements associated with these follow-on investment opportunities, with our next phase of construction at each location to be determined over the coming year as we lease up existing capacity. Further, even though we plan to construct additional capacity at Chicago 1 over the coming year, based upon trailing sales in our current funnel, we anticipate that our inventory availability will become constrained in Chicago over the next 12 to 18 months. As such, we will evaluate potential next steps in the Chicago market as we assess our broader strategic and growth plans, all relative to the strong internal growth opportunity inside our existing asset base. As always, we remain focused upon driving occupancy in our available TKD space, which, including the 3 megawatts to be delivered at VA2 by the end of this year, represents 21% of our current portfolio. In addition, we will continue to work to increase revenue and cash flows from currently leased capacity as we look to increase interconnection and breakered power revenue inside our current footprint. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q3 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development activity. Third, I will provide an update regarding our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And fourth, I will update our outlook on guidance for the full year. Our third quarter data center revenues were $68.5 million, a 7.5% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 16.7% increase over the prior year quarter. Our third quarter data center revenue consisted of $57 million in rental and power revenue, up 6.5% sequentially and 15.4% year-over-year; $9.2 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 6.7% sequentially and 23.2% year-over-year; and $2.3 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million, substantially consistent with the previous quarters. Q3 lease commencements represented $6.1 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue, comprised of approximately 45,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rental rate of $135 per square foot. Renewals in the third quarter totaled approximately 55,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rental rate of $219 per square foot, and represented mark-to-market rent growth of 3% and 10.6% on a cash and GAAP basis respectively. We continue to expect full year cash rent growth in the range of 1% to 4%. Churn in the third quarter declined to 1.2%, in line with our expectations of 1% to 2% per quarter. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $9.2 million, and $11.9 million on a cash basis. We expect approximately 45% of the current GAAP backlog to commence by the end of the first quarter of 2015, with another approximately 25% commencing through the end of 2015. If you recall, there was roughly 30% of the backlog associated with a new lease at SV3, which is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016, coinciding with the surrender of the space by our customer that is currently occupying the computer room. Our third quarter FFO was $0.55 per diluted share and unit, an increase of 17% year-over-year and an increase of 7.8% sequentially when adjusting for the previously disclosed onetime items realized in Q2. Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $32.9 million reflects an increase of 19.6% year-over-year and an increase of 8.1% sequentially, again, when adjusting for the previously disclosed onetime items recognized in Q2. In the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points year-over-year to 46.6%. This represents Q3 annualized revenue growth flow-through to adjusted EBITDA of 55% year-over-year. As part of our 2012 acquisition of Confluent, the former Confluent owner was entitled to earn payments associated with CoreSite entering into new customer contracts and renewing and expanding existing contracts during the period beginning upon the date of acquisition and ending on an agreed-upon calculation date of January 1, 2015. During the third quarter, we agreed to accelerate the calculation date to September 1, 2014, and discharge the remaining payment obligations. As a result, in the third quarter, we made a payment of $9.3 million to the former Confluent owner associated with the above-referenced agreement, of which $8.1 million is a reduction in year-to-date AFFO, with the remaining $1.2 million reflected in our Q4 2013 results. We do not anticipate making any further payments associated with this agreement. Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter totaled $3.8 million, approximately 5.4% of total operating revenues, down slightly compared to last quarter. We expect sales and marketing expenses for the full year to be approximately 5.5% to 6% of total operating revenues. Our third quarter G&A expenses totaled $7.1 million, correlating to 10.1% of total revenues, in line with the previous quarter. We expect G&A expenses to be approximately 11% of revenue for the full year. As shown on Page 18 of our supplemental, we spent and expensed $2.2 million during the third quarter related to ongoing repairs and maintenance, relatively in line with the average amount spent over the trailing 12-month period. As of September 30, 2014, our stabilized operating data center portfolio was 86.4% occupied. Including leases executed at the end of Q3 but not yet commenced, our stabilized data center occupancy rate would be 88.9%. Including pre-stabilized space, our total data center portfolio was 81.2% occupied at quarter end. I will now discuss our recently completed and ongoing development activity across the portfolio. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are encouraged by our leasing activity at NY2, with Phase 1 approximately 60% leased as of the end of the third quarter. Specifically at NY2, we currently have $43.6 million on our balance sheet as completed turnkey data center capacity, plus $65.6 million as construction in process related to the core and shell space in which we have the opportunity to develop incremental turnkey data center capacity. Regarding VA2, at the end of Q3, we carried $74.9 million of construction in process related to the asset. And we anticipate investing an incremental $5.1 million in the fourth quarter to complete Phase 1, comprised of the core and shell plus 3 megawatts of turnkey data center capacity. As we have previously discussed, as we complete development projects, we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. As a reminder, we have a included the percentage of gross interest capitalized on Page 20 of the supplemental. Turning to our balance sheet. We remain focused upon maintaining the liquidity and available capital to support our growth and fund investment opportunities, and we believe we are well-positioned to execute in that regard. Specifically, as of September 30, 2014, our ratio of debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.3x. Including preferred stock, our ratio was 3.2x, with approximately 1.6 turns related to fixed rate debt plus preferred stock and 1.6 turns related to variable rate debt. We continue to target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4x. As of September 30, 2014, we had $205 million drawn on our credit facility, with approximately $192 million of available capacity. Finally, excluding these previously disclosed onetime items, we are increasing our guidance for FFO per diluted share and unit to a range of $2.12 to $2.16 from the previous range of $2.07 to $2.15. Including the onetime items, the updated 2014 guidance of FFO per diluted share and unit is $2.16 to $2.20. As we discussed last quarter, our non-real estate depreciation expense increased by approximately $600,000 sequentially in the third quarter, due to the accelerated depreciation of certain IT systems. Over the next 3 quarters, we expect an incremental expense of $400,000 to $500,000 per quarter, resulting in total non-real estate depreciation of approximately $2.5 million per quarter through the second quarter of 2015. After which, we expect this to normalize at approximately $1 million to $1.5 million per quarter. We will provide further detail when we issue our 2015 guidance with fourth quarter earnings. When excluding the net $0.04 benefit from the true-up of real estate taxes in the second quarter and the impairment charges recorded through the first half of the year, the midpoint of our new guidance is $2.14 per share and unit. The $0.03 increase in organic guidance reflects our expectation for increased revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the remainder of the year. We now expect total operating revenues of $268 million to $272 million compared to the previous range of $265 million to $270 million. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $129 million to $133 million compared to the previous range of $127 million to $132 million. A detailed summary of all 2014 guidance items can be found on Page 21 of the earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we've discussed today. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
Jonathan Atkin: So a couple of questions for Jeff, and then maybe one for Tom. The guidance, you lowered the top end of guidance for data center revenues, but then your overall EBITDA guidance is higher. So I wondered if you can kind of take us through what's driving that? And then cross-connect, as a portion of incremental revenue, seemed to have dropped a bit from the prior quarter. And is there going to be some lumpiness around that metric? Or is there a normalized trend to think about in terms of cross-connect or interconnect growth?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Hey, Jon. 2 things in response to your questions, I guess. In terms of the guidance revenue, if you look at our revenue guidance for total revenue, as well as our data center revenue, if you look at the midpoints of those 2 numbers today, that difference is about $8 million, which is where it should be and in line with what we believe it will end up. When we gave previous guidance earlier this year, that difference was only $5 million, and it should have been corrected. And this quarter, we corrected that to make sure it was in line with where we need the -- where we think it's going to be coming out.
Thomas M. Ray: I can pick up the cross-connect thing for a second. Jon, it's Tom. I think what you'll see is that cross-connect growth relative to our base of installed smaller transactions remains very, very steady. And the oscillation of cross-connect revenue toward new bookings and total new signed revenue really turns on how much activity we have in larger deals. So the core of the cross-connect business relative to the business that generates those cross-connects is remarkably consistent. And in quarters where we signed more larger deals, then cross-connect revenue, as a percent of what got signed, will be smaller. And in quarters where we signed fewer big deals, that ratio will go up.
Jonathan Atkin: Great. And then the mix of metered versus breakered-amp power, how is that trending sequentially? And then, I guess, my final question for Tom mainly would be that you talked about embedded value in both NY2 and VA2, but really down to Virginia for a moment. What is it that makes the VA2 an attractive site versus some of the Ashburn-based competitors?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, I mean, I think the value in VA2 sits in the network density and the cloud density at VA1, so the buildings are physically connected. And so the 6 years of building a good business inside our Virginia campus adds that value to VA2. I mean, it's the same as VA1. So we -- we've delivered a new building or we're delivering a new building on top of an existing, very healthy, very connected business. What was the other part of the question, Jon?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Metered versus breakered.
Thomas M. Ray: Metered versus breakered. I don't know if we...
Jeffrey S. Finnin: We have not -- Jon, we have not typically disclosed what that number is. Historically, what we've guided people towards is when you look at our lease distribution table in our supplemental, typically those breakered revenue models will be in existence in our smaller deployments. And when you look at those deployments that we have today that are less than 5,000 square feet, that equals about 50% of our annualized rent. It gives you some guideline in terms of what that is today.
Thomas M. Ray: I'd look it up very much like cross-connects, Jon. If you look at our -- if you go to the lease distribution table and look at the smaller leases, I think our experience this year is that the breakered revenue, in our cost structure associated with that revenue within those small leases, has remained very consistent. No real changes. And in quarters where we signed more larger deals, you'll find a greater mix of metered power in those quarters.
Jonathan Atkin: And my last question is just new market expansion. There's a couple of thoughts on the map where they're very well-established or emerging or increasing in importance from a colo and retail standpoint. Dallas and Pacific Northwest kind of stand out. And where do you kind of stand on potential new market entry?
Thomas M. Ray: No real change. Anything you've heard from us over the years, Jon, we -- we value our equity very, very dearly. So we look at our near-term expansion as opportunities that are funded by debt are more attractive, and opportunities to invest where we already have a book of business. And we have turned investing in depth rather than breadth. Opportunities to invest where we already have a book of business, we already have boots in the ground, we already have good visibility, we have scale. And as such, we have lower expenses for follow-on investment. That's our top priority. And the other -- the component for us is we don't feel a need to get into new markets. It would be nice over time, but there's no pressure here. We have a nationwide platform, a couple of limited dots that we're not in. We don't think that impacts us from a competitive positioning perspective to land the best business in North America. So we'll go where it's smart, when it's smart. We don't feel any pressure to do anything. And generally speaking, we still favor depth over breadth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.
Jordan Sadler: Question on the sales organization, Tom. Can you maybe talk about the progress that you've made in the third quarter and just year-to-date? And if you're content with sort of the productivity you're seeing and how ramped we are overall? And then maybe the momentum you see into the fourth quarter?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure. Look, I think what we've -- this year, we've just been doing what we said we were going to do, nothing beyond that. We had strong objectives for the year. We wanted to move sales up quite significantly. And again, they're running at a 60% or greater quarterly pace on new and expansion rents signed compared to all of last year. And last year trailed down, so we're running almost double the rate average this year over the second half of last year. So we were pleased with the -- with what we view as a very strong turn. So we're pleased with the trajectory. And we are, by no means, content with the position. We believe we can do better. And we are just focused on getting stronger every quarter. So that's our goal. We've identified a couple of areas where we think we can get stronger as a company, and we'll have to see how that plays out over the quarters ahead. So I would view us as on track. And as we say here at CoreSite, we remain privileged to have more good work to do.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that's helpful. Are there additional bodies that needed -- need to be added to explore these additional areas of opportunity? Or you've got the bandwidth internally? And just on the momentum, you still feel good seasonally as you set up into the fourth quarter? Or just overall dynamic. You touched on a couple markets, but I guess I'm thinking a little bigger picture.
Thomas M. Ray: Sure. We don't expect to spend materially more dollars on field reps and sales next year than the run rate currently, that will go up a little bit but not dramatically. And I think in terms of momentum going into Q4, I guess I would answer it similarly to with what I've answered about breakered and interconnection. There's a kind of a fundamental book of business that is -- has become more predictable and larger this year, and we feel pretty good about that repeating. And then, in our business model, there is -- there are those larger transactions that lay on top of that. And it's very difficult to predict those from quarter-to-quarter. But in general, the markets remain healthy, and our team is in place. And so, we're just going to keep doing our jobs.
Jordan Sadler: And then, I guess I was -- you had a comment on Virginia, Northern Virginia, perhaps in particular that you haven't yet seen the leases executed to sort of suck up the demand, but you were optimistic. I kind of feel like in the last couple of days up between some of the Yahoo! space being backfilled in Ashburn, 14 megawatts or so, and a 12-megawatt lease in Richmond, which I guess, debatably not Northern Virginia, or the same market. Are those not on your radar in terms of competition or supply?
Thomas M. Ray: No, they are. The key there is, in our view, that the Richmond leasing, we don't think has much bearing on our business. The absorption in Northern Virginia does, and we were encouraged to see transactions get signed. So if -- our scripted comments, at times, are pre-recorded. In some days, a 2-day gap makes a difference. But we were pleased to see the information with the Yahoo! sublease signing this morning.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. You faked us out there for a second. Your voice sounds remarkably the same. Live, that is. Hey Jeff, last one, and then I'll get off. On debt, I'm looking forward to 2015. Can you talk about sort of the plans for the outstandings on the revolver? Should we look for you to term some of this out?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, Jordan, I think today, we sit with about $205 million outstanding on that credit facility. So it's about 50% utilized. And obviously, we continue to look at incremental capital needs in line with our business plan. And it's something we continue to look at very closely. And we'll look to term some portion or all of that credit facility here in the near future. I think in terms of amounts, you can kind of look at what we've done historically. We've termed out about a single turn of our adjusted EBITDA. It will probably be in line with something like that. We would like to maintain the flexibility and the capital structure, which is something we continue to favor as we look at our options to term some of that out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Barry McCarver with Stephens.
Barry McCarver: Just a couple, I think you've already covered most of it. But on the interconnection business, do you have an idea of the average number of cross-connects, particularly at those smaller customers where we see the most velocity there, and maybe what the opportunity is?
Thomas M. Ray: We do have a very good idea. We've disclosed in the past the number of deployments that have x number of cross-connects. I think, last quarter we said 60...
Jeffrey S. Finnin: It's right at -- if you look at 3 or more, it's right at 63% in terms of revenue, and then 83% at 5 or more, Barry.
Thomas M. Ray: Inversed. 85% have 3 or more -- 83% of the revenue have 3 or more, and 65% have 5 or more interconnections.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: 5 or more.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. We study our cross-connects pretty deeply. And if there are other specific disclosures that might be helpful, we're happy talk offline and figure out what we can do.
Barry McCarver: Okay. And then secondly, Tom, you were talking about the ability to add more capacity with your current assets of building and land. And I think you mentioned an opportunity of 20 to 25 megawatts with a CapEx of around $90 million to $100 million. Doing the math there, kind of $4 million to $4.5 million per megawatt. Is that the fully embedded number? Because that seems really attractive cost to build.
Thomas M. Ray: That's an incremental number. So we've really tried to explain to people that we've made a very significant investment, particularly VA2 and NY2 in building the core and shell, and prebuilding a reasonable amount of infrastructure associated with those core and shell. So yes, we believe the incremental investment and return on that investment is highly attractive. And with the number of megawatts available for that, we think it's quite significant.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Just a follow-up on Barry's question about sort of the incremental build-outs that you're talking about. This has been, I guess, an opportunity for you guys for a while. You had this redevelopment space. What kind of incremental yields should we be thinking about as you deploy the capital in your existing markets? And then as a second question, you do have a lot of construction activity or planned activity as we head into 2015. We've certainly seen the leasing velocity improve this year as you've highlighted, Tom. But how important is it to have available inventory in order to drive sales?
Thomas M. Ray: I think it's -- I don't think that dynamic has changed a bunch. We've said ever since we came out that sales in the colo business really require existing inventory. And for larger transactions, pre-leasing is more accepted. It happens more often. So our fundamental business here remains in the colocation world and trying to drive ARPU and profit per dollar of invested capital. And we get our best returns in our colo business. And as we've said in the past, there are times, especially when deliver a new larger facility where we will go into the market and hit some wholesale leases to drive cash flow more quickly, and then, hopefully, recycle that inventory over time. But I think because that is our core business, you will continue to see us work to maintain some degree of inventory in our markets. But we build modularly just like the rest of the guys. We don't see any advantage in having $200 million of unsold capital in any given market at any given time. So I hope that provides the guidance you're looking for.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Yes, I mean, could you give us a little color on the incremental returns and the capital that you're targeting?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I guess at a high level, Jonathan, I'd say we messaged to the street that we work to beat a 12 on a stabilized cash basis. And if you look at the front half of that has stabilized at a 6 or 7, you can look at a 17 or an 18 on the back end. And there have been a number of times where we've materially exceeded our 12. So we'll continue to work to do that. But the back half of sales or the, frankly, the return on everything after the first phase tends to be significant.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Absolutely. If I can squeeze in one more question here. You started to breaking out some of the cabinet metrics not too long ago. And the MRR per cabinet has been very consistent in terms of its progression, 7%, 7%-plus growth on a year-over-year basis each quarter. And yet, when we look at some of the leasing, the pricing per square foot tends to move around dependent on, I guess, footprint size, as well as facility and market. And I was just wondering how it is that we get such a consistent return in terms of the growth on MRR, but the underlying pricing can move around so much?
Thomas M. Ray: One component is the pricing data that we provide is generally in terms of square footage. So depending on the market and depending on the density, that can vary a great deal. And -- I'm sorry, it's also rent. I mean, the key there is that the pricing data is rent. And the MRR per cabinet includes power and interconnection. So there are times when you look at an opportunity and have a little bit lower rent, and you'll make more profit on other components of the mix. And that's what shows up in the MRR per cabinet statistic.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Jonathan, just to add to that. When you look at the MRR per cabinet information, that is essentially a same-store pool, so that amount of square feet does not vary from quarter to quarter. So that amount is staying very consistent. It gives you a very good view in terms of what type of revenue growth we are being able to generate off of essentially the same square feet, same invested dollars.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company.
Colby Synesael: 2, if I may. The first one is you mentioned, I think, 58% of leases this quarter coming from both cloud and network. And obviously, just -- beyond just CoreSite, that's a broad trend we're seeing in the industry in terms of being an area for growth. How aggressive have you had to be on pricing for those particular types of deals, especially what we'd rather, I guess, refer to as those magnet-type of customers that one would hope will ultimately bring in other customers behind them, perhaps in those other cases [ph]? And then my second question had to do with cross-connects. As, broadly speaking, the world gets more connected. Are you seeing demand for cross-connects in what we'd refer to, or as you call it, Tier 2, Tier 3-type markets, or at least here at your flagship facilities is starting to pick up to the point where some of the value add you've already built in some of your markets like LA as an example, could actually start to be replicated in a broader grouping of facilities?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think that our cross-connect business just continues to exhibit, not only very consistent growth in revenue, but also a consistent growth in fiber count. And I'd say the shape of that is -- has also remained very, very consistent. We do believe that more equipment, more routers are going to be pushed further into the edge of the network. But I think, sincerely, I think that's a net add to the marketplace. Our cross-connect volume and our global gateway facilities has remained very constant. It has grown in a very consistent and healthy rate. So I think that the push of -- into edge deployments into these Tier 2 markets is real and it's going to continue to happen. But I think it's supported by a tremendous volume of fundamental demand. So I don't know if that helps, but our statistical data to-date shows our global gateway buildings continue to add cross-connects at the same rate as they have for quite some time.
Colby Synesael: And I guess, this does relates to the pricing with cloud?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, I mean, again, I don't think there's been a huge change on that over the 15 years we've been doing this. There are certain deployments where you know that they're going to bring other deployments to the building or they're going to generate a lot of cross-connects. And those deployments, I think, have always been hotly contested in the marketplace. So I haven't seen pricing on those gem anchors really change. I think the -- as we've said for quite some time the last several years, I think pricing on the non-gems, the pricing on the less differentiated deployments has gone down quite materially over the last 4 years. And while that has been playing out, our business has grown very nicely. Our MRR per cabinet has gone up. And we just stand by the numbers that we've been disclosing and that we've been generating.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird.
David B. Rodgers: Tom, maybe a question for you to start. With regard to kind of the development activity you talked about for next year. '13 was a pretty broad year across the portfolio in spending. I think this year has been a much more narrow year. As you go back to spending more broadly, I guess, I want to understand any distinguishing features between the idea that -- is the market changing to give you more confidence? Or do you have maybe more confidence in the execution of the team and in the sense [ph] where your sales force is today to make those broader investments?
Thomas M. Ray: Honestly, it's much more simple than that, Dave. It's -- there are times when we're just running out of core and shell in a given market. And when we need to go build more core and shell, you see capital go out in a big lump. And then, you'll see us work through that core and shell over a few years, and then you'll have another step function of capital. So it really just turns on market by market, inventory availability and there's just -- there's no more science to it than that. I mean, there's rocket science in looking at are we leasing well? What is our ARPU? And what is our profitability per kilowatt? So we say yes and no to customer opportunities based on those metrics. And we say yes and no to more core and shell development based on those characteristics. But we like Virginia. We like New York. We like Santa Clara. We like LA. We like Chicago. We like Denver. And when we're out, we build more, and those tend to be lumpy.
David B. Rodgers: Okay, that's helpful. And then with regard to NY2, you had talked before you even constructed the asset that potentially you'd go to a mid-market or a larger customer to backfill some of that space for some periods of time. It sounds like in the quarter, you did sign a mid-market tenant to fill some of that. Was that the extent of which we should expect larger customers to be put into NY2? Do you see doing more of that? And what's kind of in the funnel right now that could be in the near term that would continue that trend of maybe larger or middle-market customers filling in that space?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, I think we'll continue to look for those opportunities. And in Q3, our largest transaction at NY2 is an exceedingly valuable transaction. It's a very large deployment from a very reputable global carrier. The rent, the GAAP rent, appears low because it has a ramp in it. But the stabilized cash rent on that deal is highly attractive, and it's a very strategic deal. So we'll do all of those we can do. And I think over the next -- probably through this year, we'll still be opportunistic about some larger wholesale looking opportunities. We just -- we have 18 megs still to go.
David B. Rodgers: Yes, quite a bit of wood to chop, but great progress so far. I wanted to ask about Chicago, I guess, or maybe the opportunity for midsized private M&A. I guess, as private equity firms have either become less aggressive or reduced their involvement in data, at least from what we've seen, maybe you're not seeing that. But has that happened? Are there some kind of mid-market M&A opportunities like in a Chicago that would help you expand? Or is that going to be purely organic? And are you really focused on the organic expansion?
Thomas M. Ray: No, I'd say we're clinical in what we focus on. And again, not to beat a dead horse here, but our view just haven't changed. We -- as we've look at M&A, Chicago would be a good place for us to add some local -- locally grown capacity, if you will. At the same time, our standards for deploying our capital in that direction haven't budged. When an asset doesn't bring a densely interconnected cash or rent roll to table or it doesn't have something unique, we do pay attention to price per kilowatt because we can build on our own without buying. And if an asset is priced appropriately for the rent roll you're buying, we're very open to acquiring. And if an asset is priced appropriately with a great rent roll, we're very open to buying. But we just remain disciplined around how we deploy our capital.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup.
Emmanuel Korchman: Jeff, maybe you can -- and maybe I misunderstood your comments in the beginning on the Confluent acquisition. It seems like those amounts are very big compared to what you've paid for the portfolio, and also what looks like rent coming out of the Denver assets that were acquired with it. Can you help us understand how -- what those numbers actually represent and how you get there?
Thomas M. Ray: I'll dive in on this, Manny. I think at a high level -- so if you recall, the business that we bought in Denver is, by leaps and bounds, the most interconnected business along the front range or in this greater Rocky Mountain region. So rent tells a smaller part of the story with the value of the business than it might in a lot of other markets. At a high level, we're almost 3 years past the acquisition date, and we look back and we believe we bought that business at around 6.5x multiple on current cash EBITDA. So we're very pleased with the price we paid. We're very pleased with the asset. Extremely grateful to Mr. Gardner and his work in helping build it before we got together and after we got together. And it just couldn't have worked out better.
David B. Rodgers: And that 6.5x [indiscernible], the dollars that Jeff mentioned in the beginning of the call plus the $3 million, that was initially put in the business?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: That's right. Yes.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, if you do just a current look back at the whole enchilada, everything we paid, and then look at the current adjusted EBITDA in place, it worked out very well for us. And we feel for everybody in the transaction.
David B. Rodgers: Great. As you think about both expansion in your current markets and enter into new ones, how do you underwrite how much of the business is going to be sort of wholesale-esque and more retail and colo? How do you think about splitting up facilities?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we think about it on an IRR basis. So we look at our trailing fill rate based on colocation, and we make a forecast based on that. We usually think we can continue to garner a little bit more market share as the years go by. That's been our experience and we hope to continue that. And then, you look at -- then you make a decision on how much you think you'll fill with that colo. And then, you look at the rest of the inventory that's available. And then, you just do an IRR calc based on if we fill it now at a lower rate, and it takes longer to recycle it back at high rates, where is the optimal IRR? So it's all just math.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel.
Matthew S. Heinz: Just looking for an update on the progress of your cloud ecosystems. And I was hoping you could shed some light on your recent conversation with sort of magnet cloud customers. And in particular, what you're hearing from them in terms of the pace of overall hybrid cloud adoption? And then secondly, how are you approaching the enterprise vertical from a marketing perspective? Or maybe trying to educate them on how you're connectivity solutions can aid some of those hybrid deployments?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, taking the last part first, we could just hire you in our marketing department. What we do is try to educate them. So with the Open Cloud Exchange and with -- we think the importance of private interconnections and private network connection from the enterprise to the cloud service provider, we feel very well positioned for that in our product set in terms of our offering, the exchange inside the buildings, and in terms of our network partners that bring people in. So we just try and educate them. And then, as to how the cloud ecosystem is coming along, we just, well, I guess, we'll point to continued consistent growth of the cloud signings. And we very much appreciate the value of the top 4 or 5 largest cloud service providers. We have people on those accounts. We've had very good success in penetrating them and providing value to them in a mutually beneficial fashion. So I just think we're focused on what you would hope we would be focused on, and just trying to drive more and more of those deployments into our buildings as more and more of them come to market. They're not all deployed in the market yet. So we've -- we feel like we captured our fair share and we're going to keep working to do that.
Emmanuel Korchman: And I guess we can talk numbers on that consulting arrangement a little later on.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, sounds good.
Operator: Mr. Ray, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Thomas M. Ray: Thank you very much. And thanks to everybody for taking the time to be on the call and to learn more about the company. Look, at a high level, we're pleased with how far we've come this year. And we are very encouraged by the sales and marketing progress. We do feel like we can do more, and we're going to keep working on it. And the bottom line is we've been here for a very long time just trying to rewrite returns to our shareholders. We're working hard, we work to do the right thing, and we're going to keep doing that. So we'll continue to push productivity and look forward to talking to everybody in another quarter and seeing most of you at NAREIT.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Derek McCandless, General Counsel for CoreSite Realty Corporation. Please go ahead sir.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today’s call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations which are based on currently available information and management’s judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Ray: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I’ll discuss highlights of our financial results, review our sales results for the second quarter, update our view of market conditions and provide insight into our view of our near term growth opportunities. Jeff will then present a detailed review of our financial results and balance sheet position, as well as update you on our outlook for the full year. In Q2, we continue to see sales momentum, which coupled with focused internal execution, resulted in continued solid financial performance. Total operating revenue increased 14% year-over-year, led by greater than 20% growth in revenue from interconnection. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of interconnection revenue growth in excess of 20%. In Q2, we recorded some onetime items that Jeff will explain in more detail later on the call. Excluding those onetime items, Q2 FFO was $0.51 per share in unit, correlating to 13% growth year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding onetime items, increased 12% year-over-year, to $30.04 million. Including onetime items, the net of which added $0.06 to the total reported FFO. Q2 FFO amounted to $0.57 per share and unit. That said, we focus upon our earnings metrics excluding onetime items as we measure our performance. Regarding new and expansion turnkey data centre sales, in Q2, we executed 121 leases, representing annualized GAAP rental revenue of $9.4 million, which is our highest level of GAAP rent signed from TKD leases since we became a public company. This was comprised of approximately 59,000 square feet at an average GAAP rental rate of $159 per square foot. Total sales production of $9.4 million for the quarter is more than double our trailing 12-month quarterly average and includes the 26,500 square foot lease at SB3 with a new customer that we discussed last quarter. The $159 average rental rate is in line with our trailing 12-month average. During the second quarter we executed four leases in excess of 2,000 square feet, resulting in our average lease size executed in Q2 of 490 square feet. Excluding the large backfill lease at SV3 our average lease size executed in Q2 was 270 square feet, 6% higher than our trailing twelve month average of 254 square feet. Regarding the geographic distribution of sales in the second quarter, our strongest markets in terms of annual GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases were Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Boston and Virginia. Regarding New York, Phase I of our NY2 facility consisting of the first three computer rooms brought to market, is now 19% occupied and 30% leased. We had limited, new and expansion signings at NY2 in Q2, however activity at this site has been strong and our follow-up reflects several opportunities at advanced stages of discussion. Regarding Northern Virginia, at our VA2 development in Reston, the skin is going on, generators and transformers are set on site and we expect to deliver the first phase of TKD inventory by September or October of this year. Related in Q2, we saw solid sales at VA1, as we work to drive occupancy in that building before we open VA2. To that, we believe that VA2 will deliver just as we become limited on large blocks of capacity at VA1. Turning to the performance of our verticals. Our network and cloud verticals together accounted for 51% of leases and 27% of annualizes GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in the second quarter. The digital content vertical was also quite strong this quarter, representing 25% of leases signed and 65% of annualized GAAP rent with substantial contribution from the large lease at SV3. We continue to see increased penetration with enterprises, with this vertical accounting for 19% of new and expansion leases signed in the quarter. As a point of reference, the number of our enterprise customers grew by 18% over the last 12 months. In the second quarter, we continue to experience strong net fiber ads across our network dense portfolio, with particular strength in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. Total fiber cross connect volume increased 19% year-over-year, with total connections growing by 9%. Regarding sales staffing, we’re now 94% staffed in terms of frontline reps onboard with the company. After considering the extent to which newer reps are not yet fully off-ramp, the quarter coverage of our current team correlates to approximately 76% of where we expect to finish in 2014. Similar to the dynamic we discussed last quarter, all of our markets are substantially staffed, with the exception of the New York campus as we continued to hire that NY2. We are pleased with the concealed execution of our sales and marketing teams and focused upon further accelerating the sales pace we established in the first half of this year. Turning now to the view of the markets our outlook is substantially consistent with what we discussed last quarter. We’ve seen a pickup in demand activity in the New York, New Jersey market although there remains a large supply of the available capacity in that market. We are seeing rents solidify in the Bay Area and sublease space has been absorbed and demand has remained robust. The downtown Chicago market is exhibiting increasing rents as near term supply remains somewhat limited. We continue to see Los Angeles, Boston and Miami as substantially consistent with last year. We are more optimistic on the margin regarding the Northern Virginia market than we have been in the last few quarter. Our analysis of this market continues to point at 60 MW of new supply coming to the Loudoun and Fairfax County sub market excluding the 23 MW Yahoo sub release. This compares to trailing annual absorption of approximately 40MW per year. We previously thought that this could lead to softening rents for undifferentiated requirements in the market. However our current final data suggest that the market may see better than expected absorption in 2014 somewhat offsetting the potential of near term oversupply. We continue to watch the market closely to see the extent to which final demand converts to signed leases in the market. Regarding our plans for continued investment in growth we remain very excited about our opportunity at our NY2 facility. Leveraging off the upfront cost we’ve already invested in the asset. We believe we have the ability to construct approximately 16 MW of additional inventory at the site at an incremental cost of between $4.5 to $5.5 million per MW, with this low cost to deliver additional capacity we believe we may have the opportunity to invest significant additional capital into this investment at a yield on incremental investment that will meaningfully exceed our target of 12%. Similar to NY2 we are excited about our opportunities with our VA2 development in Reston. At that site we expect deliver a highly scalable 2000sq ft core and shell data center along with 3MW of TKD capacity in the first phase later this year. Much like NY2 at VA2 we believe we have the ability to construct approximately 9MW of additional inventory at the site at an incremental cost of between $4.5 and $5.5 million per MW. As such as at NY2 we believe that the follow on investment opportunity inherent at VA2 is substantial and brings the potential for strongly attractive yields on incremental capital. The combination of NY2 and VA2 alone represents 4,53,000 sq ft of new Class A product in two of the largest markets of US. Laying the foundation of opportunity to develop an aggregate of approximately 25 additional MW at an incremental cost substantially below for replacement cost. We believe this represents a mathematically significant opportunity for follow on investment a very strong returns on capital. Beyond NY2 and VA2 we remain focused upon driving occupancy in our existing TKD space which including the 3MW to be delivered at VA2 later this year represents 21% of our current portfolio. We believe this component of our portfolio represents a further opportunity to drive earnings and in this case with even more limited requirements for new capital. Further our follow-on investment opportunity in our LA2 and Boston locations provided added headroom to invest attractive yields and drive earnings with reduced requirements for new capital. Finally with regards to our growth plans based upon trailing sales in our current funnel we anticipate that our inventory availability will become more constrained in the Bay Area and downtown Chicago over the next 18 to 24 months. As such we are currently evaluating potential next steps in those markets as we access our broader strategic in growth plans all relative to the strong internal growth opportunity inside our existing asset base. In summary, we are pleased with our financial results thus far this year and very encouraged with the progress shown by our sales and marketing teams and with our execution on development activities for the year. With that I turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks Tom and hello everyone I’ll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q2 financial results. Second I will update you on the development activity, third I will provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And fourth I will update our outlook and guidance for the full year. Our second quarter data center revenues were $63.7 million a 3.3% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 14.5% increase over the prior year quarter. Our second quarter data center revenue consisted of $53.5 million in rental and power revenue up 5.1% sequentially and 14.2% year-over-year $8.6 million from interconnection revenue an increase of 6.6% sequentially in 21.8% year-over-year and $1.6 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million substantially consistent with the first quarter in the prior year second quarter. Q2 lease commencements represented $8.2 million of annualized GAAP revenue, comprised of approximately 61,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $135 per square foot. Renewals in the second quarter totaled approximately 42,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $167 per square foot and represented mark-to-market growth of 2.1% and 8.1% on cash and GAAP basis respectively. We continue to expect full year cash rent growth in the range of 1% to 4%, churn in the second quarter was 1.8% at the high end of our expectations of 1% to 2% per quarter primarily due to the impact of the churn associated with the amendment to a single customer release at SV3. Our back log of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $6.9 million. We expect approximately 60% of the current backlog to commence in the remainder of 2014. I would point out that approximately 36% of the back log is associated with the new lease at SV3 which is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016 at the point in time our current lease is completed. Excluding the impact of onetime items FFO was $0.51 per share and unit for Q2 representing an increase of 4.1% on a sequential basis and 13.3% year-over-year. Total reported FFO for the second quarter including onetime items was $0.57 per diluted share and unit. Related to onetime items in the second quarter we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1 million or $0.02 per share to FFO related to our ongoing IT and software development initiatives. As we discussed in the first quarter we embarked on a deep dive of our investment in internally developed IT systems and through further evaluation have decided that the currently available commercial off the shelf packages can effectively and efficiently address our business needs. Therefore with discontinued internal development on a number of work streams and recorded a commensurate impairment charge. Additionally in the second quarter we realized a benefit of approximately $3.7 million or $0.08 per share in FFO resulting from a true up of accrued real estate tax liabilities associated with estimated amounts from 2010 due to a change in ownership of our acquired properties at IPO. The final tax amounts for these properties acquired at IPO became known in the second quarter and we reconciled the actual amounts to the accruals accordingly. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned onetime items in second quarter adjusted EBIDA increased 12% year-over-year. In terms of total reported results including onetime items due to adjusted EBIDA was $34.1 million. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter were approximately 5.7% of total operating revenues in line with last quarter. We expect the sales and marketing expenses for the second half to be approximately 6% of total operating revenues. Our G&A expenses were 10.2% of total revenues down a 190 basis points from the previous quarter. We expect G&A expenses to be approximately 11% of revenue for the remainder of the year. As shown on the page 18 of our supplemental, we spent and expensed $2.6 million during the second quarter related to ongoing repairs and maintenance slightly above the average amount spent over the trailing 12 month period as of June 30th 2014 our stabilized operating data center portfolio was 85.4% occupied. Including leases executed at the end of Q2 but not yet commenced. Our stabilized data center occupancy rate would be 88%. I will now discuss our recently completed and ongoing development activity across the portfolio. As reported last quarter in Q1 we completed the last two computer rooms being delivered in Phase I at NY2 in Secaucus resulting approximately 53,000 net renewal square feet of data center space in our pre-stabilized pool at this asset. We now carry $43.3 million on our balance sheet as completed capacity plus $54.5 million as construction and process related to corn shell that is currently being held for future turnkey data center development. Regarding VA2 at the end of Q2 we carried $66.2 million of construction and process related to the asset. And we anticipate investing an additional $12.8 million this year to complete the corn shell and deliver 3 megawatts of turnkey data center capacity to the market. As we’ve discussed previously, as we complete development projects we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance resulting in a corresponding increase in the amount of operating expense. As a reminder we have included the percentage of gross interest capitalized on page 20 of the supplemental as you think about your models for 2014 we continue to expect the capitalization of interest to decrease to approximately 40% to 50% of total interest expense incurred similar to where we were in Q2. Turning to our balance sheet as Tom stated we strongly believe in our follow-on investment opportunity not only at NY2 and VA2 but across our current portfolio. As such we are focused upon maintaining the liquidity and capital to support these investment opportunities. And we believe we are well positioned to execute and fund this opportunity. Specifically as of June 30th 2014 our debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.0 times. And if you include our preferred stock it is 2.9 times. We continue to target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualize adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4 times. As of June 30th 2014 we had $177 million drawn on our credit facility with approximately $221 million of available capacity. Regarding our mix of floating versus fixed rate debt plus preferred equity, as of June 30th 2014 we had a floating rate debt equivalent to 1.3 times Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA and the combination of our fixed rate debt plus preferred equity correlated to 1.6 times Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Finally excluding a onetime charge of $0.02 per share in the first quarter and the onetime net benefit recorded in the second quarter in the amount of $0.06 per share. We are increasing our guidance for FFO per diluted share and unit to arrange $2.07 to $2.15. From the previous range $2 to $2.10 including the impairment charge and net benefit of $0.06 per share noted previously. The updated 2014 guidance of FFO per diluted share and unit is $2.11 to $2.19. When excluding the net $0.04 benefit from the true up of real estate taxes and the impairment charges recorded through the first half of the year. The midpoint of our new guidance is $2.11 per share in unit. The $0.06 increase in organic guidance is been driven in part by increased revenue expectations for the second half of the year as well as lower property tax expenses offset to some extent by approximately $0.02 to $0.03 of accelerated non-real estate depreciation expected in the second half of this year related to our IT systems. We now expect total operating revenues of $265 million to $270 million compared to the previous range of $260 million to $270 million. Data center revenue is now expected to be $260 million to $265 million compared to the previous range of $255 million to $265 million. Lastly we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $127 million to $132 million compared to the previous range of $120 million to $125 million reflecting the outlook for higher revenues in the second half and the $3.7 million real estate [indiscernible]. A thorough summary of our 2014 guidance items can be found on page 21 of the earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we’ve discussed today. Now we’d like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Our first question today is coming from Emmanuel Korchman from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Emmanuel Korchman: Hey good morning guys thanks for taking the questions. Jeff if we could stick to guidance for a second you said there was a $0.06 increase at the midpoint to 2014 FFO guidance part of that is increased revenues which on my numbers is $0.02 to $0.03 of that. How much is being driven by the property tax at the lower property taxes especially if you’re saying that there’s a depreciation offset?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah overall when you look at the property tax run rate we would expect for the second half of this year to generate about a $0.5 million incremental FFO to the bottom line for the back half of the year so about the $0.01 a share.
Emmanuel Korchman: So you’ve got $0.01 there let’s call it something like a $3 million increase of revenues and you float it down with expenses you get probably again $0.03 to $0.04 there I’m just not getting to $0.06 so what am I missing in terms of guidance shift – the guidance amendment?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah I think overall when you look at the increase in revenues, Manny, there’s really three things that’s driving the increased revenues. If you look at overall we just got better visibility into the remainder of the year obviously plus what we were able to generate in sales for the first half. In addition the lease that we signed at SV3 add some incremental revenue there associated with the particular customer that the – this second quarter. And then thirdly the continued growth of our interconnection business as Tom alluded to. And as I mentioned in my call you know interconnection grew up in excess of 20% per quarter, all of that’s been factored into the overall revenue guidance. And then ultimately you just need to assess how much of that you really drop under the bottom-line that incremental revenue a large portion of that if not substantially would be dropped into the bottom-line with the exception of some offset for power expense. So if you take that on the top line you’ve got some, you’ve got the property tax run rate that comes down by $0.5 million on the back half of the year offset to some extent with the non-real estate depreciation that I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well. Hopefully all that gets it to about the $0.05 to $0.06 I guess it’s really $0.06 at the midpoint in the guidance.
Emmanuel Korchman: And then on SV3 the language in the press release perhaps an early termination on the last call we spent a lot of time talking about the fact that, that existing tenant would still be involved, is that still the case or should we read more into the early termination language?
Thomas Ray: There’s been no change so yeah I’m sorry if we confused it this quarter but the prior tenant, get back our computer room, upon execution of the new lease were surely after execution of the new lease. The prior tenant will surrender another room in accordance with the terms of the lease. And that second room is already pre leased to the new tenant and that’s, that’s the story of the new tenancy.
Emmanuel Korchman: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes couple questions. First of all on the follow-on opportunities for expansion you gave some good color around Virginia and New York and then alluded to LA and Boston. I wonder if you can quantify to a little bit greater detail timing and magnitude of Latin Angles and Boston and when you’re likely to expand. And then on the cross-connect strength you gave a kind of a geographic breakdown or the sources of that but qualitatively what do we think about as being the key drivers of the increased acceleration and the cross-connect revenues?
Thomas Ray: Sure as to LA2 and Boston I guess at a high level John we don’t think we’ll need additional inventory in LA2 in the next several quarters, we have enough there. And when we do add inventory there, there’ll be smaller sequential add-ons. So I think that’s the right way to look at it, you just look at our absorption and what’s available to building and when that gets constrained we’ll add a little bit more. Boston the approach is the same, moderate, adds to inventory as absorption demands. In Boston we are pretty tight on space right now, we have activity frankly and what’s leftover at the moment. So we’re going to look hard at a very small add in Boston maybe in the beginning of next year but just as needed and as lease is signed but neither of those markets are markets were you absorb a tremendous amount of capacity in the year so those would be fairly measured incremental adds. And as to cross-connects qualitatively I just think it’s just the fruit of the business plan but this is what we wanted to do. We wanted to driver further network density, we’ve been reporting record adds of network customers, network leases for the last year, year and half, two years. And we’ve already said you kind of get a lot of cross-connects ramping in. Six to nine months after you sign the lease, after deployment and so I just think you’re seeing, you’re seeing the fruit of that show up in the numbers.
Jonathan Atkin: Great and then if you could touch on Chicago and any kind of thoughts on expanding in that market whether it’s downtown or suburban. Your competitor’s maybe thinking similar as well but what do you see happening in that market in terms of new space becoming available either by yourself or by peers. And then just on the management side Steven Bryan is kind of settled into the roles. And I wondered what – you talked about kind of where you are in terms of quarter bearing headcount and so forth. Anything else you feel like sort of highlighting from a qualitative standpoints in terms of go-to-market approach?
Thomas Ray: You bet. And Jon I would add you’re getting four for one on this, that’s okay because we love you. As to Chicago what we said in the prepared remarks we’ll evaluate it since we’re – we have a little bit of availability in our Chicago one asset to convert, to data center capacity still but that’s not going to last forever. And so our next move in Chicago might necessarily would be a little bit larger move than just converting one floor of 20,000 feet. And so it just takes thought we’re going to look at all of our opportunities for our capital and look at the broader operating environment and make a decision. So we just, we haven’t made any decisions regarding what or when in Chicago and we can’t guide anybody else and what was the fourth question? Steven Bryan I think it’s – again we’re doing what we wanted to do this year. And you’re right we have very good people executing in their roles and producing quantified results. I think the only thing I would add is just, underscore what we said over the last two quarters and then what we said in this script and that is in order to hit the quota coverage that we would like to hit and we expect to hit as a run rate at the end of this year. We need to be substantially fully staffed with quota bearing heads by the end of Q2 then we met that objective. We were 94% then I would characterize the 6% as fairly standard churn and so what we wanted to have for complimented of – of quota bearing reps in place and we’ve done that. Hats off to Steven Bryan and hats off to our HR group, Veena Bricker and a lot of internal staffing. So we what I would add is, I think we’re executing and doing what he came here to do.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you. Wanted to – question on the leasing volume. Good numbers this quarter obviously curious if there’s been any change in the compensation structure to sales people, in the quarter or over the course of this year to sort of kick start the effort?
Thomas Ray: None we put in a slightly revised and updated comp plan at the beginning of this year. And fairly normal we evaluate sales comp each year and we’ll make some tweaks but our approach to sales comp this year is to not mess with it. Just let people rely on what they see in front of them or let our sales teams rely on a structure and a pattern and that’s what we’ve done. So no, no changes.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And how do we – looking at the sort of capitalized leasing cost. How do we think about those in the context of just on an everyday basis or on a quarterly basis, I know they’re going to move around? We’ve seen them move around but last couple of quarters they’ve come in little bit higher, anything in particular driving that?
Jeff Finnin: Hey Jon its Jeff. A couple of things when you look at the year-to-date amounts of the capitalized leasing cost, you’ll see that we’ve incurred about $9.4 million of total leasing cost. One item that is driving that higher this year and we’ve talked a little bit about it on previous calls is related to purposely going out in retaining and renewing our customers here in the marketplace that is leading to some higher associated commissions in line with the transaction we did back in 2012 with the previous owner of that business. So that amount is, is in the first six months that amounting resulted in about $4.2 million here in the first half. That together with the transaction we signed at SV3 is leading higher commissions as well as we had one incremental commission on an office lease that we finalized and put into place and commenced here in the second quarter at SV1 in the Bay Area.
Thomas Ray: I’m going to hit the former point with a hammer just because I think it has been maybe not as clear to the investment community. When we bought the compliment business in Denver as we disclosed it that time we paid the certain amount upfront with a deferred payment structure. Some people might call that an earn out Jordon but our accountants do not. And the way that deferred payment associated with the purchase agreement is structured it’s in relation to signing leases. So they’re committed they are but they are, those commissions are payable only in association with that PSA a purchase and sale agreement. And at the end of this year there’s a measurement date related to that purchase and sale agreement related to these commissions that are driven by signed leases. And at the of that year and that measurement period you won’t see further accruals related to those activities.
Jordan Sadler: Okay that’s helpful stuff. Hey Jeff could you just throw us the cash backlog number?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah the cash backlog number is $10.8 million Jordan.
Jordan Sadler: Perfect thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great, thanks. Maybe first I’ll do a little follow-up on the lease commission question. And then I have a few others. I think in the last 10-Q Jeff you guys had targeted or thought the lease commissions associated with the Confluent acquisition would be I think in the $8 million range, is that still the right number?
Jeff Finnin: Yeah I’d say as we sit here today and you’ll see the 10-Q filed later this – I guess actually probably tomorrow or Friday, that number is at $8.9 million.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thank you. Just two other questions, first there was still really good momentum around the MRO per cabinet. I think it was up about 7% year-over-year and I was wondering if you might give us some sort of insight into through the breakout of your, of your footprint between say wholesale and retail or some other sort of insight into where we might think that MRO could go over time. And then the last question and I think you talked a little bit about this but with occupancy still high right now. And I think it’s the highest that I’ve seen on record. Do you have the ability to meet the demand that you’re seeing in the marketplace. Thanks.
Jeff Finnin: Sure with regard to occupancy and our ability to meet demand I think absolutely we disclosed some of our occupancy statistics in terms of the stabilized portfolio Jon from the net lease out. The development properties that have been delivered but are not yet stabilized. So if you look at total availability across the portfolio and you include the three we’re about to deliver at VA2 over the next handful of months. We’re about 79% to 80% occupied, so we feel like we’ve really maintained and we’ve been running at that number somewhere between 75% and 85% for the last four years. So our expectation at growth from the turnkey data center capacity that we deliver to the market frankly is the same as it’s been for the last 4 years. I think what’s a little bit different right now is thatVA2 and NY2 investments bring tremendous additional scalability. That low incremental investment relative to that replacement cost. So as we view it honestly John, we do our internal growth opportunity right now better than it’s been over the last 4 years, same within the existing store with a lot more on the attractive follow on capability we’ve ever had.
Thomas Ray: And John just a little bit more color on the occupancy as Tom brings up the difference between our pre-stable and stable pools. On the pre-stable, just keep in mind as we go into 2015 first quarter, we outline on page 18 exactly when those pre-state pools or developments will come into our stabilized pool. And so that may have some impact on the occupancy, it just depends ultimately the percentage occupied ultimately when they roll into the stabilized pool. Secondly on your other question around MR per [indiscernible] the revenue growth is just shy of 8% year-over-year is really coming away from three component, first of all it is as those customers renew we are getting some uplift from a rental perspective and you know our numbers reflect that in terms of the rent growth we reported this quarter and in previous quarters, so that’s part of it. Secondly is just the incremental cross connect and interconnection revenue coming as those customers add incremental cross connects. And thirdly it would relate to some level of incremental power to the extent they’re adding power in that same particular space.
Jeff Finnin: And I think at the highest level we’ve talked about, there’s a meaningful discount between our revenue per rack between some other folks in the industry and us, and we’ve been working purposely to close that gap. We’ve closed a portion of it, but frankly there’s a lot of head room left to work on and we continue to believe in our ability to keep moving that up, moving up ARPU and close more of that gap.
Jonathan Schildkraut: If I can sneak just one more in here, do you have a number for what percent of your bookings came from your existing base for the quarter?
Jeff Finnin: We don’t have it in our fingertips, Johnson it will be probably, technically it will be a little bit higher than in the past because of the large lease at SV3 which was an existing customer, the end user under that was not an existing customer. So that there’s a new relationship there, but because of the SV3 lease, we typically run in that kind of 65% to 80% range. It wouldn’t surprise me if it’s little bit higher on the cube. We’ll have to go look at that, we didn’t check it this time.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Thank you for taking the questions.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Rogers – RW Bear. Please proceed with your question.
Dave Rogers: May be for Tom I want to ask a couple of different questions may be around leafing spreads as you look to that going forward. You’ve given guidance for the second half of the year and you’ve been pretty much tightly within that range for the first half, any variability in the second half of that number do you think around each of the two quarters? You look at 2015 and I know it’s a little early, I think it’s big year of exploration than in the average rate next year as well and in that where you have been signing deals, any color you can give on the second half of this year and both this year and next year what you should be thinking about that?
Thomas Ray: Yeah look, I think the spread should follow market racks and relative to the trailing 12 we expect you know the rest of this year to be more favorable. So we’ll have to see what that leads to, but the markets are, I think, more healthy. And I think we’re executing in the markets more favorably than we did on the trail, so hopefully that will lead to not pressure, but some upside in terms of 2015 explorations, look Jeff we have a very disciplined process around doing a deep dive on the top 20 roles and getting very specific information about those. And then we do a statistical analysis on what’s left over and we look at the in place ramp versus where we think the market is. And we don’t see anything out there that is concerning, and in terms of more specifics around churn and market to market, they’ll come out with our new guidance at the beginning of the year, but I would say we think we’re pretty disciplined about looking at that, and there are no bombs hiding out there.
Jeff Finnin: And Dave, in terms of the other question around Q3 versus Q4 variability, the only thing to be sure you factor in is Q3 is typically our one quarter where our power expense tends to be higher just do the summer rates. So you will generally see a reduction in the overall contribution from the power portion of our revenues, just keep that in mind as you look at Q3 versus Q4.
Dave Rogers: And mainly on the same topic that’s all in the same topic FD3 can you recap for us what the impact of the spread there is or was or will be I guess I should say, and then when you’ll really recognize the impact of that?
Thomas Ray: We can’t provide any financial information that would lead to back solving the restructuring of the tenant that gave some space back or the economics of the tenant moved in. We can say it is MPB and FFO positive, we think that across the Bay area market, when you look at everything we’re doing there; we’re probably a couple pennies up. Two sets of FFO more favorable to the company’s bottom line across that old market than we thought we’d be at the beginning of the year. And there’s a component of GAAP that is related to the SV3 transaction and that’s the best we can give people.
Dave Rogers: Okay I appreciate that, and may be tell on your comments both on the capped interest as well as new investment opportunities. The development pipeline as thin as we’ve seen it I think maybe since you’ve come public. And I guess if you talk a little bit more about how purposeful that is maybe to be able to drive more occupancy in what you term the portfolio, or what is out there today. Is it more of a function of timing or supply in the market that is keeping you a little bit more cautious about that back log, is it more internally willing to execute or is it surely about opportunities and I guess there’s a lot there. If you can give some color on where that might be headed Tom it will be helpful?
Thomas Ray: Yeah, it is what we’ve been saying, the bottom line is we have capacity in most of our markets we were out and we were headed out towards running out in Virginia first, so we’ve addressed that and we wanted to have a stronger presence in New York, so we’ve addressed that as a strategic goal. In addressing those strategic objectives, we have laid out what we foresee as our best internal growth capability we’ve ever had. So we’ve always liked having a disciplined balance sheet that leads to – that can support potential opportunities down the road. For other strategic objectives, may be to use that tool may be you don’t, but we like having that weapon available to us, which is a balance sheet with room in it. We have the ability to grow tremendously off the investments that are on the plate right now. So I would say we’re very happy with the risk return profile of the company. It would be different if we were also out of inventory in LA and out of inventory in three or four other markets. We’d be having a different discussion, but we have room to run in most of our markets, we’ve addressed two big strategic moves on the East Coast. We do need to start thinking about Chicago and in Santa Claire over the next couple of years. We have landed developing Santa Claire should we choose to and we just like the risk return profile and importantly we like the capital profile of how we run the business right now. We’re happy and we think we’re going to do good things for our investors.
Dave Rogers: Great then one last question, sorry just in terms of any competitive discussions that you’ve had with tenants that make you think about open – the more competitive platform to you today than a year ago?
Thomas Ray: You know sincerely. I don’t think I’ve had challenging discussions about cross connections, certainly in the last quarter in Q2 to date, I sincerely think that 99% of the discussions I’ve had about cross connection Open IX have been with mostly analysts, not customers.
Dave Rogers: Talk one more, thanks.
Thomas Ray: Turn it up, Dave
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael – Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Colby Synesael: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I understand this and I apologize if it’s been said and I just didn’t pick it up but the 26,000 square feet the customer in the Bay Area you talked about. I think you said that you’re going to commence that in the second quarter of 2016 I just want to make sure I understand that from the revenue will actually start to come in the door. And then as part of that I guess, part of that 26,000 feet is space been taken up by the customer who’s returning 12.6000 square feet. And I was trying to get a sense when you stop recognizing revenue from that 12,600 square feet and if you can write it actually how much revenue is associated with that. So let me just stop there and then I have a follow-up question.
Jeff Finnin: Let’s just take the highest level one on the transaction again SV3 and again we, we just can’t give you guys any granular financial data related to the lease that went out, the lease that went in but at the highest level the building is four computer rooms. The existing tenants before this provision to occupy and leased off four of them. We leased two of those rooms for a total of 26,000 feet to a new customer. And half of that space or in this case 12,500 just because the size of rooms but the first room has already been vacated by the old customer. And the new customer has moved into it. And that, the earning from that are now coming through our income statement beginning in Q2 that was there. A year from now, two years from now the second computer room, the remaining square footage of the total 26,000 that room expires by its own terms on the prior customer. And the new customer has already leased it from us.
Thomas Ray: And that’s the piece of revenue that won’t commence until the second quarter of 2016.
Jeff Finnin: Maybe one way to think of this, we did two 12.500 foot leases essentially and one is already started and the old customers moved out. The other one the customer will move out, the newer will move in, in two years in accordance with that leases LXD.
Colby Synesael: So I guess post second quarter the situation on all moving parts if you will, associate with SP3 and [indiscernible] result, is that right?
Thomas Ray: Well you will see a commencement and a churn –
Colby Synesael: Yeah in 2015 but you’ve already all the pieces have been figured out in terms of what goes where.
Thomas Ray: They’re all in place, as to the first half of that building. It’s all done.
Colby Synesael: And is the customer who is initially the four computer rooms too which they’ve now what they will be vacating. Are they going to also for your understanding vacate the remaining two at some point?
Thomas Ray: I think that’s more likely than not but we honestly don’t know and kind of what we’ve been saying for the last couple of years but because the customer doesn’t know. The customer may need to keep those. And again we have a great relationship with that customer, very open dialogue. It’s just unclear but what there was an opportunity for us to eliminate risk as they have to build and make money doing it, that’s done. And as to the other half of the building that the amount of capacity that would come back if they did move out is less than one year of trailing absorption and so we were very comfortable with that but they may keep it who knows.
Colby Synesael: When did the lease and the other two computer rooms that you were referring to right now. When do those expire?
Thomas Ray: One of those in two years, one of those in three years.
Colby Synesael: Okay, perfect. And then I guess a different question just a real quick housekeeping item. Do you plan executing the accordion feature of the term loan in the second half I mean obviously you’re keeping the cash balance pretty tight right now, you have variety of different projects going on. Can you just kind of give us your thoughts on how you – I know you have room in your leverage. Can you just kind of remind us how you plan on paying for all these various things?
Thomas Ray: Yeah Colby I think as we sit here today we don’t have any firm plans to execute the accordion on a term loan. However it’s just one of the options available to us as we look out and look at what our available capital needs and sources are, as we look at the back half of this year and early into 2015. So what we monitor that plus all the other market opportunities and capital that’s available to us. And ultimately when we look at pulling down a commutable debt capital, it’s one that we look at but it will depend ultimately on the amount we need and the pricing will lead to those sources.
Colby Synesael: For our own modeling purposes would you suggest that whatever incremental cash we feel that you need beyond what’s currently on your balance sheet as of June 30th we just pull it from the credit facility?
Thomas Ray: I think that’s a good way to model as you look at the rest of the share absolutely.
Colby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Barry McCarver from Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.
McCarver: Hey good morning guys, good quarter and thanks for taking my questions. I think you’ve got most of them, I did have one. Tom on your prepared remarks talking about northern Virginia and renewal rates there it sounded like you were a little bit pleasantly surprised that, that rates have remained so firm in that market despite quite a bit of capacity. A little more color on I guess the top of business that CoreSite seeing and maybe your thoughts as to why pricing has been so stable?
Thomas Ray: Well you know we were pleased, our bitter concern really was from this point forward in the market as a significant amount of new supply hits the market. So I’d say that, I think rents in the market on a year-over-year basis were up about 6% on the trail versus the you before then for us at CoreSite in northern Virginia again our big concern was going forward. And we’re, there is just a lot of activity in the market. There are lot of big block deals in the market that are not CoreSite deals but other people might be interesting in them. And that might take some of the pressure off absorb some of that spec supply early. And the kind of activity we’re seeing is completely consistent with what we are seeing ever since we’ve been in that market. It’s an amazingly broad market in terms of the sources and demand. You have an attractive cost of power there so for regional requirements Virginia has been an area that’s one lot of out of market regional base requirement let’s say a company wants big presence in the East and the West. Virginia captures some of that out of region demand we have a great government situation there. You have an excellent internet and telecom demand base there. I shouldn’t have said great government situation but, you have demand from the government. And so there was a very broad base of demand generators across industries and which has led a very steady absorption. So we are there’s the chance and I mean really we just have to get side right now it is little more than I hope. But there’s reason to be hopeful that some of these big blocks of supply will get taken out reasonably early and lead the continued stability in that market. But we are going to have to see pens put to paper for that to happen.
McCarver: That’s very helpful thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Thank you our next question today is coming from Prior Cristanio from Jeffries. Please proceed with your question.
Prior Cristanio: Good afternoon congrats on the good quarter most of my questions have been answered but just a follow on V2 I appreciate the comment about the Virginia market overall but specifically with your asset I was just how you guys are feeling about pre-leasing before it opens and what is kind of leasing velocity could look like whether you’re kind forecasting more like what’s happening to NY2 asset, we expect things to move a little bit faster or slower just trying to get a general sense for modeling purposes.
Thomas Ray: I would say we do feel on the margin better about continuing the traction Virginia that we’ve been enjoying at VA1. The situation for us in Virginia is different than New York. It’s a – it’s really a new market for us. We had to lease up with the staff up as you guys know and we are finishing that process. In Virginia we have a team on ground and we got an excellent team on the ground for quite some time. And so we think we’re going to be better able to just keep marching in Virginia rather than even to start things up as we needed to do in New York. So we’re optimistic, we are hopeful the funnel has some new good opportunities in it. And we will just see what happens but we would hope that will go little bit faster than that startup Phase in NY2.
Prior Cristanio: Sounds good to me, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Petersen from MLV & Co. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Petersen: Great thanks. You talked about enterprises, how that kind of been growing as a tenant base and I think it’s at up 18% over last 12 months. I was hoping you could talk about kind of that trend relative to what we read in the press. We’d like the aggressive push by Microsoft and Google and Amazon. Recently they offered like a lot of storage for corporate users. And I am just curious from the ground level speaking to customers why they make decision to go to CoreSite rather than outsourcing a public cloud?
Thomas Ray: I think that decision is really driven by the enterprise decision to what extend to use the public cloud versus the private cloud. And the private cloud environment is quite often going out to a third party data center provider. And that decision is still driven by security and cost. We haven’t really seen it, I think that will continue to be the case. So for workloads that are not highly secure and that are may be less predictable. When you have something that isn’t very sensitive and you need burst capacity or you need capacity for certain amount of time. The public cloud is a great way to solve for that need. When you have a very predictable set of very large long-term workloads I think we still see enterprises find better economics in putting those in a private cloud and using their own infrastructure. So the issues surrounding when enterprises go to the public cloud versus when they do it on their own, have been around for a number of years and I think they are holding steady. I just think you see such tremendous growth in data in bits and bytes in workloads that the public clouds are growing very rapidly and you see private cloud activity growing very rapidly as well.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay. Can you give us any examples of may be like stand out sectors whether its healthcare financials or energy or any of that we could think of is like a typical tenant of CoreSite and what kind of applications they run are there any good examples for that.
Thomas Ray: You might think of it more in terms of workloads or requirements been companies or industries. I mean the financial service industries or health care industry might have a greater portion of its workload in data that they want to keep secure and in private. But let’s take up any of those companies to extent they have visual mundane back office needs for their own internal networks, employee email. That’s not sensitive so when they are very comfortable putting that into public cloud environment. And then the only question is cost. Is the public cloud going to be less expensive or more expensive. I think just like real estate, when a user in the cloud environment knows how much data storage and processing capacity they need and they know they’re going to need it for a long time. I think they can still get a better deal if they use private club. When they have to burst the public cloud makes sense. So for any company they have some information that is sensitive. They have some information that isn’t. So that’s the security filter by which they look at public versus private clouds. And then separately you have a cost filter.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay I appreciate the color. Thank you
Operator: Our next question is a follow up from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great no conference call would be complete without an question on M&A and so as you over the hour here so this would give the opportunity to at least complete it. Tom we haven’t seen a M&A in the sector just wondering your perspective on whether you think this space needs M&A. And then may be some other reasons that we haven’t seen so much or what might be impetus to see M&A occur thanks?
Thomas Ray: Well I believe the analysis the industry to others. Jonathan and you guys probably have a [indiscernible] as we do as to who is going to do what we can’t speak for other folks clearly there’s been talk and discussion of various M&A opportunities among various parties for ever since we’ve been public. As for us we are open minded because we’re just clinical about driving returns on capital for investors. As we’ve said consistently we have a very high bar with regard to risk and return on transformational M&A because we believe very strongly in our ability to make a lot more money for our investors what we perceive as lower risk that’s inside or existing portfolio. So look we are open you can see scenarios where footprints are complimentary and that might lead to a little bit better reach for customers. You certainly see G&A savings but we have a good business and we’re going to keep operating it. And if there is something smart to do we’ll take a look at it. How’s that for a non-answer?
Jonathan Schildkraut: Pretty good non-answer.
Thomas Ray: Okay Jonathan. So I am running for office so I am just practicing. I’m not by the way.
Operator: Thank you we’ve reached the end of question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ray for any further closing comments.
Thomas Ray: Alright. We just want to thank everybody for being on the call and joining us as we look at in front of us. We feel like we really started to generate some momentum in the first half of the year. Our objective is to leverage off that and accelerate it in the second half of the year. We want to thank the people at CoreSite we always thank our investors and our board which we do again but the people at CoreSite have driven what you’re seeing unfold in front of you right now been its on their backs and their hard work that it’s happening. We are grateful to them, we think we have a great road in front of us. And we think we’re off to the races so we are going to keep working on serving customers being disciplined about where we send our cash and just driving returns to our common equity. Thanks for your time.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-04-24 13:45:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Derek McCandless, Junior Vice President and General Counsel for CoreSite. Please go ahead.
Derek S. McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2014 conference call.

And now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll discuss highlights of our financial results, review our sales results and update our view of market conditions. Jeff will then present a detailed review of our financial results, development activity and balance sheet position. First, our Q1 financial results reflect continued systematic growth. Total revenue increased 16% year-over-year, led by greater than 20% growth in revenue from interconnection and breakered-amp power and 11% growth in data center rental revenue. Adjusted EBITDA grew 21% year-over-year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 220 basis points compared to the year-ago first quarter. FFO per share and unit of $0.49 correlates to a 20% increase over the prior year quarter. This $0.49 of FFO in Q1 incorporates a noncash expense of approximately $0.02 per share associated with the impairment of certain software development investments, which Jeff will discuss in more detail. Excluding this noncash charge, Q1 FFO was $0.51 per share and unit, correlating to 24% growth over the prior year quarter. Regarding new and expansion turnkey data center sales, in Q1, we executed 131 leases, representing annualized GAAP rental revenue of $5.1 million, comprised of approximately 40,000 square feet and an average GAAP rental rate of $129 per square foot. Total sales production of $5.1 million for the quarter is 12% above our trailing 12-month quarterly average and represents a greater than 50% increase over the prior sequential quarter. The $129 rental rate is 13% below our trailing 12-month average per foot. However, when normalized for power density, our Q1 rate was in line with the trailing 12-month average. We were pleased to see our normalized rental rate in line with the trailing year, in light of the greater total sales volume recorded in Q1 and, in particular, 4 larger leases in the Q1 sales mix. Additionally, we are encouraged to see sales volume increase in terms of the number of new and expansion leases signed, with our Q1 total of 131 leases representing a 16% increase over the trailing 4-quarter average and representing our highest number of leases executed in the quarter since we became a public company. Finally, our Q1 new and expansion executions reflect an average lease size of 306 square feet, increasing 12% from the trailing 12-month average. We attribute the increase to the fact that we executed 4 previously mentioned leases, each exceeding 2,000 square feet. Our execution of these 4 midsize leases is consistent with our long-standing goals and business model and is in contrast to the trailing 12 months only due to what we believe to be normal lumpiness in the execution of this size of lease. Reflecting continued strength in our network and cloud verticals, fiber cross-connect volume increased 17% year-over-year, with total connections growing by 9%. We focus upon the growth of fiber cross connections as an important metric for 2 reasons. First, we believe that fiber cross connections represent the true growth engine of the digital world and that their growth serves as a proxy for the health of the ecosystems in place and being developed in our data centers. Second, fiber cross connections, on average, realize unit pricing more than 90% greater than other physical cross-connects in our platform and currently account for more than 75% of total interconnection revenue. As such, fiber cross-connects are the predominant driver of revenue growth in our cross connection business. Beyond our cross connection product line, we were pleased to see continued expansion in our platform from our logical interconnection partners. Specifically, during the quarter, we announced another AWS Direct Connect deployment, bringing Direct Connect availability to our NY2 facility in Secaucus. Additionally, Frankfurt-based DE-CIX added a new deployment to our platform, placing a peering switch in our Reston campus. Importantly, we were pleased to see what we believe is greater success for our switch peering partners in our platform compared to that with most other U.S. data center providers, as reported by a respected public source. Regarding the geographic distribution of sales in the quarter, our strongest market in terms of annual GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases were Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Chicago and Virginia. Turning to the performance of our verticals. Our network and cloud verticals together accounted for 61% of leases and 38% of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in the quarter. Importantly, in Q1, we set another record for the number of leases signed in our network vertical. We believe that our strong position in the network and cloud verticals enables enterprises to reduce cost and accelerate performance in our platform, and we are seeing that play out in our Q1 sales results. Specifically, our enterprise vertical accounted for 17% of the annual GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in Q1. Importantly, we are realizing strong penetration of the Fortune 500's top computer software and information companies, with nearly 50% of those companies accounted among our current customers, including 9 of the top 10. Finally, with regard to leasing. In Q1, we took a meaningful step toward extending the contracted term of cash flows we expect from our SV3 facility in Santa Clara. To that objective, we executed an agreement with our customer at SV3 to restructure its lease, creating a win-win for both parties. The restructured lease enables us to recapture salable capacity in the building in phases, retain a component of the economics of the original lease, reduce the rental obligations of our existing customer in this space and enable our existing customer to relocate some portion of its capacity to other locations across our portfolio, subject to certain parameters. Following the execution of the restructuring agreement, in early Q2, we executed a new lease with one of our other customers for over 28,000 square feet at the site, or approximately 57% of total capacity. The new lease has a 5-year term and is with one of our current global ICT customers as it serves a global end user, who will be new to our portfolio, establishing and strengthening a set of relationships with great additional promise for all 3 organizations. Regarding sales staffing, we are now 83% staffed in terms of frontline sales reps on board with the company. After considering the extent to which newer reps are not yet fully off-ramp, the quota coverage of our current team correlates to approximately 60% of where we expect to finish 2014. In terms of the geographic distribution of our frontline sales reps, we are substantially staffed in each of our markets with the exception of our New York campus, where we currently have approximately half of the quota coverage in place, relative to what we target to have in place at the end of this year. Turning to our view of the markets where we participate. We do not see material changes from our last update in February. We continue to believe that Northern Virginia may see moderately softening rents for undifferentiated requirements, as the number of suppliers has increased and sublease exposure weighs on the market. Chicago is exhibiting strength in the prospect for improving rents, while we see Greater New York, the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Boston and Miami as substantially consistent with last year. Our objective remains to focus our sales efforts upon differentiated opportunities that benefit from the network and cloud advantages we built into our platform, which we believe bring attractive interconnection and breaker-amp power revenue to our company. In addition, we continue to expect to augment our company-wide performance system strategy, with a near-term objective of executing a limited number of larger leases in our new buildings in Secaucus and Reston to accelerate occupancy in these new sites. As we look to the remainder of this year, our focus is well-defined and simple: execute our business plan and drive occupancy in our existing platform and markets; and capitalize upon the strong internal growth opportunity before us. Specifically, we believe that inherent in our existing assets, we have the ability to more than double the amount of leased square footage in our company, with that growth coming at an attractive incremental cost and return on incremental investment. Pointing toward our execution on our growth opportunity, we're encouraged by the momentum that our sales team established in Q1, and we believe we are well-positioned to build off of that. That said, we still have work to do in building out our sales team, particularly in the Greater New York area. Also, we see an opportunity to streamline our technology systems and internal processes, and we remain committed to that goal. Put simply, we believe that our future is bright, and that in Q1, we took meaningful steps towards accelerating our execution on the promise before us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q1 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development activity, and third, I will provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. As a reminder, last quarter, we provided enhanced disclosures in our quarterly supplemental around the components of our operating revenue to provide more transparency into data center revenue trends. Many of my comments regarding revenue will relate to data center revenue performance, which can be found on Page 12 of the quarterly earnings supplemental. Our first quarter data center revenues were $61.7 million, a 3.9% increase on a sequential quarter basis and 16% increase over the prior year quarter. Our first quarter data center revenue consisted of: $50.9 million in rental and power revenue, up 2.5% sequentially and 13.5% year-over-year; $8.1 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 2.5% sequentially and 22.6% year-over-year; and $2.8 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million, substantially consistent with the fourth quarter, and an increase of 6.5% year-over-year. Q1 lease commencements represented $3.8 million of annualized GAAP revenue, comprised of approximately 28,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $134 per square foot. Renewals in the first quarter totaled approximately 22,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $159 per square foot, and represented mark-to-market growth of 4.7% and 9.4% on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively. Churn in the first quarter was 1.2%, in line with our expectations of 1% to 2% per quarter. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $5.7 million. We expect approximately 85% of the backlog to commence in 2014. Our first quarter FFO was $0.49 per diluted share and unit, flat on a sequential basis and an increase of 19.5% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $920,000 or $0.02 per share to FFO. This charge is related to our ongoing IT initiatives and, more specifically, to internal-use software previously under development. Specifically, during the quarter, we elected to discontinue internal development efforts associated with certain software applications and, instead, pursue implementation of commercial, off-the-shelf software. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $30.1 million reflects an increase of 6.1% sequentially and 21.4% over the same quarter of last year. As Tom mentioned, in the first quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 220 basis points to 47.2% of total operating revenues. This represents annualized revenue flow-through to adjusted EBITDA of 61%. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter were approximately 5.6% of total operating revenues, down 10 basis points sequentially and below the estimated range of 6% to 6.5% that we previously provided. This decrease is due to the timing of hiring sales and marketing resources. We expect sales and marketing expenses for the year to be closer to the lower end of the range we previously provided. Our G&A expenses were 13.5% of total revenues, up 200 basis points from the previous quarter, primarily due to the impairment charge I discussed previously and, to a lesser extent, a charge associated with the elimination of the Chief Operating Officer role, which we discussed on last quarter's call. Going forward, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately 11% of revenue. As shown on Page 18 of our supplemental, we spent and expensed $2.3 million during the first quarter related to ongoing repairs and maintenance, in line with the average amount spent over the trailing 12-month period. As of March 31, 2014, our stabilized operating data center portfolio was 83% occupied. Including leases executed as of the end of Q1 but not yet commenced, our stabilized data center occupancy rate would be 84.7%. I will now discuss our recently completed and ongoing development activity across the portfolio. At NY2 in Secaucus, New Jersey, we completed Phase 1 construction by delivering 2 additional computer rooms in March. As of the end of the first quarter, we have approximately 53,000 net rentable square feet of data center space at NY2 in our pre-stabilized pool, including the 18,000 square feet placed into service at the end of the fourth quarter. We have seen good momentum in leasing activity at NY2, with the first computer room now over 75% leased. At LA2, we delivered 33,700 square feet of turnkey data center capacity in the first quarter, all of which is now reflected in our pre-stabilized pool. We developed the additional computer room at LA2 in response to solid demand in that market, which, as Tom noted, was again our strongest market in terms of GAAP rents signed and number of leases executed. At our Reston, Virginia campus, we now expect to complete the first phase of our VA2 development late in the third or early in the fourth quarter as we timed the delivery of additional space to meet market demand. We continue to see solid demand for colocation capacity in Northern Virginia, with data center occupancy at VA1 up 260 basis points over the last 12 months. As we've discussed previously, as we complete development projects, we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting in a corresponding increase in the amount of operating expense. To provide increased transparency, we have included the percentage of gross interest capitalized on Page 20 of the supplemental. As you think about your models for 2014, keep in mind that we expect the capitalization of interest to decrease to approximately 40% to 50% of total interest expense incurred. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2014, our debt to Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.2x, and if you include our preferred stock, it is 3.1x. We anticipate our leverage to increase as we continue to execute our capital spending plans related to development activity. We continue to target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4x. As of March 31, 2014, we had $160 million drawn on our credit facility, with approximately $236.6 million of available capacity. As we mentioned on our February call, in January, we entered into a $100 million 5-year senior unsecured term loan and executed a $100 million interest rate swap agreement to fix the rate in order to protect against adverse fluctuations in LIBOR. These transactions enabled us to retire the $58 million mortgage on SV1 and pay down a portion of the revolving credit facility, leaving us with ample liquidity to fund our development activity and growth plans for the remainder of 2014. Finally, we are reiterating our 2014 FFO guidance of $2 to $2.10 per share and OP unit, as well as additional guidance metrics we disclosed with our fourth quarter earnings call. A thorough summary of all 2014 guidance items can be found on Page 21 of the earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Emmanuel Korchman from Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: Jeff, if I'm looking at your capitalized leasing commissions, they look kind of high in the quarter, especially on a sequential or year-over-year basis. Could you help us figure out what that is?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. You might recall in the second half of 2013, we renewed our primary lease here in Denver. That Denver facility was part of the Confluent acquisition back in April 2012. As a result of that renewal, we were -- are now able to go and renew those customers inside that particular data center. And we've got emphasis and particular focus on getting that done here in 2014. And as a result, that led to the increase in the run rate associated with those lease commissions. I would say that on average, you could see those lease commissions on a quarterly basis being somewhere between $2 million to $4 million per quarter through 2014 as we get those leases renewed in Denver.
Emmanuel Korchman: Got it. And then I think you guys have spoken in the past about increasingly using a channel partner program alongside increasing the quota of sales staff. Have you seen any progress in that program?
Thomas M. Ray: We have. I don't have the data at my fingertips, Manny, but I think our channel production in Q1 was roughly double that of the trail. I wouldn't describe -- I wouldn't position that as a permanent increase in the run rate, although we do think we can get to that point, but the short strokes are we had a very good Q1 in terms of the channel. But I think that there's a lot of lumpiness in that outperformance. At the same time, we have been pretty methodically adding to our channel capabilities. Number one, signing agreements with new partners, that's been going very well. And now we're well into the process of training them, getting them up to speed on our product catalog and pricing and us doing the same with them so that the organizations can work effectively together. So yes, we have seen very good channel results in Q1. And that process of building that team continues.
Emmanuel Korchman: Got it. Last one for me, Tom, and correct me if I'm wrong here. I think you talked about the undifferentiated product landscape in a few different markets, including New York, New Jersey, as sort of being weaker. And then at the same time, you spoke about filling part of your space with larger requirements in, at least, in New York markets, if not the others. How do I reconcile those 2 statements of -- there's lots of product that suits that sort of large customer, but that's the customer you're targeting?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. I mean, you reconcile it just by NPV and IRR-based math. In New York and Virginia, I mean, to make this as clear as we can, we do expect to sign some larger deals that are probably going to be at pretty low rates. And if those markets, we were -- our assets there were 80% full, and as such, most of the capital that we'd outlaid in the market was already being productive, and we had a small amount of available capital deployed not yet leased, we would not go look to go to those deals. But in each of those markets where you have a large new development with a lot of run rate, as we've said, ever since we've been public, we found it advantageous. We found that NPV and IRR are positive to go out and sign -- to move velocity faster in a new development. What we are not interested in doing, what we try to avoid, is signing low rent deals without breaker power without a lot of cross-connects for -- when the tenant can tie up the space for 15 or 20 years. So look, if we can go to a 5-year deal that -- and the economics of that deal are highly to produce a strong return on the next tranche of capital to build out in that same building, our investors win. So that's been our model for 15 years. We've been very effective at what we call warehousing inventory with wholesale users until it's time to recycle back into our resale program. And early in the life cycle of large new developments, that's how we've always played the game, and we don't plan on changing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: A few here, if I may. First, Tom, can you remind us from a competitive perspective, who you see most often out in the marketplace and how you differentiate against that next closest competitor? And then the second question has to do with sort of the cloud and enterprise verticals. You guys have done a very nice job of sort of building up a critical mass of cloud platforms; the AWS announcement today along those lines. And I'm just wondering if you're starting to see the sort of the second generation of demand coming in from the enterprises that want to take advantage of sort of the security and the consistent performance by dropping a cabinet into one of your data centers to access those cloud platforms.
Thomas M. Ray: Regarding who we compete against, look, in each of our markets, we most strongly compete against the colocation provider that has the most dense interconnection offering, the best ability to offer high-performance solutions to performance-oriented apps and workloads and the best ability to connect lots of people and, as such, reduce operating cost. So in general, you see Equinix and, by market, other companies that are very strong, and those are the guys we compete against. And how we differentiate, look, the first differentiator -- the first and most important differentiator is again for the rest of the market. It's location, location, location. It's being on top of lots of networks, and it's having a business model that drives more and more networks, more cloud providers and more capability into the data centers. So the key differentiator is against everybody else. And then how do we differentiate against -- if we're the #2 solution in the market in terms of network density and cloud density, we really do look at it of how -- what percentage of workloads and applications will see a difference in performance between us and the other guy? And we actually think that percentage is quite low in most of our markets. And so our objectives are to drive customer service and provide the best experience in our marketplace. And we think we have an excellent reputation and a very good relationship with our customers around how we serve them. And secondly, I think we are an attractive, all-in value. We -- I think we've stated before that our all-in price point per unit of capital deployed is, in some areas, lower to substantially lower than the price point of whoever the incumbent might be in that area. And so as we've said for a long time, we can still make a tremendous amount of money and get very good returns relative to the past. And we have room to run around that while still providing our customers a very strong value. So the key is understanding the application and being able to communicate with the customer, "Okay. Somebody has 280 networks, and we have 50. Does that difference really matter to you for what you're doing here?" And we find that, that discussion has legs. What was the other question, Jon? I'm sorry.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: It was on the enterprises showing up to take advantage of the cloud platforms that have been set up inside your facilities.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. I think our experience is similar to the other guys in our space, as well as the cloud guys themselves. It is working. We're seeing it, and it is accelerating. But it is -- it's not going to revolutionize our portfolio and our sales results over the next 12 months. We are seeing growth of cross-connects that is disproportionate to that of other users. We're seeing growth of cross-connects to our larger cloud partners, and we're seeing that rate of growth beginning to accelerate. So all the arrows are moving in the right direction. But it's not going to change the world overnight. And I think that's what you see from Racks and the other guys, right? So I'd say our experience is similar to the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your sales headcount versus your targets in light of the recent leadership transition in both sales and marketing. And then in Virginia, 2 questions. One is the DI-CEX deployment. Is that just a good solid win for you, kind of a one-off? Or do you view that as a magnet for incremental business that would come to you, either in the way cross-connects or just new cabinet-type deals? And then in light of the -- again in the Virginia market, in light of the Yahoo! situation and then CyrusOne opening up space later this year, yourselves opening up space, are you seeing delayed decisions by enterprises, maybe awaiting better price points as a lot of inventory comes into the market?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure. I guess -- what was the first question?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Head -- sales count.
Thomas M. Ray: Sales count -- the sales staffing. So we're -- look, I think we're making solid progress. Again the bodies in place are up 21% from when we last talked. Of course, those new bodies in place are not offramp, so they don't really add much to quota coverage right now. I think in the big picture, number one, the rate at which we are adding salespeople and getting them trained and making them productive and the rate at which we're increasing quota and productivity around quota has gone up over the last quarter. Steve Smith has been an extraordinarily strong hire and the vice presidents who've been here for a while and are working with Steve, are really producing, as are their people. So I guess, we just let our Q1 results stand for themselves and we look forward to working to build on that. Separately, we've tried to be transparent about where do we expect to drive quota coverage during the year, and we expect to drive that up substantially. So I don't know what else I can add on that, but if you want to follow on a question on that, feel free before we move on to the next topic.
Jonathan Atkin: That's fine. So DE-CIX then?
Thomas M. Ray: DE-CIX is kind of in the middle of what you said, Jonathan. I think -- we're very pleased to have them as a partner. We're pleased to have all of our public Swiss peering partners in as many of our data centers as they want to come into. It's additive to the value of our data center on the margin. It's nice. At the same time, it doesn't change the world and it -- having those partners in next to our Any2 Exchange is not meaningful to us in terms of our profitability or our stickiness with our customers. Having the European exchanges provide greater connection over to Europe is a service component that is nice to add to our portfolio, and that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Last one's the Yahoo! and CyrusOne, whether or not it's weighing on the market.
Thomas M. Ray: Virginia, look, we just -- yes, I think -- I don't know that I've seen enterprises making decisions more slowly. I just think rents are softer in Virginia now than they were 1.5 years from now, and we've been calling that out and it's playing out the way we expected. I can't say I've seen a change in leasing velocity, but perhaps this is not transparent to me off of our data.
Jonathan Atkin: And if I can just follow on another East Coast question, with New York, too, given the activity there, which industry verticals -- is it broad-based or does anything kind of stand out in terms of the type of business that you're getting there? I imagine there were a lot of carriers that connect into your building initially. That might account for some of the leasing -- the volumes. But apart from that, any particular verticals stand out?
Thomas M. Ray: Not really; I think you hit it. Again, we attack each new data center with a business plan of building value in it. So you start with the networks and you start working to bring clouds along with them. And so in terms of number of lease signings in the early days, that what has happened and it's been -- frankly, it's exceeded our expectations. It's been really good. Now with a very nice base in place, we're seeing a very broad set of demand from enterprises, including healthcare, in particular, and financial services in particular. No, not high-frequency trading. We've been clear, we don't expect to take that away from anybody else. But there are other aspects of that business that we are seeing in our funnel and we've seen nice movement from content. So it's -- if you think of it -- again, we look at it kind of this 3-legged stool of networks, clouds and then enterprises. And we talk about enterprises as separate from how we term enterprises or the content guys. Other people might call them enterprises, we could show an enterprise sales number of 50% of sales if we reconfigured our definitions. But the way we define it, we have content. That is very strong in the greater New York area. And then we have enterprise and that is doing very well for us in New York, in terms of the funnel and what we're seeing. So it's broadly based. And that evolution, once you establish some network and cloud density, toward those other verticals is a natural evolution that we've worked to achieve in each of our markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti: Questions for you. The first has to do with sublease space, and my understanding from talking to different industry participants is that there's likely more sublease space coming on the market, probably more at the wholesale level. Do you see significant amounts of sublease space within your portfolio? And what are your expectations for that going forward?
Thomas M. Ray: I think the only material sublease space I'm aware of, and frankly, it's the only sublease space I'm aware of in our portfolio is the space at SV3 in Silicon Valley. And we just took 57% of that out of the market on a 5-year term with the new customer. So we've been consistently clear for 2 years that our tenant -- our customer at SV3 isn't using a portion of their capacity and that at some point in time, we expected there to be something smart to do whereby everybody would win. And in early Q2, we -- in Q1, we executed an agreement with that customer that gave us the flexibility to go do something smart. And a couple of weeks later, we signed an attractive new lease with a customer that bid smart. It -- that set of events is NPV positive to our company, and we believe it's an attractive win for both the existing customer at SV3 and the new customer at SV3. So in our portfolio, with that building, and we've taken 57% out of the market. And we have 2 years to address the remaining 43% and now we have a mechanism in place to go do that freely where everybody can win. So we feel very good about our sublease exposure. We feel like it's small and we feel like we're in the driver's seat to be smart about dealing with it.
David Toti: Okay, that's helpful. My other question has to do with sort of capital flows within your subsector. And if we step back and we look at development nationally, it would seem that development supplies are tapering, private equities pulling out of some of the more speculative construction of the merchant building. Number one, is that true in your perspective? And number two is, are you seeing more capital then move into acquisitions? And has the acquisition market changed, in your mind, in terms of there being more bidders and potentially some compressed cap rates in certain markets?
Thomas M. Ray: So I think in terms of number of new entrants, I think that has cooled somewhat. We don't see as many new startups with $300 million of private equity money or $150 million of private equity money. That has not happened as much now as it did a couple or a few years ago. I think that the publics continue to bring capacity to market like production builders, and I haven't really seen a change in that. I don't know any of the larger publics who's saying, "In market X or Y, I'm completely out of the space. And I'm not going to bring any more to market." I think, practically, I'm not seeing anything really different from the public guys, and there you have it. On acquisitions, I think that -- I don't -- there are always small deals for people to look at. But some of those trades, I don't think many of them trade into data center guys and colo guys like us. They trade at either to PE guys or to telcos, that kind of a thing. And I don't really see the acquisition landscape as materially different. There'd be -- the reports of impending huge scale consolidation in our industry have been out there for about 3.5 years. All I can say is we get up every day and go to work and try to create value, and that's what we focus on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.
Colby Synesael: Two questions, if I may. A lot of headlines this past quarter about price reductions at public cloud providers, AWS, Google and Microsoft, Azure. Just curious, when you see stuff like that, how do you think about that as it relates to potentially impacting your business? I guess one could argue that with AWS direct connecting some of your facilities, the more demand the AWS sees, the more benefit that is to someone like yourself. But is there also a negative potential impact to that, and just kind of your thoughts on how you think about these things and how it overall impacts your business? And then, I guess, the second part, speaking specifically about Secaucus and Reston and the desire to fill that up with what you've just called, I guess, more wholesale or larger footprint type of space to kind of fill up those facilities. Just for point of clarification, are those going to be wholesale type deals, where there is no real value proposition to the ecosystems that you built into those facilities? Or did I hear you correctly that you're actually looking for customers, that may be taking large space, but also value that aspect of your business and still could ultimately become very sticky customers over time?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure. On the first one, compressing -- perhaps, compressing margins for the cloud guys, I think its impact on our industry is a function of the business model of the companies with the industry. We really focus on the part of the cloud service provider architecture that is oriented towards accessing a large volume of customers and being on top of a lot of networks that support that, and where performance matters to them. And there's a component of their architecture where that does matter and we've seen our pricing hold up just fine in that and I don't see it changing meaningfully. I haven't seen it change meaningfully, if at all. I think the other component of the cloud service provider's architecture that is, perhaps, more traditionally thought of as wholesale, a big block of space. Those guys are very intelligent buyers. And to the extent they gain market power, I think that will -- can have an impact on the wholesale sector. At the same time, I mean, I think those guys have been achieving quite favorable, customer-friendly rates for a couple of years now. And I don't see it going a lot lower. You just -- I would think for the wholesalers, you reach a point where you're just going to say no to putting capital out for that use. So I mean, that's how we look at it. I think, for us, we -- the cloud has been very good for our business and we think it will continue to be so, but we're not trying to land every piece of all -- of each cloud service provider's architecture. Regarding Secaucus in Virginia, I want to be clear, we're absolutely not trying to fill up those buildings with wholesale users. We're -- if you -- the Secaucus building is a plus or minus 20-megawatt building. I can see us going out and getting 1/3 of that leased. If we can get 1/3 of that leased on 3- or 5-year deals, that is going to be NPV, cash flow, IRR-positive to our company, but we do not want to load up those buildings as wholesalers. We're -- we didn't go there to be in the wholesale business.
Colby Synesael: Okay. And I guess, just one quick follow-up to the cloud question. Do you have -- what about, I guess, the risk that there's actually some customers that have chosen to go to the colocation route, who may potentially now look at the pricing at an AWS and ultimately change their mind, at least for a specific application, and ultimately change how they purchase services to go less to colo and more to actually directly purchasing from a cloud provider. Is that something you've seen in your business in the past? And is that something that you guys spend much time on thinking about?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we've seen it go both ways, and it's a fair point, and it's -- it does happen. It also happens and I think today, we've probably seen it balance, where somebody is purchasing cloud services with an AWS and then they reach a certain level of scale, where they rolloff and go hybrid, and then they take colocation space. So I look at the general dynamic, kind of like I've looked at Moore’s Law in our industry for the last 15 years. There've always been dynamics, a component of which will point toward less demand, right, for our business. But there've always been other dynamics that point toward greater demand. And we've -- throughout all of these changes, we've seen demand grow very, very consistently. I would say 5 years ago, we worried a lot about what you've just described and we've done a tremendous amount of work around it. And we paid a lot of attention to it and we're actually very comfortable with it now with the -- the cloud has been a friend, and we expect it to continue to be so.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Barry McCarver from Stephens, Inc.
Barry McCarver: I think you've got most of my questions, but I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. On the restructuring of the lease for SV3, is that going to have any -- a lumpy effect on churn during the year or do you think that will be pretty evenly spaced out?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Barry, in terms of the churn, we don't think it will have an impact. As Tom talked about in his prepared remarks, most -- or the customer has the option to take some of that deployment and relocate in some of our other markets. And as such, if it's advantageous for them to do so, we think that, that might be the end results. We don't think it will have much impact on the churn.
Thomas M. Ray: Sorry, I'm going to -- my CFO should kick me here, but I think it -- I think we'll be adding 20,000, 25,000 feet of churn into the system over the next 2 years, with the chunk of that in this year, maybe half of that this year was -- we hadn't built it in. It's not net churn, right, because it's already back-filled with a new lease. But in terms of gross churn, yes, I mean, we didn't factor the technical departure of that SV3 customer until 2 years from now at the end of their lease. Now that churn out will hit our gross churn number. But on a net basis, it's -- again, it's a positive to us. If it's a loss in terms of square footage, it's a positive in terms of cash flow.
Barry McCarver: That's very helpful. And then just secondly, talking about larger deals, not necessarily wholesale deals. I think we kind of beat that to death. But last quarter, you mentioned the fact that creating opportunity to bring larger deployments in was something you were focused on. Can you talk about the mix of business this quarter and maybe the pipeline for some larger deals?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think the big picture was in the latter half of 2013, we just didn't sign any, frankly, even many mid-sized deals, much less larger ones. And in Q1, we kind of saw a return to normalcy of -- and we executed a handful of 2,000-foot, 1,000-foot, 1,500 square-foot deals, which maybe those are 100-kilowatt to 200-kilowatt deals each. So these are mid-sized deals that for whatever reason, we just didn't execute on them in the second half of Q3. We have a long history of executing very well on them and we're pleased that in Q1, we again executed well. In terms of larger deals -- in terms of that business, we're optimistic that: number one, our productivity in close rates around those deals has returned to norm; and number two, that by adding more resources during the year, we're optimistic that we'll actually be able to drive sales around that up a little bit, again, by the end of the year. As for the larger deals, after 14, 15 years in this business, I've just learned that they are lumpy. There's just no way to forecast them. Our funnel is, I think, stronger around that than it's been in some time. But you never know until deals are signed. And I would -- I want to go back to the churn question. I think what we'll start doing -- what you'll probably see from us this year is you might see us report churn with, "Here's churn and here's churn excluding that one lease." And I think churn, excluding that lease, is not going to be any different than what we had been forecasting to the Street. But we'll just need to be clear about the delta with this new restructure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc.
Jordan Sadler: I wanted to just follow up on the guidance and as it relates to SV3, specifically. So 2 points here, one, your -- you did $0.49 of FFO and then you had a $0.02 charge related to the impairment. But there was also -- was it $0.02 related to the departure? So was it safe to assume that the clean number, if you will, would've been a $0.53 number, Jeff?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, Jordan. Yes, you're right. We had a $0.02 impairment charge, as we alluded to. And then if you look at the full quarter of 2014 as compared to the full quarter of 2013 for that departure, it's really about $400,000 in -- for the full quarter, difference this quarter over last. That was largely offset by with a couple of lease terminations that we received during the quarter, but it's about $400,000 for that particular departure.
Thomas M. Ray: Jordan, I think at a high level, you see the onetime cost of eliminating the COO position is essentially offset by other one-time gains, so scattering of onetime gains in Q1. And so the real delta is the $0.02 impairment on the software. And then separately, I mean -- it would be normal to say, "If your run rate is $0.51, then why did you move guidance up?" And I think that it's important to discuss quickly here. We continue -- right now, we're still evaluating the rest of our software. And so we just -- we have uncertainty as to whether we might -- as to how much longer we're going to use certain things. We just have uncertainty. So on a core basis, excluding any of those, any of that variability, there might be a little bit of upside to the midpoint of our guidance, but we're just not clear yet on those other issues. And so we stand by the guidance we've given and we're confident right now we'll make it.
Jordan Sadler: Well, I'm not going to let -- that wasn't going to be my question. So I'm going to make that your question about the guidance going higher, Tom. But in terms of the actual SV3 economics, can you kind of share a little bit more with us as it relates to that specifically? What did that look like? I mean, I assume that was 21 -- 2901 Coronado?
Thomas M. Ray: The SV3 is 2901 Coronado.
Jordan Sadler: And so that was a legacy lease at a big number. Tenant was expiring in the '16 and '17. What was the mark-to-market on that 28,000 square feet?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, we won't disclose any specific economics about either lease, the new one or the old one. We will say, we were able to offer an aggressive, a customer-friendly rental rate for the new customer, by which CoreSite, the new customer and the old customer, all came out ahead of where they otherwise would've been. And we wouldn't...
Jordan Sadler: A lease termination fee sort of helping to ease the pain there a little bit? Is that the right way to think of it?
Thomas M. Ray: The old customer, the prior customer will continue to pay some degree of rent. And so the net of the new rent and old rent is favorable compared to the old rent. And I think comparing to mark-to-market, it would be strongly negative, but we would not have done this aggressive of a deal at this point in time but for the totality of the circumstances, putting all these pieces together. And again, that's what we've been trying to say forever. We're confident there'll be a chance for us to do something smart, and we believe we just did.
Jordan Sadler: And the expiration, the remainder of the original lease, is that now a '17 or a '16 departure? The other 20% -- the 50% -- the 43% that was not dealt with.
Thomas M. Ray: 2/3 of what remains are in '16 and 1/3 of what remains is in '17.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Will we see a lease termination fee in the second quarter or third quarter, or not necessarily? And we saw in 1Q, and that's it?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, that -- Jordan, that lease termination fee in the first quarter was not associated with the particular transaction Tom's talking about at SV3. And again, as Tom alluded to, there will not be a lease termination fee going forward that you'd see on a one-time basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Petersen from MLV & Co.
Jonathan M. Petersen: I have a feeling, at some point this year, everyone's going to know -- want to know exactly how much exposure each of the data center leases has to high-frequency trading. My understanding is you have a very minimal exposure, but I just wanted to get you on the record saying that. But then also, Tom, get your overall kind of macro thoughts on if that business goes away or contracts significantly, what kind of ripple effect that might have on the New York and Jersey markets?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, guilty as charged for the company not having much high-frequency trading in our portfolio. And I'm sorry to say it, right? I mean the guys that do have very high-class problems. So we don't have that in -- to a meaningful extent in our company. And I wish we were struggling with where this is headed, but we're not. For the broader industry, again, I think there's -- we have estimated in the past that perhaps 20% of the space or capacity demand for data centers from the financial services market is HFT-related. So 80% is not. And if HFT contracts some, I don't think it's going to have a massive disruption on greater Jersey, New York. So there you go. I mean, I think it will impact a small part of that market, which has historically been enormously profitable, and we don't have much of that in here and that's not something we're proud about saying.
Jonathan M. Petersen: Well -- so when you say 20% of financial services are now having high-frequency trading, are you talking about colocation or does that include wholesale? Because I assume the HFT guys are almost entirely colocation. Is the high percent -- is it colo?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, that's colo. That's colo.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. We do have a follow-up coming from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc.
Jordan Sadler: Sorry, on the -- I have sort of a little bit of a macro question, and you've touched on it in different ways. But in terms of the overall fundamentals, you've kind of run through it by business, but some of the larger competitors in the marketplace have supposedly reduced the amount of speculative construction that's been going on. And allegedly, there's been net absorption of space. And so, I'm curious as to -- are you seeing that in those conditions? I know Northern Virginia you flagged as experiencing some pressure. But are you seeing net absorption of space and then an overall improvement in the supply-demand equilibrium?
Thomas M. Ray: I think we're starting to, Jordan, probably everywhere other than Virginia. I think we're starting to. We are optimistic that 2015 might offer a little bit better balance between supply and demand in favor of the service provider, guys like us. But right now, I think, yes, there might be fewer megs [ph] under construction or breaking ground at the moment. But if you go around at each of the major markets, each one of the publics is still selling capacity. So that the current competitive landscape, I don't think has changed much and I think the combination of additional construction starts and sublease potential in Virginia means that will be a little bit softer, a little bit longer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird.
David B. Rodgers: I got in really late, so if I -- if this is answered, I'll go back and read the transcript. But could you comment, if you haven't on any cross-connect pricing pressure that you're seeing and more broadly and even maybe within specific verticals where you're seeing greater or lesser success in getting that pricing?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure. Our -- we've not seen pressure on our cross-connects. I think there is some pressure on cross-connect pricing for providers whose price points are measurably higher than ours. But for ours, no. I mean, we actually think there's probably still room to run on that. So no, we're not seeing pressure on cross-connects. And separately, I think it can be challenging to kind of follow the delta between Open-IX and public peering and cross-connects and on the Open -- or on the public peering side of our business, we're not seeing any pressure on our rates at all because our rates are incredibly low. Our -- look, our average port price across our company is now in the order of $300 a month. And so Equinix might have gone from $3,500 to $5,000, 3 or 4 years ago to $1,500 to $1,000 now. We offer our ports, our -- that business is at best a breakeven business, and that's at scale. So I think if you talked with the MCIX guys and the DE-CIX guys and the providers that things like Open-IX are trying to bring in the data centers, I think those providers would tell you their breakeven for their members is north of our price. So no, we're not seeing any pressure on our prices at all. We actually think we still have room to run and I mean, that's where we stand in the market.
David B. Rodgers: Okay. Second question, and I appreciate that color. With regard to Santa Clara in Northern California, the demand for you and some of your peers seems to be improving again after it had kind of lulled for a while. Anything incrementally new in that market in terms of driving demand or is it just kind of the same types of customers, but they finally kind of revived with lower overall new supply?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I guess the only thing different that we would point to, that we've seen is, we've done some more business now with offshore companies, Asia-based companies. So I think there's more of -- there's more native deployment from those guys now, as opposed to going through -- as opposed to just taking colo with a U.S. reseller or a U.S. guy, they are now putting more architecture across the water.
Operator: At this time, we have no further questions. I will turn the call the back over to Tom Ray for closing comments.
Thomas M. Ray: Thank you very much. And thanks, everybody, for sharing time with us today. Well, look, we're pleased that our Q1 results showed good financial results, but most importantly to us, frankly, strengthening, accelerating sales and importantly, accelerating sales productivity. We've been through a tremendous amount of change over the last couple of years and a tremendous amount of change over the last handful of months. And we're just proud of and thankful for the skill and the energy and the heart of our colleagues here at CoreSite. We feel like we have good things going on, that there is very strong momentum that we've captured in Q1 and we can keep driving throughout the year. So we're pretty darned excited. It's because of the people here, and we're thankful. As we go forward, look, we're just trying to drive clarity, focus and execution around the existing portfolio and the development deals we have ongoing right now. And with that, we're going to work hard to keep growing our company and driving strong returns to our investors. Thank you, again.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-02-13 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn in over to our host, Derek McCandless, Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Thank you, you may begin.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2013 conference call. I'm joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Ray: Thanks, Derek. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'll discuss highlights of our financial results, review our sales results and update our view of market conditions. Jeff will then present a detailed review of our financial results, development activity and balance sheet position and then provide insight into our 2014 guidance and outlook. Regarding our fourth quarter financial results. We reported revenue growth of 1% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% sequentially and 17% year over year, and FFO growth of 5.6% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. For the full year 2013 compared into 2012 we recorded revenue growth of 13.5%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 20.5% and FFO growth of 18.5%. Interpreting to our earnings growth in 2013 over 2012, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin by 270 basis points from 43.2% to 45.9%, driven by a more profitable sales mix, including increasing revenue from breakered amp power and interconnection services. Regarding new and expansion TKD sales. In Q4 we executed new and expansion leases representing annualized GAAP rental revenue of $3.5 million comprised of 122 leases representing 26,276 square feet at an average GAAP rental rate of $132 per square foot. Total sales production of $3.5 million for the quarter is approximately 30% below our year-to-date average of quarterly GAAP rent signed. While transaction volume has continued to increase, in Q4 we did not sign any leases exceeding 10,000 square feet and only one lease exceeding 2000 square feet. This drove down our average lease size to 215 square feet in Q4, more than 35% below the average size of new and expansion leases executed in the first three quarters of 2013 and 45% below the average size in 2012. We attribute the decline in lease size to two factors. First, our transaction engine selling smaller blocks of space has shown accelerating strength with transaction count of new and expansion leases signed in 2013 increasing 34% over 2012. At the same time however in the second half of 2013, we saw fewer execution of larger leases due to what we believe is a combination of normal lumpiness in this category as well as certain correctible dynamics in our sales engine. Regarding pricing, the $132 average rental rate in Q4 new and expansion leases is 30% below our average through the first three quarters of the year. Geographic mix played a role in this dynamic. Specifically included in our Q4 results are 14 new leases signed at our newly opened NY2 site in Secaucus representing 44% of the square footage signed in the quarter at a GAAP rental rate of $122 per square foot. This reflects the aggressive pricing we anticipated offering as we open the data center and began to build sales traction in the community of customers we seek to create value in the asset. Outside of NY2, in Q4 our average GAAP rental rate in new and expansion leases was $140 per square foot or 8% below the trailing 12 month average. I will take a moment now to offer a higher level view of our sales engine in 2013 and our goals for 2014. Although our sales for 2013 reflects strong execution in certain areas, there are areas where we believe we should, can and will perform better. Over the past several years and throughout 2013 we’ve been pleased with our production in our network and cloud verticals. And as we mentioned the growth in transaction volume and total sales volume and leases on breakered-amp model and those generating a greater number of interconnections has been encouraging. However in light of the added resources we brought to bear we’ve not achieved the accelerated volume of new and expansion GAAP rents sold that we would expect from ourselves in these additional resources. Recognizing this, as we closed out 2013 we conducted a deep dive around our sales productivity. Our work identified two key areas where we believe we can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the resources we’ve added over the past two years. The first area where we expect 2014 to materially strengthen over 2013 is that of staffing levels of our quota-bearing sales force. In 2013 we did not hire as many reps as we planned and we had higher losses among our in place quota bearing team than we had anticipated. This led to our number of off-ramp [ph] quota bearing raps not increasing materially during 2013. Our goal in 2014 is to execute upon the plans we made in 2013 and ramp up tenured quota bearing headcount steadily through the year. Specifically our current plans call for us to close out 2014 with approximately 35% more quota coverage than was in place early this quarter and on average through 2013. The second area where we believe we are moving the needle in 2014 is in sales and marketing leadership. As we sit on today’s call we've repositioned and rebuilt the leadership in sales and marketing and have a strong and motivated team eager to execute going forward The combination of the factors just discussed, increasing quota bearing staffing levels, having a strong leadership team in place and learning from our deep dive as the year ended, has us well-positioned to accelerate sales in line with our objectives from last year. We believe we are well-positioned to increase our efficiency and effectiveness in hiring, on-boarding, training, leading and retaining our quota bearing sales team. All key ingredients to executing upon the goals for the year. Key among CoreSite’s professionals is a new addition to our executive team. Steve Smith, senior vice president of sales. Steve has a proven track record of success throughout his career as a sales leader and deep industry relationships across the technology landscape We’re excited to welcome Steve aboard and are confident that he is well-positioned to lead our sales and sales enablement organizations going forward. Throughout 2013 we continued to see strong recent momentum in our network and cloud verticals, both in terms of transaction volume and the nature of the deployments brought to our platform increasing the value of our data centers. Specifically in 2013 the number of new and expansion leases signed in our network and cloud verticals represented a 27% increase over 2012. Related to our cloud verticals specifically, we are very pleased with cross customer adoption of our Open Cloud Exchange, which has added members at an accelerating pace since its launch in early 2013. Also in 2013 our content and enterprise teams continued to generate steady production relative to 2012. Offsetting our strong and accelerated success in network and cloud and our steady performance in content and enterprise, our systems integrator vertical reflected a material decline in 2013 in terms of both lease count and square footage. This decline materially contributed to our negative variance to expectations in the number of larger leases signed in the year. We believe that leasing volume in the systems integrator vertical is likely to rebound in the coming year and we will keep you apprised of this dynamic. To put 2013 into perspective, we will use as a frame of reference the analogy between our approach to building sustainable value in our data centers and building a luxury mall. Over the past three years we've had strong and accelerating success in landing the key anchor customers that we believe create the foundation for sustainable and attractive returns on capital. Transaction volume with the anchors has increased. We brought valuable new customer service offerings to our platform and more target customers are deployed in multiple CoreSite locations than ever before. We believe that our more recent sales mix has driven increasing profitability in our reporting -- reported earnings results with expanding margins supported by increasing revenue from interconnection services and breakered power which represented more than 60% of total power revenue for the full year, up from 50% two years ago. Continuing with the luxury mall analogy, we see the enterprise in our business as analogous to the inline store in the luxury mall business, a key ingredient towards monetizing the value of the network and cloud anchors we’ve built into our platform. As we look ahead into 2014 and beyond, we see strong opportunity to increase sales to enterprises and drive the same kind of growth in this segment that we’ve realized in network and cloud. We’ve had steady success in the enterprise segment in the past and we believe that now is the right time to add resources and focus around the enterprise as the natural next step in monetizing our strengths in network and cloud. As such, the majority of the open quota bearing positions we seek to fill in 2014 are in our enterprise segment, as our network, cloud and other teams are well staffed and producing solid results. We will update you on our progress over the coming year as we work to accelerate sales volume in the enterprise and drive a higher volume of sales overall. Turning to our view of the markets where we participate. In 2014, we will continue to watch the Bay area, Northern Virginia and New York New Jersey, following a year marked by lower rental rates for undifferentiated requirements. We view the Bay area as substantially similar to 2013 with minimal rent growth in 2014. We’ve seen a pickup in demand activity in New York New Jersey, although there remains a large supply of available capacity in that market. We believe that Northern Virginia may see moderately softening rents for un-differentiated requirements. As the number of suppliers has increased in the Yahoo! Sub-lease exposure weighs on the market. With respect to performance sensitive colocation, we continue to see absorption levels and total revenue per square foot as substantially similar to 2013. In general, across the broader data center landscape we expect 2014 to remain highly competitive across our markets. That said, we are encouraged by a reduction in speculative development and we believe this may lead to healthier pricing environment for all participants in 2015. In summarizing 2013, we were pleased to deliver strong financial growth driven by expanding margins, supported by interconnection services and a meaningful increase in the number of transactions for requirements that offer a more attractive pricing model. We were also pleased by our continued strong sales in our network and cloud verticals. As we executed on our strategy of winning [ph] valuable anchor deployments across our platform. As we look to 2014, we believe we have the right leadership team in sales, marketing, and across our company. We also believe that we have a strong opportunity to leverage our core capabilities to drive sales and profitably grow revenue to deliver attractive returns on capital. With that I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Finnin: Thanks, Tom and hello everyone. I will begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q4 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development activity. Third, I will provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity, and fourth, I will introduce our guidance for the year. Before I review the financials, I would like to point out that we have enhanced our disclosures in our earnings press release and quarterly supplemental around the components of our operating revenue. On Page 12 of our supplemental, we are providing more transparency into data center revenues by segregating the office and light industrial revenue separately. We have provided the new revenue breakout incorporating these changes for the trailing four quarters in the appendix on the earnings supplemental on page 22. Our fourth quarter data center revenues were $59.4 million, a 1.2% increase on a sequential basis and an 11.6% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Q4 data center revenue consisted of $49.7 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 1% sequentially and 11.9% year-over-year, $7.9 million from interconnection services revenue, an increase of 5.7% sequentially and 23.5% year-over-year and $1.9 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue were $2 million, an increase of 6.2% from the third quarter and 1.8% year-over-year. In addition to the more granular revenue presentation, we have included two new metrics on page 10 of our quarterly supplemental. Same-store turnkey data center monthly recurring revenue per cabinet or same-store MRR per cabby and occupancy rates to provide the investment community greater visibility around our data center revenue performance. As you can see, we have been able to drive an increase in same-store MRR per cabby of nearly 11% year-over-year on a fairly consistent occupancy rate. Our interconnection services revenue continues to lead our overall sales growth and grew nearly 24% over the prior year fourth quarter. Interconnection revenue now represents 13% of total data center revenue compared to 7% in the fourth quarter of 2010, which has meaningfully contributed to our growth in profitability over the same time period. Going forward, we will expect interconnection volume to continue to show strong growth as we further build network density across our operating portfolio. Q4 commencements including the build to suit powered shell at SV5 represented $4.8 million of annualized GAAP revenue, comprised of approximately 116,052 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $41 per square foot. Excluding the lease at SV5, commencements totaled 14,331 NRSF at an annualized GAAP rate of $116 per square foot. And for all of 2013, the GAAP rate per square foot was $157, excluding the SV5 build to suit. Renewals in the fourth quarter totaled 50,513 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $135 per square foot and represented mark to market growth of 3.5% and 14.3% on a cash and GAAP basis respectively. For the full year, cash rent growth of 3.6% was in line with our guidance range and reflects the market conditions over the last 12 months as well as the maturation of our portfolio. Churn in the fourth quarter was 1.9%, bringing the full year rate to 7.8% which came in at the higher end of our expectations. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $4.3 million with approximately one-quarter attributable to leases signed at NY2. We expect approximately 60% of the backlog to commence in the first half of 2014. Of the remaining amount, 30% should commence in the third quarter of 2014 with the remainder commencing in the subsequent two quarters. Our fourth quarter FFO was $0.49 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 4.3% on a sequential quarter basis and a 16.7% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $28.3 million increased 3.1% sequentially and 17.2% over the same quarter last year. Our full year 2013 results reflect revenue of $234.8 million, an increase of 13.5% over $206.9 million from 2012. Our adjusted EBITDA of $107.8 million increased 20.6% from $89.4 million in 2012. As Tom mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 270 basis points to 45.9% of revenue from 43.2% in 2012. FFO for the full year was $85.3 million, an increase of 18.5% over a 2012 amount of $72 million while FFO per diluted share in unit increased 17.4% year-over-year to $1.82. This represents revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 66% and 48% respectively. Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately 5.7% of revenue, up 40 basis points sequentially, although still below the estimated range of 6 to 6.5% that we previously provided due to the timing of hiring around sales and marketing resources. Going forward, we would expect this metric to be in line with the targeted range of 6 to 6.5% as we continue to strategically invest in and align our internal sales resources. Our G&A expenses were 11.5% of revenue, down 20 basis points from the previous quarter and slightly below our guidance of approximately 12% of revenue. We expect G&A expenses to be approximately 11% going forward. The only exception to this is the first quarter, which will be higher as a percent of total revenue, reflecting the elimination of the Chief Operating Officer role. The charge in Q1 will be approximately $1 million or $0.02 per share to FFO. As shown on page 18 of our supplemental, we spent $2.7 million during the fourth quarter and $8.6 million for the full year related to ongoing repair and maintenance expenditures. As of December 31, 2013, our stabilized operating data center portfolio was 81.7% occupied. Including leases executed but not yet commenced, our occupancy rate would be 83.3%. Now switching to development activity. 2013 represented our largest year of capital investment with three ground up developments underway concurrently as well as ongoing development activity in certain markets across our portfolio to meet customer demand. In early December, we delivered 18,000 net rentable square feet of turnkey data center capacity and the first computer room in Phase 1 of our new NY2 data center in Secaucus, New Jersey. The next two computer rooms of turnkey data center capacity are on schedule to be delivered in the first quarter and represent an incremental 35,000 NRSF of capacity. We look forward to capitalizing on favorable market conditions by expanding our presence in one of the largest addressable markets in the world. NY2 brings to market a secure, reliable and cost effective solution to a wide range of mission-critical, high performance data center requirements among enterprises and other key customer verticals including cloud, network and content service providers. At the end of the fourth quarter, the first computer room was 63.5% leased and we expect the positive momentum to continue at NY2 as we add additional capacity. The build to suit for a strategic customer at SV5 was completed and delivered on schedule in the fourth quarter and is now reflected in our stabilized operating pool. As we mentioned last quarter, while rent did commence upon delivery of the powered shell, we anticipate the customer will ramp up its power draw in the second half of 2014 as it builds its own data center infrastructure. At LA2, we are on track to deliver an additional 33,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity in the first quarter, reflecting the solid demand we have seen in the LA market over the last 12 months and the corresponding increase in LA2 occupancy over the same time period. At our Reston, Virginia campus, we expect to complete the first phase of our VA2 development in late Q2 or early Q3. Our occupancy has increased at VA1 over the last 12 months and we will continue to focus on driving sales at this facility while the new capacity is under development. Based on the demand at VA1, we believe VA2 will provide our customers with the flexibility and scalability to accommodate their needs in the Northern Virginia market to support their growth plans. As we discussed with you last quarter, as we complete our development projects, we will see a reduction in the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance associated with the development which will result in a corresponding increase in the amount of operating expense to the company. This is something to keep in mind as you think about your models for 2014 as it relates to our development activity. Page 18 of our supplemental provides enhanced disclosure related to our capital expenditures by breaking out the amounts attributable to data center expansion, non-recurring investment, tenant improvement and recurring capital expenditures. Turning to our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2013, our debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.1 times. And if you include our preferred stock, it is 3.1 times. We anticipate our leverage to increase as we continue to execute our capital spending plans with the aforementioned development projects. As we have discussed previously, we target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4 times. As of December 31, 2013, we had $174.3 million drawn on our credit facility and approximately $222 million of available capacity under the facility. On January 31, 2014, we entered into a new $100 million five year senior unsecured term loan which contains the same financial covenants and other customary covenants as our current credit facility. The term loan has an accordion feature which allows us to increase the total commitments by an incremental $100 million to $200 million. The proceeds from the term loan were used to retire the $58 million mortgaged on our SV1 facility and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. We also entered into a $100 million interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate in order to protect against adverse fluctuations in LIBOR. At our current leverage ratio the swap effectively fixes the interest rate at 3.23%. This financing enables us to secure an attractive interest rate, balance our debt maturities and create capacity on our line of credit to support additional investment. Our debt profile is now entirely unsecured which we believe is another important step toward our long term goal of obtaining an investment grade rating. Lastly, during the quarter we announced our Board of Directors had approved an increase in our dividend for the third consecutive year. We increased our dividend by 30% to $0.35 per share on a quarterly basis or $1.40 per share on an annual basis. This new annual rate represents an increase of nearly 170% from the annualized Q4 2010 level. We remain focused on maintaining our dividend payout levels to comply with our REIT requirements, balanced with our need to retain cash to invest in and grow our portfolio. And now in closing, I’d like to address guidance for 2014. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our market as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio, resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity, other than what we’ve discussed today. As provided on page 21 of our supplemental, our guidance for 2014 is as follows. FFO per share in OP unit is estimated to be $2 to $2.10. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $260 million to $270 million. Data center revenue is estimated to be $255 million to $265 million. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $28 million to $30 million or approximately 11% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to $120 million to $125 million. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows. Estimated churn rate per quarter of 1 to 2%. Please note this is not net of increases in our rent growth as we will report those amounts separately. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 1% to 4% for the full year, in line with our expectations for more moderate cash rent growth that we discussed last quarter. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $115 million to $145 million. The components are comprised of data center expansion, estimated to be $90 million to $105 million. This includes the expansion capital related to development activity at VA2 and the continued build out of NY2. Non-recurring investments are estimated to be $15 million to $20 million and include amounts related to our on core IT initiative, facilities upgrades and other capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures and tenant improvement are each estimated to be $5 million to $10 million. Now we’d like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Jordan Sadler: Thank you and good morning out there. First question is regarding the leasing that’s sort of embedded in your guidance. I’ve got the operating revenue number of 260 to 270 that’s helpful along with the data center revenue, but kind of curious what’s embedded in there in terms of the net go get or speculative lease up and how you sort of devise that plan given sort of the restructuring of the sales organization recently.
Tom Ray: Well Jordan I think that first, and Jeff can give you the exact figures, but our backlog, our contracted but not yet commenced backlog going into 2014 or exiting 2013 is lower, substantially lower than it was the year before. And that’s 6 million versus – I’m sorry, what are the two numbers?
Jeff Finnin: I’m sorry, it was $4.3 million at the end of 2013 compared to 10.3 million at the end of 2012.
Tom Ray: So that’s a component of the build into 2013, and then really Jordan, the rest of it you can reverse engineer into what we think we're going to sell. I would say in terms of the quarterly trajectory as we said on the call the amount off ramp or the effective quota coverage in place at the beginning of 2014 was not substantially different than it was the average for 2013, and we do expect to increase quota coverage on the order of 35% ratably through this year. And we expect sales to come in roughly in line with the increase in quota coverage. That said, the quota coverage really relates more to or it’s more mathematically tied to the production of the smaller deals. One of the issues we've identified for ourselves and for the Street is that in the latter half, the last two Qs of 2013, we didn’t really sign any anywhere near as many larger deals as we have for a long, long time. And so it’s hard to predict that piece of our business going forward, I would say we’re underwriting a healthy bounce back in that business but it’s really hard to predict the timing.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that’s helpful. And then I noted the strength in the network and cloud business you discussed and it’s kind of continued and that’s sort of some helpful color. It’s interesting that the weaknesses on the enterprise side. Have you seen any pushback whatsoever from customers in the marketplace as it relates to the Open IX initiatives or just some of these other competitors coming into the space?
Tom Ray: Well, first, you know, the softness – the weakness in 2013 was in the systems integrator vertical, while our enterprise business stayed very constant. We are investing in it, we want to ramp it up and get the same kind of growth that we got over the last two years out of network and cloud but our enterprise business has remained very steady. We think we can do a lot more with it. But the negative variance to expectations in ’13 was in systems integrators and that, Jordon, wasn’t a market share issue that those guys went somewhere else because of Open IX or competition, our read of the market is that segment, the systems integrator segment, frankly just had a lot less demand that was executed in 2013. Then I think, more broadly, what’s the impact of Open IX, what’s the impact of competition? I really don’t think Open IX today, as we stand here today, has had any impact at all on our business. Both, in terms of anecdotes and discussions with sales team and with customers and in terms of clinical results. I think competition has gotten greater, has increased over the last handful of years, certainly the last two years and that’s, I think, played a role, right, that’s played a role in rents and we’ve been talking about that since we went public and so I think competition definitely plays a role. We do feel that going forward in ’14 we’re pretty optimistic.
Jordan Sadler: But you don’t see – so you’re saying you do see potential pressure in rents in the network and cloud segments?
Tom Ray: No, we really haven’t – you know, the competitive dynamic really plays out much more so in the undifferentiated area and there are – the difference between performance sensitive and undifferentiated is not a bright line and so there are some pieces of our business that I think have just not been impacted – the margin, the rent, the cross connect revenue per unit it’s just not been impacted and there are some other portion of the business that has been impacted over the last few years by competition. And all that said, I think we’ve gotten better and better and I do think our results show that we’re capturing a greater share of the more valuable stuff. The really issue is, the second half of the year we didn’t sign big deals and we believe that we will sign more of them again this year.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you for the time.
Tom Ray: You got it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. A few if I may. First, I just wanted to make sure I understood what you were saying about the charge with Jarrett. It’s about a $1 million charge in the first quarter and a $0.02 impact to FFO?
Jarrett Appleby: That’s correct.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Okay. Great. Because that is not something that we were previously modeling. I have a question for you, Tom. Just in terms of cloud, cloud development and CoreSite’s role in that process. You know, one of the things that we’ve seen, I think, sort of really high with cloud adoption is that there has been a ton of elastic compute if you will but more of a hybrid cloud has turned into a handful of SaaS based applications and then maybe cloud-based – proprietary cloud-based storage and a lot of that is occurring currently over the public internet and I think that over time there’s a vision here that you’re going to need higher security and higher performance and so I was just wondering how CoreSite plays into that and if that line is up with your perspective on cloud evolution? Thanks.
Tom Ray: We agree very, very strongly, Jonathan. And at the highest level we believe very strongly that the enterprise requirement, the cloud capability and the network capability are really three legs of a datacenter stool if you will, it’s no one is as profitable or as deep of a pool as bringing all those together. And we are convinced that on the network side of that equation SLA-based secured, private connectivity is currently vital to a number of workloads and applications and will increase quite dramatically, so, you know, you saw us attack that with the Open Cloud Exchange, it’s a Ethernet-based offering that provides an SLA private, dedicated, secure and rapid ramp-up solution. We are clearly aware of MPLS capabilities around the space in the network, we’re clearly aware of private IP and both in terms of the services that we offer, the solutions we offer around those technologies and in terms of our targeting of our customers and the anchors in our malls, we’re keenly aware of that and it’s a very high focus for us. And I would say, we feel like we’ve had a lot of success at it and we’re in very healthy conversations with the right people, the right groups, who drive this going forward and we’re very excited about 2014.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great. As a follow-up question to that in terms of who the right folks are as you yourself, that value proposition, because we’re probably now talking about very large scale, you know, couple of cabinets, in order to provide that secure connection to give the high performance reach to the SaaS applications. Is that a sales process that goes through, you know, the network administrator or is that a C-level conversation for you guys and does that create a challenge for you as you look to add more some of the large footprint stuff, is it the same audience that you’re talking to or is it a different audience? Thanks.
Tom Ray: No, it’s an executive level conversation, it’s a platform level discussion for us and it has been for a number of years and nothing about that has changed. Jonathan, I didn’t really understand your question about the – is it an issue with the larger deals, can you explain that a little more.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Oh, I was just saying that, you know, one or two cabinet level discussion often doesn’t have to be a C-level discussion in the sale process and if you’re doing a large footprint deal that’s usually a C-level discussion. I was just trying to understand where the sales emphasis was, what are the same –
Tom Ray: Yeah, I would look at it differently, you know, Jonathan, I think the one or two cabinet deployment discussion that is not highly strategic to the customer is not a C-level discussion. What I mean is, look, if you’re going to – if Verizon is standing up private IP or our great relationship with Time Warner around their scalable products, their private and secure products, those deployments might be in a handful of cabinets but the discussion around the companies partnering together over those handful of cabinets across the platform that is an executive level discussion.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great. Thank you for that insight. If I can ask just one more question, are you seeing any difference in sort of the customer mix as you see demand evolve in the New York market versus your historic markets?
Tom Ray: Well, I think that our approach to NY2 specifically is – and there’s no change to what we said in the past, it’s a big building and so it’s economically rational for us to drive sales with more volume early and we will cast a wider net as we do that and that wider net will have some deals that get done at less attractive margins and then as you get more of the capital generating revenue and EBITDA then you get increasingly selective. And so in the early days we’re very focused on strategic execution in New Jersey in exactly the same way we have been and remain across the rest of our portfolio. There are very specific clouds and there are very specific not only networks but network solutions that we’re targeting – you know that we’re targeting to get into the building and many of which have already committed to come to the building. And then beyond that, in the early days, we will do more undifferentiated type transactions and then as we get more of that fold we’ll get increasingly selective and look to drive the same store and that’s the same movie that’s played out in every asset we built over the last 14 years.
Jonathan Schildkraut: Great. Thank you for taking the questions.
Tom Ray: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [Emmanuel Horshman with Citi.] Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. Tom, in the past you have talked about sort of staffing difficulties especially in the enterprise segment and you kind of had this discussion on stabilizing the go-to-market platform a couple of times now, what changes the sun runner, you know, made what changes in your search for those sales people you discussed or otherwise.
Tom Ray: Yeah, firstly, entirely fair question and frankly that we’re asking ourselves that question, is what led to our deep dive at the end of Q4 and led to our approach now to 2014 that we’re very excited about. And I think on the trail just what we’ve seen is some turnover from folks who had opportunity – if you’re head of sales you get the opportunity the CEO of XO Communications, there’s not much you can do about that after you hire them and if that person takes a key person that’s worked with him for 14 years, you know, that’s going to happen. The key is making sure that the people we bring in are extraordinarily excited about being at CoreSite in the role that they – and the opportunities at CoreSite and that they’re attuned to the size of our business and the method of working that fits well with that. And we’re incredibly excited about Steve, he’s just – he’s been here long enough for us to really know that we found something wonderful there. And as to the rest of the sales and marketing team, frankly most of that organization has been here for a little while and were either promoted up to or in some cases promoted back into roles they had two years ago, so that’s a pretty well-known quantity. And we just feel it’s effective and efficient and highly visible. And again, we are sincerely excited about next year, but your question is valid and that’s how we think we’re moving the needle going forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for that, Tom. Maybe focusing on New Jersey for another second. In your prepared remarks you discussed that those leases were – let’s call them – more highly incentivized than some others because you want to get those anchor tenants in there. How far off are those from sort of where you think a run rate or a stabilized rate would be for the asset.
Tom Ray: Well, you know, look, I think over time I would expect New York or New Jersey NY2 to be substantially similar to the Bay Area in Virginia. I would say, we disclosed, we signed 14 deals and some component of that are a little bit larger sized deployments obviously not too large because we didn’t get really large deals in Q3 or Q4 but a little bit larger size requirements with aggressive pricing. But another portion of the ’14 and a meaningful portion of the ’14 are those advance network deployments in those case there’s sometimes the two cabinets are free, and so, look – it’s very, very early to NY2, we’re building the components that we devalue but I would expect the overall ARPU and EBITDA per dollar capital NY2 to be not dissimilar to our other major markets.
Unidentified Analyst: And thanks. Just staying in New Jersey for one more second. Jeff, if we’re thinking about the operating expense ramp especially as you deliver another 35,000 square feet coming up here, when do those operating expenses have less of a detriment on your numbers or how, I guess, should we think about the yield increase stabilizing in that phase of [indiscernible]
Jeff Finnin: Well, I think as you look through 2014, obviously we’ll be bringing on those last two – or the incremental two will return this quarter. Essentially we have to staff that data center with the facilities and operations capability that we need from day one and so those dollars would be incurred here as we start the year. In terms of ultimately how do those – that’s stabilization, that’s occurring at the beginning of the year ultimately the objective being, as we continue to lease it up, to begin covering those operating expenses as we get through 2014.
Unidentified Analyst: Is it going to be incremental going through the year or is it on day one you have sort of full staffing and then that stays the same throughout the year?
Jeff Finnin: I think it’s pretty full staffing on day one but we don’t – at this point we don’t envision adding incremental capacity other than the two computer rooms that we’re talking about in Q1 and so essentially at that point we’re pretty well staffed with our people, as we hit the 2014.
Tom Ray: And the issue on the sales side is most of the those bodies are here but many of them are new so they’re still on ramp and they’re not yet productive and, you know, in the prepared remarks we said we expect in place quota coverage to increase 35% by the end of the year. And that’s really a function of a lot of the headcount that here burning in and getting off of ramp and picking up their quotes. And we have, I think, probably 50% more bodies to land in the seats in the sales – code bearing sales engine that are in place now. I would also say we have open racks and a lot of those are in interviews or offering letters go out the doors. So, look, we expect to be pretty well staffed across sales this quarter and expect productivity to ramp in through the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks so much guys.
Tom Ray: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator’s Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
David B. Rodgers: Yes, good morning. Tom, I guess a question for you. I’ve been going back to the enterprise vertical discussion, you know, you spent the last several years trying to root out a lot of the lower productivity, lower efficiency type customer’s requirements in the portfolio and letting those expire and now you go back to enterprise. And so, I guess, one is is can you continue to achieve the high level of productivity and the strategic customers through the enterprise vertical do you think or have you kind of gone under the portfolio looking at parsing out spaces where enterprise is maybe more appropriate than a strategic retail-oriented customer on a smaller basis, maybe – any color around kind of where the productivity would be in the new customers as you move forward?
Tom Ray: You bet, Dave. And again, we’ve really dissected the customer base, the customer opportunity, the market opportunity, the vast majority of what turned out as unattractive over the last couple of years was content and hosting. And the enterprise applications you seek are the ones that still need value benefit from the network access and the cloud support and in certain instances the other enterprises around them. So, we continue to grow our enterprise vertical in L.A. around media and entertainment. And those enterprises are highly interconnected to not on public cloud and storage and other utilities and capabilities and to networks but also to each other and that is very attractive business. And I’ll be honest, Dave, look, five years ago, we didn’t really pay attention to the difference, you didn’t really need to. We’re very aware of the difference now and we’re not saying that – I want to make sure that everybody is really clear on the distinction between enterprise and separately content or some components of CDM and in particular hosting. There are big pieces of enterprise business that are very attractive and there are some that aren’t and we spend our time on the former and not the latter. So, no, I think there’s a lot of fertile ground yet to be ploughed.
David B. Rodgers: Okay. And then maybe last question, you kind of indirectly referenced it earlier but talking about cross-connect pricing. Any pressure anywhere that you’re seeing on kind of the more sensitive application related cross-connect pricing?
Tom Ray: I haven’t seen any difference in cross-connect pricing for the last – I don’t know how many years, Dave, you know, three, five, seven, eight, whatever. I mean, the big guys, the big customers with lots of cross-connects have always received very attractive volume discounts and I think they’ve received them from us and from all of our competitors, no matter how you rank the competitor. And I think I haven’t seen those discounts really change. They are deep and attractive and they haven’t changed. And the retail rate for the customer who takes a handful across mix, I haven’t seen that under pressure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Barry McCarver with Stephens.
Barry McCarver: Hey good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. And switch over to interconnection revenue for a minute. You highlighted that it continues to be a real strong driver for total revenue growth. Can you think about over the next couple years how do we think about that continuing be a driver? Do you look at the average cross-connects to see what the ongoing opportunity for that is in the next couple years?
Tom Ray: We disclosed our cross-connect volume growth rate. I don’t know if we put in our prepared remarks – this is something we just forgot but we have been communicating that every quarter and we are happy to continue to do so. And so I was just encouraged the modeling to assume that the average price remains constant and the historical trend around volume has been very consistent on the trail. And we will continue to update you every quarter on what that further trend is but it's been remarkably – the growth rate of volume has been remarkably steady for quite some time. I don't see industry dynamics that point to that changing. You will have to model whatever you think you should model. But the industry seems to be in line and we will continue to update that metric every quarter.
Jeff Finnin: And Barry, just to give you some granularity around that. I think in the past we’ve always disclosed, it’s been right around the mid to high teens and that's fairly – fiber cross connects in the mid to high teens.
Barry McCarver: Well, I certain think it will continue – I just wanted to hear that you felt the same way and it sounds like you do. And one other question, in your prepared comments, when you were talking specifically about some of your markets, you said in the Bay Area, not much chance for rent growth there. I didn't catch why you said it, so is that just a function of capacity in the overall market?
Tom Ray: Well, yes but importantly it’s a function of the number of competitors with enough capacity to compete for business. So there are brokerage reports that come out each year from the larger real estate brokerage firms and they point toward a more favorable supply and demand dynamic in terms of total megawatts of supply versus trailing annual absorption. Those point to some strengthening in Virginia right now or in the Bay Area and in Virginia right now. I think our current experience is different than that. It's not negative, it’s not declining but it is – there are still a lot of competitors with enough capacity. And so I just think as long as that remains the case you’re not going to see rent growth by any material component. I do think that development – especially spec development has decelerated somewhat and I think that could point toward a more favorable environment in 2015 as some of the competitive with previously built spec stage there is now, running out of capacity and I think there could be a more favourable environment coming around next year.
Barry McCarver: Thanks guys.
Tom Ray: Thanks Barry.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jonathan Atkin: I was wondering if you could give us a flavour of how much of your business now is multi-natural in nature and has that changed notably in the last few quarters? And then secondly in terms of the decision cycle on a like for like basis within the performance segment and the undifferentiated segments, are you noticing any changes in terms of the vision?
Tom Ray: Jon, first on the multi-market we will come up with the stat here. I can tell you – it continues to grow, and I think a lot of that is because of large numbers right, the larger your embedded customer base becomes, the more you’re working with those same customers across multiple a markets. so it continues to go up and we will get you that number in a minute. And then as to decision cycles, more broadly and in performance sensitive areas I have seen a really big change yet, I think we saw some enterprise decisions get deferred in the last half of last year. But I would say the network and cloud guys it's been pretty consistent. So on balance I take a little bit longer cycles around the enterprise and that’s it. Do we have the data on multiple market?
Jeff Finnin: Hey Jon, we have given this in the past, I just don’t think we included it in the script today. But in the fourth quarter we had 41 transactions out of our total of 12 of 2200 that were multi-market deals, that’s an increase year-over-year in about 40%. But that’s fairly consistent with what we’ve seen in Q2, Q3 and Q4 in terms of number of deals that have been multi-market.
Jonathan Atkin: And then real quickly on pricing for kind of interconnect “retail high deals” compared to this behaviour are you seeing any changes in folks that you are competing with on those requirements.
Tom Ray: I think that it’s consistent with the past Jonathan. The really good deployments, the sophisticated providers, create long-term value, have been very competitive quite some time and remain very competitive. Undifferentiated is very competitive, there's been that others thought -- don't know -- the companies that come to a data center we are provider, because the Yankees that there have been place and I think pricing around those, experience is it’s firm. The smart guys have always thought really hard for the anchors. It’s bought comments you a data center provider. It’s been fierce, it doesn’t hang of the aggregate, it hasn’t changed in 10 years. it remains fierce. Once you have the anchor, the pricing around the in-line store that comes with the anchor has been very steady.
Jonathan Atkin: Great. Thank you very much.
Tom Ray: Thanks Jon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes, good morning everyone. The first question is just a deep dive around this idea of big deals coming back in ’15. I know LinkedIN on their earnings call talked about moving to new leases of data centers base in 2015. But I am curious specifically what you are seeing that kind of give me that encouragement, that, that piece of the business comes back in ’14?
Tom Ray: Well, first I want to be clear about what we are seeing, we say big deals, we are not talking about super wholesale. For us the big deal was that 3000 feet to 10,000 feet deal. And I guess two dynamics around that. One is we used to get a fairly steady stream of that from our systems integrator vertical. I think we’ve got a good CAGR [ph] closer to it last year. And then of the other verticals, I think we have – I think in years past we have executed extremely well around those. Our statistics suggest we didn't do as well in that last year, and I believe that our ability to do that in the market for that going forward remains as attractive, no more, no less than it has been for the last 5 years. We just had a softening in our execution numbers and we feel good about get them back.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay, alright, that’s helpful. And then the second question, I am just trying to understand that size associated with Jarret [ph], I mean when the press release came out in end of January it sounded like you were leaving to pursue other opportunities, you sounded very voluntary. And I am just kind of wondering exactly what the charges in the quarter?
Tom Ray: I think we stated in our way K that –
Jeff Finnin: Yes, overall Tayo, Jarret [ph] as what a few of us have – are subject to employment agreements and just due to the reason for the departure there was some charges associated with some accelerating of some equity compensation primarily is what that charges related to. And so we will disclose that a little bit further in the 10-K that will be filed here in the near term.
Tom Ray: Just to be clear, I believe that we stated that he will receive severance benefits under this employment agreement. That’s what you are going to get.
Omotayo Okusanya: That is helpful. And then just one more in regard to the comment made earlier about the moderation in cash leasing spread. I was just curios are you seeing – is any particular market you are seeing more pressured in versus other markets at this point?
Jeff Finnin: Tayo, I think the thing to think about as we look into 2014 when we talked about our rent growth is when you look at our expirations that are currently scheduled in 2014 the dollar amount that we disclosed upon the expirations is about $152 per square foot. And so that number as compared to where we've been finding new and expansion deals, it’s just slightly under that number. I think if you look at all of 2013 our comments came in about $157 all in for 2013. So when you look at that, you can see the moderation just to give you some data point. Last year when we entered 2013 that dollar per square foot of explorations is about $117. So it's subject to not only market but also relative to the pricing at expiration of the individual leases.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got it. Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Tom Ray: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: It’s Austin Morrison [ph] here with Jordan. Just had two quick ones. Is the reduced data center developments in 2014, is that coincidental based on your applicable inventory today or is that – the overall industry dynamic I believe it's less than of 2013.
Tom Ray: It’s just pure lumpiness. We just few built really big buildings in two markets in Virginia and in New Jersey. So we just don’t need to go more there until the following year most likely. And then we still have – we think a year of inventory less in [indiscernible]. So it’s just purely a cyclical dynamics of developing a scale.
Unidentified Analyst: That’s helpful. And then just lastly could you provide with the backlog on signed, but not yet coming on fleet to on a cash flow basis.
Jeff Finnin: Yes, the GAAP basic that I gave in prepared remarks was up 4.3 million, that on a cash basis is $8.4 million heading into 2014.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Tom Ray for closing comments.
Tom Ray: Thank you and thanks everybody for joining the call. As we look at 2013 and the rearview in ‘14 going forward – in ‘13 we’re pleased with the expanding margin, we’re pleased with the expanding profitability and ROI. From a sales perspective we are pleased with cloud and network – enterprise and other verticals were fine and systems specifically have a lot of demand. Going forward we really believe that we have a great team, most of that team on the marketing side actually use tenure. And we’re very excited about Steve, and frankly very excited about all the support quota bearing reps and all the support that we built around them. So we took a hard look at the end of the year because we didn't accomplish what we expected to in terms of total sales volume in the second half of the year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we believe we can, should and will accelerate into ’14. So look, it's our obligation to produce the results. Rhetoric and anecdotes frankly I don’t think are relevant and we are very focused on the simplicity of blocking and tackling and producing numbers. And we'd like the investment community to watch the year unfold. Thanks for your time. Thank you for your support.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-10-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Derek McCandless, General Counsel. Mr. McCandless, you may begin.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2013 conference call. I'm joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; Jarrett Appleby, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'll begin by discussing key highlights of our financial results, as well as current market dynamics and our outlook regarding growth. Jarrett will then provide a more in-depth review of our sales results for the third quarter and update you on our performance and targeted verticals in geographies. Jeff will then present a detailed overview of our financial results, balance sheet position and update 2013 guidance. Our third quarter financial results reflect continued execution of our business plan. Top line growth continues to be steady, and earnings growth remains robust. Specifically, total revenue increased 5% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, while adjusted EBITDA and FFO both increased 17% year-over-year. Revenue performance year-to-date has been near the low end of our guidance, driven by a favorable mix of continued strong growth in our more profitable revenue line such as interconnection and breakered power, offset to some extent by a deceleration in revenue growth from metered power, which does not contribute materially to gross margin. Specifically, in the third quarter, interconnection revenue grew 6% from the second quarter and 20% year-over-year. Revenue from sales of breakered power grew 9% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. And rental revenue increased 3% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Regarding new and expansion TKD sales in the quarter, annualized GAAP rental revenue signed of $4 million reflects a 25% decrease from the trailing 12-month average of $5.3 million. We attribute this to the fact that we did not sign any leases exceeding 5,000 square feet in the quarter. We ascribe this to normal lumpiness in the execution of larger transactions. In fact, we saw a meaningful number of larger opportunities in our funnel at the beginning of the third quarter, many of which we targeted to close in the quarter, but were still pending at quarter end. Many of those opportunities remain active. We saw a similar dynamic in the third quarter of last year. And this may point to some degree of cyclicality, although our Q3 sales this year are nearly double that of Q3 last year in terms of annualized GAAP rent. Regarding pricing, the average annual GAAP rental rates signed in Q3 was $170 per net rentable square foot for turnkey data center leases. We believe that when adjusted for lease size, geography and power density, this rate is substantially consistent with our recent trailing results. Regarding interconnection results, in the third quarter, we again saw solid organic growth in cross-connections, with fiber cross-connections growing 18% year-over-year and total cross connections increasing 10% year-over-year. We'll now offer insight into our thoughts regarding market conditions. With regard to overall market demand, despite quarterly variations in lease executions, we believe that net and gross absorption for 2013 will be consistent with that of the past several years in each of our markets. We also believe that demand in edge markets, driven by growth of performance-sensitive workloads, is outpacing growth in more remote locations, which is favorable for CoreSite. Additionally, we believe that CoreSite's share of the performance-sensitive market segment is growing as evidenced by a further penetration of the important network vertical. This is a key piece of our strategy. And we've signed 129 leases with network customers through the first 9 months of 2013, and networks have accounted for nearly 40% of new and expansion leases year-to-date. We believe that this success lays valuable groundwork to support public and private clouds, as well as enterprises leveraging off of cloud and network capabilities. With regard to supply, we believe that currently available supply and pipeline supply in the wholesale market will maintain continued pressure on rents for wholesale and other undifferentiated customer requirements. Of note, we continue to see lower rental rates for undifferentiated requirements in the Bay Area, Northern Virginia and New Jersey. Regarding the undifferentiated component of the colocation segment, we expect to see continued pricing pressure, partly driven by wholesale providers as they seek to adjust their business models to serve smaller customer requirements. More specifically, we've seen pressure on rents, interconnection services and power margins in the undifferentiated colocation segment as wholesalers seek to gain market share. However, we see market dynamics for undifferentiated colocation as having been poor for some time. We believe those dynamics are distinct from the dynamics associated with the performance-sensitive colocation segment. Looking more specifically at the performance-sensitive segment, we believe supply and demand remain substantially balanced in our markets. Specifically, both the capabilities related to tethering may support the disaggregation of certain customer requirements within an edge market. We believe that supply-demand dynamics in the performance-sensitive segment remain attractive. Specifically, we believe that overall demand in edge markets continues to accelerate, largely driven by mobility growth and cloud adoption. Additionally, we believe that the economics and human resource requirements associated with tethering make tethering a suitable solution predominantly for larger customer deployments and less so for smaller requirements. Further, we believe that the performance requirements of many workloads continued to benefit from the differentiated value of data center platforms offering robust, low-latency network solutions and valuable customer communities. As such, we believe that CoreSites market opportunity related to performance-sensitive requirements remains attractive, and CoreSite is well positioned to execute on that opportunity. Now I'll offer insight into our expansion activity and the status of the core projects we currently have under construction. Our build-to-suit at SV5 is on schedule to be completed this quarter, and we expect rents to commence by December. Keep in mind that this is a powered shell, and our customer will need to build out its own infrastructure before ramping up to a meaningful power draw in the second half of 2014. While the customers' ramp regarding power will not impact our earnings, it will impact top line revenue. At LA2, we are under construction on approximately 33,000 square feet to add capacity in response to steady demand, as occupancy at LA2 has increased from 75% to 87% this year. We've seen consistent demand from our content vertical in this market, and we see a solid sales funnel as we prepare to bring this new capacity online. Our NY2 facility in Secaucus remains on schedule to deliver our first computer room of TKD capacity toward the end of the fourth quarter and the next 2 computer rooms in Q1. Presales signed to date at NY2 include 6 networks that will serve the facility, plus additional leases signed with end users, totaling 8,000 square feet. Each of the end user leases was signed subsequent to the close of the third quarter. Further, we have additional leases up for signature at the asset, and we have a strong funnel of near-term opportunities. We note that we aim to continue our past practice supplied to new developments by working to both execute upon our strategy to serve performance-sensitive requirements and also sign larger leases to accelerate generation of cash flow in the early phases of leasing. As such, we expect that the rents we signed in the early part of the lease-up at NY2 will likely to be below the average rents we've recently been achieving across the rest of our portfolio. At our Reston, Virginia campus, we expect to complete the first phase of inventory in our VA2 development toward the end of Q2 2014. While this timing may result in a somewhat reduced pace of sales for us in the first half of 2014 relative to past years in Virginia, we will continue to drive sales in the remaining capacity of VA1. In summary, we believe our earnings growth in the quarter reflects systematic execution of our business plan. We continue to drive revenue most strongly in the areas where we believe we can generate the most attractive profits. Q3 sales were a bit lower than the trailing 12-month average, which we ascribed to normal fluctuations and executions of larger leases. We believe the outlook remains bright for our business and that we remain on a well-defined path to drive growth and increase returns on capital that we invest prospectively and that we have already invested. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jarrett.
Jarrett Appleby: Thanks, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start by discussing in more detail our sales activity during the quarter. In the third quarter, we executed 106 new and expansion turnkey data center leases, representing $4 million of annualized GAAP rent with an average rent of $170 per net rentable square foot. In addition, we added 21 new customer logos in the third quarter. And year-to-date, we have signed a total of 87 new customers, which is an increase of 9% over the first 9 months of 2012. Growth in multisite deployments continued in the third quarter, reaching a record 44 new and expansion leases signed with customers deploying in more than one location. This represents a 50% increase over the trailing 12-month average, which we believe is attributable to our vertical sales model and the investments in our sales and marketing staff embarked upon a year ago. Importantly, with 106 leases signed in the quarter, we continue to see strong transactional volume, the cornerstone to our effort to increase sales, supporting a more favorable product mix of cross-connections and power and the breakered-amp pricing model relative to base rent. Sales closed in the third quarter reflect and reinforce our strategy of building customer community in network-dense, cloud-enabled data centers supporting performance-sensitive applications. The networking cloud verticals drove the majority of our sales in Q3, representing 39% and 28%, respectively, of the leases signed. This dynamic further supports our strategy of creating high-value points of interconnection and supporting the best environment for our customers to maximize their growth. With our focus on the networking cloud verticals, we are also seeing a direct correlation in the growth in interconnection as an 18% year-over-year growth in fiber cross-connects. Our growing network density and diversity across our data center platform is one of the key decision factors for cloud service providers in choosing a data center partner. And we are seeing the greatest growth in interconnection coming from cloud providers. Cloud providers, along with social media, gaming and content providers, have a strong desire and need for interconnection. I'll now take some time to discuss our performance in our targeted verticals. Specifically in the network vertical, this quarter, we signed 41 leases, following a record number last quarter. Year-to-date, we have signed 129 leases with network customers, which is a 29% increase over the first 9 months of 2012. During the quarter, we made good progress in expanding our non-U.S. network community with over 1/3 of our network leases in Q3 coming from international network service providers. In that end, we announced that BICS, Belgacom International Carrier Services, one of the world's leading wholesale telecom service providers, selected our One Wilshire campus in Los Angeles, with the expansion of its global voice and mobile services footprint in North America. Like many other foreign-based networks, BICS chose CoreSite due to the ability to interconnect with the community of more than 275 networks and hundreds of other potential customers. Other key non-U.S. network signings during the quarter include FK broadband, a leading telecommunication provider in South Korea; TeliaSonera International Carrier, a primary telephone and mobile network carrier in Sweden and Finland; Hibernia, a provider of both subsea terrestrial networks throughout North America, Europe and Asia; and NTT Communication, the world's largest provider of telecommunication services, which entered and expanded its presence across 4 locations with CoreSite. NTT and TeliaSonera International Carrier are representative of the deployments we are winning with more frequency at CoreSite, multisite deployments across our North America platform, which help drive interconnection and attract other customers and enhance our community. To further enhance our diverse network product offering, we recently announced a newly established relationship with the London Internet Exchange, or LINX, targeted to provide direct access to a new Internet Exchange Point, IXP, called LINX NoVA, a set of the LINX peering exchange from our VA1 facility in Reston. We now have relationships with all 3 of the major European Internet peering providers, including AMS-IX and DE-CIX, as well as NYIIX in New York, which all joined our Open Internet Exchange when it was first introduced last year. In our cloud vertical, we signed 30 new and expansion leases, an increase of 30% compared to the trailing 12-month average. We expect to continue to see solid growth in our cloud vertical, as cloud adoption increases and as companies continue to realize the benefits of placing their application in the cloud. We believe we are well positioned to win deals with cloud service providers because of our flexible data center offerings, which allow providers to meet their capacity and power density requirements with cost-effective, scalable data center space. Meanwhile, our network density and diversity also helps to ensure the performance of these cloud providers' application. Since launching our Open Cloud Exchange offering in the first quarter of this year, we have seen good traction with the leading networks and cloud service providers joining our growing platform, allowing customers to enjoy secure performance-optimized connections and cloud service providers of their choice. Most notably, we recently announced the availability of AWS Direct Connect's sub 1G connections, which provide our customer connection speed of 50 meg to 1 gig, allowing more CoreSite customers to take advantage of the cost-savings and performance benefits of the cloud environments. AWS Direct Connect is now available in 5 CoreSite data center campuses across our portfolio, with deployments in New York and Los Angeles and extended connectivity to Boston, Silicon Valley, and Virginia. The relationship enables more of our customers to benefit from direct connectivity to AWS Direct Connect using optimal levels of flexibility and control. We expect key cloud deployments like AWS Direct Connect to help drive future enterprise customers to our facilities as they learn the value and benefit of secure, low-latency direct connections to hybrid IT solutions. In addition to AWS Direct Connect, in the third quarter, we expanded our relationships with key strategic customers including TW Telecom, Zayo, Reliance and XO Communications. In other verticals, we see strength in the content vertical where we had 20 leases representing more than 30% of GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases. We had key wins from firms representing the entire content supply chain, including several leading movie studios, content delivery networks, internet TV platforms, online cloud gaming platforms and social media firms. The results in our SI and enterprise verticals came in below our expectations for the quarter. Deployments from system integrators can be inconsistent and often dependent upon sales cycles of their end users. We also believe the government shutdown had an impact on government agencies purchasing decisions during the quarter. As for enterprises, although sales were less than anticipated, we won a significant new customer deployment with Classified Ventures LLC, a leading online classified advertising firm that migrated to our facility in Chicago, as well as gaining a sizable expansion with an existing financial trading customer. Turning to geographic performance. Los Angeles was again our strongest market in terms of both volume of leases in GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases. Digital content was the top vertical in terms of GAAP rent signed in Los Angeles, accounting for more than 50% of rent in this market, including leases with leading providers of gaming, entertainment and social media. Chicago was our next best performing market in Q3 in terms of GAAP rent signed in new and expansion agreements, driven by the enterprise vertical. Our New York market rounds out the top 3 in terms of GAAP rent in Q3. We signed 7 new in expansion leases at our NY1 facility led by the network, cloud and digital content verticals. However, we also had one large hosting customer move out of the facility in search of a low-cost, wholesale solution. This customer represented $1 million GAAP rent and 14% of the capacity at NY1. Therefore, despite solid leasing at the facility, we saw occupancy decline in 75.8% to 67.1%. I'll close by touching on our sales, marketing and operations team. Regarding sales and marketing staffing, we have seen good progress with the vertical sales model we implemented in mid-2012 as evidenced by the favorable trends in our product mix mentioned earlier. However, we had some recent turnover in our vertical sales team. As a result, we continue to identify additional resources to supplement the current sales team and currently have 3 open positions, 10% of budgeted headcount. Based on the tenure of our current sales team and related sales quota, there are approximately 2 quarters behind where we anticipated being when we embarked on this initiative a little over a year ago. For reference, we currently have 19 fully tenured sales reps or 66% of our budgeted headcount, with an additional 7 people in the ramp-up phase. In addition, we want to take this opportunity to thank Chris Ancell, Senior Vice President of Sales and Sales Engineering, who's departing CoreSite to pursue other opportunities. I want to thank him for his contributions over the past year. Chris played a key role in the initial transformation of our go-to-market sales model. This role is being filled internally on an interim basis as we conduct the search for a permanent replacement. I maintain full responsibility for the sales organization, and we remain focused on building a best-in-class sales organization and delivering a superior customer experience for our more than 750 customers. Turning to operations. We continue to deliver reliable operational performance across our portfolio, achieving 6/9 of uptime in the year to date. This is consistent with our reliability since becoming a public company. In august, we completed SSAE 16 Type 2 examinations, covering all 14 operational data centers across our portfolio, demonstrating our commitment to our customers surrounding operational excellence and security, environmental controls throughout our facilities. As we look to the remainder of 2013 and into 2014, we are optimistic, given our strong pipeline and commitment to executing against our strategic plans, to create value for our customers and shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Jarrett, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter call. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q3 financial results. Second, I will provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And third, I will update our guidance for the year. In the third quarter of 2013, we recorded revenue of $60.6 million, a 5.1% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 12.8% increase over the third quarter of 2012. Year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter was diluted to some extent by our whole building customer at SV3 reducing its power draw. Partly driven by this, our revenue from the sale of metered power declined 3% year-over-year. Our Q3 operating revenue consisted of $51.3 million in rental revenue from space and power, an increase of 5.3% as compared to Q2; $7.4 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 5.5% over Q2; and $1.9 million from tenant reimbursement and other sources. As Tom and Jarrett both mentioned, we are pleased to see continued strong interconnection revenue growth and a shift in our mix as this product line has grown as a percentage of sales by nearly 80 basis points compared to the same quarter a year ago. Q3 commencements were strong, with leases representing $6.7 million of annualized GAAP revenue comprised of approximately 37,000 square feet, a GAAP rate of $180 per square foot. Performance on renewals in the third -- in the quarter was mixed, with solid cash and GAAP mark-to-market growth of 6.6% and 10.7%, respectively, but higher than average churn of 2.7%, bringing our year-to-date churn to an average of 2% per quarter at the higher end of our guidance range of 1% to 2% per quarter. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $5.7 million. We expect approximately 70% of the backlog to commence in the fourth quarter of 2013, of which 80% is attributed to our build-to-suit at SV5. The remaining 30% is expected to commence evenly throughout 2014, slightly weighted to the second half of the year. Our third quarter FFO was $0.47 per diluted share and unit, an increase of 4.4% on a sequential quarter basis and a 17.5% increase year-over-year. Year-to-date, FFO per share has increased 18% compared to the first 9 months of 2012. Our year-to-date flow-through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 65.3% and 45.8%, respectively, leading to an expansion of our adjusted EBITDA and FFO margins of 279 and 143 basis points, respectively. The difference between the 2 margin expansions results from the additional interest expense and preferred stock dividends in the current year as we continue to increase leverage to fund our 2 large development projects in New York and Virginia. Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter were approximately 5.3% of revenue, down 150 basis points sequentially and below the estimated range of 6% to 6.5% that we previously provided. This was primarily due to timing of expenses, and we expect this metric to return to the 6% to 6.5% level, depending on the timing of hiring around sales and marketing resources. Our G&A expenses were 11.7% of revenue, relatively in line with the previous quarter and slightly below our guidance of approximately 12% of revenue. We expect G&A expenses to be around 12% for the remainder of the year. Our operating expenses include amounts related to ongoing repair and maintenance expenditures, as shown on Page 18 of our supplemental. We spent $2 million during the third quarter in line with amounts spent in each of the previous 4 quarters. As of September 30, 2013, our stabilized operating data center portfolio was 80.6% occupied. Including leases executed but not yet commenced, our occupancy rate would be 82.2%. Development spending is expected to be approximately $60 million to $70 million in the fourth quarter, related to development capital expenditures, approximately $25 million higher than forecasted in our Q2 reporting. Taking this into account, we now expect our total capital expenditures to be in the range of $230 million to $240 million in 2013 compared to our previous guidance of $200 million to $225 million. The increase in development capital expenditure stems partly from an acceleration of capital previously planned for the later phases at VA2 and NY2 and partly due to increases in project scope at those developments. 2013 will represent our largest year of capital investment with a number of large development projects under way. As Tom mentioned earlier, we will be delivering 100% of the capacity at SV5 in Q4; the first phase of NY2 in Q4 and the beginning of Q1; and the first phase of VA2 toward the middle of 2014. Keep in mind that as capacity is delivered, the capitalization of interest, access and insurance associated with the development will be reduced unless a corresponding amount of operating expense will be absorbed by the delivered rooms. In addition, as we enter later phases of our ongoing IT systems initiatives, the capitalization associated with the investment to support the project will decrease significantly, and the cost will be absorbed into operating expenses. We anticipate entering those later phases and thus decreasing our capitalization in early Q2, 2014. Page 18 of our supplemental provides enhanced disclosure related to our development capital expenditures by breaking out the amounts attributable to data center expansion, nonrecurring investments and tenant improvements. Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2013, our debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 1.5x, and including our preferred stock, is 2.6x. We anticipate our leverage to increase as we continue to execute our capital spending plans. As we have discussed in the past, we target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4x. As of September 30, 2013, we had $108 million drawn on our credit facility and approximately $290 million of available capacity under the facility. Finally, with respect to guidance, we are tightening our guidance for 2013 FFO per share and OP unit. We now expect FFO per share and OP unit for $1.80 to $1.84 compared to the previous range of $1.76 to $1.84. Please remember that this does not include any capital markets activity, property dispositions or investments beyond what we have discussed. On Page 21 of our supplemental package, you will find additional guidance information. We believe revenue will be slightly below the low end of the $237 million to $247 million range that we provided, principally due to the decrease in metered power draw we have seen from a large customer at SV3 throughout 2013. We estimate the impact of the lower metered power revenue to be approximately 1% to 2% of company revenue for the full year. As mentioned last quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be on the high end of our guidance range of $105 million to $110 million, due to a favorable product mix reflecting increased revenue from the sell of power on our breakered-amp pricing model. Cash rent growth on renewals will fluctuate, depending upon the specific market and type of deployment. As we look to next year, we believe the cash rent growth may moderate from the amount seen in the year-to-date period of 3.6%, which is slightly below our previous guidance range. Our churn rate for the quarter was 2.7%, and our year-to-date amount is 5.9%. Year-to-date amount of 5.9%, or 2% on average per quarter, is at the high end of our guidance range of 1% to 2% per quarter. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi
Emmanuel Korchman: Jarrett, maybe you could go back to your comment earlier about some attrition from the sales force, and now you're trying to replace heads. Could you give us some more color as to what might have happened? Was it performance-driven? Was it that they felt like the product mix was wrong? Sort of give us some color as to why those people are no longer with you.
Jarrett Appleby: First of all, thanks for the question. First of all, you would expect some normal churn in the sales organization tied to performance and opportunities or both, so this is built into our plan. We did ramp up the team. We wanted to provide some additional color for you on this call in terms of where we are in getting tenured reps and ramping up the sales engine. This is in the range of what we would normally expect based on performance or opportunities in the business.
Emmanuel Korchman: And then, Jarrett, we'll stick with you for a second. On the NY1 occupancy drop, you mentioned that it was a large wholesale customer that had moved out. But it looks like it was an outsized portion of the rental income versus how much space was given up, which doesn't seem to sort of jive with the idea of a large wholesale customer moving out. Could you help me reconcile that?
Jarrett Appleby: Well, there's 2 components to it. On the rent side, again, we are -- the types of performance-oriented deployments that we're selling now include rent, power and cross-connect. So if you look at it from a rent side, yes, they were our larger opportunity in the hosting provider. When they approached us, we did not have the NY2 solution available in Secaucus, so we weren't able to serve both the network performance side and the larger power side of that business. So we decided to move to New Jersey. In terms of the rate, we did see -- and we are replacing those types of solutions with performance-oriented applications that include rent, power and cross-connect in total.
Thomas M. Ray: So Manny, if you look at our churn in the Q, and the move-out in NY1 was a meaningful component, there were 3 deals that moved out that represent about 2/3 of all the churn. And as we look at rent margin on power and cross-connect revenue, the sum of those revenue and profit streams with regard to power, some of those, for the trailing 12 months that we've achieved in the 3 buildings that these 3 moved out of, the trailing 12 was 59% greater than the rent, power profit and cross-connect revenue that moved out. So as to rent, 3, 4 years ago in NY1 when we signed this customer on a rent only model, that rent has moved out, and it was a reasonable rent. It was, in terms of profitability, substantially below what we've been achieving in the trailing 12 months in each building where these deals moved out. So hopefully, that gives some color around the churn.
Emmanuel Korchman: And Jeff, just finally, on your point on the total operating revenue guidance coming down for '13, I think you mentioned that there was a 1% to 2% impact, sort of -- and maybe I missed on what that item actually was, but it doesn't get me to number that's below the range, it gets me to the bottom end of the range. So what else am I missing in that number?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, Manny. Just picking up from where we left off last call, the guidance range that we gave in connection with Q2 was we guided towards the lower end of that revenue range -- of the original revenue guidance range, which was $237 million to $247 million. What I mentioned in my prepared remarks and is consistent with what we saw in the second quarter is that our customer at SV3, the revenue associated with their power revenue has decreased and -- which is on a metered power basis. We essentially said that the impact, the revenue impact from that particular decrease in draw was about 1% to 2% of our overall revenue. Well, ballpark, call it about $3 million.
Thomas M. Ray: Jeff, I think puts you at the low end of revenue guidance.
Emmanuel Korchman: So that's 1% to 2% impact, and you're already at the low end rather at the midpoint.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: That's correct.
Emmanuel Korchman: So you get -- so you're $3 million effectively below the low end.
Thomas M. Ray: No, we can give it a new range. But that revenue negative variance on metered power from a single building customer puts you at the low end of the range from what Jeff said at Q2.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
Jonathan Atkin: Just a brief follow-up on the topic of power deal. So the deals that you're signing now and the deals kind of in the pipeline, what would be the way to characterize the mix of metered versus breakered-amp?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, Jon, throughout the year, that mix has been increasing, filtered toward breakered-amp. And we've been disclosing the growth rate around sales of breakered power so that -- there's been clearly an increase in that, and it's been material. I think the deals signed in Q3 -- you have a significantly greater portion that was breakered than on our trail -- because we didn't sign any big deals in Q3. That was just a big deal lumpy quarter, and that's that. But across the year, the signings on the breakered model have grown substantially. And we will just encourage people to look to the growth rates and revenue from the sale of breakered-amp power that we've been disclosing to get a read on that trajectory.
Jonathan Atkin: Great. And then my question then on the rates of interconnection growth. Is there anything to suggest that it would deviate from kind of recent growth rates in terms of just the actual dollar volume of growth quarter-on-quarter? And then you said it would moderate or accelerate as you are -- if you have the LINX -- that relationship out of VA1 and then the other kind of European exchanges. On a broader scale, I think Open IX is coming into a site elsewhere in the Virginia markets. I'm just wondering if you can kind talk about the dynamics around that topic of interconnect.
Thomas M. Ray: You bet, Jon. I think there are 2 dynamics at play inside our interconnection revenue. One is we had a big, meaningful price increase that we implemented about a 1.5 years ago, plus or minus, so that led to a significant jump at that point in time. And I think you could pretty well see that over 1 to 2 quarter basis -- 1 to 2 quarter period. Since then, we had still consistent growth, and most of that growth is backed by or is driven by increases in volume. So we're working hard to make sure that the investment community understands, not only the trailing increase in revenue, but also the trailing increase in cross-connect volume. And over time, you should think that maybe you get a small increase in pricing, a colo-based cost of living, a 3%, plus or minus, increase in pricing over time, all of these being equal. And the rest of your growth rate and revenues are going to correlate to growth in volume. That's over time. In the near term, we believe our embedded cross-connect base still has greater than a 3% upside versus the market. And so we think there's still some running room there. And I don't expect the Open IX initiative to materially change that in the near term. So I hope that helps.
Operator: The next question is from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: I wanted to see if you could expand a little bit on the pipeline. I think, Tom, in your prepared commentary, you mentioned that there were some larger tenants that you expected to sign during the quarter that ended up still in the mix at the end of the quarter. If you could sort of maybe characterize them, what kind of -- and give us a sense of scale in terms of what the pipeline actually looks like or the funnel, I think, as you described it.
Jarrett Appleby: Well, Jordan, I didn't think we disclosed post quarter that we did sign additional leases in NY2, for example. So those were deals that are fully closed in Q3 that did close in Q4 in the prepared remarks. So we've seen some of those larger deals delay in that new site, and we shared that script here. We do see continued growth. The larger deals...
Jordan Sadler: So that 8,000 square feet of leases, that was the sort of larger, lumpier one that you were sort of referring to?
Jarrett Appleby: In the total, yes, there was the larger, lumpier one there. So that did not close in the quarter, but it did post quarter, saw it at NY2. We do see a lumpy Q3 for some reason. That seems to be the larger deals don't seem to get as close as -- and they're -- that many of those have moved into -- most of those have moved into Q4.
Jordan Sadler: Is there anything going on in particular in the enterprise or system integrator verticals that are causing them to sort of come in below expectations?
Jarrett Appleby: It's really deal-dependent. Several are related to government -- a couple of them are government-related. They just got delayed in terms of funding, again, with the federal shutdown, and some of those opportunities are already in Q4. Largely, I think those are deals dependent on end users, so we don't have direct input. And it was a big shift that you see us doing. And we balanced out both the vertical, which we're getting great success on networking cloud vertical, and digital content, to start going a little more direct with the geographic enterprise focus. So we're doing both there to get more control and manage that to move away from some the system-integrated dependencies on end-user deals.
Jordan Sadler: That's helpful. And Jeff, did you have a cash backlog?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Let me get that for you here before the end of the call, Jordan. I don’t have it right off top of my head.
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Stephen W. Douglas: Two, if I could. I guess -- I mean, you mentioned the international customer wins that you got. And I'm wondering how big of a factor your cross-selling agreement with interaction was there. And then second, one of the questions we got a lot is about whether cloud is actually a good thing for your business. And I guess, I'm wondering if you're seeing any kind of uptick in interest from specifically the enterprise segment as a function of having the multiple customer wins in the cloud vertical that you've mentioned.
Jarrett Appleby: Well, in terms of the global business, Stephen -- we are seeing -- we've been spending more time directly, not really with interaction or -- it's really direct relationships we have with NTTs and BICS of the world. We are spending more time, ourselves, in Europe and Asia directly with the network providers they deploy here. And we're excited because they are choosing us and our sites to provide alternatives in new -- North American markets, and they're bringing larger deployment like the NTT example, that we use here. So that is a direct relationship and focus on the network side. And on the cloud side, we do see, again, benefits with these cloud service providers, the infrastructure and service providers to enterprises, and we see continued focus and growth. We went -- last year, we had a -- last quarter, we had a great quarter with 65 networking cloud deployments. Now with 71 this quarter. So we are absolutely targeting those networks in cloud where we believe the enterprises will want to connect. And they're setting up their service offerings in these sites across our platform.
Operator: The next question is from Dave Rodgers of Robert W. Baird.
David B. Rodgers: Maybe Tom or Jarrett, earlier in the year, we talked about a lot of strategic customer signings, just a couple in particular that were fairly large, but brought the rate down as they became a little more high-profile. Can you talk about the deployment of those customers? Are they on track? And kind of how far along they are in their deployment? And the second part of that would be, relative to your expectations, how far along with the ancillary demand from the strategic deployments be at this point in time?
Jarrett Appleby: Well, you are seeing here the commencement data that we are deploying, and some of the larger and smaller deployments are going on, on a timely basis. The largest opportunity that we mentioned, I think, Jeff talked about in terms of the power with scale over the course of 2014 timeline, the very large ones do take larger time to deploy. The smaller opportunities and leases that we're signing and the midsized are coming in on a timely basis. And you can see that in the commencement data that we're providing.
David B. Rodgers: And maybe then just a follow-up for Jeff, going back to your capitalization policies and kind of the guidance, maybe you're trying to kind of lead us to for the first half of '14. It sounds like day 1 completion of the development, all the OpEx is going to come on regardless of the occupied or lease percentage of those assets. I just wanted to expand on that a little bit in terms of what is the expected timing on some of the big -- I guess, your kind of big 3 developments are out there, big money drivers, in terms the uptake of that space? And how we should be thinking about that dilution on a monetary amount basis in the first half of next year?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, Dave. Appreciate the question. Just let me dive into this because I think it is important to make sure people understand the amounts around it. And some of it is provided in the supplemental, and some of it is not. But let me just dive through the components. As you look at development, obviously, you've got capitalized interest, taxes and insurance. On Page 20 of our supplemental, you can currently see how much we've capitalized in interest year-to-date, which is about $3 million. On an annualized basis, it would equate out about $4 million. That equals about 60% of our year-to-date interest expense. So I think the best way to think about capitalized interest is if we were at 60% of it being capitalized year-to-date in 2013, we would expect that to moderate in 2014 as those developments complete and start to come online. And I think a better range would probably be somewhere in the 40% to 50% range rather than 60%. The other component of that is taxes and insurance. So the smaller amount -- and we don't typically disclose it, but just to give you some context, year-to-date, we've capitalized about $1.2 million through September. On an annualized basis, that's about $1.6 million. You would expect to be about a 50% reduction in that amount in 2014, given the timing of those developments coming online and what else might be in the pipeline in 2014. The third component, Dave, you didn't specifically ask, but let me touch on it because we -- it was categorized in those comments, and it's around some of our IT development and expenditures. As we've disclosed in the past, we are incurring some development dollars associated with our IT systems. And year-to-date, we've capped about $1 million of those costs through September 30 on an annualized basis. That's about $1.3 million. As we've said in our prepared remarks, we expect a development of that IT initiative to substantially be completed by, call it early Q2. And as a result, there'll be some development subsequent to that point, but we would expect those dollars also to decrease by about 50% in 2014.
Thomas M. Ray: You would expect some degree of that capitalization to put forward to expense.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Right, yes. Does that help, Dave?
David B. Rodgers: It does on the expense side. And then with regard to revenues, anything that wasn't in your prepared comments that we should be thinking about in terms of the uptake of this space relative to the expenses coming on?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, that's a great -- I think -- we typically model our stabilization period when we deliver space over about a 24-month period of time. And I think that's been fairly consistent. At times, we beat it. But I think that's a fairly good way to look at it in terms of the space that's being delivered. As we said in the prepared remarks, on NY2, we expect to bring on one of those computer rooms in December. The other 2 in early Q1, and so that gives you some idea on the timing of that particular development.
Thomas M. Ray: Dave, let me touch on this dynamic at a higher level for a moment. I think that our business is -- spans the spectrum, as we all talked about quite some time. We do smaller deals. We're very well practiced at them, and we have a good internal sales engine to execute them. That sales engine, frankly, is a little bit behind in terms of staffing and resource capability right now than we'd hoped. Q3 was kind of a one step forward, one step back quarter in terms of staffing, and we'll get over that. But we have that capability, and separately, we're practiced, if you will, wholesale guys. In Q3 and really in Q2 as well, you saw less wholesale sales at CoreSite. We have 2 big development projects coming online. We have NY1 coming at the end of this year, and VA2 coming in, in the middle of next year. And we just look at those, really, on an IRR basis. And there's some level of that inventory that's coming to market that we believe is smart to sell back into the wholesale funnel or just trying to give the Street a heads-up around that. And the reason we believe that is the incremental return on the incremental cost of developing new kilowatts inside this core foreign shelf that we just completed is fantastic. It's not as good as what we can do with that capacity over the long haul, but if, let's say, NY2 was little over 20-megawatt building, rather than systematically working through the whole thing with performance-sensitive colocation, we're going to drive the transaction engines steady and consistently, and we feel like that, that engine and its profitability in terms of breakered power and cross connections is accelerating. And we will work to go do some larger deals. So at this moment in time for Q3, you saw no larger deals in the company and a little bit softer overall revenue and sales growth because that dynamic -- but it's a dynamic we've been managing for over a decade. And there are -- the best business for us is the performance-sensitive colocation business. We're focused on it, and we keep executing on it. Separately, there had been times in the past where we have warehoused inventory with wholesale rents simply in order to get paid and generate cash flow, but with a view toward recycling that capital, that -- those kilowatts in a 5-year period, plus or minus. When you have a big building coming on, you orient a little bit more toward that. So we understand the concern in the marketplace. We understand it, we respect it. Our business is straightforward, and we're doing the same thing we've been doing in the past. The profitability of our colocation and transaction sales, we believe, are clearly increasing. We believe, year-to-date, we've shown fairly convincingly that we're making more money on less capital than we did before. And going forward, we'll see us tilt back and grab a little bit more of these wholesale deals. And we'll manage that dynamic on an intelligent cash flow IRR basis for our investors. So there are dynamics at play, and we want to just be very direct about them. And we're going to keep marching about our business.
Operator: The next question is from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies & Company.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Thanks for the color around, again, the delineation between undifferentiated colo and as well as performance-sensitive, high-quality colo. Could you guys give us a sense of just how much of the undifferentiated stuff is still within your portfolio? And just from an innings perspective, where exactly you feel you are in regards to really moving to the performance-sensitive stuff?
Thomas M. Ray: You bet. Again, we've shared this in the past that we look at this issue in terms of how many cross-connects are in place per deployment. And we've seen that move in the right direction as well. So like the clinical data at this point, 83% of our revenue comes from deployments with 5 or more cross-connects, and 63% of our revenue comes from deployments with 10 or greater cross-connects. So that's our best read into what's performance-sensitive. And those ratios have increased over the last year since we've started talking about them. And I think that's probably the best way to look at it.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-on just in regards to Silicon Valley and the subleasing going on with Facebook. Could you just kind of give us a sense of what you're hearing regarding that, the impact of that on pricing? And what ultimately Facebook may do with that space, whether or not they get the space subleased?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure. I mean, look, the Bay Area is a tough market. It has been for 2.5 years. I don't know that it's materially tougher now than it was a year ago. There is a lot of space available to come back to the market via Facebook, but as with any real estate product, when lease terms get shorter on a remaining primary lease, and that primary tenant is working to sublease, cooperation with the landlord is valuable to help clear out that sublease inventory. To date, we really haven't seen much. I can't think of any offhand, but I might be wrong. If The Facebook sublease inventory gets resold, that's good and bad, right? I mean, if rates are -- I think are steady, that's not a great level, but they're steady over the last year, but you still have that shadow supply working its way back towards the market. Our objective is to -- if Facebook leases -- subleases its capacity on our portfolio, we understand that. If we have an opportunity down the road from here to make an intelligent deal with them where we can recycle that to colocation and not deploy capital to build another building on that site, just use that as -- use the Facebook inventory as a slot in our manufacturing schedule, if you will, for building product, we will take advantage of that opportunity. If we can't make -- if it's not rational for the parties to make an agreement before they roll -- we did structure their roll with us as 2.6 megs in the first year and another 2.6 in the second year, plus or minus. And the reason we did that is we've historically leased about 3 megs in our traditional product mix. 3 megs a year in the Bay Area, and that 2.6 is a pretty good fit with our retail operation. And we just don't plan to -- if all the Facebook stuff comes back to market in 2 years, I think wholesale rates will be pretty tough. They could get tougher. One could certainly see that scenario. We don't plan on reentering that space into that climate, and we've structured our lease accordingly.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.
Unknown Analyst: This is John Luciani [ph] here with Michael. I was actually also going to ask about the cash leasing backlog. And also related to that, if you guys could tell how much of that is replacing in-place revenue?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Hey, John, this is Jeff. Yes, in terms of the cash backlog as of the end of the quarter, it's $10.2 million. About 45% of that will commence here in the fourth quarter, but the larger share of that is going to be coming from our customer on our build-to-suit development that were completed here in this quarter. The remaining 55% will come in rapidly throughout 2014. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your the question, John?
Unknown Analyst: The second part was how much of that is replacing kind of in-place revenue in a space that's already -- you're kind of replacing the tenant, not leasing space that's currently vacant.
Thomas M. Ray: Not much.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, it's a great question. I agree with Tom. I don't think it's a substantial portion, but I don't have it specifically in the front of me, John. It's something we can do an analysis on and get back to you on, but I don't have this specifically in front of us.
Operator: The next question is from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Tom, I wanted to just follow up on your commentary regarding you're potentially focusing on or targeting some of the potential wholesale tenants for some of the new development. And I'm just curious, would that include -- what would the scope of wholesalers be? Would it include resellers?
Thomas M. Ray: I think that's unlikely, Jordan. I mean, we never say never. We're cash flow optimizing mindset here, but I think that's unlikely. I think these are -- it's substantially more likely that they'll be enterprise in cloud and network, from a network service provider's who, of course, also have growing MSP and cloud businesses inside their organizations. So they're taking larger footprints, but they're also interested in the -- being on top of their fiber paths and other parties' fiber paths, so I doubt they'll be resellers.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then, could you just clarify regarding the rates that you are seeing initially at NY2 from the first few leases that are there? I think you said they'd be lower initially than the overall portfolio. Could you just clarify sort of what's going on there?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, I just think that the early days of lease-up at NY2 were very heavily orient toward more wholesale-type requirements as we get traction going in that building. We feel good that we'll have plus or minus, and it could be a plus 10 networks contracted in that building when we open it. We feel good about the fundamental business plan we laid out when we made the decision to go there. And it's easier to kickstart a big new data center by nailing a couple of larger deals and putting cash flow in it. While we do that, we'll be moving to transaction engine. But in the early days, you'll see a greater weight, a greater product mix oriented toward wholesale. And throughout the course of the investment, you'll see that mix shift much more strongly over to performance-sensitive colocation if we're right about our thesis. So it's just the timing, approach. It's the approach to how you manage the lease-up of a new data center in a new market.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that's helpful. One more, if I may. Tom, this is more of a high-level question for you. Just obviously, the spaces in terms of stock performance, and maybe sentiment has become a bit washed out for a variety of reasons. And I'm kind of curious in terms of your thought process, in terms of -- how does that get cured? What is sort of the solution? And how long does it take? And can it be cured? And then at the same time, is there any opportunity in that for CoreSite?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, look. I mean, the ultimate cure -- for my view, the ultimate cure for stock price valuation is performance, the EBITDA and FFO and the FFO distributable to shareholders. So you cannot be cured, absolutely. Companies perform or they don't. And we live by those laws, and there you have it. We feel every bit as excited about our ability to grow earnings in this company as we did a year ago when sentiment is really high. So that's how we view the world. Are there opportunities? Well, look, I just look at it this simply, Jordan. If you can -- if the wholesale landscape gets to a point where you can buy wholesale products below the depreciated replacement cost of the asset, that can spell opportunities for anybody, just building a platform. That said, I don't see prices anywhere near that level, and we are not interested in buying somebody else's wholesale space at more than we can build it on our own. But yes, if there was such a level of distress in the wholesale segment, I think there'll be opportunity. I think the performance-sensitive colo business remains a steady, solid business. So I just don't see a huge amount of distress coming around that such that it would be meaningful valuation arbitrage. It would be great if I'm wrong, we'd like to be a predator in the jungle rather than a prey. There's no doubt that's how we're wired as human beings. I just don't really see that landscape, but we'll see.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Ray for any additional remarks.
Thomas M. Ray: I just want to thank everybody for their time. Again, we appreciate that there a lot of questions out there in the marketplace right now. We're about our business, and honestly in most respects, we look at Q3 as another day on the job. And we're excited about the go forward. We're happy to follow up in any manner and talk more about the information that's already been publicly disclosed to help people understand it. And we look forward to seeing you again in the quarter. Thanks for your time.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-07-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Derek McCandless, General Counsel. Thank you. Mr. McCandless, you may begin.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2013 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; Jarrett Appleby, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Thanks, Derek. Hello, and welcome to our second quarter call. Today, I'll discuss key takeaways from our performance in the quarter, provide an overview of our markets and discuss our growth initiatives. Jarrett will then provide a deeper dive regarding our sales results and put our Q2 activities into perspective among our geographies and targeted customer communities. Jeff will then review our financial results, balance sheet position and provide an update on 2013 guidance before we open the call to questions. Our Q2 results reflect continued execution of our strategy to support performance-sensitive applications. In the quarter, we increased earnings meaningfully, recording a 9.9% sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA over Q1 2013 and 25.4% growth over Q2 '12. Similarly, we increased FFO 9.6% sequentially over Q1 '13 and 22.1% over Q2 '12. Growth across our product lines, most importantly in product lines key to our strategy, drove these results. Specifically, sequential growth in Q2 revenue over Q1 was comprised of 7.3% growth in interconnection revenue, 7.1% in power revenue and 3.3% in rental revenue. We attribute the growth in interconnection and power revenue relative to rental revenue to a favorable sales mix and deal structure. Notably, revenue from power in our breakered-amp product line increased 25% in Q2 '13 over Q2 '12, reflecting the benefits of our strategy and go-to-market model. Beyond our Q2 financial results, we recorded accelerating sales this quarter. In Q2, we sold $5.8 million in annualized GAAP rent from new and expansion leases of turnkey data center capacity, a 14% increase over Q1 and the trailing 4-quarter average preceding Q2. The average annualized GAAP rental rate of executions in the quarter was $188 per net rentable square foot. This higher rate relative to the last quarter was driven in large measure by increased power density and the geographic mix of sales. When adjusted for power density and geography, we believe that our achieved rental rate was substantially consistent with the past several quarters. Sales for the quarter included a record number of agreements with customers in multiple sites, with 40 leases signed with customers who do business with us in more than one data center. We believe this demonstrate the value of our vertical sales model, which facilitates accelerated sales across our platform. Finally, Q2 sales results included 56 new and expansion leases with customers in our network vertical, representing a record quarter in this vertical since we became a public company. Adding new networks to our platform is foundational to our strategy to create high-value points of interconnection in customer communities. To that objective, over the trailing 6 quarters, including Q2, we signed 215 new and expansion leases in our network vertical. We believe that this increase in network density reflects and further strengthens the value that our platform and customer communities bring to network service providers and our shared partners and customers. We're pleased to see in our Q2 sales results what we believe is some of the fruit of our investments in our sales and marketing functions, the seasoning of our sales team and focused execution upon our strategy. With regard to market conditions, we see market dynamics for the performance-sensitive colocation segment consistent with the prior 12 months. We believe that fundamental demand drivers remain healthy, market demand remains strong and available supply in the performance-sensitive colocation market is little changed from Q1. Our markets with the highest number of leases signed in the quarter included Los Angeles, the Northern Virginia and Washington D.C. area and New York. Our new and expansion sales saw little to no impact from customer insourcing, reflecting our focus upon interconnection and robust customer communities rather than providing large-scale power capacity. As noted above, we saw firm pricing across our platform, which we attribute to the differentiated value proposition inherent in our assets, operating platform and customer communities. Regarding our expansion activities, we currently have 4 projects under construction. First, our NY2 facility in Secaucus remains on schedule to deliver the first phase of TKD-ed capacity in the fourth quarter. Moving to Virginia, we expect to complete the first phase of inventory in our VA2 development in Reston in late Q1 or early Q2 of 2014. In Santa Clara, our build-to-suit project at SV5 remains on budget and on schedule to complete in Q4 this year. Finally, at our LA2 facility, we will develop an additional phase of capacity comprising 20,400 square feet at a projected cost of $10 million. We accelerated this project to meet customer demand, which exceeded our expectations in terms of both signed agreements over the past year and strength of the current sales funnel. We believe that our current development projects, while meaningful relative to our current size, represent only a small component of our internal growth opportunity. When combined with our available TKD capacity, our mark-to-market opportunities supported by our goal to drive increased cross-connections and breakered-amp power and our opportunity to construct additional data center capacity in buildings and on land we currently own, we believe that our internal growth opportunity is significant. We remain focused upon executing our plan to provide solutions for performance-sensitive applications, provide best-in-class customer service and drive attractive returns for our investors. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jarrett.
Jarrett Appleby: Thanks, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start by discussing our sales activity during the quarter. In the second quarter, we executed new and expansion turnkey data center leases representing $5.8 million of annualized GAAP rent with an average rent of $180 per net rentable square foot. The $5.8 million in leasing volume is 14% above our trailing 4-quarter average. The annualized GAAP rent of $188 per square foot was in line with our trailing 4-quarter average when adjusted to account for power density and geographic mix. Regarding renewals, we renewed 44,702 Net Rentable Square Feet at a weighted average GAAP rental rate of $166 per NRSF, reflecting a 5.4% increase in rent on a cash basis and an 11.7% increase on a GAAP basis. Rental churn was 2% for the quarter and 3.2% on a year-to-date basis, in line with our guidance. Lastly, we commenced 42,672 Net Rentable Square Feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $147 per square foot, which represents $6.3 million of annualized GAAP rent. We believe our Q2 2013 sales demonstrate the value inherent in our strategy to focus on building customer communities in network-dense, cloud-enabled data centers supporting performance-sensitive applications. We continue to expand the CoreSite Mesh, which is our community of customers and partners that do business in our facilities. During the second quarter, we executed 115 deals across our portfolio, 33 of which were with new customers. Each lease, expansion, customer logo and partner enhances the ecosystem's value and makes the community even more attractive to potential customers. The 115 new and expansion leases executed in Q2 represents a 20% increase over the trailing 12-month average. Further, the 40 multi-site agreements Tom referenced represents a 35% increase in multi-site executions over the last 4-quarter average. Over the same period, the average lease size, based upon the annualized GAAP rent of turnkey data center leases signed in Q2, decreased 3% from the prior 4-quarter average as we continue to add performance-oriented applications across our portfolio. Over time, many of the applications we target will generate accelerating interconnection revenue per net rentable square foot and continued strong growth in revenue from our breakered-amp power product line, increasing our return on invested capital. At the vertical level, the value of our network-dense cloud-enabled data center strategy can be seen in the success we have realized in the network and cloud verticals. The second quarter included a record 56 leases from network customers and 18 from our cloud customer base, which establishes the foundation of our Mesh strategy. Networks represented approximately 50% of new and expansion leases signed in the quarter. These new customers not only further strengthen the network density of our data centers, but they also demonstrate the robust network capability inherent across our platform necessary to support performance-sensitive application. One of the key network wins in the quarter was Hibernia Networks, a European provider of global capacity solutions providing submarine and terrestrial networks throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The expansion will include a subsea cable connection into CoreSite's Boston facility, as well as an ethernet deployment in CoreSite's New York facility. We also saw broad demand among the leading Asia Pac-based carriers, such as SK broadband, one of the largest providers of broadband internet access in South Korea, leveraging our platform to enter and expand into the North American market. Today, we announced that the global IP network business unit of NTT Communications expanded into 3 additional locations with us to support its North America growth. NTT Communications is a wholly owned subsidiary of NTT, the largest telecommunications company the world, and its expansion with us, along with the other carrier expansions, further increases the value of our platform. In the mobile network vertical, we won a significant new deployment in Chicago from a leading global mobility provider and an expansion from a leading U.S. mobile services provider in the Silicon Valley. We also won a deployment for our mobile ad insertion platform in Los Angeles. And we believe we are capturing strong, solid growth in the mobility sector, as we see mobile applications as a key future growth opportunity for us. To support our growing cloud vertical, last quarter, we announced a new product called the Open Cloud Exchange to enhance the value of our platform to enterprises seeking private and public cloud solution. The Open Cloud Exchange enables customers to take advantage of secure, performance-optimized connections to cloud service providers of their choice and leverage various networks across the country as on-ramps to the cloud. This quarter, we closed key network expansion into multiple sites with TW Telecom, which was the first network to join our Open Cloud Exchange. In addition, iland, a global VMware vCloud-powered Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider that delivers enterprise-class cloud services, was a notable addition to the Open Cloud Exchange in Q2. We are focused upon adding additional participants in the exchange, and we expect this service to drive value for new and existing customers who leverage leading network providers to connect to the cloud. In the second quarter, we announced additional key wins connected to our cloud vertical, including 3 key expansions from one of the largest global cloud service providers and an expansion supported a SaaS operating for a large financial software provider. From a market perspective, Los Angeles continues to perform very well as our #1 market from the perspectives of both transaction volume and GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases. Our L.A. campus is comprised of our high-powered, cloud-enabled LA2 facility, which is connected by high-count dark fibers to our space at the One Wilshire building. In the first half of the year, we drove record sales of our fiber capacity between the 2 sites, with fiber absorption in this first half of 2013 increasing 400% sequentially over that in the last half of 2012. Additionally, leases signed at LA2 in the first half of 2013 represent 78% of the annualized GAAP rent signed across our L.A. campus during the period. Roughly tied with Los Angeles as our strongest market in Q2 in terms of GAAP rent signed was our Silicon Valley market, which delivered solid financial growth as well as new and expansion deployments from 3 network providers and 2 leading cloud service providers. Our Northern Virginia market, consisting of VA1 in Reston and DC1 in Washington, D.C., was our next-strongest marketing Q2. In this market, we have delivered consistent quarterly growth over last year among the network cloud and financial service provider verticals that we believe have meaningfully advanced the value of our data centers in this market. Regarding NY2, we are pleased with the progress we are making towards opening in Q4. Following upon a successful tethering model in L.A. and Northern Virginia, in New York, we have secured fiber connectivity connecting NY2 to NY1, as well as other key points of interconnection, such as 60 Hudson and 111 8th. Importantly, beyond tethering to existing points of interconnection to support the early adoption at NY2, we are working purposefully to establish NY2 as a new point of interconnection in cloud-enablement to support performance-sensitive applications. To this end, we have already secured commitments from 5 network and submarine cable providers, and we have a growing pipeline of potential additional network partners as we get closer to our opening date. In Q2, we added Tenesis and Cross River Fiber to previously announced Light Tower, Zayo and Seaborn Networks, which is a new subsea cable system built to Brazil. Inherent in our cloud-enabled data center strategy is the value of interconnection. Supported by the strength of the more than 275 networks accessing customers across our platform, our installed base of fiber cross-connects increased by 17% over Q2 2012. And interconnection revenue grew over 7% since last quarter and now represents $7.1 million in quarterly revenue. In summary, our view is that the number of new and expansion leases signed with strategic customers across key verticals and across our platform illustrates that our vertical go-to-market strategy is working. We believe that CoreSite is well positioned to capture market share in the performance-sensitive segment of the market with our attractive mix of available capacity, expansive network connectivity options, active and growing customer communities and a differentiated customer experience. Regarding sales and marketing staffing, we are approximately 90% staffed for the vertical sales organization and 80% for the marketing organization, as planned. The strong lease volume this quarter was driven in part by the increase tenure of our sales team. We expect to continue to see sales momentum from these teams going forward. Turning to operations, we continue to deliver reliable operational performance across our portfolio, achieving six nines (99.9999%) of uptime in the year to date. We also remain committed to providing the highest standards of IP systems and anticipate completing our upgrade project by the second half of 2014. We expect that this investment will enhance the CoreSite customer experience, enable further scale and increase internal efficiency to facilitate a best-in-class solution to customers with high-performance, low-latency applications. Looking ahead to Q3 and the remainder of 2013, our pipeline remains strong, and we are encouraged by this quarter's progress. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Jarrett, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter call. I'll begin my remarks today, first, by reviewing our Q2 financial results. Second, I will provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And finally, I will provide commentary on our guidance for the year. In the second quarter of 2013, we recorded revenue of $57.7 million, a 4.7% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 13.9% increase over the second quarter of 2012. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by increases in our interconnection and power revenue, as both Tom and Jarrett discussed earlier. The growth rate year-over-year was diluted by 1.4% due to our customer at SV3 decreasing their metered power draw as they transitioned certain applications out of our facility. This facility is currently fully leased to this customer, with 50% expiring in 2016 and 50% in 2017. Our Q2 operating revenue consisted of $48.7 million in rental revenue from space and power, an increase of 4.4% as compared to Q1; $7.1 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 7.3% over Q1; and $1.9 million from tenant reimbursement and other sources. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $8.5 million. We expect approximately 85% of the backlog to commence in the second half of 2013, with equal amounts in both Q3 and Q4 and the balance to commence in 2014. Our second quarter FFO was $0.45 per diluted share in units, an increase of 9.8% on a sequential quarter basis and a 21.6% increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Our FFO growth in the quarter demonstrates our ability to realize efficiencies of scale by leveraging our current resources to minimize expense growth. On the expense side, sales and marketing expenses were approximately 6.8% of revenue, relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter and slightly above our estimated range of 6% to 6.5%. This was largely due to the payment of recruitment fees as we staffed our sales and marketing team. Our G&A expenses were lower compared to the prior quarter and below our previous guidance of approximately 12% of revenue. We would expect G&A as a percentage of revenue to trend back up to around 12% as we proceed through the rest of the year. Our operating expenses include amounts related to ongoing repair and maintenance expenditures. As reflected on Page 18 of our supplemental, we spent $1.9 million during the quarter, in line with amounts spent in each of the previous 4 quarters. As of June 30, 2013, our stabilized operating property data center portfolio was 80.5% occupied. Including leases executed but not yet commenced, we are 82.2% leased. As discussed last quarter, Page 18 of our supplemental shows our pre-stabilized assets. In Q2 2013, we completed and added capacity at SV4 and CH1 and added both to our pre-stabilized pool. Also during the quarter, we completed approximately 24,000 square feet at Boston 1 that was 100% pre-leased and is now included in our stabilized portfolio as of June 30, 2013. Next, I will address our development spending. The company currently has approximately 237,000 square feet under construction at NY2, SV5, VA2 and LA2. We have incurred a construction cost of approximately $60 million out of a total estimated cost of $188 million. The total estimated cost included an increase for NY2 related to accelerating base building infrastructure costs originally planned in subsequent phases. We also expanded our disclosures on Page 18 related our development capital expenditures by breaking out the amounts attributable to data center expansion, nonrecurring investments and tenant improvements. We spent $20 million over the last 12 months related to nonrecurring investments, or approximately 13% of our total capital expenditures. These expenditures were in line with what we discussed during our February 2012 Conference Call and are comprised of $5 million to bring certain data centers up to brand and improve efficiencies; $10 million related to office building improvements, primarily at SV1, where we remodeled our lobby and added mezzanine office space; and $5 million related to our investments in our technology and IP platforms, which we expect to complete in mid-2014. We expect to incur $14 million during the remainder of 2013 associated with these projects, and the amounts are included in our overall guidance related to development capital expenditures for 2013. Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2013, our debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 1.2x, and including our preferred stock, was 2.3x. As we have previously said, we anticipate our leverage level to increase as we continue to execute our capital spending plans, and we target a stabilize ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4x. As of June 30, 2013, we had $73 million drawn on a credit facility. During the quarter, we exercised a portion of our accordion on a credit facility and expanded the capacity to $405 million. We expanded our relationships with 2 additional banks, adding to the quality portfolio of lenders that support our credit facility. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $325 million of available capacity under our credit facility, and together with our cash on hand, our total liquidity was approximately $328 million. Finally, with respect to guidance, we are increasing and narrowing our FFO per share and OP unit guidance to $1.76 to $1.84 from the prior range of $1.72 to $1.82. Please remember that this does not include any capital markets activity, property dispositions or investments beyond what we've discussed. On Page 21 of our supplemental package, you will find additional guidance information. While our range of total operating revenues remains at $237 million to $247 million, we expect to be at the lower end of this range, primarily due to lower revenue in 2013 from metered power mentioned earlier. In addition, our cash rent growth on data center renewals year-to-date is 4.1%. We expect our 2013 rent growth to be on the lower end of our guidance range of 4% to 7%. Before opening the line for questions, I'd like to mention the private letter ruling that we received from the IRS during the quarter, which states that interconnection revenue is qualifying rate income. While we do not anticipate this change to impact our near-term financial results, we believe that this ruling will be beneficial over the longer term as our interconnection revenue continues to grow as we enhance the CoreSite Mesh, attracting additional performance-sensitive applications to our platform Now I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
Jonathan Atkin: A couple of questions. First, on expenses. You talked about G&A trending up. How do we think about sales and marketing and operating maintenance relative to the 7% that we saw in the first half for sales and marketing and the 26% for operating maintenance for the second half? And secondly, I was interested in the new logos that you brought on. And are these customers new to colo, or are you seeing benefit from churn from other colo providers, or was it a matter of those customers wanting more vendor diversity, and you're winning the business in kind of that fashion?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Jonathan, this is Jeff. Let me touch on the first one, and then we'll have Jarrett and Tom address the second. But as relates to our general -- I guess, our G&A cost, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect that amount to trend back up to a roughly the 12% of revenues, as we've guided to in previous quarters. That lower amount that was reported this quarter was assisted a little bit by about $400,000 credit that we have going through resulting from us adjusting our reserves for bad debt. On the sales and marketing, as I mentioned, we're at about 6.8% of revenues for this quarter. We expect that to be still in that range of 6% to 6.5% per quarter as we move forward and as we continue to look at some additional investments in sales and marketing expenses, where we might want to enhance and/or make further investments. But I think that range still gives you some idea where it expects to be. On the operating expenses, the only thing I would say there is that in the third quarter of our fiscal year, it is traditionally a little bit higher due to the seasonality of some of our power expenses that do -- that we will get hit with in the third quarter. Other than that, that should be relatively consistent beyond Q2 as we head through the second half of the year.
Jarrett Appleby: Jonathan, it's Jarrett. And building on the new logos with the 33, we're just seeing progress. We're seeing more at bats [ph] with the sales and marketing coverage and investments that we see there. We're primarily seeing more, I think, new deployments, new application-type deployments, but we also see the diversity of choice, particularly in the network and cloud segment. So we see continued momentum. And again, with the investment and the tenure of the sales force, we see more at bats [ph] and more new logos.
Jonathan Atkin: And then on the sales force, can you remind us where things stand on sales headcounts and maybe comment on the sales retention, sales recruitment, any major changes or challenges that you're seeing on that front?
Jarrett Appleby: Yes, we're about 90% there on the sales side. You'll see continued ebb and flow, but we're materially there. We've been patient, hiring the right talent, and it's really paid off in the network and cloud vertical segments, where we're seeing that progress and that focus. So we'll continue to be patient and move forward as we go in and close out the rest of this year. The big thing is giving them time and getting them productive and getting them more experienced and trained. That's taking a couple of quarters.
Thomas M. Ray: And Jon, it's Tom. I would just add that we felt like we saw pretty good returns on the expansions of the quota-bearing headcount in Q2 as people are coming off of ramp. We believe that what we've been working to do is working. And given that, we're going to evaluate probably adding an additional smaller round of headcounts. But if you think this 30 to 35 quota-bearing heads right now, if we look at another 5 to 10 on top of the historical plan, it's not going to move the expense structure in a huge amount, but that's a -- it could be a meaningful add to the quota-bearing headcount, and we're certainly looking at that.
Jonathan Atkin: Great. And then finally, I'm just wondering about connecting your sites together. And to what extent are you seeing carriers deploying or customers looking to purchase or maybe deploying their own dark fibers as opposed to lit services between your sites? And you mentioned the example of NY1 and NY2, where you're doing a tethering. Is that dark as well as lit or just lit capacity at this point?
Jarrett Appleby: Jon, it's a combination of dark and lit. In major markets, we want multi-count, high-count fiber between our sites. But think of it as it's really our campus strategy. It's really bringing this large cloud enablement, where we can do the larger deals, and then tethering and connecting back through high-count fiber back to our point of interest, in the case of NY1. So we're getting some momentum with that. And in other markets, with did share with you, where there's key points of interest that are moving, that are running out of capacity, it's a benefit for us to make it easy for them to leverage our campus in NY2 or other markets.
Thomas M. Ray: Jon, when you're thinking about intermetro connectivity, we have a link along the coast of California linking Northern and Southern; we have a link over in the Eastern region. Those are lit. Those are lit leases with a little bit shorter-term capacity. Within a metro, intrametro, most of that is dark. And that's been something that's been meaningful for us in L.A. As we mentioned on the call, it's accelerated very well in Los Angeles with our strength at LA2. And so we're replicating that in the New York. Intrametro, primarily dark. That said, Jon, I mean, I guess the bulk of the capital and the bulk of the strands, intrametro, is dark. We do provide lit services intrametro, it's just -- you can put gear on either end of one strand and break it into waves and move a fair amount of smaller retail traffic, but that's one strand. So as a service offering, we are also lit intrametro. But as a capital and if you count fiber, you see the big guys wanted to light their own glass, and they are looking for dark.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: Just -- Jeff, if we can dig in to guidance for a second. You're now guiding to the lower end of your revenue guidance and of your cash rent growth, but you've raised FFO guidance, and it doesn't look like anything else on Page 21 has changed. So maybe, can you walk us through what's changed between last quarter and this quarter, except for actuals coming in, obviously? And also, what might get you to the high end of guidance if you're thinking lower end on those 2 big items?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes. As you pointed out, and as I did say on the call, we've guided towards the lower end of our revenue range. And that's largely due to our customer at SV3 having lower metered power draw during 2013. How -- and really what it comes down to is really product mix. On the positive side, we have had higher revenue from our higher-margin products. And that this a good flow-through to the bottom line. And as a result, we expect to have adjusted EBITDA, reported adjusted EBITDA, at the higher end of that range. And ultimately, that's what's increasing -- or resulting in the increase in the guidance.
Thomas M. Ray: You see a deceleration in metered power, which is a 0-margin product, and you saw outperformance on higher-margin products, cross-connect and breakered-amp power. And that's really the reason for the dissonance between the movement in top line revenue and the movement in profit.
Emmanuel Korchman: Maybe I'm missing something. How do they go from an EBITDA range that doesn't change, though, to an FFO range that increases?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think Jeff said we expect our adjusted EBITDA to come in at the higher end of the range as well. We're guiding up on adjusted EBITDA. We're guiding up on FFO. We guided down a little bit on revenue, and it's all because of product mix.
Emmanuel Korchman: I mean, your $1.05 to $1.10 EBITDA range didn't change, though, quarter-over-quarter?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Correct. Just take the midpoint, Manny, of that range, of $1.075. We expect to be in the higher end of that range.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti: Jeff, the first question I have is relative to your floating-rate debt level there. I know you've spoken about this in the past, but maybe we could talk about the -- specifically, the line balance. Clearly, funding development through that facility. What are the current long-term financing plans as some of these developments stabilize and get delivered? And is there some impact, given credit market turbulence, in your mind, to some of the spreads that you established going into some of those developments relative to the long-term financing costs?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: David, let me give you some idea kind of how we're watching and monitoring things and give you some idea of what we're thinking. But when you look at -- we obviously -- we watch the mark-to-markets very closely. But when we look where we are halfway through the year and what we anticipate spending in terms of development dollars for the rest of this year, we've guided to a range of $200 million to $225 million of CapEx for the year. If you just pick a point somewhere in the mid-range, call it $215 million because it will make the math easier, year-to-date, we've spent about $96 million. So that leaves us about $120 million of additional CapEx that we'll spend in the second half of the year. We've got about $73 million outstanding on the line today. So that's going to put us up somewhere between $190 million and $200 million outstanding on the credit facility by the end of the year, assuming we don't do anything from this point between now and then. That still gives us well above $200 million in total liquidity. However, we're going to continue to watch the markets and ultimately assess when it makes the most sense for us to go to the market, and it's really going to depend on the size of the proceeds that we want to deploy, what pricing is looking like in the marketplace and, ultimately, the term we're looking for when we term out some portion of that short-term debt. I think, as it relates to -- I guess, your second part of the question was really around levels and how is that impacting ultimate returns. We've traditionally said that our returns, which are on an adjusted EBITDA basis, are north of 12%. So that's not going to change that based on what we end up doing from a financing perspective, but that gives you some color in terms of how we're looking at and monitoring the markets. I think late 2013, early 2014, we will continue to look at where an opportune time is to do something from a financing perspective.
Thomas M. Ray: David, I'd offer 2 comments in addition. One is, although our debt, if you exclude the preferred, our debt is 100% floating right now, it's also currently 1.2 turns. And we think about when to term out more in terms of the floating as a percent of turns of EBITDA rather than the ratio of floating to fixed. If we were an 8x EBITDA borrower, that ratio might have a lot more meaning, but we really just think more in terms of the risk of interest rate rises relative to our income trajectory. We think through the rest of this year, that's a very manageable risk. But when we do get a handful of turns out or 3 turns out, we look hard at terming out, as you saw us in the past. The second thing I would offer is, as the spreads in the market have widened, certainly, over the last 2 years, the company-specific spread at CoreSite has come in, I think, reasonably nicely. So you have a company dynamic that continues to strengthen relative to a market dynamic that has widened a little bit. I think the strengthening of the company dynamic tempers the risk in the market dynamic. I'm not saying that it overcomes it, but it tempers it. And so we think about that when we think about the risk of widening rates versus near-term dilution to our shareholders. So we think in terms of absolute floating-rate debt relative to EBITDA, and we believe our company-specific spread continues to tighten.
David Toti: Okay. That's all very helpful. And then I just -- I had one other detail question. Maybe I missed it. Did you talk about the occupancy decline at MI1? Did I miss that?
Thomas M. Ray: We didn't. The short strokes there are we had one customer move out. There might have been more. We had one material customer move out. And the decline in occupancy there is really due to the law of small numbers. It's a 20,000-foot building. We had a 5,000-foot lease move out. I think if you look at the rate on what moved out, you can -- I mean, I'd look at the variance between the property table q-on-q. We moved out 5,000 feet, an average of $45 a foot a year, and the in-place base on the rest of Miami is $121 a foot a year. So we had a small guy move out at a very low rate, and we're -- we didn't manage that churn to have a different strategy with the building. It was a not-that-profitable customer, and we feel good about backfilling that over the course of the year, and we think the in-place rents reflect that opportunity.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: I'd like to maybe ask some questions about demand drivers. Tom, going back to our conversation we had at NAREIT, where we talked a little bit about Facebook and their need to kind of reach the mobile customer and that highlighting the value of your dense network facilities. Since that time, I think that digital media and dynamic ad insertion for mobile devices has really escalated in terms of news flow. And then obviously, we had a very good print from Facebook on their mobile ads yesterday. So I was wondering what else you're seeing in that digital media, ad insertion marketplace and how that's driving demand in your facilities. And then sort of on the other side, there's been some news flow about remote peering. And I was wondering if that was at all a headwind or an opportunity for you?
Thomas M. Ray: I'm going to turn the mobility question over to our savant here.
Jarrett Appleby: Jonathan, it's Jarrett. Yes, in terms of mobile, we are seeing ad-insertion platforms prevalent. There are some assets that were getting some tower deployments as well from the network guys, as well as, clearly, some value in financial services in our assets like our D.C. campus, Chicago, New York. I think we saw mobile deployments from the network provider, from tower infrastructure, from that product line and from the digital content players, I think, in 5 markets this quarter. So it is early days, but it does leverage that community. It does leverage the digital content. You mentioned one player in that space, but our digital content is a very strong base for us. They are pushing that to the edge. And again, from the market perspective, ad insertion is latency-sensitive, and we are focused on those folks and new logos in that space who are coming on-board.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Great. And remote peering?
Jarrett Appleby: Oh, in terms of remote peering, I think there's an opportunity. One of the things that we called out was the 40 multi-site deployments that we had this quarter. We have multiple networks in every one of our markets this quarter, and that's pushing out for the IP side and peering community, as well as the private networking deployments that they're putting out there. And so I do think there's opportunity for us there that folks are looking for other places for IP and peering and picking new choices outside of downtown New York. I think that's particularly an opportunity for us in our NY2 facility. We aren't seeing a lot of pull-through that we can see right now from remote peering. There's still major hubs, typically 2 and 3 -- 2 or 3 in every one of the markets. Folks are diversifying in Northern Virginia, New York, Chicago, Santa Clara and L.A. They're looking for multi-site kind of deployments there.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Great. And in the past, you guys have given us some indication of exposure to performance-sensitive applications by discussing the number of -- or percentage, rather, of customers that had multi-site deployments across the base as opposed to just the new contracts. And I was wondering if you might update us on those numbers.
Thomas M. Ray: I don't -- we don't have the updated stats at the moment. I would be comfortable that it's moved north, and we'll come back on the next Q with the detail. I don't think it's-- these are fairly large battleships to move, right? So I don't think it's changed in a huge amount. But I think the trend is favorable, and we'll come back on next Q with the clinical data again. Sorry we didn't bring it this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: I wanted to come back to the question regarding tethering, which you are doing in L.A. and now in New York. I'm curious, one, about sort of the plans to do it in other markets. And then, it's unclear to me, are you connected to third-party facilities in L.A. as well? I mean, it sounds like New York, you're tapping into 111 8th and 60 Hudson and maybe some other. So are you doing the same in L.A.? And maybe just talk about that strategy a little bit more.
Thomas M. Ray: We're -- we don't in L.A. I mean, our only tether in L.A. is a point-to-point from LA2 to LA1. I think broadly, the strategy, Jordan, where you're entering a market without a point of network density, then you help seed growth by tethering to other points. When you have established your own point of network density, then you don't really tether to other people. And as you build more capacity elsewhere in the market, you tether back to your point of network density. It's the age-old hub-and-spoke that we've been doing for years now. And the tethering to other folks I view as kind of the first 3 to 5 years, as things get going. And then, as we execute our strategy to bring more networks into our facilities, then the value of that tether decreases.
Jordan Sadler: What's the cost in New York, for instance, of sort of the -- of tethering to those 2 other facilities?
Thomas M. Ray: I think the capital on that, Jordan, was on the order of $1 million, $1.5 million, plus or minus.
Jordan Sadler: Per facility?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. And there's a reasonably manageable monthly maintenance cost with the network.
Jarrett Appleby: And just on that, if I could build, one of the benefits of that, those 2 campuses happen to be publicly announced where you can directly connect AWS. And again, bringing the network and the cloud community and making that a campus is a great -- not just for AWS, but other cloud providers, giving them that choice of multiple cloud providers and hybrid environments for cloud closer together.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. A separate question is regarding the PLR having no impact. What's the -- I mean, I see that there obviously was some income tax in the quarter. What are the mechanics surrounding, I guess, avoiding the income tax going forward?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, Jordan. Most of the tax expense that you see in the quarter is really resulting from state income taxes. That PLR generally won't have a whole lot of impact on state -- the way states look at REITs. So you're always going to have some level of -- a small amount of state tax expense. In terms of logistics for the PLR, we have been working on transitioning our business out of the TRS and into the REIT, and it just takes a little bit of time. But as I said on the call, near term, we don't think it's going to have a big impact. However, longer term, as that side of the business grows, that's where we will see the benefits on a long-term basis.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then lastly is just on SV2. I didn't catch exactly what was going on with that tenant. It sounded like they're moving some gear out, even though they've got later-year expirations. Can you maybe just give us the nature of the type of the tenant or the nature of the move-out?
Thomas M. Ray: Jordan, it's SV3. So that's the large single-tenant deal we've had there for some time.
Jordan Sadler: Oh, it is SV3. Okay.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes.
Jordan Sadler: And that's the deal you did shortly before the IPO?
Thomas M. Ray: That's right. The single-tenant, full building.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. You just said they're scaling up and pulling some of the gear out at this point, right?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. I think that's a customer who is -- no surprise in the marketplace, a number of larger customers are self-sourcing data centers in other locations. And I think this customer has consolidated half of the gear out of that building. They're, I think, looking to sublease the space. We've talked about this in the past. We're also in an open dialogue with them. And our income is secure for the next 4 and 5 years. And there you go. I think, at the end of the day, the timing at which we take that space back to the market, if it's before the lease expiration, will just be driven by when we need inventory in the location. As we've said in the past, wholesale rates have declined meaningfully from when we signed that deal. Separately, though, we believe that our ability to -- that we have an ability to increase EBITDA in that facility off of that inventory with a retail program. So we don't have an intent to take that back to the wholesale market at whatever time that capacity comes back to us. And Jordan, I want to be -- also, a little more color around the cost of the networking, if you will. The fiber is one cost. The gear on either end of the fiber is another cost. And then the capability to manage the network is a component. I think what we shared in the past, if you look at any tier, you look at our packet exchange, you look at our Ethernet exchange, you look at our dark fiber purchases and you look at our gear inside our buildings, it's less than a couple of points of our total capital base. It's -- I'm guessing it's 2 points plus or minus. So it's -- there's a lot more to it than just buying $1 million or $2 million worth of fiber. But the total cost is still a reasonably small amount of our capital.
Jordan Sadler: Was that part of the underwriting of NY2?
Thomas M. Ray: It was. We went a little bit longer on it than we had underwritten. So you saw a little negative variance on cost there because we went a little bit bigger on the package, but yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Spencer with Robert W. Baird.
David B. Rodgers: It's Dave Rogers here. I wanted to follow up on the developments. You've got 6 projects or so that are complete, yet to stabilize. Another 4 under construction. Maybe taken separately, Tom, can you talk about any activity in the market that either makes you incrementally more positive or negative on the returns coming off of those and remind us, maybe as separate groups, what the overall development returns do you expect on those assets are?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure, Dave. I think that -- we think of the development in 2 different groups. There's one class of development that's really just add-ons into existing facilities. And those are incremental builds to meet demand as we start getting short on inventory. Those tend to be the higher-margin, higher-returns -- higher-return developments for us because by definition, they're built inside a facility that already has customers and traction and some interconnection base. Let's leave that category there. Circling back to the other category, you have new large ground-up or full-building rehab deals. And we have 4 of those -- or 3 of those right now. We have the pre-leased deal in the Bay Area, SV5. And I think we've given all the guidance we can give around returns on that. It's an attractive deal for us, and we're glad to have it. And then we have 2 large new TKD data centers going up, one in Virginia, one in New Jersey. We've consistently said we think we can meet or beat '12 [ph] on a stabilized cash yield basis. We continue to believe that. I think as our -- what we do expect, and historically we have seen, higher returns on the incremental adds in existing data centers, and those returns can vary fairly widely. And our objective is to continue to drive a higher component of breakered-amp sales and cross-connect sales as part of the product mix and, hopefully, have some upside across the portfolio. But that's how we view yields. Really no big change other than we think the yields continue to move in the right direction for us across our -- each development, and we're excited about the future.
David B. Rodgers: Great. And then maybe on the strategic deal that you did in the first quarter, and I didn't hear if you commented on this during your prepared remarks. But can you give more color on kind of when you expect that rollout to be fully deployed and then kind of what the time frame is you're thinking about for the cross-connect? I know we've talked about kind of the timing of cross-connects kind of following up to those deals, but when will they be fully deployed?
Jarrett Appleby: Yes, this is Jarrett, Dave. The first phase, over the holiday season. And I think we mentioned this as a cloud gaming platform. And into early next year, you can expect the first phase of that deployment to go out, again, in Q4. But it will phase in and ramp up in the first half of 2014. The first deployments will include power. And again, it's an interconnection -- we anticipate it to be an interconnection-rich application to the networks in those sites. So first phase for the holidays, and then ramping into 2014.
Thomas M. Ray: And I think on average, our stats suggest that 80% of total cross-connect growth from all new deployments in any Q burn in over an 18-month period after the deployment. There are -- some are faster, some have more growth for a longer period of time, but on average, you get about 80% of the cross-connects on a new deployment over the 18 months after it deploys.
David B. Rodgers: And then last question, maybe on the acquisition environment. Any appetite for additional acquisition today? Anything that you're looking that -- coming up?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we wouldn't comment on anything specific, Dave. But I would just say that -- and the message we tried to send last quarter is, look, we just try to be smart and pay attention to the market and pay attention to opportunities to increase shareholder value. At the same time, our internal growth opportunity is quite significant, we believe. And as such, our hurdle for buying something is relative to our hurdle for sticking to our knitting right now. And really, none of that has changed since we've been a public company. I think there's been a little oscillation in the perception of what we're trying to say, but our orientation, I feel, has been pretty consistent.
Operator: . Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
James C. Feldman: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your expirations. I know you touched on some this year, but even into next year, where you've got 22.8% of rent expiring, are there any known move-outs? Or how should we think about that NOI stream?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, Jamie. This is Jeff. We haven't given any specifics as it relates to 2014 roll. We'll plan on doing that probably later in the year or as we give 2014 guidance. But I can tell you that there aren't any significant known move-outs in that fiscal year that we're aware of at least today. So nothing significant that we're aware of that will move the needle there.
James C. Feldman: Okay. And then, I know you spoke about mix and -- product mix and tenant mix kind of driving better rents. But where would you say tenants are just today in terms of thinking about the economy and whether it's getting better and how much better, and how much of that is driving your outlook -- or I guess, how much of that drove operations in the second quarter, and then your outlook going forward?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think the North American climate is obviously a little bit brighter. But I think we all read the same papers and see the same economist reports. There's not blistering growth here. But certainly, the outlook here is a little bit brighter. I think more than anything, you just saw -- I would circle back to what we've said pretty consistently. I think overall demand in the industry I expect to grow at similar rates to where it has before year-on-year. And there are some quarterly oscillations. We saw that in Q3 last year. You saw the counter-oscillation in Q4 of last year. We look at Q1 and Q2 results as fairly normalized. So I don't think that there was an exuberant outpouring of executions based on a view of better health in North America. Things are, I think, on the margin, better in North America. I think, more than anything, we're seeing stronger growth in capturing the smaller performance-sensitive deals that we think have a product mix that drives higher margin because we've invested into a platform that captures more of that activity. So that's what we attribute Q2 to. And I think things are better in the States, but I don't see IP spending or the trends behind IP outsourcing, we don't see Gartner's forecast shipments of router and interconnection gear. Those trends still seem relatively consistent, a little bit brighter in the States, a little bit duller in China and Asia. But it's a fairly consistent pattern from what we've seen over the last couple of years.
James C. Feldman: Okay. And then finally, one of your competitors last night discussed the lengthening the book-to-bill cycles, specifically in the enterprise segment. Is that something you guys have seen?
Jarrett Appleby: Yes. This is Jarrett, Jamie. Not really. We have seen consistent, again, the smaller deals and our focus on that are moving -- are consistent. We're seeing those consistently move through to close, and roughly the same time.
Thomas M. Ray: And I would say, also, you've got to think about the geography. It -- I think there are other companies in the sector that have more business abroad right now. And maybe some of the lengthening of cycles is due to macro factors elsewhere. My guess is -- my sense would be that the companies we compete against in North America are probably seeing pretty similar things that we are, and they're very able competitors with great business plans. And some -- other times when you have exposure to a market that's a little bit slower, and then things pick up. So that's our sense. I think in North America, we've seen things stay pretty steady.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Two quick questions. First of all, the -- could you talk a little bit about the dollar value of rents that have been signed but haven't yet commenced?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes. You're talking about backlog, Tayo? It was -- in the prepared remarks, we has talked about it. At that end of the quarter, it's $8.5 million. And what we gave some color on was that -- of that $8.5 million, we expect about 85% of it to commence in the second half of this year, equally split between Q3 and Q4, and the rest of it in 2014.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: So that's helpful. And then the second thing. I mean, there's been some recent chatter around Facebook and then subleasing a lot of their space in Santa Clara. Could you kind of talk about how that may or may not have impacted you?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, I don't think it has impacted us. And we really have worked to message this to the Street for the last 2 years and strongly over the last year. We do expect them to move out of the SV3 building upon lease expiration. You have half of that in 4 years and half of that in 5 years -- or I think it's 3 and 4. And we expect to time our inventory deliveries in Santa Clara such that we would convert that space to our retail colo program. And between now and then, we're collecting rent, and we have a good relationship with the customer, and on we go.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: So Facebook is still in your space right now, or have they actually subleased it already?
Thomas M. Ray: No. They've been in the market to sublease it. We've been in discussions with them. I mean, they have -- I think they've moved out a portion of the building, and that's that. It is a fairly normal landlord-tenant situation with a tenant who doesn't need some of their space and is probably going to move out the rest of it over whatever time period make sense for their business, and we look at the intelligent way, as the landlord, to either take that space back early and market it early or wait until the lease ends, and that's really driven by our inventory availability in the market. That's what drives our decision-making and our thought of timing and whether we participate in taking it back early or not. And until we need capacity in the market, we're happy to stay where we are with that lease.
Operator: . Our next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisors.
Eric Frankel: This is Eric Frankel here with John. I just have a question regarding LA2. Obviously, you made a lot of great progress in leasing there this quarter. Just curious, were there any customers that migrated from LA1 over to LA2?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. We've had some migrations. We've had a handful, and it's an activity that we encourage.
Eric Frankel: Great. And just a question on the G&A. I think, Jeff, you might have quoted on G&A, you expect to run at roughly 12% of revenue over the next year. Is that scalable at all in the future, or is that probably a the way to just think about G&A over the next couple of years?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: No. I think in the near term, call it 12 to 18 months, I think that's a reasonable percentage. I think once you get beyond that, we do think it's scalable. And ultimately, we'll know better as we get closer and closer to those time frames. But at some point, definitely, it is scalable.
Thomas M. Ray: And I would offer that not scaling it, I think, is a good sign. Not scaling G&A means that we believe that further investments create accretive returns. If we wanted to just stay steady state as a business in our current activities, then we could scale G&A down as a percentage of revenues. As we -- if we believe that enhancing our capabilities produces attractive returns, we'll keep G&A as a percent of revenue where it is or evaluate the optimal position for the shareholders.
John Stewart: Great. And just a final question, just on interconnection revenue. Can you just clarify how much of that comes from your more network-dense properties and how much comes from some of the newer enterprise locations?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: It's -- we haven't given that specific breakout by property, Eric. I don't even have it at my fingertip. But -- yes, at this point, we haven't disclosed those separately.
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think generally, the longer a property has been around and the more customers it has in it, the more cross-connects you'll have embedded in that building. And we just work hard to systematically add to that dynamic in new buildings and new developments. It takes time, but the trend has been favorable, and we're going to keep doing what we're doing.
Operator: Mr. Ray, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Thomas M. Ray: Thank you. Well, we're pleased with Q2. We're very pleased with the seasoning of the sales team and with the returns we're getting on what we're trying to accomplish. I think, more than anything, we're very pleased with the sales mix we see evolving in the organization. And we're going to stick to our knitting and keep going. Thank you, everybody, for the support from the analyst group, from the investors. We're going to keep working hard to create good returns, and we'll talk to you guys soon.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-04-24 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Derek McCandless, General Counsel. Mr. McCandless, you may begin.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2013 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; Jarrett Appleby, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans and future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectation, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Thanks, Derek. Welcome everyone to our first quarter call. Today, I'll offer our perspectives regarding the high-level performance of our business, general market conditions and our market opportunity. Jarrett will then review our sales results and our progress in supporting an increasing portion of the performance-sensitive needs of our customers. Jeff will then review our financial results for the quarter, and we'll close with Q&A.  With that, let's dive in. Our Q1 operating and financial results reflect further execution of our business plan in what we believe is a compelling market opportunity. We believe that a handful of key metrics indicates that our platform is further strengthening in value and that the market is increasingly adopting CoreSite as a key provider to support performance-sensitive applications. First, in Q1, we added more new customers to our platform than during any quarter since going public. Second, we continue to realize solid growth in cross-connect volume, and importantly, we see accelerating cross-connect orders from our more recent customer deployments. Specifically, the number of cross-connects ordered in the first 3 quarters of deployment of new and expansion deployments in 2012 was 32% greater than for new deployments in 2011 and 50% greater than for new deployments in 2010. Third, we believe we have materially increased the number of new and expansion executions for what we identify as strategic deployments, customer applications that we believe disproportionately attract other applications and increase the value of our platform. Specifically, in the most recent 3-quarter period, Q3 '12 through Q1 '13, we executed new and expansion agreements for what we identify as 35 strategic deployments. This compares to 8 such deployments in the 3 quarters prior thereto and 4 in the 3 quarters prior to that. Finally, we are executing what we believe are strategic agreements much more broadly across our portfolio, reflecting the benefits of our vertical sales alignment, enabling our teams to sell across our platform. Specifically, over the 3-quarter period, Q3 '12 through Q1 '13, we executed at least one strategic transaction in each of our 8 primary geographies. Whereas in each of the prior 3-quarter periods, we executed a strategic transaction in only 3 primary geographies. Leading the way in the most recent 3-quarter period with 7 deployments each are New York and Virginia, which includes our facilities in Reston and Washington. Following closely with executions for 5 strategic deployments each are Los Angeles, the Bay Area and Denver. We believe that these metrics point to good things happening across our platform, and most strongly, in the markets where we have our largest development opportunities: New York, Virginia, the Bay Area and Los Angeles. Beyond the specifics associated with our sales and operations in the quarter, we believe that the broader set of market conditions remained substantially unchanged to last quarter, both across the data center industry generally and specific to CoreSite in the performance-sensitive colocation segment of the industry. Looking at our business and our market opportunity from the perspective of customer verticals rather than geographies, we are similarly pleased with the breadth and depth of the progress we are making across our platform. Specifically, we are encouraged with our penetration in Q1 in our network, mobility and cloud verticals, as Jarrett will speak to in more detail in a moment. Finally, I'll take a moment to address the company's near-term growth plans. We believe that our development projects underway and available to be commenced across New York, Virginia, the Bay Area, Boston and Los Angeles provide us with a full plate during 2013 that will result in strong growth this year and in the following years. As such, we are highly focused upon executing our development and sales plans for this year. Meanwhile, we remain vigilant in working to be aware of opportunities to acquire operating companies in North America that are highly aligned with our business model, whether from a geographic or customer vertical perspective. That said, we will remain highly selective as we evaluate external growth opportunities beyond our current 2013 development pipeline. With that, I'll turn it over to Jarrett.
Jarrett Appleby: Thanks, Tom. I'd like to start by discussing our sales activity during the quarter. In the first quarter, we executed 42,800 square feet of new and expansion turnkey data center leases, which was 30% above our trailing 4-quarter average. The new leases were well distributed across our 5 verticals with digital content and network verticals growing in all 9 of our markets, while the cloud vertical grew in 5 of our primary markets. We believe our interconnected communities of customers and partners, which we refer to as the CoreSite Mesh, enhance the value of our data centers and differentiate our platform. We remain focused on leveraging the growth within our networking cloud communities, which strengthen the foundation of the CoreSite Mesh in all verticals across our entire platform. Last quarter, we executed 110 new and expansion agreements, with 31% of those closings coming from the network vertical; 30% from the digital content vertical; 22% from the cloud vertical; and the remaining 17% from the enterprise, system integrator and managed services verticals. Our installed base of fiber cross-connects increased by 20% from Q1 2013 over Q1 2012, which includes the Comfluent acquisition. Excluding the Comfluent acquisition, fiber cross-connects grew 13% over the last year. The 42,800 square feet of new and expansion sales bookings in Q1 represents approximately $5.1 million in annualized GAAP rent at a rate of $119 per square foot. This rental rate is below our trailing 4-quarter mean, meaningfully driven by lower power density and a shift in a geographic variations in the sales mix during the past quarter. Specifically, when normalized for power density, our rate in Q1 is $144 per square foot, 15% below the average rate we achieved in 2012. This lower rate in Q1 was predominantly driven by our negotiating and execution of a fixed market agreement with a strategic customer, which includes larger deployments backfilling capacity recently vacated at our as SV2 facility in Milpitas and opening sales in the 102,000-square-foot third floor of our LA2 facility. From a long-term strategic standpoint, we were pleased to close on several key customer wins during the quarter in the network, cloud and digital content verticals. Specifically, we won a significant digital content solution with a network-rich consumer cloud platform where the access points or on ramps for the application will be housed in CoreSite facilities across 6 of our markets. We anticipate that as this new application scales, it will drive significant network traffic and bring additional eyeball networks and cable providers to our data centers. In addition to the new expansion bookings during Q1, over 39,000 square feet of new and expansion leases commenced during the quarter, which had a GAAP rental rate of $161 per square foot, representing $6.3 million in annualized GAAP rent. This represents a 40% increase in commencements over the trailing 12-month average. On renewals, we realized the rental churn rate of 1.1% on approximately 41,000 square feet of space with rent growth of 2% on a cash basis and 21.6% on a GAAP basis. The difference in cash and GAAP rent on renewals relates to a powered-shell lease for 22,000 square feet at our Chicago 1 facility and migration of a digital content application from our LA1 facility to our LA2 facility. Excluding these 2 specific transactions, the cash and GAAP growth rents were 4.4% and 9.4%, respectively. We continue to see more applications in all of our verticals move from in-house solutions to public and private cloud deployments for the scalability, reliability and diverse community of providers. These applications leverage our data centers and choice of 275 networks to improve performance. To capitalize on this shift and further enhance the value of our platform to enterprise-seeking public and private cloud solutions, in Q1 2013, we launched a new product called the Open Cloud Exchange. With this interconnection exchange product, our customers are able to use these on-ramps to the cloud to interconnect with high-performance networking cloud providers and optimize IT architecture. We believe that enhancing our platform with products designed for this new private and public cloud marketplace, paired with a dedicated team to provide these solutions to customers, will enable us to capture market share and realize a return on our investment. Taking a closer look at new and expansion sales during the quarter, we closed 29 new customer logos across all verticals, significantly expanding key communities inside our data centers with over 2/3 of the new customer logos coming from our cloud, network and mobility verticals. We made substantial progress in our network and mobility vertical, executing deals with numerous global network providers, including Chunghwa, Peerless Networks and Teliax. In our cloud vertical, we won 2 expansion deals with InterMedia and Layered Tech, while in our enterprise vertical, we won a significant new private and public cloud deployment with Samsung SDS relative to its IT infrastructure. In addition, today, we are announcing an important strategic network vertical win with XO Communications. XO has announced its expanding its XO-concentric cloud deployments in our cloud-enabled data center campuses at LA1 and Virginia 1 to better serve enterprises wanting to directly connect to their high-performance cloud and network services. Key customer wins during the quarter also included Arista, a leading software-defined cloud networking company and AppNexus, a leader in advertising insertion platforms for mobile applications. These companies are key enablers for the cloud, network and mobile communities. In Q1, we also executed 5 new and expansion agreements in the systems integrator and managed service provider vertical. We also commenced a key channel relationship with SunGard with a deployment to support health care, financial services and retail customers. Customers such as SunGard enable the communities in our data centers to support enterprise customers who may lack the scale and expertise to transition their IT architectures to a new high-performance Wide Area Network in private and public cloud environment. On an operational level, we remain pleased with the progress that our sales team has made. We believe we are on schedule to complete the development of our sales and marketing teams into a fully tenured vertical, go-to-market organization over the course of this year, and we anticipate that we will continue to see improvement in the number and the value of transactions. We believe that our vertically aligned sales force is a key differentiator in our industry and is the most effective way to create and expand the valuable communities within our platform. Additionally, during the quarter, we continued to maintain our commitment to deliver high availability operational performance and to strive for future improvement by investing in technology systems of the highest industry standards. We remain on track to finish our comprehensive IT upgrade by the second half of 2014. With that, I will now turn over the call to Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Jarrett, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter call. I will begin my remarks today by discussing our first quarter results. I will then provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity plans. In the first quarter of 2013, we recorded revenue of $55.1 million, a 16.5% increase over the first quarter of 2012. This represents a slight decline on a sequential quarter basis, driven by inclusion of approximately $1 million in nonrecurring revenue in Q4 '12, as noted on our last call, plus a $600,000 decrease in power revenue. The decrease in power revenue is attributable to a decrease in power draw by our metered power customers and a credit resulting from a customer billing dispute. Our metered power leases provide for a submetered power billing structure. As such, half of the decrease in power revenue was offset by a decrease in power expense. Our Q1 operating revenue consisted of $46.6 million in rental revenue from space and power, $6.6 million from interconnection revenue and $1.9 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenue sources. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $9.1 million as of March 31, 2013. We expect approximately 45% of the backlog to commence toward the end of Q2, another 45% in the second half of 2013, substantially weighted towards the fourth quarter and the remaining 10% in mid to late 2014. Moving onto funds from operations. We recorded first quarter FFO per diluted share in unit of $0.41, an increase of 13.9%, or $0.05 per share in unit over the same quarter of the prior year and a decrease of 2.3% or, $0.01 per share in unit on a sequential quarter basis. The decrease in FFO per share in unit from the previous quarter is largely a result of the following. First, inclusion in Q4 of $1 million or $0.02 per share in unit in nonrecurring revenue, as I mentioned a moment ago. Second, additional preferred stock dividends in Q1 being our first full quarter with the preferred stock in place, following our issuance in December 2012, net of the interest expense we would have incurred on our credit facility. This is approximately $1 million greater than Q4 or $0.02 per share in unit. Third, a $300,000 credit we issued to resolve a customer dispute in Q1 offset by additional capitalization of internal lease commissions due to additional clarity around the time incurred by our sales team on successful leasing transactions. The net impact of the foregoing items is a decrease in FFO of approximately $0.04 per diluted share in unit. Excluding those items, FFO per share in Q1 would have increased by $0.03 per diluted share in unit, or 7.5% over Q4 '12. Regarding expenses, G&A expenses were in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. Sales and marketing expenses also increased in line with our expectations. However, due to the small decrease in revenue previously discussed, our ratio of sales and marketing expenses to revenue was 6.9%, slightly above the 5.5% to 6.5% range we communicated on our last call. We expect the ratio of sales and marketing expenses to revenue to normalize within but toward the higher end of our target range as we progress through the remainder of 2013. As of March 31, 2013, our operating data center portfolio was 79.7% occupied. Including leases executed but not commenced, the portfolio was 81.6% leased. As we have discussed in the past, we expect to complete construction of 225,000 square feet of data center capacity or 18.6% of our current operating data center portfolio during 2013 as a result of our strong development pipeline. To help better represent the performance of our operating portfolio, distinct from our pre-stabilized portfolio, we have revised our supplemental to disclose these 2 components of our portfolio separately. The pre-stabilized portfolio consists only of capacity that we placed into service in March 2013 at both SV4 and LA2 as shown on Page 18 of our supplemental. Next, I'll address our development spending. We currently have approximately 275,000 square feet of data center capacity under construction at SV4, SV5, BO1, CH1, NY2, and VA2. We have incurred construction costs of $67 million out of a total estimated cost of $190 million. Presales in the projects currently under construction include 24,000 square feet in BO1 and our 100,000 square-foot build-to-suit project at SV5. Turning to our balance sheet. As discussed on our Q4 call, we amended our credit facility in January to expand its capacity, convert it to unsecured and extend its term to 2017. As of March 31, 2013, we had $52 million outstanding on this facility, leaving $294.5 million of available capacity. When combined with $8.5 million of cash on hand, we ended Q1 with over $300 million of current liquidity. Our ratio of debt to Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 1.1x at March 31, 2013. Including our outstanding preferred stock, our ratio of long-term debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.3x at quarter end. We expect our leverage to increase as we complete the capital projects outlined a moment ago. We continue to target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4x, though this may vary to support strategic initiatives or as market conditions warrant. Finally, we are reiterating our 2013 guidance of FFO per share in OP unit to a range of $1.72 to $1.82. This guidance assumes a weighted average end-of-year diluted share count of approximately 46.9 million shares in OP units, reflecting continued vesting of outstanding long-term equity incentive awards. This guidance does not account for any additional capital markets activity, property dispositions or investments beyond what we have discussed. With that, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Tom, could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on the commentary surrounding the potential acquisition opportunities? It sounded as if you were focused on -- you used, I think, the term operating companies, specifically, as opposed to property in North America, and I was just curious what sort of the nature of sort of target sort of opcos might look like?
Thomas M. Ray: Sure, Jordan. And it's always delicate to mention any kind of acquisition interest for fear of people running with that. I think the bottom line is there isn't really much to say. We're very focused on building out our data centers and selling them this year. We have a lot of product coming to market that's under development right now. We do pay attention, I guess, is really the message of what might be out there. And I guess, perhaps I might not have even said that last paragraph about acquisitions. But we do pay attention, we stay in the market. I guess the note about operating companies is that there are two ways to think about acquisitions. One is geographic, dots on a map, where else do you want to be. We don't need anything else right now in the markets we're currently in. We have a full plate. So if we were to look hard at something right now, it would probably be more oriented toward something with cash flow in it, because we have a full development pipeline right now for the year. And that's it, there's no more message than that.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. But I guess I was driving at -- it would be something that was cash flowing, but when you say operating, would it be something with sort of a higher technology application or hands-on application?
Thomas M. Ray: No. No. Our business model is our business model. Anybody we would want to look at would have to have a business model that's very closely aligned with ours. The message in there was really...
Jordan Sadler: More of a stabilized?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. If we were to do anything into next year, we're not going to go enter 2 more markets with spec development. We have plenty of that, and that's really the message.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up. In terms of the rental rate, do you think there was a little bit more color there in Jarrett's commentary on the nature of it, the lower power density and the geographic variation? But then, there was a 6-market agreement as well, and I was just curious -- and then some opening sales in LA. Are these sort of -- these concessions typical of what you've seen in the past? Or are they new and reflective of just the dynamic in the market today?
Jarrett Appleby: Jordan, it's Jarrett. These are -- when we look at it, these are opportunities that are really platform deals that we're seeing. In this particular case, it was a consumer platform. What you would see is -- the deals are comprised of rent, power and cross-connects -- and there are some larger deployments that we'd have to support like this. I think we talked about LA2 and SV2. Those assets are where the larger deployments were, and then the on-ramps were across our platforms. So we'd expect -- I think Tom provided color upfront over 2 or 3 quarters or so that will pull through the interconnection piece of the business, and that's typically what you'd see there.
Thomas M. Ray: Jordan, I'll add just a little color. I think there were 2 dynamics, predominantly, that drove the lower rental rate per foot in Q1 sales versus the trail. One of those is just power density. And when you normalize for watts per foot, the number is, I think, $144 instead of $119. That's just normalizing for power. That's flat-out math. And then, I think the driver of a $144, which is still -- I don't know -- 15% below the trailing price, plus or minus, is location. We did 25% of our sales in the Q at our SV2 facility in Milipitas where we had a prior tenant leave a larger chunk of space that we've all talked about, left it about a year ago. We're now about 75% re-leased on that capacity, and that is a building in our portfolio that is not network dense. We have -- I would say that asset and the Miami asset, as we've talked in the past, are less strong than our other assets. So that was a big chunk of it. We did a large deal in one of our buildings that wasn't a great asset and price reflects it, but it was a nice backfill. And then the other component of the larger deal was in LA2, which is the Alameda building, where we got 100,000 feet back from a tenant a little bit ago, and we've now opened up leasing in that building with a very low-cost basis. So we were aggressive on pricing on a deal opening up that third floor but still, I think, with very attractive yields on cost. So when I think about managing our investors' capital, we feel very good about Q1.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: If we look at your lease distribution table in the supplemental and we look at the space 5,000 square feet and below, it looks like the annualized rents in that category have fallen compared to last quarter. Is that just a matter of people taking -- the same users taking larger spaces and kind of moving and within the portfolio? Or is there something more to that?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, Emmanuel. This is Jeff. That's exactly what it is. We actually had a couple of customers through some expansions, ended up moving into a category, I think, into that the 5,000 to 10,000 square-foot category.
Emmanuel Korchman: So it's just a re-jiggering kind of between buckets more so than anyone trying to wait until...
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Correct.
Emmanuel Korchman: And then, Tom or Jarrett, if we looked at the 6-market lease that we keep talking about, is that already commenced? Or is that going to hurt the commencement numbers in the next 3 to 4 quarters?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, it's going to be ramping up over the course of this year, so it hasn't commenced. It just closed at end of the quarter. So that will phase in over the course of this year, over the next [indiscernible].
Emmanuel Korchman: And so how much of that is part of the $9.1 million, for the signed, not commenced?
Thomas M. Ray: We haven't commenced any of it.  Yes, it is a component of that $9.1 million, Manny. I don't think we've given -- we haven't given specific dollar amounts for specific deals.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti: Did you mention what proportion of the move-outs in the past quarter that you know of are either building their own facilities or going to the cloud?
Thomas M. Ray: I'm not aware of a...
David Toti: Can you get that kind of information?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, the move-outs that build their own facilities are usually much larger deployments. So I guess nothing in the last Q -- that we've talked about a large global social networking company at length over for last year and a half. They moved out of 2 megawatts on 3 quarters ago, plus or minus, and likely consolidated that into a building that they built over the last couple of years. I'm not aware of any other consolidations into fee-owned or user-owned buildings. And then migration to the cloud, I think I might need David and Jarrett to weigh in. I think that happens a lot, right? Enterprises are doing that all the time. It's just so much of the other side of that coin -- the cloud deployment ends back up in multitenant data center.
Jarrett Appleby: And to build on that, just a little color, we're announcing and we have the AWS relationship, where they're deployed in our sites and you can directly connect. That is bringing some clients to us. We announced Samsung SDS. They're moving their private cloud near a public cloud, so that is an opportunity for us that they're bringing it into the multitenant centers. And then the XO Concentric announcement, service providers like XO are building up their cloud deployments in our sites to market it. So I think we're getting some -- actually some benefits. It's early days from the private and public cloud deployments.
Thomas M. Ray: I'd say on -- in general, I'd say the rate of absorption from our cloud customers significantly exceeds the rate of contraction from an enterprise guy going to a cloud. And then separately, as to user-owned buildings, we just don't have much of those deployments in our portfolio. That's just not our business.
David Toti: And then maybe touch on this, I might have missed it. Can you talk about -- when you were talking about the acquisition opportunities in transaction markets, did you mention international opportunities and your thoughts? I know we touch base on that every once in a while, but I'm wondering where your head is around international opportunities today.
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we're highly focused on North America. We think we have a great opportunity here and a great business to grow. We will pay attention to anything. But I'd say our views toward international investing have not changed at all. We think it's early for us to go try and build a business organically on another continent right now. We have just a tremendous runway in front of us in North America. So something that we would look at abroad would have to be a fairly large, a fairly sizable stabilized business, and there aren't that many of those. And our view, our interest or lack thereof hasn't changed a bit.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: My first question goes back to something in Jarrett's prepared remarks, I think. And I didn't really understand the answer, so I thought I'd just answer the question again. When I look back at your GAAP and cash growth rates upon renewals, they historically have really kind of tracked each other pretty well. In this quarter, we sort of saw a real divergence in terms of those 2 numbers, and I was wondering if you might explain that again. And then I have a follow-up.
Jarrett Appleby: Well, Jonathan, yes, there's one in terms of the migration. We saw the power-shelled lease in Chicago for 22,000 square feet and a migration in L.A. from LA1 to LA2. When you correct for those, that does normalize it in the range that we talked about. Cash would go to 4.4%, and GAAP would go to 9.4%. So there were 2 individual deals that affected that, and this is what we'd expected in guiding going forward.
Thomas M. Ray: And Jonathan, the big swing or the increase in the variance between GAAP and cash in this Q was because of that powered-shell lease where fundamentally you're rolling an old 10-year deal to a new 10-year deal. So the cash mark-to-market on that could be reasonably small but the gap is very, very big, solely because you're rolling a prior long term to a new long term.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Got it, long-term deals. That makes a lot of sense. All right, great. I was just wondering if you could give us a little color on -- and you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Tom, just that you saw some pretty stable trends. Obviously, you guys are continuing to execute. But as you prepare to move into some bigger facilities and, particularly, in New Jersey, where we're hearing about some pricing weakness, does the way that you approach the competitive entry into that New Jersey market versus, I guess, 32 A of A, does it change at all and what's your approach?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, it's a great question, and it absolutely does change. When -- we are very focused on building value inside our buildings, and that comes from heavily multi-tenanted, multi-customered, lots of different applications that fit together in very specific sets of communities, cloud, mobility, et cetera. That said -- so that is our core business. That said, any time you have a new 280,000 square-foot building, doing 1 or 2 larger wholesale deals to put a little balance in your income statement and just stabilize the asset rapidly, we look more at those opportunities in the early days of a new large build. So in the past, you look at SV4, the Coronado building in the Bay Area, our Reston, building VA1, in the early days of those, we would do a couple of larger deals. And so we are in that market, wherever we have a lot of inventory. And then as you get assets up and running, then you kind of throttle back on your interest in that kind of business. I would say what's different now than in the past, to look at larger wholesale deals, we're still really focused on the customers who will also bring applications that add value to the buildings. Just a generic enterprise server farm that's all wholesale, still not very interesting to us. But sometimes, you see some of the larger content or network guys with 1 or 2 meg requirement that also serve as a nice network anchor. And then the early days of a new build, we do look at those opportunities.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Super. And if I can ask just one last question. I think you guys have really over the last several quarters made tremendous progress towards going after performance-sensitive applications. In a lot of ways, it's just highlighting the value of the asset that you guys have in the way that it should be viewed from the marketplace. As you go through that process, and we have seen some very nice momentum around the repricing of customers who do renew, will there be an impact to churn? This was another low quarter with very low churn. But as we look forward, will we see a give-and-take between churn levels and your ability to really take advantage of the quality of your asset by pricing that space appropriately?
Thomas M. Ray: We think that's still a little ways off, Jonathan. I think our most direct comp in the marketplace has managed churn over the last couple of years to get repricing through new applications inside existing capital, and that certainly is something that may happen over time. I think it will probably happen reasonably effortlessly with the 1-meg deal here or the 0.75-meg deal there that 3 years from now probably should go to a different market, frankly. It should go some place with a lot cheaper power. So I think we will, over time, probably organically harvest existing capacity in the portfolio, the higher and better use. I don't think in the immediate term, we're driven toward doing that.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: And Jonathan, the only thing I would add is as you did see we were at 1.1% churn this quarter. In our guidance for the year, we did give guidance, basically the same would be 1% to 2% per quarter for 2013.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Rand with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Rand: I might have missed this earlier, but I was hoping you could give a little bit color on -- in New Jersey, the expected cost for your Secaucus development increased by about $20 million versus your last supplement. Can you talk about that a little bit?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, we should have done a better job messaging in the releases this morning, so our apologies for that. But the math is as follows: $18 million out of that $20 million is just a timing shift from later capital to phase 1. You're right, we haven't increased the square footage that we're communicating to be built in phase 1. But by revising the plan, as we've done, we're going to end up getting an extra 3 megawatts of capacity out of the asset. So we'll end up with a 21 critical megs instead of 18. So about a 17% increase in ending capacity in exchange for a 1% increase in total project cost. So it's a pretty good deal. I think -- essentially, we think we're going to go from a prior vision of maybe around $8,500 a kilowatt to closer to $7,500 a kilowatt at stabilization. What's driving that is the asset had a 40,000-foot area that our plan, which was conservative, assumed that we would have to fill all of that with gear. Since acquisition, we've been engaged with the Meadowlands Commission and other entitlement authorities, and we do have a clear read on being able to put more equipment outside the building. So we're going to spend a little bit more money on structural steel. We're going to spend a little bit more money putting things outside the building and creating structural scalability inside the building, and that will enable us to bring an extra 3 megs. And the shift of that is a very small increase in total project cost but a meaningful shift from later phases to the first phase.
Matthew Rand: Okay, I appreciate that. And then on that facility, can you talk a little bit about the proximity to Equinix's assets? Does that help you from a competitive perspective?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we think -- we certainly select our sites to be in a position to drive network density, cloud density and communities of interest from our customers. We think that the center of gravity for the financial ecosystem shifted from Manhattan to Secaucus in the post-911 era, and that shift to Secaucus certainly had something to do with our decision to locate where we did. We also see a meaningful pressure from the cloud and content communities off of Manhattan to New Jersey priced power. But especially when -- in the content verticals, when it has -- when an application needs mobile support, mobility support, which increasingly they all do, that shift out of Manhattan needs to be in a location still with great latency over to Manhattan, where the eyeballs are, where the users are and the mobile devices. And so Secaucus, yes, it has the financial vertical, which is appealing. And it has great network access, a lot of network, so you get great network choice and tremendous low latency back to serve mobility, cloud and networks into Manhattan. So all of that factored into the location decision.
Matthew Rand: Okay, that's helpful. Then finally, I'm interested in this 6 market agreements you had with a single customer. It seems like based on some of the cloud deployments, you're doing more and more of these with one customer in multiple locations. Can you tell me how a typical negotiation goes over that or how you look at pricing across the different markets?
Jarrett Appleby: I think it's really -- we put together a platform deal. It is still market by market. It has to be competitive. But the benefit, we're seeing more opportunities like cloud. We have 5 markets that we're scaling in our campuses, where we're serving the cloud community. The digital content and network are growing 9 markets. So we definitely had a West Coast bias in a couple of markets like Virginia, where we're consistently seeing 5 to 9 market opportunities. So you do have to compete a bit with local. But it does give us some price stability, and the benefit is really around increasingly the value of interconnection and in connecting to the cloud providers. And these on-ramps are more and more strategic for us. And again, those -- we're providing those as 5 to 9 markets at a time.
Thomas M. Ray: And I'd add, I think our expectation is to see a meaningful shift in product mix surrounding these multi-market agreements. And specifically, they do have a little bit lower rent going in. But by definition, if you're looking at a 6 or 7 or 9 market agreement, what -- when we're very interested in most types of opportunities is when they're supporting customer applications, they're going to drive traffic. So the one we did this time is a significant customer cloud, end-user content application that we believe is, number one, going to attract some networks to some buildings, some assets we'd like to add more networks to; and number two, will drive a lot of disproportionate number of cross-connects. And so we do price rent lower not to give it away, but I think the market is more aggressive on rent to land deals that the market believes are going to drive significant [indiscernible] and cross-connect margin. And that's -- those are the same set of decisions we've been making for 13 years. We used to make those decisions on a one-off basis at LA1 or D.C. or NY1. We're now very fortunate to be able to make the same decisions to land network anchors in a greater number of markets and populate more and more of our buildings and our platforms with these kinds of apps. So yes, the rents are lower, and our visibility into cross-connect growth around different apps is pretty good. And we think that the total economics of these deals remains highly attractive.
Matthew Rand: Okay, great. And are you able to sort of get less attractive geographies leased-up as a result of packaging them into these deals? Or is that not as much a factor?
Thomas M. Ray: No, I think it is. The metric I gave in my prepared remarks was 1 year ago and 1.5 years ago, we might get 3 nice deployments, deployments that we think add value to the buildings. We got 8 a year ago. We had 4 1.5 years ago. And those numbers correlated to 3 markets in each of those time periods. On the most recent 3-quarter trail, we got 35 of them. We got at least 1 in every single building. We got 7 in New York and Virginia. We got 5 in the Bay Area and Denver and New York -- or yes, L.A. So yes, absolutely, we're seeing a much greater number of these apps and much better distribution across the portfolio, and we wouldn't have gotten those in some of our less powerful buildings without selling to the platform. And I think you're seeing that the platform sale being able to lift the entire value of the whole platform, the whole portfolio. And it takes time, right, but, I mean, the early returns to us are very positive.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.
David B. Rodgers: Yes, Tom, I guess following up on the comments on strategic transaction that you've talked about. Is there a point in time when taking Secaucus out of the equation, that this begin to abate and that we don't see maybe some of the pressure on the rental rates? I guess with that, can you provide some color on the average lease lengths that you've been signing for some of these more strategic customers?
Thomas M. Ray: No, I think they -- our interest in doing wholesale deals declines really as each asset fills up. So I would expect, Dave, the dynamic to continue. Whenever we deliver a very large slug of inventory in any market, we'll probably still look to move a little bit of it faster in the early days. So it will decline somewhat as the portfolio strengthens. But you still sell based on your inventory, and when you have a lot, you sell more aggressively. And what's the second half of your question? I apologize, I'm sorry.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: I think -- the question on the term, Dave, I think, was your second question. On the term for the quarter, it was right in line with what we've said historically, on average 3 to 4 years overall. And we were just on the low end of that this quarter on a combined basis with everything.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. And to frame it, in Q1, the "larger strategic transactions" without great pricing, I think one of them was 300 kilowatts and one was 350. Those are the biggest deals we did. So they're not earthshaking deals. And so on a deal that size, you'll still see a colocation-type term. But if we were going to do 2 or 3 megawatts, number one, the customers want 5s and 10s. And we're certainly willing to do so those on those kinds of deals. I just think, for lack of a better way to put it, Dave, the market is the market and a 300-kilowatt deal is often still a 3- or 5-year deal, and a multi-megawatt deal is still probably a 10-year deal. And we're a normal company that meets the market.
David B. Rodgers: And I guess just following up on the development pipeline, you have 3 developments coming online. It looks pretty close at least, given the dollar spent to date, Boston, Chicago and then another round at SV4. Maybe talk about some early traffic or demands there that give you some confidence in some initial leasing getting done there.
Thomas M. Ray: You want to take it?
Jarrett Appleby: Yes, we are -- in a couple of these, you have seen some movement in New York. We're continuing to presell the networks and the cloud deployments. In Boston, we had some movement with a system integrator partner and a magnet in the digital content that is commencing now. So you're seeing some movement there. And the pipeline is growing roughly 25% across our portfolio each quarter. So we are seeing movement in Boston. In Chicago, frankly, the vertical piece is a little bit surprising. We just want to -- we have another digital content, network-oriented asset that's commenced there, but we've been a little slower there as we've moved to a vertical sales force. But the funnel is growing in Chicago. We have moved the needle in a few financial service clients. In fact, 7 of the top 7 deals in the financial services is vertical, as we've hired up. But we're continuing to focus on Chicago and expect to grow that with this digital content and the network community coming in there.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Dave, just one other piece of color for you. In the supplemental for that Boston project that completes here in the second quarter, we have footnoted that, but it is 100% leased at this time. And that will come online here next quarter.
Thomas M. Ray: So Boston's sold. The Bay Area, SV4, it's just pretty consistent singles and doubles. It's just more inventory for the building. There is a [indiscernible] that -- and there are a couple -- that a couple of different customers have on those buildings that may or may not get triggered. We want to be prepared in case they are, and we'll have visibility around that over the next few months. So that asset is really -- we just keep delivering inventory kind of in pace as we sell it or as we think we might. And as Jarrett said, I think Chicago's been frankly slower than we anticipated, and there you go.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC.
Jonathan Atkin: Yes. So on a general basis, which markets in which you operate have you seen the greatest absorption overall? And then conversely, in which markets have you seen the greatest amount of competitive supply come on?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, in, Jon, what kind of time frame? If we look at Q1, we frankly sold the most volume in L.A. and the second most in the Bay Area. But in general...
Jonathan Atkin: This is more of from an industry standpoint. We know where you sold. But as you look at the overall sector and the competitive set, which markets do you think it seem that the most absorption, including yourselves but not limited to?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, it's really kind of the same. I haven't seen a huge change. You still see Virginia and the Bay Area as the biggest absorption markets. I do think Secaucus -- infill New Jersey has continued to do very, very well. But it doesn't absorb as much as a 30- or 25-meg annual megawatt market like the Bay Area or Virginia. Those markets are still absorbing. I think that our view is that competition or supply in the Bay Area has somewhat leveled out. That market has troughed. We don't see it rebounding briskly in the near term, but we think it's troughed. And we think Virginia is -- probably has a little bit further to go in terms of towards its trough. There's a lot of supply there. And we're building a shell in our VA2 development, but we're only going to build 1 of 4 floors of data center precisely for that reason. We're going to stick to our co-lo business. So I don't know if that helps. I guess we'd also say, we certainly get a lot of information from the marketplace that Chicago is doing very, very well. And you know, once again, Chicago had a great party and we weren't invited. And we're going to get in to that party by hook or by crook, but that's a little bit more market commentary for you.
Jonathan Atkin: And in the 6 market strategic customer, are you having kind of preselling discussions with other customers as a result of that magnet customer coming on board? Or are we getting ahead of ourselves that we need to see them take occupancy before you start to see some beneficial flow-through impacts?
Jarrett Appleby: Yes, we're talking to the community right now, Jon, and laying out, particularly the eyeball networks and the cable providers. And under NDA, we can share what's doing on there in the application. And those are the kind of things that we're looking to pull through other folks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Just trying to understand a little bit more what's going on with pricing. So the explanations you give for your price there in the quarter, when you adjust for the power density, you get to the $144. And then the $144 is 15% to 20% lower than where you've historically been because of some of the strategic deals that you did in this quarter. Am I to assume then that pricing generally in the market has been stable? Is that the message you're trying to get across to people? Or you just kind of had this unique thing happen during the quarter.
Thomas M. Ray: I guess the core message is pricing for the -- really kind of regular co-lo, I think, has been stable. I think pricing for performance-sensitive, I think there's still kind of steady 3% growth in that business. We did a deal that had 300 to 400 kilowatts in each of 2 locations, where we were very aggressive on pricing to backfill one chunk of old inventory in a building that is not one of our stronger buildings, and then the pop open the old Sprint floor at 900 Alameda. I think beyond that, our view of pricing, our core business is business as usual. And it's just one of those anomalous quarters of -- we didn't been sign deals in our stronger buildings, and a couple of the larger deals we signed were just not dense with regard to power. So the square footage number came out low.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then now that you kind of backfilled kind of like the Milpitas space, which is the largest of your empty spaces from a client move-out. I mean, are there any more kind of large spaces that you could still have to be aggressive pricing-wise to fill over the next few quarters x your development coming online?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, I don't have that -- I think Jarrett and I talk about all the time, there isn't anywhere else we're saying, "You know what, it's time just to move that merchandise. Whatever the clearing price is in the market, let's shrug our shoulders and just take it and fill it." There isn't anywhere right now that we're saying that to ourselves like, "If the clearing price for a 1-meg deal in Virginia or the Bay Area is a bad clearing price, let's pass on those large deals and just keep doing what we're doing." So that's where our mindset is.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the Milpitas deal, I know you were aggressive on the pricing, I know you didn't mention that cost base on that building is pretty low. So what kind of yields are you achieving just on that lead in that kind of 12% to 15% range?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think the yield on both the locations where we put on each individually and assets in aggregate, that the yields are comfortably above our 12% hurdle.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisors.
Unknown Analyst: This is Eric Franco [ph] here with John Stewart. Could you just discuss what the GAAP backlog of $9.1 million? How does that translate on a cash basis over the next 12 months, call it?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: You said on a cash basis, what's the backlog? It's about $12.5 million as compared to the $9.1 million from a GAAP perspective. In terms of trending, I think we said in our prepared remarks that about 90% of the GAAP amount ends up commencing during 2013, some in Q2 and then back ended in Q4. From a cash perspective, that's a little lower than that. I don't have the number right at the top of my head, but it's -- my recollection is it's probably somewhere around 65% rather than the 90%.
Unknown Analyst: And I'm assuming most of that is already incorporated in the operating portfolio versus the development pipeline. Am I right in that assumption?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, it is.
Unknown Analyst: The next question, just regarding future acquisitions. I know it's pretty speculative. But if you ever saw any attractive acquisition opportunity, just curious, given your pretty healthy balance sheet, just in terms of funding, how would you decide to think about your capital structure in terms of -- you seem to have a lot of variety of fundings at your disposal, including common stock of your -- the preferred market's certainly open to you and your recap lines. Just curious to get your thoughts on what seems attractive at this point.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, it's a great question, Eric. I think when we look at currency related to some type of a strategic deal, as Tom alluded to earlier, I think bottom line is we do like having the dry powder that we have today. So from that standpoint, we like continuing to operate at that low leverage. But we look at our means of currency anywhere from whether it's the common stock, the preferred stock or some type of unsecured debt issuance. And ultimately, it's going to vary based upon the size of some type of a deal if we were to get something done and the timing and what that looks like from a pricing standpoint. I think all of those factor into ultimately what we would use. But I think size will play a big part in that. I think as we've said earlier, when we have a target of debt to preferred stock ratio of the call it somewhere around 4x...
Thomas M. Ray: Net debt plus preferred to adjusted EBITDA.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, I'm sorry, debt plus the preferred to the EBITDA ratio of roughly 4x. We said we would go higher for that on the strategic deal, but that gives you some level of idea how large the deals would be before we would have to start looking at other means to finance that besides just debt and preferred stock.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, I think in terms of product mix, Jeff and I have talked about it really over the last week or so that -- I think you'll see us try to maintain a fairly staggered roll of maturities. We just did a perpetual with the 7 handle. We have a bunch of very short-term stuff that will be ramping up on our line of credit. If there's been some price talk that maybe we can do a 7- or 10-year bond, a 7- or 10-year paper with a 5 handle, somewhere in the 5s. So that might be an interesting layer in the stack, but we don't need that yet. The pricing off the line is incredibly attractive. So you'll see our line run up some and then we'll take a look at how to term it out. Since we just did a preferred, we may look at 7- to 10-year paper, but we may go back to preferred if it's -- let's say the preferred comes inside of 6. We might look at that. So but I think in general, you'll see us stagger our maturities, and that will show up in a couple of different tranches of pricing. And as to which one we hit at any given time, we're just going to pick the best thing at the moment.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would like turn to the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Thomas M. Ray: Thank you. Our view is that the Q1 is another good step as we execute the business plan. I guess, I've thought of it a little bit as -- it's a very solid base hit right through the GAAP, probably moved a guy from first to second. We didn't get a revi in the Q, but it was a nice at back, good, solid. And we continue to play our game. The team here, we're here to manufacture runs and win a championship, and we're not going to be happy with anything else. And we think we're on track to go make that happen. We're very happy at how our customers are responding to what we're doing in the market. We think the market opportunity remains very strong. We think our momentum in grabbing the kinds of business that we want to grab is accelerating very well. We're just trying to build value in our business. So we appreciate the trust our customers put in us. We very much appreciate the hard work of our people, and we are thankful for the support of our shareholders. We are going to just keep working hard to deliver strong returns. So thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-02-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Derek McCandless, General Counsel. Thank you, Mr. McCandless, you may begin.
Derek McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jarrett Appleby, our Chief Operating Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in a supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Thanks, Derek, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter call. Before reviewing Q4 results, I'd like to review some of our key accomplishments in 2012. During the year, we restructured our sales, marketing and go-to-market activities to a vertical model. Despite the disruption this caused, we executed through the year in both financial and operational terms. Specifically, in 2012, we increased revenue by 19.7%, adjusted EBITDA by 36% and FFO by 26.5% over 2011. This continued drive in top line growth, and our 69% flow-through margin to adjusted EBITDA in 2012, are particularly encouraging in light of the material changes we made in our sales and marketing teams during the year. Also in 2012, we invested over $92 million in growing our data center platform, and entered a new market in Denver with the acquisition of Comfluent, the area's most network-dense colocation operator. We signed 338 new and expansion TKD leases for approximately 130,000 square feet, reflecting an average size of 387 square feet per lease. With this customer growth, our installed base of fiber cross connections increased by 21%, which includes cross-connects related to our acquisition of Comfluent. Excluding the Comfluent acquisition, fiber cross connections grew 13% over 2011. Turning to Q4 '12. Our financial results reflect consistent execution of our business plan and solid growth over Q4 '11. Specifically, revenue increased by 20% over the prior year quarter, adjusted EBITDA by 38% and FFO per share by 23.5%. Reflecting investments in our sales and marketing functions, Q4 booking volume was the highest since we became a public company. New and expansion sales of $11.6 million in annualized GAAP rent included TKD sales of $8.4 million. It also included an estimated $3.2 million in annualized GAAP rent related to a 100,000-square foot powered-shell built-to-suit on our Santa Clara campus. We note that the rent on the build-to-suit is subject to potential minor adjustments to reflect any changes in final project cost. We expect to invest $19 million in this project during 2013, as disclosed in our Q4 supplemental. 1/2 of the rent from this project should commence in Q4 '13 and the remaining 1/2 toward the end of 2014 or early 2015, depending upon the timing of the completion of certain power upgrades associated with the lease. As expected, Q4 lease commencements of $2.9 million in annualized GAAP rent, were lower than our historical average, reflecting lighter bookings in Q3. Pricing in Q4 remained firm across our platform. Specifically, we achieved rental mark-to-market of 11.7% on a cash basis and 15.6% on a GAAP basis. We recorded churn of 2.1%, slightly below our trailing 4-quarter average of 2.5%. Our GAAP rental rate on new and expansion TKD sales in the quarter was $151 per square foot, reflecting lower power density in the product mix sold in the quarter, as well as conceding lower rent to win a key network anchor application in Chicago. Beyond the record dollar volume of our Q4 sales, we saw a healthy blend of new business across all verticals. Specifically, we signed 23 new logo customers in Q4, including 7 network, 9 cloud and 5 enterprise customers. In the key network and cloud verticals, we executed over 64 new and expansion leases. Of that, we executed 27 leases with network and mobility providers. Among the key Q4 wins in our network vertical were leases signed with service providers Sidera, Zayo, GTT and CITIC. Other new customers in the vertical included Saas Unified Communications leader, BroadSoft, and 2 mobility service providers. Our cloud vertical segment also showed great strength in the quarter and represented 64% of annualized GAAP rent signed. The 39 new and expansion agreements in this vertical include key wins from global cloud providers in our Boston, Reston and Santa Clara markets. Specifically, we executed new agreements with what we believe are 3 of the top global cloud service providers, each leveraging off of the growth of our cloud-enabled data center campuses and the launch of our Open Cloud Exchange. The Open Cloud Exchange, which was announced in January of 2013 offers our customers direct connection to the variety of cloud-based IT resources and applications on our platform. We believe that success in our network and cloud verticals leads to increasing value across our platform. In addition to strength in our network and cloud verticals, we saw solid growth in the systems integrators and MSP vertical with industry leaders such as a Digital Voice Solutions and SunGard, a new partner specializing in supporting enterprises in targeted industries such as health care, financial services and retail. Together, these Q4 customers enhance the valuable mesh of technology solutions already offered by the over 750 companies relying on CoreSite's data center platform and our valuable mesh of customers and applications. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to run through our financial results.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Tom and hello, everyone. Before I review the results of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to outline the steps we took in 2012 to strengthen and expand CoreSite's financial foundation. As we've grown our business, we've maintained a strong balance sheet with low leverage and limited near-term debt maturities. We believe that we are entering a new phase of growth as a company, and in 2012, we enhanced our balance sheet to support that growth. In December, we issued $115 million of perpetual preferred equity, netting the company $111 million after expenses. We used the proceeds to repay all of the secured debt outstanding on our VA1 property, and to repay all borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. Additionally, in January, we amended our credit facility. Supported by the increased value of our portfolio, we increased our line capacity, reduced the spread by 25 basis points, moved to an unsecured structure and extended the term to 2017. This additional liquidity secures low-cost capital to support expansion and terms out all of our near-term debt maturities. Additionally, diversifying our capital structure in reducing our secured indebtedness also brings us closer to a longer-term goal of achieving an investment grade rating. With that, I will now turn to fourth quarter and full-year operating results. Regarding full year results. In 2012, we recorded revenue of $206.9 million, reflecting an increase of 19.7% over 2011. Adjusted EBITDA increased 36% to $89.4 million in 2012. Importantly, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 500 basis points to 43%. FFO increased year-over-year by 26.5%, coming in at $72 million for 2012. Our revenue flow-through rate to adjusted EBITDA in 2012 was 69%, demonstrating our ability to leverage off our current platform as we continue to scale the business. Regarding our Q4 results. We reported FFO per diluted share and unit of $0.42, which represents a 23.5% increase over Q4 of 2011. Our operating revenues were $55.3 million, a 20% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Q4 operating revenue consisted of $46.1 million in revenue from space rental and power charges, $6.2 million from interconnection revenues and $3 million from tenant reimbursement and other sources. Interconnection revenue increased 88% over the prior year quarter, and increased from 7.1% of revenue in Q4 2011 to 11.1% of revenue in Q4 2012. A material component of this growth resulted from increases in unit pricing. As Tom noted, our organic increase in fiber cross-connect volume was approximately 13%. For 2013, we forecast organic growth and cross-connect revenue between 9% and 13%. Regarding our investments in our sales and marketing functions, we incurred sales and marketing expense of $3.4 million in Q4. This correlates to approximately 6.1% of revenue, which is within our target range of 5.5% to 6.5% of revenue. We expect this level of spending to continue in 2013. As of December 31, 2012, our data center portfolio was 77% occupied, including all operational properties, which includes the pre-stabilized assets, as shown on Page 18 of our supplemental. Including leases executed, but not commenced, our data center portfolio was 81.3% leased. Regarding our backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases, annualized GAAP rent from this pool is $10.4 million as compared to last quarter's backlog of $1.6 million. The backlog is expected to commence in 2013 with approximately 2/3 in the first half and 1/3 in the second half of the year. Regarding capital spending on expanding our national platform. We expect to invest between $180 million to $200 million in 2013. This amount is comprised of the following key projects: $65 million to complete the initial phase of our NY2 project, including the $24 million already invested to acquire the land and the site. We anticipate investing the remaining $41 million ratably over the second and third quarters; $60 million in our VA2 development with commencement expected in the second half of 2013; $19 million in our SV5 built-to-suit development on our Santa Clara campus, expected to be completed in Q4 2013; $36 million to $56 million in various projects across Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Boston and Chicago. For a more detailed breakdown of these projects and planned near-term future construction, please refer to Page 18 of our supplemental package. Now, I will turn to our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2012, we had no amount outstanding on our revolving credit facilities. We had approximately $8.1 million of cash available, and currently $355 million of capacity under our credit facility, providing what we believe is sufficient liquidity to fund our expansion plans for 2013. Our debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 0.6x and our debt to total enterprise value is 4.1%. During the quarter, we announced our Board of Directors had approved an increase in our dividend for the second consecutive year. We increased our dividend by 50% to $0.27 per share on a quarterly basis or $1.08 per share on an annual basis. We remain focused on maintaining our dividend payout levels to comply with our REIT requirements, balanced with our need to retain cash to grow our portfolio through internal and external investments. Additionally, I would like to note that in our supplemental for this quarter, we revised the nomenclature that identifies our data centers. For example, our locations at 32 Avenue of the Americas and Secaucus, New Jersey will become NY1 and NY2, respectively. We have provided a reconciliation of the former and current sets of nomenclature on Page 8 of our supplemental. And now in closing, I'd like to address guidance for 2013. Please keep in mind that our guidance is based on our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio, such as acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity. As provided on Page 21 of our supplemental, our guidance for 2013 is as follows: FFO per share and LPE unit is estimated to be $1.72 to $1.82. Keep in mind that the recently completed preferred stock offering impacts our 2013 FFO guidance by approximately $0.10 per share in unit in 2013. Revenue is estimated to be $237 million to $247 million. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $28 million to $30 million, in line with our earlier guidance that our G&A would be approximately 12% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $105 million to $110 million. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows: estimated churn rate per quarter of 1% to 2%. Please note that this is not net of increases in our rent growth, as we will report those amounts separately. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 4% to 7% for the full year. Capital expenditures related to development are estimated to be $200 million to $225 million. This includes the expansion capital discussed above, plus amounts related to our IT upgrade project, tenant improvements and other capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures estimated to be $4 million to $8 million, or approximately 2.5% of our revenue for 2013. With that, let me turn it back over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Thanks, Jeff. I'll now take a moment to discuss our perspective on market conditions and our internal organizational initiatives. At a high level, our views on the market have not materially changed from 1 year ago, and we expect a steady 2013. Although 2012 saw uneven sales volume from quarter-to-quarter, volume for the year remained consistent with past years. Our view of 2013 paralleled that of last year, and is supported by a steady volume of attractive opportunities in our sales tunnel. Our "boots on the ground" view is supported at a macro level by data from Gartner, which shows data center outsourcing increasing from 20% in 2012 to nearly 35% in 2016. In addition, Gartner forecasts that over 70% of server workloads will be virtualized over that same period, with new enterprise workloads deployed in multi-tenant data centers forecasted to nearly double in the next 2 years. We believe that these trends bode well for CoreSite, particularly as we focus on further strengthening our network-rich, cloud-enabled data centers in key interconnection hubs across North America. Regarding organizational changes, 2012 marked a very successful year across 5 key areas: first, in 2012, our field operation teams provided our customers with what we believe is the best service in the industry. Our focus on operational excellence allowed us to execute upon more than 8,000 service orders, including a record number of fiber cross-connect installations; second, to further improve the CoreSite customer experience, we also made strong progress re-architecting our internal technology platform. Our previously announced IT upgrade project, designed to bring our technology systems up to the highest standards in the industry, is approximately 30% complete and we anticipate final execution by Q3 of 2014; third, regarding the reliability of our facilities, our performance in 2012 cements our position as an industry leader. First, our facilities team ensured 100% uptime through Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath. More broadly, for the second consecutive year, our team distinguished itself with 6 9s of uptime across our North American platform. This record of excellence stands out as one of the best in our industry; fourth, with regard to the vertical alignment of our sales and marketing functions, as of today, we were approximately 80% to 85% staffed in both our sales and marketing teams. We anticipate that we will add the remaining hires during the first half of 2013 and settle in with SG&A expenses consistent with our anticipated range from 17% to 19% of revenue. We expect the investments we made in 2012, and those will complete in the first half of this year, to result in headcount across our sales and marketing functions that is nearly 2X that in place at the end of 2011. We believe that this greater capability enables us to win a greater market share of high-performance applications, and provide a differentiated value proposition for our core verticals. Finally, we continue to expand our geographic platform. At year end, we had approximately 95,000 square feet of data center capacity under construction across our existing facilities in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Santa Clara, with all projects slated for completion by mid-2013. In addition to those existing building expansions, we expect to break ground on the following 3 new developments in 2013. In Reston, we are entitled and have submitted for a construction permit to build our 200,000-square foot VA2 data center, contiguous to our 260,000-square foot VA1 building. We expect to break ground on VA2 in the middle of this year and invest $60 million in constructing the powered-shell and first phase of salable inventory. On our Santa Clara campus, we expect to commence and complete SV5, the 100,000-square foot powered-shell build-to-suit. This pre-leased development enables us to serve a strategic customer and accelerate the monetization of a portion of the land we own on the campus. Beyond the pad sites supporting the build-to-suit, we retain 2 additional development parcels: one currently entitled for 210,000 square feet of development; and the other that we believe may support between 100,000 and 300,000 square feet, depending upon entitlements. In Secaucus, New Jersey we will construct our NY2 facility on the supporting land parcel we acquired in 2013. NY2 will bring 4.5 megawatts of salable data center capacity to market in Q4 '13, with the ability to scale the existing building up to an estimated 18 critical megawatts. We believe that the land parcel we acquired will support additional ground-up development, and we will provide updates regarding the entitlement process on this site as appropriate throughout the year. We have high expectations for our NY2 expansion as we enter what we believe is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable submarkets in the U.S. for our business plan and our targeted applications and customers. Specifically, 2 of the United States leading colocation and IT services companies have experienced consistent, robust and highly profitable growth in Secaucus in the Meadowlands. Additionally, the Secaucus submarket is the leading location in the region for financial services firms, and provides robust, diverse, low-latency network access to Manhattan. These factors differentiate the Secaucus area from the outer submarkets of Somerset and Middlesex counties, which offer the same cost of power but significantly longer and less diverse fiber routes to Manhattan and subsea cable landing stations, access to which is often a key requirement for performance-sensitive colocation applications. We see strong opportunity in Secaucus, and look forward to bringing our NY2 facility online at the end of this year. 2012 was a great year for CoreSite. We had ambitious plans to reengineer our company, and we executed on all fronts. Importantly, we did so while keeping our sales and financial performance on track. As we look ahead, we are as optimistic as ever about our company and our market opportunity. We have a great platform of assets in the right locations in the best U.S. markets; the right go-to-market strategy supported by excellent products, service and a world-class sales and marketing team; and more than 750 key customers working together across our platform to create a valuable mesh of technology solutions. We believe that we are in the early stages of executing upon the opportunity before us, and we remain focused upon continuing to build a great company with a valuable and enduring market position. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unknown Analyst: This is actually Gee [ph] here for Jamie. Just a question on the powered-shell build-to-suit in Santa Clara. Can you just talk a little bit more about the strategic rationale, and also if you could provide the lease term and the yield on that build-to-suit?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we have confidentiality provisions in the lease, Gee [ph], but what we can communicate is what's in the public disclosures. We've indicated GAAP rent of $3.2 million a year, annualized GAAP rent on a stabilized basis, and incremental capital costs of $19 million to build the building. And I think that the majority of the rest of the cost is the land parcel that was in place. We think -- I guess, a couple of different things. The returns met our thresholds, #1. #2, we are helping a customer that's very, very important to us across North America and just furthering and deepening a good relationship with that customer. And then #3, I think what that customer -- what we believe that customer will be doing on our campus will make the campus even more attractive to other networks and cloud service providers and enterprises. So it was a win on all 3 counts.
Unknown Analyst: And also just shifting gears a little bit. Can you talk about the general competitive landscape for each of your markets? We're hearing more about capital shifting into colo from wholesale. I know your products are more differentiated with higher network density, but maybe you can just talk about what the pricing pressure you're seeing for colo in general and how your data centers are doing?
Thomas M. Ray: I'd say across the markets, really no change. And Jarrett, do you want to offer more feedback?
Jarrett Appleby: Yes, I think for what we're focused on, I think we've been talking a lot about the cloud and networking community. Again, that's part of the reason where we selected these sites in close proximity. It took a lot of years to build up the network density that we have over the years, and we continue to build on that. So from our side, it is differentiated. Folks are looking for an alternative to incumbents. We'd heard of others trying to move in this space. But again, I think it's going to take quite some time for you to build up the network density and choice and the ability to support digital content in the CloudCommunity like we have.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Want to just quickly follow-up on Gee's question on the build-to-suit. The GAAP rent, is that a net rent, triple net rent?
Thomas M. Ray: It is.
Jordan Sadler: It is. And if you were to throw an allocation to the land down there, either book value or what have you, what would the total all-in be on the site?
Thomas M. Ray: I don't think we've disclosed that anywhere, Jordan. I think -- you see market prices for land. I'd say may be between the $30 and $90 an FAR foot is probably where the market is.
Jordan Sadler: $30 and $90?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. I mean, it's a fairly wide range.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, okay. Okay, that's helpful. And how did the transaction come about? Was it reverse inquiry? I don't see you guys -- or I don't hear a lot about you guys pitching shell.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, we don't. It's fairly rare. There are times we do in some locations. I think this came about from a good relationship at executive levels and at the staffing level, the sales team with a large customer.
Jarrett Appleby: And Jordan, I think, we've been talking about the value of our platform. What's happened is we're getting a lot more of that. We're clearly focused on transaction level, but we are focused on our strategic account list. And when these opportunities opportunistically come up, what we can -- it's a win-win, we'll focus on that.
Thomas M. Ray: I think we just have more resources and Jarrett has made a huge difference. More resources at the field level and at the executive level going deeper and deeper with our top 31 targeted accounts.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And just generically across the 3 developments that you described, Reston, Santa Clara and Secaucus, did you say -- comment on returns, maintaining 12-plus percent returns? Is that sort of fair? Is it going up, down?
Thomas M. Ray: No change. And we've always said north of 12%. And that's no change.
Jordan Sadler: Okay. And then this is lastly a comment on sort of building out a network-dense facility, with Jarrett, I think this was sort of your last comment, the difficulty in building the necessary network density. I think you guys have talked about, historically, in order to sort of create these facilities, they have to be in locations that already have significant network density and then you have a facility that has -- bringing an anchor tenant to a facility in 1 of these locations. Is that sort of a fair assessment? And any other sort of critical obstacles to creating these network-dense facilities?
Jarrett Appleby: I think that's at the core of it and also having a relationship across multiple markets. We're in 9 markets today, so we really get to provide a value proposition across the platform. That's why a tuck-in like Denver made a lot of sense for us to bring the density there. But it also where we had a lot of those clients. They told us to go there. Another good example is L.A., where you have One Wilshire tethered in -- LA1 tethered into LA2, and we get that value proposition, and you'll see that in New York, with New York 1 tethered in with NY2 in Secaucus. So we build on those communities, and we make it easy to be in the city and also nearby and that's one of the big value propositions of Secaucus. It's right with those providers and our carriers and our CloudCommunity said they wanted to be there.
Jordan Sadler: There are some of these facilities that would sound a lot like the ones that you're describing that are really operated currently by wholesale providers that don't really traffic in the same businesses that you do. Is there an opportunity there at all?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I was going to say I think -- we think about the key ingredients. One is location, location, location, and there are other data centers that are in markets that have a lot of fiber and a lot of carriers. Another key ingredient, obviously, is capital, which I think all the publics share and some of the privates share. But important additional key ingredient is your customer mix and your customer base. You really are putting together puzzles inside these data centers, application puzzles, and they create a virtuous cycle. So having very, very, very heavily multi-tenanted, multi-customer, multi-application data centers is vital. And to that, it speaks to what I think of as the fourth key ingredient, and that is you got to have scale to support all of the IT and all of the people and all the human resources. There's a meaningful amount of fixed cost infrastructure to be effective in our business. And it's not economically rational to do that with a $200 million capital business. It works when you're $1 billion or $1.5 billion, you're kind of past the tipping point. But I think scale to support people and systems is required. So I think those are the key ingredients.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Emmanuel Korchman from Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: Just looking at the news that's kind of been happening in the cloud space with a major cloud provider cutting revenues or cutting service fees this morning. How do you think that'll impact maybe your business and just the data center business overall, if any?
Jarrett Appleby: Yes, I think there's clearly some movement. I think a lot of it is there's just a lot more choice. There are more providers. I think the one you might be referencing was an early mover for small-medium enterprise, and now there's a lot more choice. I think where they are headed is in a lot more in these data center campuses, to take advantage of selling into these communities. So we're seeing an acceleration of choice and options for the client, and that's really what our initiatives around Open Cloud Exchange and our cloud-enabled campuses are to do what we've been focused on: Choice for networks, it's the same type of choice for cloud. So I just think it's accelerating it, and all the movement to outsourcing and workloads to the cloud, we're actually -- for folks in our community should see the benefits of that overall.
Emmanuel Korchman: And then Jarrett, earlier you had mentioned the 9 markets you're in and the fact that Denver was partially driven by tenants asking for that as an additional option. How many other markets do you sort of need to be in to be even more sort of fully -- full as a platform? And then maybe how many of those do you get into over the next year or 2 years?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think the question is when do you pass the tipping point of offering a comprehensive platform that puts you at the table on continent-wide opportunities with the largest customers. And I think we're past that tipping point. So we don't feel that we have to be in X or Y markets to be highly successful with our strategy. And then beneath that layer, and that layer really does define it, but beneath that layer, there's incremental value in broadening the platform and we have, to date, focused on Tier 1 markets. So again, we've named them in the past, Dallas, Seattle, Toronto, Atlanta. Those are markets that are high-liquidity Tier 1 markets that we pay attention to. But I think that customer-led demand is more our focus than the sense that, gee, we have to be in 1 or 2 additional markets and we'll do whatever it takes to get there. I think we are past the tipping point. We have a good broad platform, and I think that's showing up.
Emmanuel Korchman: Great. And then from the Secaucus development, you guys are doing roughly, let's call it 1/3 of it this year. How long to get a full build out there?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, it just depends, Manny. We have at times opportunity to do a little bit larger deals that might be interesting, that's that lumpy side of the business, and that -- there are times when you don't. So it's hard for us to guess. I think, we try to underwrite every significant tranche of capital as less than a 2-year build-out -- less than a 2-year lease-up to stabilization. That might imply 6 years at New Jersey. We would hope to beat that. But we'll scale the capital in accordance with the pace of demand and absorption. But the first big tranche of capital we deliver, we would say consistent with our 2-year stabilization guidance. We've been fortunate enough to beat that in the past and we're going to work hard to do it again.
Jarrett Appleby: And you do have events that were unfortunate like Sandy, but it's accelerating things to nearby New York, and we hope to capture that -- those opportunities now, as well, as people look nearby.
Emmanuel Korchman: And then just 1 quick clarification on the Santa Clara lease. Was that an existing portfolio customer, or was that just an existing kind of corporate level -- or exec level of relationship?
Thomas M. Ray: Existing portfolio customer in a company with which we have very good relationships.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Most of my questions have been answered, but this one is for Jarrett. I mean, Jarrett, when you first showed up, you kind of had this very clear mission of working on the realignment of the sales force. You guys are definitely getting good traction with that. I'm just kind of curious, as you kind of look over the next 6 to 12 months, are there any other kind of 1 or 2 key strategic initiatives you can talk about that you'll be undertaking just to continue to drive customer penetration and drive the top line at the company.
Thomas M. Ray: I think that was "What have you done for me lately?"
Omotayo T. Okusanya: You know how it is, guys.
Jarrett Appleby: So first of all, we definitely want to get consistent, solid growth in the sales and marketing engines. So it's still early days and we're still ramping up and getting that team productive and I think we were sharing with you, it takes 6 to 9 months. So the team's not off the hook. This is still, we're building that engine. But behind it, it really is bringing the cloud and networking community. And we talk about network-rich, cloud-enabled data center campuses and the products associated with that, and you're seeing some of the partners in the software side. We want to make it easy to connect and scale with the cloud on these campuses. And that brings, as Tom was talking about, the value of the communities. We have 750 customers today. Once you have those ingredients, the soil, the community can really develop in these campuses. So those are the kinds of relationships and partners that we want to do to augment that. And whether it's system integrator and MSP partners that can do it for the clients, or showing folks how to take advantage of these new software tools. It's a fundamental shift in architecture and we just have education to do in the community and that's kind of what we're driving next.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore Partners.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: I just wanted to ask, I guess, a couple of questions. There were some questions on the competitive landscape and we do a lot of channel checks and I just wanted to get a sense, because based on our checks we always thought that you were a very attractive value proposition relative to the pricing on some of your competitors, and maybe if you can give us some color in that regard, it would be helpful. And then secondly, a couple of your competitors are not getting renewed over at 111 8th in New York and I know that you're making a big investment out in New Jersey and you've obviously got your hubs at Avenue of the Americas. And I'm wondering if you're starting to see any demand or any conversations are coming out of what's going on at 111 8th?
Jarrett Appleby: Hey, Jonathan, you're hitting it. Those trends in 111 8th and others are creating opportunities for us, as well. Some of the larger footprints that you also can't do in those legacy facilities are really being driven by the applications in high-performance cloud. So from a competitive benchmark, that's why we picked Secaucus. And I know folks have a lot of questions there, but the pricing is a lot firmer. You have a whole community of electronic trading right nearby. So the financial service firms, you see Amazon supporting in our facility. Direct Connect options and other cloud providers are coming to New York and New Jersey. So all those, I think, present opportunities for shifting key applications out of New York, and growing in these campuses like in Secaucus.
Thomas M. Ray: And I think we're also optimistic about early discussions with some subsea cable re-architecture or expansion that, I think, historically went straight to 60 Hudson on one side and to 165 Halsey on the other. And think the newer cables are looking to establish more efficient routes into bigger, more professionally managed data centers and we think Secaucus is well positioned for that as well.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: And Tom, I know in your prepared remarks, you talked about scaling of the sales team. Is the initial phase, then, of the realignment complete? And how big a team are you willing to give, I guess, Jarrett, to go out there and drive sales?
Jarrett Appleby: I think we've shared. We're about 80%, 85% there in terms of the investment. The next 2 quarters, we'll ramp up the rest within the range that Jeff provided, so that should be sufficient to build on this engine and get that going. And again, Jonathan, it takes 6 to 9 months to get them fully productive. We are hiring domain experts from the verticals and so they're bringing expertise in relationships and talk about the platform and it took a while to change the funnel out now to -- to now get to those right opportunities. And the marketing engine is just starting to kick in. You see some of our new messaging around the cloud and network in the Mesh, as we call it, that's happening here, and how the communities come together. And those are all building blocks that we'll continue to drive. I don't know how far we can go, Tom, with that but...
Thomas M. Ray: And I think in terms of the resources we can supply to that, I think it's -- you can eat anything you want so long as you pay for it. I think as we get more and more successful, we'll continue to invest. And that's really baked into the guidance that we give of 5.5% to 6.5% of revenue. And if, as we accelerate revenue, if we're more and more successful, then I think we'll hold that ratio constant and continue to build muscle in the organization at least for the next couple of years.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Great. And then just 1 last question. And Jeff, I guess I'm going to keep asking this question 'till I get the answer I want. But you broke out interconnect as a separate revenue line item. CyrusOne, during their IPO roadshow, said their PLR had interconnect in the QRS. Equinix is obviously down this path and would obviously deliver a pretty good benefit to you and to the shareholders if you were able to move that from the TRS to the QRS. So where is the company thinking about this, and where are you if there is a process?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Jonathan, I think the way to summarize where that all is, is that we're optimistic as we look into 2013. However, the ultimate resolution and the timing of that is not in our control. And so while we are optimistic, as soon as we have better clarity, it's something we'll give better guidance on.
Thomas M. Ray: And just to be clear, Jonathan, I think that somebody wrote something 1 month or 2 months ago about the potential upside to earnings based on if we were to get a PLR and put the cross-connect revenue inside the QRS. And we just urge people to be cautious about their enthusiasm around that underwriting, because today you can look at the amount of tax we've actually paid. The allocation of expenses into the TRS to date has meant we haven't paid huge taxes, that is certainly accelerating. We just urge people to be very disciplined about the math around that and we'll try and help in that regard as well.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jon Petersen from MLV & Co.
Jonathan Petersen: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your long-term capital structure. I believe in the past you set a goal of 4x debt and preferred to EBITDA. I think you're at 1.8x today, so you still got a ways to go. Can you talk about some of your options for long-term debt and what kind of yields you think you can get today?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: John, this Jeff. Yes, I think as we've disclosed in the past, managing the company somewhere around that target of 4x debt-to-EBITDA is consistent with what we've done -- said in the past and that's where we are today and as we continue to look out for it. I think when you look at our 2013 business plan, as we've laid out, in terms of our guidance, given our expansion of the credit facility, it's fair to think about things along the line that we will continue to fund our expansion by utilizing that credit facility. We've got plenty of liquidity to do so. However, we'll continue to monitor the markets and we want to be opportunistic as it relates to continuing to finance the company, but it's not something that we have as a high priority this year, but it's something we want to watch and see what happens to rates. I think in terms of the other options to us, you can see that we've paid off over the last couple of years a big portion of our secured debt. We still have 1 mortgage outstanding today. That's something that we have -- is available to us, but it does tie up our assets, and as we said on my comments, our goal is to free up those assets as we continue to look towards trying to get to investment grade rating for the company. We still have some scale to go, but it's something that we still have in mind. Obviously, unsecured debt is another avenue, but as you look out at the unsecured debt opportunity, it is something that takes a large amount of capital in order to go that route from the first issuance for somebody like CoreSite. You're talking somewhere around $250 million to $300 million at 1 time. So the line of credit helps us from the standpoint of, as we continue to expand capital, to do it in dribs as we need to on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
Jonathan Petersen: So I guess, is what you're saying you'd work up the line in credit to that $250 million, $300 million and then you would start to look at the unsecured market or...?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: I think that's what we've planned for. The other avenue, and I didn't mention it, but obviously we did a preferred stock offering just late last quarter. The nice thing about the preferred stock is that it allows you to issue some capital in smaller increments. As you saw, we did it about $115 million. And so that's another good avenue, but it's going to depend on pricing. We did it in the fourth quarter and took advantage of a good opportunity with low rates and a compressed spread that we wanted to take advantage of and executed on it, we thought, pretty well. And so that's another avenue depending upon the amount of capital we need as we look out to the landscape.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay. And then just a clarification on 1 thing. Can you talk about the kind of business that the powered-shell tenant is involved in? And I'm just kind of concerned. I mean, would these guys potentially be competitors? I mean, would they be leasing to people that you guys might be leasing at adjacent properties, or are they in a completely different business that is not competitive at all?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I was going to say we won't talk at all about the tenant. But at a high level, we're not hugely interested in leasing to competitive service offerings, that's for sure.
Operator: Our next question is coming from John Stewart from Green Street Advisors.
John Stewart: Tom, what exactly do you mean when you're talking about a vertical model? Can you kind of dumb that down for us a bit, please?
Thomas M. Ray: Go ahead, Jarrett.
Jarrett Appleby: Well, John, what we do is, 1 of the things that we've learned is the value of sites, 9 sites that we have across North America, really provides a data center platform for services. It starts with the network service providers, so that would be a vertical, the network in mobile. And so we want to understand their business, and so we've created a sales and marketing team to understand what types of deployments, what type of value that we can provide. But we also support -- we have a vertical around digital content, cloud and IT services, system integrators and managed service providers and then enterprise, which is comprised of some of the emerging communities like health care and financial services and government, for example. So that's what we're doing. We're going to market through a vertical sales and marketing strategy and communicating and understanding their needs and what kinds of deployments and services that they need from us across North America.
John Stewart: Okay. And maybe this follow-up is for a combination of Tom and Jeff. But Tom, in your closing remarks when you mentioned that you were sort of 80% to 85% of the way through the vertical alignment process, I thought I heard you say that, that would amount to 17% to 19% -- or G&A at 17% to 19% of revenues. And so the question is, can help us understand exactly which costs and which functions run through OpEx, G&A and sales and marketing line items?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, and Jeff will take you through in 1 minute, but to be clear, that ratio 17% to 19% is SG&A. We've been running G&A around 12%, it went to 13% in the Q because of some anomalies, but we think 12% is still a good run rate. Go ahead, Jeff.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: John, just to answer your question, as Tom just outlined, we've got those 2 line items broke out separately inside our supplemental on Page 12. So you've got the sales and marketing team, which is the resources and the team that Jarrett was referring to earlier, and that they commented on being about 80% to 85% built out. Obviously, that includes some marketing dollars on top of the individuals, but that is the team that they're talking about. In terms of the G&A, that is us. That is Denver, predominantly, and that is what, as Tom referred to, we've given guidance for that number to be somewhere around 12% of revenues on a go-forward basis. Does that help?
John Stewart: A little bit. So is OpEx exclusively real estate taxes and insurance? What runs through that line item?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Predominantly, when you look at our property operating, we've got separate disclosure for property operating and maintenance. Those are the dollars predominantly associated with our individuals in the field, as well as some of our power costs. And so when you look at our facilities teams and our operating teams, those are the individuals making sure our data centers are up and running 24/7. They're the individuals deploying some of our deployments and doing some of our hands-free, our remote hands activity. That's what's labeled in our property operating and maintenance dollars. And then we've got real estate taxes and insurance are separately broke out as well.
John Stewart: So are the sales and marketing folks, are they in Denver?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: They're distributed. We have most of the marketing organization, we've got some very strong talent now on the vertical side that we've been adding this quarter. We're hubbing that up here in Denver. But the sales force is primarily in the field with customers, except for some of the sales leadership team.
John Stewart: And how common is it for you guys to pay a leasing commission to a third-party?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: I wouldn't say it's -- I don't know what percentage of the deals we do it on, John, but it's not a large percentage. It's generally going to really relate or depend upon the ultimate type of deployment we're doing in our leasing. So I wouldn't say it's -- I don't know. What do you think?
Thomas M. Ray: John, I'm try think of the dollars around that, and I know we've provided that in the past and we're not -- I'm just not ready to do that right now because we haven't had any of that recently, so it's just not at the top of mind. But where we pay commissions, 99% of the time, are on larger deals where the customer effectively outsources the entire procurement and site selection process to a real estate service provider like a CB. And we're respectful. When the customers comes to us and says, I have 2 people in corporate real estate or 2 people in my operations group and I have 8,000 leases to take care of, so we'll use CB or Grubb or whoever, then we respect that, and those people get paid, and frankly that cost is baked into the deal. But those are pretty rare. And on the colo side of the business, it's incredibly rare that there's an outside hand to feed.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: And John, the other thing I'll point you to is if you look at Page 13 in our supplemental, in our reconciliation of FFO to AFFO, we do separately disclose those lease commissions. So to give you an idea of what the levels have been the past 5 quarters, you saw an uptick this quarter predominantly because of 1 or 2 larger deals that we did, but you can see the numbers in there.
John Stewart: Okay. And lastly for me, what was the rationale for revising the property names?
Thomas M. Ray: Just to make it simpler. We're just getting more of them. I know it's not simple learning the new language, but we think the language is simpler once it's baked in. And I think we'll probably not be as communicative as we have been in the past about specific addresses. Just out of respect for our customers.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin: I was interested, tenant improvements in the AFFO reconciliation was lower than earlier periods. So what kind of run rate can we see think about going forward? And then maybe for Tom or Jarrett, if you could talk about VA2 and contrast the demand profile you're seeing there compared to your legacy site in the markets? And then kind of the same question for SV4 and LA2 as well.
Jarrett Appleby: You bet. I'll take the first question, Jonathan, on the TIs. We've given guidance that does show up in our supplemental on Page 21 that we -- I'm sorry, we didn't that break out separately for the TIs, but on average, that number is predominantly made up of TIs that we spend regarding 1 of our customers out in the Bay Area, in our office portfolio. It's our -- the lease was GSA/IRS. And so that varies a little bit, predominantly because of -- when we're incurring large dollars, it's predominantly related to that customer as we're doing a restack inside that building. We estimate that restack to be done hopefully at the latter part of this year, but I think we've estimated to be spending somewhere around $4 million to $8 million in that restack for 2013.
Thomas M. Ray: And we certainly don't envision any other large office deals. That's just not our business. So this was a lease in the SV1 building at 55 South Market that was embedded in the portfolio when we went public, and the lease was executed. It's a good piece of business. I think it'll end up being quite valuable. But we went IPO and disclosed with probably an $8 million or $10 million TI obligation related to this lease, and we're just churning through it. I think when that is complete, I don't know what the right run rate is to think of, Jeff, but it's clearly a lot lower.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, I think when you look at what we've got in there this quarter, it's probably $0.5 million to -- I'm sorry $0.25 million to $0.5 million on a quarterly basis. But that's about what we know today, Jonathan. Does that help?
Jonathan Atkin: Yes.
Jarrett Appleby: And then on part 2, Jonathan, in terms of the expansion projects, this is part of the benefit of the business model, is expanding these campuses when you have the momentum in Reston, in VA1, in VA2, you can build out literally in the parking lot. You get all the benefits of the networks and the cloud providers and the other enterprise and other clients in that center. You just extend and allow cross-connects. So there is a lot of demand still in Reston. You see that at Santa Clara with SV4, the same type of capabilities. And LA2 is really you are getting the benefit of the higher power density that you can't get in the One Wilshire facility. And so the tethering those together, essentially allowing you to connect to anyone: The network, the cloud providers, the digital content, the communities already built there. It's just room to grow, and they count on us to grow there. So it's just another phase to these campuses.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird.
David B. Rodgers: Jarrett, given your past experiences and where you sit today, I'd like to talk more about the interconnect business, specifically your thoughts about volume growth over the next couple of years. Again, your experience would tell you -- or what does your experience tell you about how we should see volume growth in that business, which has been, I think, given your comments earlier, fairly anemic this year. But with the realignment, should we expect at any point that, that interconnect business maybe takes a step backwards in revenue amount or volume amount before moving forward, and then what's the pace moving forward over the next 1 to 3 years?
Jarrett Appleby: I think, first, if you -- Dave, if you benchmark it to the leader in the space, I mean, we grew 21% this year, 13% organically. You're seeing that movement, and I think we've guided where that is, where it is today, where we will see it for 2013. The key is to continue to build on this success. It does take a while to provide an alternative for the Internet and peering community. We continue to focus on private networks, network deployments and cloud deployments. And we think those are interconnection-rich over time and they take a while to grow. But again, we had 21% growth, was solid relative to our peer group. I do think there's a benefit, too, now, we're selling the entire portfolio to our customer base and selling them to expand in additional sites and really focus on those high-value customers. So yes, we are focused on those communities and interconnecting them and I think we're getting momentum.
David B. Rodgers: And I guess, again, given your experience, do you see that business accelerating in subsequent years once you've finally gained traction?
Jarrett Appleby: Yes, I do -- I see continued growth here in these campuses. New York was a great market for interconnection and that's a great example why we went into Secaucus and we tether back into NY1 and downtown markets, to grow that, and by expanding these campuses, VA2 and LA2, you get the momentum in those markets to continue to grow your customer base who can interconnect to each other. So yes, it's still early days, but we're definitely focused on those network-rich performance applications going forward.
David B. Rodgers: Okay. Then, I think 2 of your 10 largest tenants expire in the back half of this year. Do you guys have any updates on how that's going to come out?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Dave, it's Jeff. Yes, what we disclosed back there is just an average remaining term on those customers. But you can see that the average is less than 12 months. There's multiple leases within each of those customers. I would say that on 1 of them, we've got a couple of renewals. One's already done, one's getting ready to be finalized, and on the other, we're working through it. But at this point, we're working through with the ones that have come up or will come up here in the near future. So I think we expect most of them to be renewed, but we're still looking through the majority of 1 of them.
Thomas M. Ray: Even though it shows up as significant for a customer, the capacity is fairly well distributed, and we're not aware of -- I think we're fairly deep with these customers. It doesn't appear that anything that doesn't get renewed is going to be financially material.
David B. Rodgers: Okay, that's helpful. And then last question, Tom. I think earlier you responded to a question and said that you guys are able to sit at the table on any North American transaction that somebody's looking to do in terms of the sales cycle or the sales funnel. What about international? Is that a different table you'd like to sit at any time in the near term, or is that still a little further off?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think it's still a little bit further off, Dave. It's always on our minds, it's always on our board's mind of how do we best grow the company? And it's on the menu, there's no doubt. I would still say that it's a little bit further away. We don't have anything to message at all around that other than we just try to stay abreast and that's with a longer-term view.
Operator: Our final question today will be a follow-up from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Could you guys just clarify the interconnect growth for 2013. I know it was 21% overall in '12? Is it 9% to 13% total?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes. Jordan, this Jeff. Yes, that's what I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, is our estimate for the revenue growth was 9% to 13% for 2013.
Jordan Sadler: Can you share a mix of unit versus price?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: I think if you recall in the comments, what we said earlier was as, Jarrett alluded to, we had strong growth in 2012, and obviously, that is a mix of both price and volume. And I would say that a majority of the increases coming in 2013, that, that's substantially weighted towards volumes for 2013.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that's helpful. And I think Dave Kim has a follow-up.
David Kim: Is there any particular driver behind the sequential move-up in tenant reimbursements?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, that's a great, great question. We actually had, in the fourth quarter, we had our typical processes to monitor and true up our CAM reimbursements and that got taken care of in the fourth quarter. I want to point out that, that resulted in probably an additional $0.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012, and so keep that in mind as you guys are modeling things on a go-forward basis. So call it about $500,000 in the fourth quarter associated with that item. In addition, also in our revenue, we had probably another $500,000 associated with a, what I would call, a onetime item where we had some holdover revenue from one of our customers. It's not something we would expect to recur on a go-forward basis. That was probably another $0.01 in our revenue item for the quarter. And the other thing that we mentioned also in my prepared remarks was, as you look forward into 2013, keep in mind, the preferred stock has an impact of about $0.025 per quarter as we head into 2013. So, as I said in my remarks it was about $0.10 for the year.
David Kim: Okay, that's helpful. And separately, is there anything behind the decrease in taxes this quarter? We're a bit surprised given the strength in Internet.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, I think it's fair to say the element that we booked in the fourth quarter is predominantly related to what I'd call kind of your state and local taxes. That's the amount that does not relate to federal. We've taken cared of what we needed to for 2012 in the previous quarters on federal, and due to some of the changes in tax law that occurred right at the beginning of this year, it came -- it was favorable to us. And so as you look at that amount for the fourth quarter, that's really staked in state and local taxes.
Thomas M. Ray: Those are income, not real estate.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, those are purely state income taxes.
Operator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Thomas M. Ray: Thank you. Thanks, again, to everyone for joining the call. We're pleased to have made all the changes we made last year and to keep our financial organization and our sales on track. Extremely excited by all the amazing talent that's joined the company. And we're going to work very hard this year to keep this thing going. Thanks for your time.
Operator: This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-01 11:00:00) =====
Derek McCandless: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jarrett Appleby, our Chief Operating Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks in today's call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website at coresite.com. And now I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Thanks, Derek. Welcome, everyone, to our third quarter call. Before I start, I'd like to take a minute to send our thoughts to the people and communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy. We're saddened by the devastation the storm has caused, and our hearts go out to those who have lost loved ones, had their homes destroyed or had their livelihood and security placed at risk. We hope and pray for a rapid return to some sense of normalcy and healing. I'd also like to take a moment to thank the men and women at CoreSite who prepared and worked tirelessly to keep our customers up and running without interruption, kept communication flowing at such a critical time and selflessly helped others around them. We're grateful for the professionalism of your efforts, the depth of your endurance and the strength of your character. We're proud to be a part of the company you represent. Now we'll address our third quarter, starting by discussing our financial highlights, sales results, operational progress and expansion plans. Our third quarter financial results reflect continued solid growth in our business. Revenue increased 21% over Q3 of 2011, adjusted EBITDA increased 28%, and FFO increased 16%. Additionally, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 250 basis points from Q3 '11 to Q3 '12 from 41.2% to 43.7%. We accomplished this by driving a more profitable revenue mix and by holding in check expenses related to back-office functions and service delivery, while we increased expenses in sales and marketing by nearly 70%. With regard to Q3 sales, commencements were strong with approximately 40,000 square feet of leases and $5.9 million in annualized GAAP rent starting in the quarter. In the quarter, we also saw firm pricing across our platform. Specifically, regarding renewals, we achieved a 91.8% rent retention ratio in conjunction with rental mark-to-market of 4% on a cash basis and 9% on a GAAP basis. With regard to pricing on new and expansion sales, our GAAP rental rate of $177 per square foot was consistent with that of the prior quarter. However, Q3 new and expansion bookings came in below our trailing average base with Q3 new and expansion bookings representing $2 million in stabilized annual GAAP rent. We ascribe our Q3 sales results to 2 key factors. First, timing of executions of larger deals was soft in Q3. While we saw a solid funnel of opportunities exceeding 250 kilowatts in the beginning of the quarter, late in the quarter, those opportunities were deferred. After a temporary lull, many of those opportunities are back on track and appear likely to close in Q4. The second driver of our Q3 sales results was turnover in our sales function related to our realignment to a vertical selling model. Specifically, our drive to verticalize in Q3 to professionals who contribute over long term to our strategy resulted in a number of quota-bearing positions being temporarily unfilled. The result was that our quota-bearing sales team was staffed at roughly 40% with reps with more than 6 months of tenure in their positions and 25% with reps with less than 6 months of tenure, while the remaining 35% of our targeted sales positions were unfilled. We have, for some time, been convinced of the importance of implementing a go-to-market strategy focused on verticals instead of local customers. This focus gives us the ability to take full advantage of our national platform and deep operating expertise. Implementing the transformation in Q3 was more difficult than we anticipated, but we believe the right thing to do was to press forward and get the team behind us quickly. It cost us some sales staff during the quarter, and therefore, some sales. But we're pleased to now have much of the difficult work behind us. Most importantly, during Q3, we completed sales leadership staffing with the new head of sales and 100% sales verticals staffed at the management level. We're excited about the new people we have in place, the rewards we continue to see from our strategy and the further rewards we see in the future. As I've said, in the quarter, we paid some direct and indirect costs associated with the realignment. With that, we made important measurable progress in areas directly related to and illustrate above the value of the realignment. First, our carrier and mobile team, which is the first vertical team that we set up earlier this year, was responsible for over 40% of bookings in the quarter on a revenue basis. Further, the team recorded several network-centric wins that build increasing value across our platform. Specifically, over the next few days, we will announce 3 platform partner agreements, adding further network density to our business, with Sidera agreeing to expand to 5 markets, CenturyLink to 9 and GTT to 9. Additionally, our carrier team has been integral to the progress we've made in creating our Open Internet Exchange, including CoreSite's Any2 Exchange, the AMS-IX, NYIIX and DE-CIX, as announced earlier this month. We're encouraged by the mounting success of our carrier and mobile team and are even more encouraged by its funnel looking ahead. We were also pleased to execute and announce important wins from our cloud team, which although in its early days and still staffing up, accounted for 30% of bookings in the quarter on a revenue basis. During the quarter, we enhanced our cloud-enabled platform by entering into our previously announced channel and product alliances with RiverMeadow Software and Violin Memory. In addition, in Q3, we finalized our agreements with Arista Networks, provider of next-generation software-defined networking solutions for cloud deployment. Finally, in Q3, we were pleased to have Amazon Web Services turn up service in our Manhattan facility, joining AWS's deployment with us in Los Angeles. AWS combines with other leading cloud service providers in our platform, including CSC, Layered Tech, Logicworks and additional global providers and systems integrators that confidentiality provisions prohibit us from mentioning. Additionally, within our platform, CoreSite customers can leverage off of direct access to cloud storage providers including Box.net and Nirvanix, as well as emerging DDoS security providers like Black Lotus. Bringing these types of customers into our platform creates a valuable marketplace for our customers to access and increasingly differentiate their data centers as locations of cloud enablement, something that we believe further cements our position in the path of growth in our industry. Regarding our operational progress, in Q3, we completed a significant amount of work associated with realigning our sales and go-to-market strategy to a vertical rather than local model. The greatest changes we made in the quarter relate to our sales function, where as noted before, we executed upon meaningful staffing and alignment changes among our leadership team. Specifically, we now have a vertical sales vice president managing each of our 5 customer verticals with 3 VPs taking their positions during the quarter. Importantly, we are pleased to have Chris Ancell join our executive team as Senior Vice President of Sales and Sales Engineering. Chris started on October 8 and brings 28 years of industry experience, the last 12 of which at CenturyLink and Qwest, where he held executive roles including President of Business Solutions and Executive Vice President of Sales. We're excited to have Chris aboard, and his direct experience in our industry has enabled him to hit the ground running. Regarding our expansion activity in the quarter, we strengthened our foundation for growth by securing entitlements to expand our facility in Reston, Virginia by an additional 198,000 usable square feet comprised of data center, supporting infrastructure and general building support space. We're excited about this ability to expand in an established location where we currently host a growing nexus of 24 networks and 110 customers. Upon completion of the expansion, we will have approximately 460,000 square feet in our Reston campus. We anticipate breaking ground on this project, which we refer to as VA-2 [ph], in the first half of 2013. We expect to invest $60 million in constructing the powered shell and first phase of salable inventory in the new building. We anticipate investing an incremental $40 million in success-based phases to deliver additional turnkey computer rooms to keep pace with customer demand. As we look ahead, we are as optimistic as ever about our company and our market opportunity. We believe we have the right people in place at senior levels, and importantly, that they are aligned with our company strategy in the way our customers do business. We believe that we are in the early innings of executing upon a compelling opportunity to create a great company with a valuable and enduring market position. I'll now turn it over to Jeff to take us through the financial results. I'll then be back to discuss our view of the market and offer closing thoughts.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Tom, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter call. I will begin my remarks today by discussing our third quarter results. I will then provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity plans, and will conclude with some comments in regards to our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2012. As stated in this morning's earnings release, CoreSite reported third quarter FFO per diluted share and unit of $0.40, which represents a 14.3% increase over the third quarter of 2011 and an 8.1% increase on a sequential quarter basis. Our operating revenues were $53.8 million, a 21.2% increase over the prior year quarter and a 6.2% increase on a sequential quarter basis. Our third quarter operating revenue is comprised of 59% rental revenue, 26% power revenue and 15% interconnection revenue, [indiscernible] reimbursement and other income. Our property operating and maintenance expenses increased 7.1% over the previous quarter, primarily due to increased power costs associated with the seasonal increases in rates during the summer months. Our sales and marketing expense of $2.2 million decreased by 13.6% over the prior quarter and correlates to 4.1% of revenue for the quarter. The decline in expenses is primarily due to employee turnover on our sales team, as Tom outlined, and to annual performance-based compensation adjustments. We anticipate Q4 2012 expenses to approximate $3.0 million to $3.2 million or $800,000 to $1 million higher than Q3 '12. Based upon our current plans, we expect to increase sales and marketing expenses over the first 2 quarters of 2013, stabilizing at a target range of 5.5% to 6.5% of revenue. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $1.6 million, a decrease over last quarter's backlog of $5.3 million. The timing of the commencements for this backlog is approximately 50% in Q4 2012 with the rest commencing in 2013. As described in our earnings release this morning, we anticipate investing $60 million in VA-2 [ph]. We also plan on spending approximately $35 million on additional projects that are currently under construction or those that we've identified as near-term construction, all disclosed on Page 15 in our supplemental. In addition, we are looking to invest an additional $60 million to $80 million in 2013 most likely in a development or redevelopment project. This equates to approximately $155 million to $175 million of capital investments through the end of 2013. We are utilizing this expected level of investment as we plan our financing and capital markets activities. Now let me address our balance sheet and capital availability. We have maintained a conservatively levered balance sheet to position the company for growth and make key investments such as those I just described. As of September 30, 2012, the balance on our credit facility was $62.8 million. We had approximately $13.4 million of cash available and $131.1 million of available capacity under our credit facility, equaling a total of $144.5 million of current liquidity. As you may recall, our current facility has an accordion feature, which allows us to expand the capacity up to $400 million. We are currently in discussions to increase the capacity under the credit facility and extend the maturity based upon, one, the increase in value we've achieved, leasing space inside our current portfolio; and second, the opportunities we see to continue to intelligently grow the company. When completed, we believe the expansion of our credit facility will provide more-than-enough liquidity to complete the capital projects I discussed earlier, and extending the term to lower our maturity risk. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, recognizing that this involves both the term and stability of financing and not just the amount. Towards that end, we will look to issue longer-term financing during the next 2 quarters to refinance borrowings under our credit facility. Although the ultimate source and timing of funding will depend on market conditions, we will consider various forms of long-term debt and preferred stock in an amount that will replace a portion of our current short-term variable rate debt. Also, as part of our plans to reduce our near-term debt maturities, and as we've said before, we extended the term of the mortgage loan on our 55 South Market property for 2 years. As such, we have no debt maturities until June of 2014, including other extension options. Our debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.6x, and our debt to total enterprise value is 11%. In connection with our anticipated future capital investments, you can expect our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to increase over time as we fund our capital expansion. At a high level, and consistent with our past communications, we target a stabilized debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4x with potential fluctuations around that target based upon investment activities and capital market conditions. Now let me turn to guidance and expectations for the remainder of 2012. Overall, and as we indicated in the release this morning, we are tightening our FFO per share and unit guidance for the year to a range of $1.50 to $1.54. This guidance range reflects a Q4 run rate equal to that in Q3 and also includes the additional sales and marketing expenses described earlier. This guidance does not include the impact of any future financing or investment activities beyond what we have discussed that may become available and completed prior to year end. We will provide our specific 2013 guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings release sometime in February 2013. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom.
Thomas M. Ray: Thanks, Jeff. I'd now like to offer our views on market conditions and our road ahead. Regarding market conditions, I'll first underscore our belief that the data center market is not homogeneous but rather comprised of distinct segments that reflect different market dynamics. We believe that the nature of a customer application, rather than the number of supporting kilowatts, is the defining characteristic determining the value to a customer of one data center provider and location over others for a given data center requirement. We have, for some time, defined our go-to-market strategy accordingly by focusing upon the nature of customer applications rather than their size. To that objective, we focus upon the extent to which an application has a compelling reason to locate in a data center providing access to certain network or business and IT enablers or as an integral contributor to the IT solutions required by other applications. When an application meets one of these criteria, we refer to it as performance sensitive. When an application does not meet any of the criteria, we refer to it as undifferentiated. With that as backdrop, I'll offer our views of current market dynamics for each of undifferentiated and performance-sensitive requirements since we believe that the market dynamics differ between the 2. In the market segment for larger undifferentiated applications consuming one or more computer rooms of one or more megawatts each, we believe that customer selection criteria focuses upon the cost of space and power more than the value of the business marketplace operating within competing available data centers. As we have previously communicated, we believe that there are few barriers to adding to the supply of buildings serving this market segment. The competitive dynamic in this segment is driven by not only the number of kilowatts available or coming available in any given market but also the number of competitors active in the market. We saw a meaningful increase in both in Santa Clara over the last 2 years, and we saw a correlating drop in market prices for undifferentiated applications on the order of 25% to 35%. We see a similar dynamic at play now in Virginia where we count 10 providers now offering capacity in blocks exceeding 1 megawatt with additional providers stating that they are coming to the market. Regarding the market for smaller undifferentiated colocation requirements, we believe that prices have also declined meaningfully over the past several years. This business model requires only minimal capital investment to stand up, and there are ample buildings, leasing space offering limited network density. As such, there are limited barriers to adding the supply in this segment, and we've seen supply increased meaningfully. Increasingly, we've seen undifferentiated colocation resellers in undifferentiated data centers materially reduce prices to win undifferentiated applications, a trend we believe will continue through 2013. To summarize our view of market conditions for undifferentiated applications, large and small, we believe that supply has grown materially, and prices have dropped materially. We do not forecast a sustained recovery in the market for smaller undifferentiated colocation requirements. We believe that the market for very large undifferentiated requirements will reflect the cyclicality of any other real estate asset class driven by capital availability. There will be times when supply will outstrip demand and prices will fall. The market will correct them for a time. Demand will outstrip supply, and prices will rise and so on. With the foregoing assessment of the market for undifferentiated applications as prologue, I'll now discuss our view of the market for performance-sensitive applications, starting with an assessment of supply. With regard to supply, we've seen minimal new supply in our markets. As we've said for more than 2 years, we believe that there are meaningful impediments to adding new capacity that meet the requirements of this market segment. Specifically, capacity meeting performance-sensitive requirements must include much more than kilowatts. It must include the following vital ingredients. The kilowatts must be in the right location, among a strong nexus of metro and long-haul access points. The provider must have the scale and ability to bring nearby networks into the data center since being nearer, long-haul or metro access line is not meaningful unless the network service providers invest to bring it here inside the data center. The provider must carry the trust of highly discerning customers. We must trust that the provider understands their business requirements and have the service delivery platform required to support them. It requires a robust supporting operational platform with the scale necessary to support a strong sales and marketing team and a complex IT service delivery and back-office capabilities to deliver reliable and comprehensive customer service. This requires a broad, highly scalable and secure physical platform capable of meeting multimarket needs of the world's largest organizations. Finally and importantly, it requires the service platform to be a robust business optimization platform, offering direct access through a multitude of complementary service providers supporting the array of needs inherent in performance-sensitive applications. To summarize our view of supply in the performance-sensitive segment, we believe that there are very few platforms and providers in North America today that serve the performance-sensitive market and that there are sustainable barriers to creating new supply. To that end, from our perspective, we have not seen a new entrant make a meaningful difference to the supply in this market segment. Oftentimes, the more an application is performance sensitive, the fewer the number of data center providers that can efficiently and effectively support it. And we don't envision it will change dramatically in the near and mid-term. Regarding demand in the performance-sensitive segment, we believe that demand continues to grow steadily, driven by an increase in both the number of performance-sensitive applications and their size. Regarding the number of applications, we believe that the driving forces of cloud and mobility are transformational and are creating new industry segments of performance-sensitive applications, complementing and adding to establish segments. Additionally, we see an increase in the number of networks in the market as large content companies, cloud service providers and enterprises increasingly develop their own networks, including CDN and application delivery network capabilities. These new networks are distributing their architecture across broad geographies, deploying edge applications in as many as 15 of the largest Internet markets in North America to better serve their customers, employees and partners. As such, customer demand to source these applications across a network-centric data center platform in multiple markets is accelerating in key communities, including Internet and peering, private networking supported by services such as Ethernet and the previously referenced high-performance cloud and mobile applications that require distributed architecture. With regard to the size of performance-sensitive applications, we continue to see an increase as well. Specifically, whereas several years ago, we did not see many such applications exceeding 250 kilowatts, we now see requirements for cloud hubs and core network deployments of 500 kilowatts and greater. We continue to see strong demand from our key targeted verticals including network and mobility, digital content, cloud service providers and systems integrators. Evidencing the strength in the market segment exceeding 250 kilowatts, we've seen our funnel accelerate into this quarter as we've worked through many of the organizational changes from Q3. While we've seen our funnel in this segment accelerate into the quarter, these sales can be lumpy. The healthy supply and demand dynamics surrounding the performance-sensitive segment have supported a pricing environment that, in our view, has remained firm with moderate increases on average this year across the markets in which we operate. This trend is reflected in our reported pricing to date, which reflects a small increase year to date over calendar year 2011 in GAAP rental rates on new and expansion bookings. When factoring in the improvements in our revenue mix, driving more EBITDA from interconnection revenue and breaker amp power, we estimate that average total revenue per sold square foot in new and expansion leases have decreased between 3% and 5% year to date over calendar 2011. Surrounding all of my foregoing comments regarding market conditions, supply and demand is the question of what should we make of soft sales reported by several data center companies in Q3? From my perspective, the answer turns upon drawing a clear distinction between supply and demand. Regarding supply, we believe that there are low barriers to adding new supply in certain segments of the data center industry. In periods of abundant supply, prices decrease, and in periods of limited supply, prices increase. We have focused our asset locations in go-to-market platform upon the segment in which it is more difficult to add supply. And we feel that we are well positioned to succeed in that segment. With regard to demand, our perspective centers upon the longer term and bigger picture. In the 13 years we've been active in the industry, we've seen periods of broad economic stress and uncertainty in decision making from our customers, including during the dotcom and telecom crash in the early 2000s and the pain of the depths of the great recession a few years ago. Those periods, at times, have been reflected in a quarter here or a quarter there in which customers deferred larger deployments. Throughout those 13 years, we've seen true capacity utilization increase in the data center segment. We continue to believe that fundamental demand in our industry is driven by growth in any among 3 key areas of the IT and communications landscape: networks, devices and applications. Though any given quarter may be softer than another for customer decision making, we believe that the trends driving global growth among networks, devices and applications remained inexorable. To wrap up, CoreSite's operating strategy remains focused upon supporting performance-sensitive applications and growing the service enablement ecosystems available across our North American platform. We seek to provide differentiated value to customers that come to our facilities to conduct business with other CoreSite customers and access our hosted platform of the business enablement ecosystems rather than to store or process data in our data centers for use somewhere else. We believe that our business model is reflected in key metrics. First, we serve 750 customers across our platform with more than 1,200 data center leases in place. Less than 2% of our leases are for greater than 10,000 net rentable square feet. Further, approximately 75% of our total data center revenue comes from leases less than 10,000 net rentable square feet. Finally, based upon our run rate through Q3, we expect to process approximately 8,000 customer work orders, many of which are for services related to interconnection, facilitating the interoperability of our customers as they connect to each other and conduct business together inside our data centers and across our platform. As we look towards finishing 2012 and entering 2013, we do so with enthusiasm. We believe that the demand for data center capacity from the applications we target remains strong, supply in check and pricing firm. During a period of tremendous organizational change, we've maintained growth in revenue, earnings and profitability. In Q3, we made difficult decisions and completed a good deal of the work necessary to accelerate our growth and increased the profitability of our company. We are already seeing the results of our vertical strategy and of work our team has put in to implement it. And we believe that we are in the early stages of executing upon what we see as a strong opportunity to create sustainable value. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question does come from the line of the Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: First question regarding the performance sensitive versus undifferentiated. I'm curious, just as you parse your portfolio, where are you today in terms of your customers that are -- you consider and customers, and I guess, facilities that you consider performance sensitive versus undifferentiated? Maybe you do it on an NOI basis.
Thomas M. Ray: Sure. I think when you look at the applications in the portfolio, we first carved out the office and light industrial component. That effectively just went for us to redevelop at some point in the future other than the 55 South Market building. So we moved that to the side. Then you have a very small number of larger powered shell leases. 73,000 feet in Boston is leased to somebody for a very long time at a -- now that the space is finished out at a below-market rate of where we think it would roll to. And we have a couple pockets of those kinds of leases. But when you look at our colocation applications, the colocation business in the portfolio, we analyze differentiation and performance sensitivity, really, by points of network interconnection in our portfolio. So I think in general terms, Jordan, whether you think of something that is getting performance sensitive in the 3 or 4 different connections to 3 or 4 different customers inside our data center or 6 or 7, depending on how you think of it, we view our performance-sensitive embedded base as between, call it, 75% and 85%.
Jordan Sadler: 75% and 80%. Okay. Now I guess -- I don't know if this is related, but sort of a separate question related to sort of the growth you've seen year-over-year and sequentially. We've noticed for a while that the growth in your rental revenue has been strong and impressive year-over-year. I see it up a few million bucks, $4 million, call it, plus or minus, versus last September ended quarter. The other revenue segments or line item is obviously up pretty dramatically. I know your interconnection sits there. I'm not sure if anything else significant sits there. But clearly, the growth in that line item is dramatically stronger than the growth in the rental revenue. I'm wondering, is that related to the performance segment? And how should we think about that heading into -- the dynamic between the 2 heading into 2013?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, I think on a stabilized base, if you take a full year's report, full year's numbers, I think the vast majority of other revenue is interconnection. Jeff, is that in the 90s?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes.
Thomas M. Ray: High 90s?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, absolutely, mid-90s to high 90s.
Thomas M. Ray: Mid-90s. So yes, the vast majority of that line item is interconnection revenue. And this raises a point that is important to us. As we think about the mark-to-market opportunity inside the existing portfolio and the embedded base, I think there's on balance upside on rents that are in place. But most importantly, I think there's tremendous upside or opportunity for a tremendous upside related to product mix. So again, as you drive more performance value into your buildings and into the applications inside those buildings, you see the non-rent revenue increase more rapidly. And I think at a very high level, Jordan, if we benchmark ourselves against the industry leader in performance-sensitive services and capacity, I think they're in place or average total revenue per foot or per kilowatt, per cabinet is quite materially above where ours is. And we view that as an opportunity to increase the profitability of each dollar of capital that's already in place. I think the way we will get there has a little bit to do with rent and a lot more to do with product mix, selling more breaker amp power as opposed to metered and more cross-connects per foot. And look, that's all a long march. I think our view is over the next 2 years, we will have an extremely good view as to whether we have firmly grabbed this position as an alternative to the incumbent and materially distance ourselves from any other competitor in that regard. I think that the long haul of realizing all the value in the portfolio, that's a 5-year march to get 60%, 70% all the way there, and we hope to have more upside thereafter. That's a long answer, but yes, that line item is interconnection revenue. But it speaks to the much bigger picture of our business model that the value of our in-place assets and what we think we can do with them and the time frame over which we hope to execute on that.
Jordan Sadler: That's helpful. The -- in the quarter on leasing activity, you chalked it up to a couple of reasons, which makes sense. So I guess would you call it more of a coincidence relative to what we've seen of the other data center player, data center players this quarter and that you've seen sort of a significant slowdown on your leasing activity? There's been some noise in their numbers as well. Is it more than a coincidence? Is it -- you did say there was one of the requirements pushed. So that seems -- would that be considered a non-differentiated application or tenant? Or was that a performance-sensitive tenant? Just kind of curious about that and then what your expectations are going forward. I mean, should we ramp back up to sort of the levels we saw earlier in this year?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think that the results in Q3 are not entirely coincidental. I think that number one, we did have a meaningful amount of open spots or brand-new positions in the sales team. And clearly, I think that impacted us. It's very difficult to determine precisely to what extent, but it had an impact. I think -- I do think, in all fairness, the bigger impact was market and customer driven, and I think the vast majority of that impact for us was timing. We -- beginning Q3 and in the middle of Q3, we saw a very strong funnel, a significant amount of which we thought was going to close in the Q. A small amount of that was canceled or indefinitely suspended. We had businesses say, "You know what, I thought I needed it now. Now I'm not sure when I need it. I'll circle back to you when that need comes back." I think those requirements are need-driven and I think they will come back. But be that as it may, some portion of the -- of not converting in Q3 was for projects that were indefinitely suspended. The greater proportion was for projects that, frankly, just slid into Q4. So I think the reason projects went into Q4, the customers did not feel as much of a need now, and I think that's reflective of the rest of the industry right now. I'll just underscore the big picture of -- we've seen this movie a couple of times over the last decade. And some Qs are soft. The vast majority about what's soft is teed up for Q4 and we feel good about that funnel.
Jordan Sadler: And you think the activity, as we head forward, will sort of ramp back up?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes. And I'll add a little bit of color to that. I think what we are doing, to Tom's point, to differentiate it, we are focusing on the right applications. So we are seeing networks change their mix of what they buy instead of smaller IP nodes. They're doing upgrades right now of their switch infrastructure and router infrastructure, and we're seeing those. Those are larger deployments. And Tom referenced, on the network side where we're focusing our vertical sales team, that represented 40% of our sales this quarter, we're seeing bigger deployments, these edge and core nodes, which are larger, and we can give you real examples of companies like GTT, who expanded in 3 sites with us plus upgraded their infrastructure. Sidera, they were upgrading their infrastructure and added another site to 5 markets. And CenturyLink expanding with us in 5 markets to all 9 markets, and again, upgrading their switch infrastructure. So where we've had the vertical sales force in place earlier this year, selling this way, we're seeing platform deals. In this quarter, we saw a good progress on the cloud side. That represented 30% of our sales. What I can defer is some of the larger, high-performance applications that were cloud oriented, and that's what we're seeing from the timing side. And we have -- we're doing that work on the other verticals, but we've seen early progress on the 2 verticals where we have established teams selling the platform benefit and looking to be able to do the smaller deployments, plus I think we have some unique data center campuses that are larger that can support these high-performance applications in each site as well.
Thomas M. Ray: And Jordan, as you asked about the go forward, I think that the best way for us to help people understand what we believe is, we've made and are still making very significant investments in sales and marketing go-to-market platform. We simply wouldn't make those investments unless we thought there was a return on them. And our board is fully aligned in that expectation. We've studied the market and the market opportunity a great deal. It will take a little bit of time, but we are already seeing results. But most importantly, it'll be very difficult to imagine making the level of investment we've been making and not expecting upside on sales pacing and on revenue per foot or per kilowatt. So we're doing this for a reason. It will take a little bit of time for it to unfold, but we're making these investments expecting an incremental return, an additional return on these additional dollars, absolutely.
Operator: And our next question does come from the lines of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman: Just kind of following on the stuff you just talked about, how much of the push requirements have you actually seen signs in 4Q, in the month that we've had so far?
Thomas M. Ray: Manny, we just -- we don't give the interim quarter sales stats. We feel like we have tremendous visibility into the Q based on what is already signed and on what's been verbally awarded and is in legal negotiation, legal contract work. So we feel like we have a tremendous amount of visibility, but we don't give interim numbers.
Emmanuel Korchman: Okay. And on the reorg, or the shift, I guess, in the organization, how far along would you say you are with that, including hiring and maybe laying off other people?
Jarrett Appleby: Yes. I think where we are, I think, in terms of laying off, I think it's really -- we had some folks leave as we moved to the vertical approach. I think we're through that from a couple perspectives. First, bringing Chris Ancell, a professional leader to run our sales organization, he brings a lot of depth around sales enablement, coaching and development of the vertical sales leaders. We've put 5 vertical sales leaders in place now. That happened this quarter, and we're developing and expanding their team. So I'd say we're 60%, 65% of the way there. We -- it will take until first quarter. We are hiring industry expertise and we are finding the right people with that domain expertise in each of the 5 verticals. And it takes 6 to 9 months to get them fully productive. And then in the interim, as we ramp up and expect the returns that Tom was alluding, the returns we'll get on the engine, we are working on those larger engagements and building that transaction engine as we go forward. So we're, again, I'd say 60%,  65% of the way there, fully in place in the first quarter.
Thomas M. Ray: And I think, Jarrett, it's important that staffing on new functions and changing new functions, it happens most effectively on a layered approach: executive management; middle management; and then ICs, the individual contributors. Jarrett's finished at the top 2 layers. Now we're -- it takes a little bit of time, but over the next -- by the of Q1, I think you expect to have the individual contributors in place.
Jarrett Appleby: Absolutely. And we're doing the same investments on the marketing. I think we also know that, a great example is the Amazon Web Services announcement we did in New York and we have in L.A. We're marketing that. People want to directly connect to that. And so the marketing engine is also building out targeted marketing to create leads for that sales engine around these new applications and solutions that we can provide per client. So you're seeing more of the marketing PR effect, communicating, who were the folks that you connect with through a high value. And we're seeing that movement on the interconnection side. You're seeing that movement start. And again, that takes time. We know how to do it. We have a framework. We're getting the talent and we're ramping that go-to-market engine for sales and marketing.
Emmanuel Korchman: Do you guys feel that you lost any business with the people that left the organization? Did anyone take business, kind of, with them, rather than you guys are not pitching any new business for the lack of staff?
Jarrett Appleby: I think we lost maybe some timing, ending of the relationships, there were a lot of accounts that did change hands. Frankly, a couple of the folks who were there tended to be kind of the larger power type focused deals, and I think it's one of the reasons a couple of the individuals left. That's the kind of business they wanted to go target. But I don't think we've experienced, that I'm aware of, any lost customer opportunity that our performance-based targets that we're looking for.
Thomas M. Ray: I'm not aware of anybody quoting a deal to another company, so...
Emmanuel Korchman: Got it, and then my last question. On Reston, is that vacancy that's there now, was that engineered to be there because you knew you're trying for this extra phase? Or if not, what gives you confidence in building so much more space with the vacancies there now?
Thomas M. Ray: Yes, so number one, we're not starting construction on VA-2 until we have the visibility that we'll need to be doing that. But that said, I strongly believe it will be in the first half. And depending on sales, it could be early in that half. The availability we have right now is that last tranche that was available to be redeveloped in the existing building. And quite simply, we've had very sustained, very strong demand in this location for a number of years. And if you just look at the trailing fill rate and say -- and don't even ascribe upside from the additional investments for making in sales and marketing. If you just take that trailing fill rate, we'll be needing to be under construction in the not-distant future. As to the level of availability right now, I think it's on the order of 3.5 megawatts, 4 megawatts, maybe less. And our trailing run rate says that will get sold in -- within this year, so we're going to have another data center. We're going to have more capacity to meet customer requirements. We better get busy and -- so we don't view the existing availability as particularly huge. And there you have it. And importantly, we probably built one extra computer in, Manny, to be fair than we might have otherwise because building 4 or 5 instead of 3 or 4, we were out of the building. We were finished developing, finished construction and can just put a bow on that. So we might have gone a little bit longer than typical because of that reason, but we think that we're going to need to get that next building going in the not distant future.
Operator: And our next question does come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
James C. Feldman: I guess just focusing back on the development and redevelopment pipeline again. Can you just differentiate? I mean, how much of that space is undifferentiated that you discussed versus the more differentiated, just so we all understand?
Thomas M. Ray: Jamie, I'm not sure I understand your question. Are you asking about the markets where we can build more space? Or are you talking about harvesting space back from existing applications?
James C. Feldman: Well, no. If you look at your current pre-stabilized data center projects, just -- are all of those at the more differentiated level? Or is some of that more of the commodity space that's more of legacy stuff that you had before you decided to go down this path?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, you have 2 things. You have available inventory, and I think the spaces where we have done deals with less differentiation. And for what it's worth, I think over the last 6 or 9 months, I don't -- we worked hard to not do any purely undifferentiated deals, but there is a continuum. And I think that the 2 markets that we've said where we've done deals with less differentiation have been Virginia and the Bay Area, and that's because of availability. I think that those days were probably closer to coming to an end in the Bay Area, and then we've built up the last floor of 2972, and we're very focused on cloud and network and other applications in that building. In Virginia, I'd say the same thing. Again, we don't have to spend capital on a new building until we feel that we're out of space in the old stuff, in the existing building. And the applications that we're seeing and working on are highly attractive. They're in our sweet spot. So we're not talking to anybody about a 2-megawatt storage deal. We're not having those discussions.
James C. Feldman: Okay. And then turning to lease expirations. If you look at what's coming due in the back half of the year, I think it's, according to the supplemental, 13% annualized rent, and then next year 18%. Can you just talk us through your thoughts on renewals and the NOI stream as those come due?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: You bet, Jamie. This is Jeff. Just let me focus real quick on Q4. As you can see on the supplemental, we have a little over $15 million of rent that comes due here this month -- or I'm sorry, this quarter. Just big picture, we know that there's about $2.3 million of that, that we know as no move-outs. So if you look at the remaining $13.2 million, there's a large concentration in about our top 35 customers in terms of size, and equates to about $10.9 million of that remaining amount. As you take a deep dive through that, we expect that renewal to be somewhere around 85% on that pool of customers. That leaves you with about $2.3 million of additional rent that roll in this quarter. We give that a little lower than 85%, call it somewhere around 82%, 83% when you add it all together. For the quarter, we expect to be somewhere around 73% for Q4.
Thomas M. Ray: If you look into 2013, you're looking at -- and just quickly on the bigger ones, we just give them 85% and 80%, and so the average, 70%, 73%.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: I'm sorry, for the year, we expect to be somewhere in that mid-70 range. I apologize, yes. If you look at 2013, Jamie, I think ballpark, we're looking at somewhere, probably, we've taken a look at it, we're continuing to do some work there. We're probably somewhere in that 70% to 75% range.
James C. Feldman: Okay. So I guess what does that mean for year-end occupancy in your guidance for '12?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: We ended the quarter on the data center portfolio at around 77%. I don't think we're adding a lot of supply. As you know, as we add supply during the quarter, that can sometimes move that number pretty up -- downward pretty significantly. If you look at what we're going to add, we estimate that we're going to be adding some additional square feet in this fourth quarter, predominantly from our completion of the 2972 Stender facility. So that's going to -- that could be moving it a little bit, Jamie. And so you have to factor that in to the equation. To give you a specific number, I couldn't give you a specific number, but we just got to factor that component in.
Thomas M. Ray: I would think, in large measure, we said we have $1.5 million of backlog, about 50% of which -- these are dollars. 50% of which will start in the Q. And then Q3 signings were below the trailing average. I think that same store, Jamie, occupancy is going to go up a little bit, not a significant amount, but it will go up a little bit. And then I think that'll be offset and perhaps somewhat a little bit more than offset by the delivery at 2972 in the Bay Area. So I think portfolio occupancy is likely to end Q4 flat or just a touch down. And that's all building, stabilized and pre-stabilized, but I think that's reasonable to expect.
James C. Feldman: Okay. And just to make sure I heard you right. So you said on the remainder of '12, there's $15.5 million of rent. You think you know $2.3 million are going away, but you still think you'll be flat on the same store? Did I hear that right or no?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: We know there's about $2.3 million that will be moving out. And when you look at the rest of it in total, we expect it to be, for the year, right in the mid-70 range, right about -- call it 73%, 75%.
Thomas M. Ray: My building blocks, Jamie, are the amount that we expect to be moving out that we know is roughly equal to the Q3 signings, candidly. So that should be close to a wash. And then what we would hope would commence in Q4 may hold pace with the rest of the statistical churn from the install base. And then you deliver 2972 Stender.
James C. Feldman: Okay. Okay. So it's kind of a wash on the 13% rolling? And then when you think about your largest tenants, I mean I think if you look at -- if you listen to the DFT call, and it sounds like it's more of big tech tenant concern on some of the more wholesale properties. Can you just walk us through, like Facebook and CSC, some of your larger tenants, kind of what they have in their properties and how do you think about the future? Is that space, we should think, eventually you'll have to release? Or is that space that, given the use, these guys will be around for a long time?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, it's not appropriate for us to go into too much detail, Jamie. But I would say, I think we're highly up to speed. But as I go down the customer diversification table in the Q, I say with Facebook, the one spot where they have a big block of space is at 2901 Coronado. And without going into the detail, I think there's a portion of what they do that is, the word we all used a couple years ago, sticky. And there's a portion of what they do there that is undifferentiated. So I think that's all I can, in good faith, offer about Facebook, just to be respectful of their operations. On Akamai, their footprint is highly diversified with us. And so there isn't any big single block anywhere. CSC is very similar. They're pretty diversified and most of those are new deployments. And CSC has a vibrant and growing cloud business, and we've been fortunate to support them on that. We go to number 4, which is Internap. Really, they have a collection of smaller highly performance-sensitive deployments, and then a big powered shell lease in Boston. And that's not going anywhere for a long time. So as I go down the list, I look it at and say we don't see meaningful downside. In fact, I think on balance across our top 10, I would see upside.
Operator: And our next question is from the lines of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: I got a couple here. The first one is just about your interconnection revenue and the classification. Earlier in the week, Cincinnati Bell held their conference call discussing the potential IPO track for CyrusOne. CyrusOne had recently received its PLR, which indicated that the interconnect revenue could fall into the QRS. Equinix seems to be walking down that same path. I'm wondering what work you're doing around that and if you have any perspective there.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Jonathan, yes, we talked about it briefly on the call last quarter, but big picture. It's something we've been looking at, we've been spending time on and we're working through those types of situations, just take time to work through, to be quite honest. It's probably a 4- to 6-month type of time frame before you get real certainty or clarity around that. But that is definitely something we're working on.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: All right, great. In terms of your renewal schedule, you do have a lot of stuff coming up over the next few years relative to -- you look at some of the other REITs' renewal schedules. So I just want a couple questions about that. Just kind of doing some back of the envelope thinking, apples-to-apples to -- some more of the data center companies and maybe looking a little bit beyond what we've just looked at through our REIT lens. If you were able to secure a renewal on 75% of your rents coming up for renewal in 2013. Just doing back of the envelope and using those quarters' revenue, rental revenue as a run rate, it would imply annual churn in like the 4% range. Is that the right math?
Thomas M. Ray: Jonathan, I'd have to go look at it.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: I think it's a little bit high, but -- I would say it's just a little bit high, Jonathan. I would say it's about 3%.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Okay. 3% high. I just wanted to make sure because that is a very low churn number relative to what we see from an industry perspective on an annual basis. Now was that [indiscernible]?
Thomas M. Ray: Jonathan, I want to be really clear. We'll circle back on that. Look, on the trail for a handful of years, we had about 1 point to 1.5 points per quarter in churn, so we're running at 4% to 6%. And as we think about churn now, again, as I shared with Jordan at the very beginning of the Q&A, one of the ways that we feel we can drive potentially significant additional value out of the existing store is by selling space to applications that are more performance sensitive and increasing revenue per foot or per kilowatt. And so as we think about churn, there's a portion that over the years...
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Not all churn is bad.
Thomas M. Ray: Not all churn is bad. So we'll have to give you more guidance. But I do think on the trail, we were between 4% and 6%. So your 4% number, I don't think, is a bad number. But I don't think we can triangulate it any better than that right now.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Understood. I mean, the math that I did was 75% -- or 25%x your $20 million of annualized rent that's coming up for renewals, about a $5 million loss over a run rate of business. That's about $125 million, and that's how you do the math.
Thomas M. Ray: I think that's fair math.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: But the point I'm trying to make, or at least drive to is that, as you look at your renewal schedule, you do have a lot coming up over the next few years. And I'm wondering if this is more of a consequence of the type of business that you're pursuing that is a little bit more retail, you're going after certain applications as opposed to large blocks of space, and so even as you do these renewals, we might not see necessarily the average lease length across are base extent. And then again, coming back to the churn, that would give us comfort about kind of the longevity of your revenue stream.
Thomas M. Ray: I think that's right, Jonathan. I think that -- look, our average lease term is -- ranges between 3 to 5 years on signings at any given Q. So based on that, 20% to 33% of the portfolio is going to roll each year. And I think that's the math.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Great. Just 2 more questions if I may. Just first in terms of the international opportunities. Obviously, you guys have in place relationship with interaction. I'm wondering how that's progressing, how important it is for CoreSite, particularly as you really pursue your vertical model? Is having international relations, and whether that's delivering any value to the business as of today, and what you see maybe from an international perspective longer term?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Jonathan, to address that, I think there is an opportunity there for tightening up kind of a loose hold, it's more alliance, but we can tighten it up. Right now, it's a marketing relationship that advanced and leads sharing. We have been looking at that. We do -- we've been approached by the other global carriers in Europe and Asia and even in Latin America. And so we're in discussions to how that might be structured going forward. For us, frankly, into Europe, we're probably a lead exporter more than a lead receiver from the European Community right now. But there is more opportunity, particularly in Asia and Latin America, that we could capture coming from those markets as well, a little bit more balanced. So I do think there's some opportunities on the lead opportunity, and we would look to tighten that up over time through some relationships like interaction.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Great. And then just lastly, in terms of the storm and storm-related impacts, obviously you guys have a presence down at 32 Avenue of the Americas. I believe that's in a zone where there is a power outage. I was with a number of providers in this geography, we've seen people flip over to diesel as they should. I'm wondering whether you have any issues around your operations,  if you're able to get fuel, and if you're able to get fuel to the building, if there are any challenges necessarily getting that to wherever the fuel tanks are? There are a number of anecdotes in the city about lack of elevators to in some cases, the fuel tanks are at the top of the building. So I just wanted to get some color on your operations through the storm.
Thomas M. Ray: You bet. We're extremely proud of our team to have had no customer interruption related to Sandy. No customer interruption in New York or the other East Coast markets. And at 32, we went over to generator power and our batteries work in that transition. The generators pick up the load just fine. We've already been refueled once. Our fuel consumption run rate, at least certainly in the first half of the time period during which that building has been down has been around 1% an hour. We have 24-hour fuel refill contracts. To my knowledge, we haven't been below 50%. We've already been refueled at least once. We carry fuel contracts with multiple vendors to make sure that we can get supplies. And we anticipate being on gen for a while longer in Manhattan, and we don't anticipate any issues in accomplishing that.
Jonathan A. Schildkraut: Great. If I can ask actually one follow-up question around that, Tom, is -- are there incremental costs? I mean does your cost structure change when you flip over to diesel? Obviously you're not going to be paying the utility during that time. And is it a comparable cost structure? If there are incremental costs, who bears that burden? Are there elements of your contract with your customers if there was an incremental cost to pass that through? Just trying to get a sense.
Thomas M. Ray: Yes. Number one, there is some incremental cost. Running gens -- supplying power off the gens is more expensive than off the grid. And number two, for the most part, CoreSite bears those costs, to put it differently, the customers do not. That said, we do maintain insurance for external service interruption beyond 24 hours, and that insurance is designed to reimburse us for those incremental costs. So yes, it costs a little bit more to run on gen, but I don't think it's a cost that is material to the operations of the company, the finances of the company. And for anything that would be material or enduring, we are insured.
Operator: The next question does come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: A couple of questions. 2972 Stender, I mean, everyone's kind of talking about the Santa Clara being a slightly tougher market. Tom, I believe you mentioned it even in your comments earlier on today, but that's where you seem to have done the most by way of leasing this quarter. I'm just kind of curious specifically what you were seeing in that market relative to your peer group, and what kind of made your leasing activity recently as robust as it was relative to everybody else.
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we -- I guess first, we've seen very significant cloud adoption at 2972, and that pipeline remains solid. So we've had good activity from the cloud applications in that market and that building. I think we've all seen the market that we've talked about in the past. That market has performed better than we expected it to. It's staying on that better than we had thought, but still, pricing is down meaningfully for undifferentiated apps. I think that -- I don't see anything going on in Santa Clara different than what we've seen over the last handful of quarters. And I see our pipeline, our funnel of defined applications being reasonably consistent as well.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Okay. Majority of this are tenants that are signing leases at 2972, are they tenants looking for 250 kilowatts of power, 300 kilowatts, or are there kind of bigger requirements?
Thomas M. Ray: We've had a good mix. And I think in the largest Internet markets, you see the larger performance-sensitive applications. So when there is more of a consolidation or just a bigger market to serve, you see larger apps. And Virginia and New York and the Bay Area have been consistent, and Chicago. So yes, I'd say the mix is a little bit bigger there than the others, but that increase is consistent with the overall size of the market.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Okay. And then you also -- for 2972, when I take a look at your development schedule, it looks like estimated completion may happen a little bit faster relative to last quarter. Is that because you've just seen a very strong demand funnel of people trying to move in?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, we've worked harder to go faster to deliver that first floor with direct correlation to customer demand.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the other side of things, 427 South LaSalle, the development that's going on over there, does the estimated completion date seem to have been moved out 1 or 2 quarters?
Jeffrey S. Finnin: Same reason. Frankly, I think Chicago has been the spot where our conversion to the vertical selling model has cost us a little bit. And so we should have better sales going forward. Chicago has been a good market for us. But over the last 2 Qs, it has slowed down. And as such, we deferred completion of that project accordingly just to conserve capital until we need to deliver it.
Jeffrey S. Finnin: And we still see pipeline funnel coming from the cloud and content providers there, that want network access that are interested in downtown, but it just hasn't materialized this quarter.
Thomas M. Ray: And we -- as we converted to our vertical selling model, I've shared the discussion with some of you this morning that -- an internal discussion that we were effective at a level of 1 or 2 vertically before, and we're become effective at a level of 8. What needs to happen is you also remain effective geographically at a level of 8. But in the transition -- we lost our lead sales person in Chicago due to the transition. He self-selected out, and we have felt that pain. And I know Jarrett and Chris, Chris in particular, are working on getting restaffed. So yes, it's slower in Chicago than we thought, we'd hoped. In that market, it's pretty easy to say that had a huge amount to deal with the sales realignment. And as such, we deferred capital accordingly.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Okay. But is there a danger that all of a sudden because of relatively good demand there, someone showed up wanting to take space and you don't have it, which are the kinds of the problems you had in 2Q?
Thomas M. Ray: Well, from your lips to the heavens, Tayo, we would love that to happen.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jordan Sadler: Sorry I may have missed it. But I was just curious on the transaction costs that were expensed during the quarter. What were they attributable to? And any sort of insight you can offer on sort of the investment front?
Thomas M. Ray: We were working on a development opportunity that we have indefinitely suspended. So we've wrote those off, but I wouldn't say that, that opportunity will never come to fruition. But we wrote off everything we've accrued to date. And then our other activities, as Jeff indicated in his remarks, we; would -- we've established a goal to have an additional project kick off in 2013 in addition to VA-2 and in addition to the things you see in the stuff from the existing store. And we're working purposefully and feel like we have a good opportunity to meet that goal. And we think that will probably be in the $60 million to $80 million range to get a powered shell developed and deliver the first phase of salable inventory and have attractive follow-on investment opportunity thereafter.
Jordan Sadler: You're thinking greenfield or redev?
Thomas M. Ray: We're -- we don't perceive a huge difference between those 2, Jordan. The difference is meaningful when you buy a data center that's already got 40% of data center use in it and the rest can be redeveloped. But I think our general view is this will probably be a brand-new development. And whether we're using an existing shell or not, I don't see a difference.
Jordan Sadler: Okay, that's helpful. And the nature of the development that you wrote off, was that in the existing market or new market?
Thomas M. Ray: We just don't go into detail. It wasn't a big expense. It is something that we're keeping on the back burner and we just thought it was better to clean out the books in the Q.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Thomas Ray for any closing comments.
Thomas M. Ray: Well, thanks to everyone for joining the call. More lengthy than normal, but more interesting market climate than normal. Yes, to summarize, we believe that the fundamental demand drivers in our industry remain very, very strong. There are periods of interruption, but we believe the fundamental drivers in the industry remain very strong. We think our business model has proven effective and we think importantly, it's becoming increasingly effective, and we're confident in the trajectory of that effectiveness. We did things in Q3 that were painful to accelerate what we target as accelerating performance in the future. And we're very, very excited about the go forward. We do see a very attractive opportunity in the market to become a premier provider. There's an opportunity for another extremely strong company in the performance-sensitive segment, and we believe that we're very well positioned within the industry to seize it. So thank you, everybody, for your support, the support from our shareholders. And we'll continue to work hard for everybody. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the conference for today, and we do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-04-26 11:00:00) =====

 Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments. 
Steven Collis: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen once again delivered solid quarterly results, and our performance for the first half of our fiscal year 2012 positions us well to meet our objectives for the full year. In the March quarter, our revenues were up 2% to $20.1 billion. Earnings per share were up 5% to $0.81, and that's on top of a 22% increase in the prior year. 
 We generated $236 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $200 million of our shares. I'm especially proud that we overcame a challenging comp to this quarter, last year, and exceeded our internal profit goals for each business unit. 
 During the quarter, we also made excellent progress integrating recent acquisitions and working towards the closing of our World Courier acquisition. Our strong cash generation and high-quality balance sheet continue to provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives, grow our business and return funds to shareholders. 
 AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. Demographics and initiatives aimed at expanding access to health care and coverage -- and health care coverage, should continue to drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals, as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth over the next several years. Whether the new therapies are traditional oral medications or complex biotech pharmaceuticals, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to not only benefit from the distribution of new products, but also to offer pre-launch and commercialization services to manufacturers and to support patient access and reimbursement programs to help ensure that patients have access to life-saving therapies and that the products achieve their full potential in the marketplace. 
 At our verse [ph] revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics, and our customer mix puts us in a favorable position to continue to benefit from the historic influx of generics. As you know, generics mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry but drive tremendous value for wholesalers, health care providers and patients alike. In addition, close scrutiny of health care expenses and cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers also drives demand for our services, most notably in our Consulting Services group. 
 Over the last several years, we have significantly strengthened our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and we continue to look for meaningful ways to provide additional services across the supply channel to help them ensure they meet the challenges of today's changing health care landscape. As our provider customers face similar challenges regarding cost-containment and reimbursement for services provided to patients, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen. We help in making their health care practices run as efficiently and effectively as possible.  
 Our provider customers work hard every day to provide world-class patient care, and we believe they deserve fair reimbursement for the professional services they provide. AmerisourceBergen is an active participant participating in policy discussions in Washington, D.C. with the objective of helping legislators understand our industry and our importance to the health care system. 
 Our associates are focused on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of providing outstanding service to customers and in our financial performance. They continue to seek creative ways to meet the challenges in the diverse markets we serve and identify new opportunities to add value through collaborative innovation and by maximizing efficiency. I take great pride in their enthusiasm and dedication, and it is my honor to work beside them. 
 Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, as expected, had flat revenue in the quarter as strong performance in the institutional segment was offset by the previously disclosed loss of a large retail customer. Top line growth was also mitigated by the impact of generic convergence, including decreased sales to our largest customer. 
 Our ABDC associates did a stellar job this quarter managing several generic launches, including 5 different generic products that launched within one week. Year-to-date, the generic launches have performed as planned and we, of course, look forward to several more launches still to come in the second half of the year. 
 With over 4,600 members, our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network, the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S., continues to play a crucial role in providing pharmacy care nationwide. Patients prefer choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions, and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs and at adapting to the changing needs of the marketplace. 
 Our ASHP implementation continues to run smoothly with 8 distribution centers conversions complete, 2 additional conversions occurring tomorrow, and the remainder planned for the beginning of 2013. As we have gained experience with the new system, particularly with the corporate and back-office functions, we have already begun to realize some operational savings, which is reflected, in part, in the good performance we had on the expense line this quarter. 
 Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins continued in the March quarter. Our associates have done a tremendous job setting up 4 new distribution centers in 6 months, in order to support this new business. There is still much work to be done, but we are confident that our expansion efforts will meaningfully increase the value we bring to both independent pharmacies and especially providers in the Canadian market.
 As we noted in the press release, following the closing of the merger of Express Scripts and Medco in early April, we amended our existing Medco agreement to provide for the contract to end upon the award and implementation of one or more new pharmaceutical distribution agreements for the newly combined business. Express Scripts has issued an RFP for the combined business, and anticipate that the new contract, or contracts, will begin on October 1, 2012. We are participating fully in the competitive RFP process, and we intend to pursue this opportunity to retain or grow the business under a new contract. We have had an excellent working relationship with Medco for over 2 decades, and we are excited about the opportunity to demonstrate the value we can bring to the newly combined entity. 
 AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and in our vaccine and physician distribution business. Our oncology business performed well, while facing a very difficult comparison due to the strong performance of the 3 large Besse generic products last year. While our Specialty Group is best known for our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched into the physician marketplace. We continue to execute very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product establishing significant market share in what was the first full quarter of the introduction. 
 Our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full suite of capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, we recently helped a manufacturer launch a new biotech product. And during the March quarter, we were able to not only achieve the leading market share for the distribution of the product, but also to provide third-party logistics, contract packaging and all of the reimbursement and patient support programs for the product across the market. We are very proud that these combined service offerings provide unmatched value to manufacturers and distinguish AmerisourceBergen in the marketplace. As we look at the products in development pipelines today, we believe that we will win even more of these opportunities in the future, which will be an important driver of our growth in the years ahead. 
 Our Consulting Services group delivered a very strong quarter, while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source, which are both performing very well. The last group had the strongest quarter in its history, even without the contributions from TheraCom. While the group only represents about 2% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting services provide essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible. In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. 
 We continue to make good progress towards closing our most recent acquisition, World Courier. As we deepen our knowledge and understanding of their business, I am more convinced than ever that World Courier affords us the opportunity, not only to acquire the market leader in premium niche clinical trial logistics services, but also to begin to build out a framework to expand our consulting and commercialization services beyond North America. 
 In this current quarter, we will begin operating in 50 new international markets and employ about 1,500 new associates outside North America. This is significant expansion for ABC, and we are tremendously excited about welcoming the World Courier team to ABC. 
 In addition, we are exploring ways to potentially expand some of our niche Specialty Distribution services into select markets as well. We expect to close the acquisition next week, at the end of April, and I'm very excited about the potential we see in the World Courier platform in the years ahead. 
 Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel, they should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as consulting and packaging services. While we, historically, have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we will consider selling larger, as we did with World Courier, if it made good strategic sense and would deliver value to our company and our shareholders. 
 Looking ahead, the results we've had in the first half of our year have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect GAAP earnings per share to be within the range of $2.74 to $2.84, and we are tracking towards the midpoint of that range. Tim will provide the details in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, but I want to highlight that we continue to remain disciplined on expenses, our cash flows are strong and we have increased our share repurchase assumption for the year. 
 Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012, including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our ASHP implementation. In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see this 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients enter the health care market, driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years for generic conversions. And, of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that time frame. 
 Before turn it over to Tim, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and in our future. Demand is strong for the products we distribute, and we play an essential role in pharmaceutical supply channel. We've positioned ourselves well to continue to benefit from the 2 key growth drivers, generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our distribution and in our services businesses. 
 Over the last year, we were summating important investment in other areas of our business with an eye to the future. We expect demand for specialty products to continue to grow, not only the U.S. but throughout the world, and the commercialization and reimbursement support services we provide to manufacturers will help support that growth. As cost containment efforts continue to cross the health care landscape, our customers increasingly turn to us for help in meeting the challenges of the marketplace without sacrificing patient care. Finally, the vision and innovative ideas that our associates bring to market every day set us apart in our industry, and I am proud to be their leader. Here is Tim. 
Tim Guttman: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be participating in my first earnings call as acting CFO. And I am pleased to report another solid ABC quarter and, most importantly, that our Q2 results are on track with our internal plan. 
 The highlights this quarter: excellent top line growth at our Specialty and Consulting businesses; very good execution on new generic launches and continued focus on expense management across the organization; and finally, another quarter of strong cash generation. 
 Now let's turn to the quarterly details. And starting with the top line, revenues were $20.1 billion, a 1.6% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenues were essentially flat, as we guided. We had strong performance in our alternate site and health system segments, offset by the loss of a large chain customer last year, as well as the impact from brand to generic conversions. 
 The Specialty Group revenues increased 6%, led by 2 of our businesses with above market growth. ICS, our third-party logistics business and Besse Medical, our vaccine and physician office distribution business, which benefited from a full quarter impact of sales of a new ophthalmology drug. 
 The Consulting group, though small to the overall top line, continues to perform well. Excluding their TheraCom acquisition, they had over 20% top line growth. TheraCom contributed just under 1% of our overall revenue growth in the quarter. 
 Moving to gross profit. Gross profit was $695 million in the quarter, up 1.1% from last March, with a gross margin of 3.46% in the quarter, down about 2 basis points from last year. As we have discussed in the past, our second quarter was a very tough comp, due to the significant contribution in the prior year from oncology generics. In the second quarter 2011, these oncology drugs contributed about $0.16 of EPS to our results. Our gross margin expanded 31 basis points in the March 2011 quarter. This year, we are able to effectively offset this headwind with contributions from the new oral solid generics, as well as the lower contribution from oncology generics and gross profit contributions from our acquired companies. 
 Additionally, our LIFO charge was approximately $4 million in the quarter, down $10 million from last year. We continue to expect our LIFO charge will be approximately $15 million, down significantly from last year. Our annual LIFO forecast is based on our expectation that brand price inflation will be somewhat less this year. And more importantly, we will see significant generic price deflation in the second half of our fiscal year related to key brand to generic conversions coming off exclusivity. 
 Finally, the benefit we received from the new generic launches, and also price appreciation, was in line with our expectations. This quarter, we did an excellent job controlling our operating expenses. Operating expenses were approximately $327 million, up 1.5%. However, this amount includes the operating expenses of about $11 million from our recently acquired companies. Additionally, we had $9 million of executive severance and acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses would've been down, excluding the impact of our acquisitions, due to lower compensation costs, including benefits. 
 Additionally, our SAP implementation is progressing well at the corporate level. The system has reached a level of stability faster than we expected, enabling us to realize some early savings, especially with external consultants. 
 Last quarter, our guidance was an annual expense increase of about 3%, due to our acquisitions. As an organization, we continue to exercise discipline and focus on managing expenses. We now expect our total operating expenses for our base business, before adding World Courier, to be essentially flat for the year. 
 Operating income of $368 million in the quarter increased about 1%, while operating margin was down 2 basis points compared to last March. Our current quarter was slowed by the $9 million of executive severance and acquisition transaction costs. Excluding these nonrecurring expenses, our operating income margin would've expanded 3 basis points to 1.88%. 
 Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of nearly $24 million in the March quarter increased 25% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million bonds we issued back in November. The proceeds help to fund the TheraCom acquisition and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. Our effective income tax rate of 38.4% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and is right in line with our expected annualized rate of 38.4%. 
 Our diluted GAAP earnings per share in the quarter of $0.81 increased by $0.04, or 5%, over the same quarter last year. And again, overcoming a $0.16 headwind from the contribution from specialty generics in the March 2011 quarter. Our EPS benefited from a reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares for the quarter were approximately 262 million, down just over 6% from last March. 
 Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows, where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $236 million of cash from operations in the quarter, bringing our 6-month total to $668 million, compared to generating $577 million for the first 6 months last year. We continue to manage AR and inventory levels very closely, and this has benefited our working capital this year. With our daily revenue volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter-end working capital snapshots are subject to volatility. Therefore, our 6-month cash results cannot be extrapolated to determine a full year cash flow estimate. 
 Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter and $88 million for the 6 months. During the last 2 years, we put a number of capital projects on hold as we focused on SAP. We have a pipeline of attractive internal projects that we have begun to pursue as our SAP deployment moves along. 
 Additionally, we have CapEx associated with our recent TheraCom acquisition. Because of this, we will exceed our previous target of $150 million for CapEx, and we will be closer to $200 million for the year. Even with this additional CapEx, we expect that our free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. 
 During the quarter, we bought back $200 million of our shares. For 6 months, we've purchased $320 million of shares. At March 31, we have approximately $180 million left on our current share repurchase authorization. In terms of key financial metrics that we track, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 14 days, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 18 days in the March quarter were up slightly from 17.3 days last year. And favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 3 days compared to fiscal '11. 
 With our recent debt offering, our gross debt, the total debt and capital ratio, at the end of March, was 39%, above our target range of 30% to 35%. And it will remain above the range until we pay off our $400 million of debt in September. Our cash balance at March 31 was $2.3 billion. Keep in mind that we will be funding our World Courier acquisition from cash and we will be paying down debt in September, as previously mentioned. After these 2 large cash outlays, we will still have financial flexibility to fund CapEx and strategic initiatives and return to capital -- and return capital to our shareholders. 
 Now let's turn to updated fiscal 2012 guidance. We expect our diluted GAAP EPS to track to the middle of the range we previously provided, $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumption for revenue growth remains unchanged, flat-to-modest revenue growth. We expect our operating margin expansion to be in the high-single-digit basis points. Free cash flow will now be in the $800 million to $900 million range. And we are raising our guidance for share repurchases for the year to $500 million, which will complete our current share repurchase authorization. 
 Looking ahead, I would like to remind everyone that Q3 is another challenging comparison for us because of the $0.17 EPS contribution from oncology generics last year. Also in Q3 2012, we have 2 of the large generics coming off exclusivity. When looking out to the second half of the year, we believe Q4 will be somewhat of an easier comparison. With the return of Oxaliplatin for half a quarter, a few favorable year-end generic launches for the Drug Company and favorable expense comparisons year-over-year. 
 So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate, that 6 months into the fiscal year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business, and we are well positioned to meet our financial targets for fiscal 2012. 
 One final point, I'd like to take a moment and thank our ABC associates, especially those in the finance and accounting areas that have stepped up the last 2 months and helped support the organization and me, in particular, during our CFO transition period. Thanks, everyone. Here's Barbara to start our Q&A. 
Barbara Brungess: .
 Thank you, Tim. Operator, we'll now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Go ahead, operator. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Crédit Suisse. 
Glen Santangelo: I just want to quickly follow up, Tim, with respect to some of your comments on the operating margin expansion goals for the year. Previously the company had expected operating margin expansion in the high single-digit, kind of low double-digit range and now, it seems like you're suggesting high single-digit. I guess -- could just give me a sense for maybe what has changed in that thinking? And I know there were some onetime costs that you're now embedding in your estimates, and I'm curious if there's anything else that I should be thinking about. 
Tim Guttman: No, we changed our guidance to high single-digit. In terms of looking out, we did an assessment of the full year, and looking out, we had some deal costs in Q2 and some onetime items, nonrecurring items. And as we look out, we're going to have some similar costs in Q3 with the World Courier transaction. So when we look out and do a reassessment, we felt more comfortable that high single-digit was a realistic target for us for the year, and there's really nothing else factored into that. 
Glen Santangelo: And, Tim, maybe if I could just ask a follow up on the World Courier group. You originally sort of guided $0.06 to $0.10 worth of accretion and I'm kind curious, is there anything embedded from an accretion standpoint in your fiscal '12 guidance as it relates to World Courier? And it kind of sounds like you're going to be taking down some integration costs or acquisition-related costs next quarter. I don't know if you care to size those at this point. 
Tim Guttman: Glen, no. We will have some transaction-related acquisition costs in Q3. Probably not more than the number that we had for Q2. And there is no accretion in our numbers for this fiscal year. We expect it to be neutral. And in terms of next year, for fiscal '13, we're still confident with that guidance of $0.06 to $0.10. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Marsh with Barclays. 
Lawrence Marsh: So my question is as follows, Steve, around Medco. Here you're communicating -- I guess, is it fair to say that you voluntarily agreed to move up the termination date of your Medco relationship by 6 months? And if so, is there any benefit for doing so, and possibly foregoing that profit stream? And then just around the topic, I wanted to confirm, you said you've already have a relationship with Express Scripts. How long have you had that? And then have you disclosed or in a position to comment about the length of the suggested new contract under the RFP? 
Steven Collis: First of all, obviously, we are part of a very active process here and we want to be very respectful of that and some of the questions should really be directed to the buyer. But I think ABC, as you know, has been very proud of over 2 decades of service to Medco and now, you could almost say we are the incumbent here because we've had such a long relationship. So we wanted to demonstrate flexibility. We wanted to recognize that this is a new entity that has their own requirements and will have a different dynamics to relationship. And now it just made sense for us to be concurrent with the current requirements. So we demonstrated flexibility. We demonstrated that ABC is a good partner and listens to our customers and I think that, that will hopefully put us in a good position throughout the contracting process, but it will be competitive. And, I guess, the only internal benefit I can point to is that this is concurrent with our fiscal year, and whatever happens, we'll be in a good position to plan for it and to communicate that to our investors. 
David Larsen: Okay. So it sounds like you're uncomfortable commenting about the length of the contract as proposed in the RFP at this point. 
Steven Collis: As far as we know, as far as we could say, it's pretty standard type of contract term. 
David Larsen: Right. So we assume, maybe 3 years, but again, not commenting. And I guess just a follow-up to you and Tim around SAP implementation, we appreciate the update there. If you let it to go back or remember some of the bigger expenses for this, seemed to be fiscal '10 and '11, $40 million to $50 million a year, you've mentioned, Tim, stability sooner than you thought. Can you ballpark kind of expenses around SAP for you this year? And how do we think about that comparable to next year? 
Tim Guttman: Yes. Larry, our guidance has been that we'll see some benefit for SAP next year, 6 months after our last DC deployment, so we expect that to be in Q4, and we've guided to $10 million. And we expect the full benefit of about $40 million to be in '14. And so far, the benefit that we've had this year for SAP is really incremental for that. I mean, this is just expense that we've been able to take out of our operating budget, which has probably been a few million dollars. So again, they're separate. One's not a part of the other. 
Lawrence Marsh: I got it. Right. Expenses associated with consultants and such, but again, $10 million incremental next year, $40 million for '14. And then just to clarify, I think it's an important point, the guidance confirming the range, but you're suggesting the $0.02, which was the severance and transaction cost this quarter and the $0.02 which -- ballpark of transaction cost next quarter, are included now in that range. You're not breaking that out at all? 
Tim Guttman: No, absolutely, Larry. We're GAAP, and we include that in. 
Lawrence Marsh: And again, you're saying that's a big reason why you're top and the operating margin expansion has been pulled down? 
Tim Guttman: Absolutely. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. 
Robert Jones: Just to go back to the Express Scripts contract. Steve, it sounds like -- you mentioned contract, or contracts, so I'm assuming there's some suggestion that it could be broken up. Any insight into this view or maybe, more importantly, what benefit that would create for Express to have this contract separated? 
Steven Collis: Well, I think, in terms of processing, there's not much differentiation between s $10 billion contract, or a $15 billion, or $20 billion contract, it's just that, that is the way these large contracts tend to go. And there could be some geographical, regional benefit, based on where they're planning to have their large mail-order sites, there could be a way to separate the specialty business with the core mail-order business. So we have 2 big specialty units so -- but again, these are questions that we probably are not that comfortable commenting on and could probably be best be directed to Express Scripts, sir. 
Robert Jones: No, I definitely appreciate that. And I guess just one follow-up, Steve. Given the somewhat more acquisitive nature of the company as of late, and I know you've gotten this question before and I imagine as you continue to do acquisitions, you might get it more in the future, relative to your peers. Any thoughts or discussion between you and Tim about moving to a cash EPS, or at least breaking out a cash EPS? 
Steven Collis: No, we haven't. We lack -- we think we report not only good earnings, but very high quality earnings and, at the moment, that hasn't been under consideration. 
Tim Guttman: And we, in our public company filings, we feel we give pretty good disclosure on some of those differences, especially around intangibles. And the reader of those documents can go ahead and do that calculation. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard. 
Thomas Gallucci: Steve, I was wondering if you could expand on some of your prepared remarks around sort of international and how you see the opportunity may be there over -- not the near-term necessarily but the next few to 5 years, it sounds like maybe World Courier is a bit of a platform that you could grow from in different ways, so if you have any thoughts there, it would be appreciated. 
Steven Collis: Well there's a couple of things. First of all, again, we do $300 million in revenue a day, as ABC, but one of the things we've been very, very happy with is our specialty performance in Canada. This is -- this market works differently than it does in the U.S., but we've been able to do some joint programs, we've been able to help with a more complex reimbursement environment there, including a pretty robust product market that we -- that is not generally known. At least here, in the U.S., we think about it as single-payer market, that hasn't been the case. We've been able to help, we have a very strong presence with new infusible drugs. So what we've seen is a manufacturer environment that ABC is very comfortable in contracting with, that is looking for us to get into more countries. So we've been prompted to look at international opportunities by manufacturers. Then comes World Courier, we're in 50 new countries as of next week, hopefully. We have 1,500 associates that are very tenured. We've been extremely impressed with the quality of the World Courier associates. As you know, health care is very local. So we think that we have an opportunity to understand health care markets, both organic and acquisitive opportunities, with people on the ground there who speak the language and know the trends, know who's the right players, the ethical players, the high quality players in that environment. And we think that, that's going to give us a good opportunity. We also think that as the products that World Courier is managing are commercialized, as more and more of those products are commercialized and come to market as -- middle class is growing in some countries that we haven't traditionally thought about as being big [indiscernible] sort of -- and especially consumers of products, we think we're going to have an opportunity to participate in those commercialization strategies. Think about it, World Courier has handled those products, they know the treatment centers, they know the environment. So we think that we have to recharacterize part of the business, but we think we can do that, so long answer, but as you can tell, I'm very enthusiastic about this. 
Thomas Gallucci: Sure, that's clear. And then maybe just one housekeeping item. On the CapEx, can you sort of breakdown your maintenance CapEx versus maybe what's additional and some of those projects that you highlighted earlier, do they seep into next year? Should we assume that it comes back down a little bit, or how are you thinking about that? 
Tim Guttman: Good question. No, we -- when we look at maintenance CapEx, we think it's typically between about $100 million and $120 million. We have some big projects this year supporting our expansion up in Canada. We're looking at another DC project in the U.S. in terms of expansion, automation, renovation and our TheraCom acquisition. So I would say that the $200 million is probably a peak, and it definitely should come down next year. Probably about half of the maintenance CapEx is probably a good -- kind of a good range. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Willoughby: Steve, what kind of clarity do you actually have on -- does the RFP provide for you? I mean, I assume you would have size of the potential contract, the mail footprint you'd be serving, whether or not specialty would be there. I mean, are there some things you could disclose there that would be helpful for us? 
Steven Collis: I think, we partly said, Bob, I appreciate your interest in this and, believe you me, I am really interested in this and the ABC team is very interested in this. We're just participating fully in the RFP process, it has just begun. So I could tell you we really don't -- we think it's in the range of about a $20 billion contract. So I will tell you that Medco peaked with ABC at about 19% of our revenues in fiscal year 2011, and it's come off a few percent from that, and our current run rate is more in the mid-teens, 16% range. So we could potentially gain some couple billion dollars in new revenue here. 
Robert Willoughby: Okay. And any sense on timing, when a decision will ultimately be made, obviously, before October 1. But how much time would you need? And do you anticipate if you win, is there investment you need to make or in the unfortunate event you don't win, what kind of offsets we might see to your cost structure, some initiatives you'd pursue? 
Steven Collis: Well, we're mainly servicing the current business out of 3 DCs, and we certainly would start giving consideration to what it could mean if we lose. But from a more exciting basis, I think we do have the capacity to service this business without much incremental investment. And we look forward to talking about the different capabilities that ABC brings to the table. And we're participating fully in this contract. 
Robert Willoughby: And timing, Steve? Anything? 
Steven Collis: No, I just think you know -- I think you know -- you cover Express Scripts. You know they move quickly, so that's all I can tell you. They don't let the grass grow under their feet. So we expect them to have a very active and quick and decisive process unlike this other very public contract that we went through very recently. So that should make everyone happy, at least, we'd all know where we stand very quickly. We believe so. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. 
Ricky Goldwasser: Just a quick follow-up [ph] on the Medco Express side, from what we understand, specialty is included in your relationship with legacy Medco. Should we assume that the services that you provided to Medco on the specialty side are more of wholesale-type services, or do you also provide them kind of like the added value services that's associated with your specialty business? 
Steven Collis: We are both the wholesaler to the former Accredo division, the Accredo division of Medco, and now will be Express Scripts. And we have, obviously, worked very collaboratively with them in many areas including the hospital, pharmacy area and the specialty area. So I can't -- I'm not comfortable pointing to any particular program, but certainly as our largest customer, we spend a lot of time working on common approaches to the marketplace, and we would expect to bring that expertise and that market knowledge and the manufacturer relationships that we have to the combined entity now. 
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay, and then I have a couple of just questions from modeling purposes. For the SG&A level for the remainder of the year, should we assume same level as we saw in the March quarter or should we see a step up, and if so, can you quantify for us? And is it related to World Courier? 
Tim Guttman: We, at this point, Ricky, we don't have World Courier finished yet, completed. But definitely with World Courier coming in 2 months in quarter 3 and we'll have them for the entire Q4, they will add extra expense. When I gave the guidance today this morning, again, I was talking about the core business being flat. For the core business, we will see a little bit of a step up in 3, but probably not dramatic. And again, we will have some nonrecurring acquisition-related cost in Q3, probably not in Q4. 
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And then can you just qualify to us the impact from a basis point perspective of the acquisitions on the margins for this quarter? 
Tim Guttman: In terms of SG&A? 
Ricky Goldwasser: SG&A or operating margin. 
Tim Guttman: Well again, we commented that we had about $11 million of SG&A expense in the quarter from our acquisitions, primarily TheraCom. So again, it's probably 4, 3, 4 basis points. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. 
Eric Coldwell: I think a lot of the timely questions have been answered, so I'll shift gears a bit. Health systems and alternate site in your drug company, sound like another good quarter there, above market growth, perhaps. I'm curious if you can define what's leading to this growth. It must be share capture, I don't want to lead you too much, but the market's clearly not growing at a rapid pace. You're primarily doing pharmaceuticals and not the other broad med service lines or other services into the health systems. So could you just give us some better sense on what's driving that growth in health systems and alternate site and then perhaps if you could frame it, would be helpful, too. 
Steven Collis: Well with health systems, we think we have a market share that is, at least comparable, maybe even the largest in the U.S. We believe we're with the right customers, we believe that we're growing with them. We believe that we have some nice little services that we provide that maybe don't get the headlines, but they are additive to their business, like helping them with 340B consulting, helping them with price pharmacy. So we have a very good practice in health systems, and we believe we're with the companies that are the leaders in that space, and I think some of our customers are there. Likewise with alternate care, I think ABC has been a leader there. Certainly our knowledge of specialty and our ability to offer an integrated solution on the specialty and drug wholesale side and our knowledge of the manufacturing environment and the patient environment and the reimbursement environment has been very, very helpful. And the Humana contract, we think ,was a direct result of that knowledge, and that's a very fast grower. We're with a lot of the companies that are growing faster than the market and when we discuss potential RFP responses, we look at who do we think will be the winners in a certain space, and we like to really target them and try to get them into the ABC portfolio. So I think you could look at it as it's not a matter of happenstance, it's a matter of strategically planning the accounts that we believe will be winners in the space. 
Eric Coldwell: Great answer, Steve. Could you put a frame around the growth rates in those 2 segments? 
Steven Collis: I think we can maybe look at that and invest it out.  I think we've done some of that in the past. But we don't have a framework that we can share right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. 
Lisa Gill: I think that you made a comment earlier around your expectations for LIFO this year and within that comment, Tim, I think you talked about branded price inflation being less and more deflation on the generic side. Can you maybe just talk about what you actually saw in this quarter and then what you are seeing in the marketplace around an increase in competition, as far as the number of generic manufacturers that spend a nice steady state the last couple of years, are you seeing a trend that's perhaps changing a little bit, as we go through the next couple of months? 
Tim Guttman: In terms of -- and when I speak of LIFO, just let me say that we look at our portfolio of drugs which -- in our mix and in terms of brand, last year we had pretty healthy price increases for brands, slightly above 8%. This year, we're tracking slightly below 8% again for our mix of inventory. So a little bit different, a little bit lower. But on the generic side, we really expect that we'll see some deflation, second half of the year, especially on Lipitor and Zyprexa, the generics when they come off exclusivity, which will help and give us a LIFO benefit. In terms of your second question about suppliers. I mean, last year we also had pretty good price appreciation on the generic side. It's still pretty good, but that's probably off a little bit this year, it's softened a little bit this year, but still pretty healthy. 
Lisa Gill: Okay, great. And then, Steve, just one quick question for you on the oncology side of your business. We know of a number of these pilot programs that have been started by Aetna and United around the way they're paying their physician in trying to take the drug cost out of the equation, are you seeing that impact your business at all? And what are the physicians saying? And if it does take hold, what does that mean longer term, will that change the relationship you have with the physician, where you'll now have a relationship with one of the managed-care companies? How should we think about that? 
Steven Collis: Well, our strategy with the large payers is really to help them understand how important community oncology is. We believe that it's not only important from a clinical perspective, but we believe that the patient is best served being in the community, and even the payer is best served by those patients being in the community. So our big effort over there is really to help bring the 2 sides together. We have taken a lot of effort at ION, our physician services company, primarily focused on oncology, to help the 2 sides communicate better, have a transparent relationship. And we don't anticipate having a direct relationship with the payer, but we intend to help our customers contract more effectively and more transparently with the payers, and I think we're making a lot of progress there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Swann. 
David Larsen: A question for Tim. It looks like, according to my model, your SG&A costs, on a year-over-year basis, declined by about $12 million. Can you describe sort of the cost control process you go through on a quarterly basis and if that's sustainable? 
Tim Guttman: Sure, David. I mean, when we looked at the year, I mean, we knew and we guided that Q2 and Q3 would be very tough comparisons, I mean, we knew it going into the year. And we put word out through our businesses to really manage expenses this year. And we knew we had to focus in this area. So I mean, we looked hard at managing labor and payroll expense. We looked at outside consulting and services and then this year, too, we've had some good discipline and credit collections, and our bad debts are down. So really, it's all of our businesses focusing on headcount, on making sure they spend money prudently, and that's going to carry forward into quarters 3 and 4. 
David Larsen: And then if I were to look at like, say, 3% of SG&A in fiscal '11, I'm coming up with like $35 million. So for the incremental acquisition cost with like World Courier group and these other ones, will all-in, that will be more than $35 million? And that's why they'll be -- that's why there was a slight reduction on the operating margin expansion guidance, is that correct? 
Tim Guttman: Well, in terms of your question, the $35 million, no, I don't think the  all-in -- I mean, we should be under that number. So hopefully that helps you in terms of some guidance but, again, we think we're managing expenses well. We also had the benefit this quarter and we'll have for the rest of the year in terms of SAP being stable, and we're seeing the benefits there. So all in all, I mean, I think what we're saying here is that expense management is offsetting the increases from the special charges and the nonrecurring charges. 
David Larsen: Great. And then your merchandise inventory looked like it declined nicely on a sequential basis, maybe leading to an increase in cash flow guidance. That looked nice. 
Tim Guttman: Yes, definitely. Like, David, in my comments, I've mentioned that we've really focused on working capital. All of our businesses are focused on it. Managing AR, managing inventories. So we are seeing some really good reductions in those areas, especially at our ABSG businesses. 
Operator: Okay, our last question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. 
Steven Valiquette: So I guess, just one more question on the Express Medco, I'm obligated at the end here with the -- I think you mentioned in your comments that in some ways you viewed yourself as the primary incumbent on the Express Medco contracts. I guess my question is, are you now happy this is going to an official RFP versus your previous thought pattern over the past 9 months since this deal got announced? Or are you disappointed? Is it because you thought you were the primary incumbent, or are you just indifferent? Just trying to get more color sort of on your view now, the new information versus kind of what you thought previously. 
Steven Collis: I was actually at a NACDS conference, and I heard one political pundit speak about the election, and they said incumbency is a 4-point advantage, so I was just trying to get that incumbent advantage in there. But that's just my view, I mean, I don't know if anyone else has that view. We did, of course, do more business with Medco than the current wholesaler did with ESR so, you could look at it as an incumbency but, I think, that's just really my view, but we are pleased that this has been decided relatively early in the process. That's very helpful from a planning perspective and, again, it's helped us have a very quick and interesting discussion with ESR. So we think that it's a positive for the industry and we think that, potentially, it could be positive for AmerisourceBergen. 
Barbara Brungess: Thanks, Steve. Now, Steve Collis would like to make some final comments before we go. 
Steven Collis: We know that it's a very busy day, so we really do appreciate everyone's interest and attention with AmerisourceBergen. I would like to commend my colleague and our acting CFO, Tim Guttman, for his leadership and contribution during this transition period. As you could see, Tim's really done a great job. So to wrap up, ABC thinks this is a really good quarter for us and especially given our tough comps, and we are proud to report good momentum on all fronts at this halfway point in our fiscal year 2012. Thank you again for your attention. 
Barbara Brungess: Thanks, Steve, and before we go, I'd just like to quickly highlight our upcoming events. On May 17, we'll be presenting at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2012 Health Care Conference in Las Vegas. And on June 6, we will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs 33rd Annual Global Healthcare Conference. That concludes our call for today. And now I will turn it back to the operator.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-01-26 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AmerisourceBergen first quarter earnings. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Barbara Brungess. Please go ahead. 
Barbara Brungess: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AmerisourceBergen's earnings conference call covering our fiscal 2012 first quarter results. I'm Barbara Brungess, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations. And joining me today are Steve Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and CEO; and Mike Dicandilo, Executive Vice President and CFO.
 During the conference call today, we will make some forward-looking statements about our business prospects and financial expectations. We remind you that there are many risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For a discussion of some key risk factors, we refer you to our SEC filings, including our 10-K report for fiscal 2011.
 Also, AmerisourceBergen assumes no obligation to update the matters discussed in this conference call, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. As always, those connected by phone will have an opportunity to ask questions after our opening remarks.
 Now here is Steve Collis to begin our comments. 
Steven Collis: Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that AmerisourceBergen delivered solid results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012.
 Our revenues were up 2% to $20.4 billion. Earnings per share were up 9% to $0.62. We generated $432 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $128 million of our shares. Our financial results were in line with our expectations and position us well to meet our objectives for the remainder of the year.
 Our excellent cash generation and strong balance sheet provide us with outstanding financial flexibility and give us the ability to fund our strategic initiatives and grow our business.
 AmerisourceBergen is fortunate to be an important part of a growing industry. As I discussed at our Investor Day in December, demographics in the expansion of health care coverage should drive organic growth in our industry over the next several years. In addition, launches of new pharmaceuticals as well as new indications for existing drugs should also drive sales growth. The tremendous wave of over 30 brand to generic drug conversions that we expect in our fiscal 2012 as well as additional conversions expected in subsequent years will mitigate the top line dollar growth in our industry. It will drive tremendous value for wholesalers, healthcare providers and patients alike.
 These trends bode well for AmerisourceBergen in particular. Our diverse revenue base positions us well to benefit from organic growth driven by demographics as well as from the influx of the uninsured over the next few years. Our customer mix also puts us in a favorable position to benefit from the historic influx of generics. In addition, cost-containment efforts underway by the federal government and other payers drive demand for our services most notably in our Consulting Services group.
 Today, we are more entrenched than ever before with our manufacture customers and we expect that to continue to increase. As our provider customers face reimbursement and other challenges, they increasingly turn to AmerisourceBergen for help in making their healthcare practices run as efficiently as possible without sacrificing excellent patient care.
 Over the last several months, a few large contracts in our industry have been the subject of much dialogue for various different reasons. Overall, however, the market continues to be competitive but stable. We continue to participate in discussions that are important to our business, our industry and our customers in Washington, D.C., educating lawmakers about our business and the value we and our customers provide to the healthcare system.
 I've discussed our core tenets several times over the last year but they continue to drive our efforts and that bears repeating. Firstly, collaborate to drive innovation for all stakeholders, increasing customer and supplier value, expanding our business in targeted markets, maximizing operating efficiency and maintain a high-performance culture. Our associates creatively tackle challenges and identify new opportunities to add value on a daily basis. They'll focus on meeting our objectives for the year, both in terms of the service we provide to customers and suppliers and in our financial performance, and I'm honored to work beside them.
 Turning now to our business units. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation had solid revenue growth in the quarter, up 2%. We had positive revenue growth in both retail and institutional segments, even with the previously-discussed loss of a large retail -- retail customer in September of 2011. Our ultimate side segment was particularly strong in the quarter and hospitals and independents had very solid growth. 
 We now have over 4,600 members in our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network which makes it the third largest network of pharmacies in the U.S. That is a powerful endorsement of the role that independent retail pharmacy plays in the complex healthcare landscape today.
 Patients preferred choice when determining where to fill their prescriptions and our retail customers are very adept at fulfilling unique patient needs. Our SAP implementation continues to run smoothly with redistributions and our conversions complete, and the remainder plans for the beginning of 2013. Our investments in our Canadian operations to support significant new business wins are also well underway. We are very pleased to be the leading distributor independent pharmacy in the Canadian market as well as the leader in Specialty Distribution and services.
 AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group had another strong quarter with revenues up 4%, with particularly strong performance in third-party logistics and good performance in Oncology Supply. The integration of IntrinsiQ has gone very well, and our customers have responded favorably to the tools at office. While our Specialty Group is based after our oncology franchise, we are an instrumental part of the commercialization strategy for any infusible product launched in the physician marketplace.
 In addition, our Specialty Group often collaborates with our Consulting Services group to help ensure patients have access to products by utilizing the full capabilities of our physician networks, as well as our reimbursement and patient support program expertise. For example, during the quarter, we executed very well on the launch of a new brand of ophthalmology product, establishing significant market share in just the first few months of introduction. This is a great example, not only of excellent cross-company collaboration, but also of the strength and tremendous value of our diverse offerings.
 AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services delivered a strong quarter while making excellent progress in the integration of TheraCom and Premier Source. Our Consulting and Packaging business both performed well in the quarter. And while the group only represents about 1% of our revenues, we believe our packaging and consulting associates are providing essential expertise to pharmaceutical manufacturers to help ensure that their products are brought to market as safely, quickly and efficiently as possible.
 In addition, our reimbursement expertise helps ensure that patients who can benefit from both new and mature therapies have access to the products. 
 Given the continued strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for acquisitions that meet the criteria we've had in place for quite some time. They should increase our value offering to existing customers both up and down the channel. They should be within our established core competency and they should increase shareholder value. While we have not contemplated any further contribution from acquisitions in our guidance, we continue to be receptive to acquisitions and we continue to be interested in opportunities in pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution and Services, as well as Consulting and Packaging services. While we historically have been very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million range, we would consider selling larger if it made good strategic sense and would deliver value to our company and our shareholders.
 Looking ahead, the results we've had in our first quarter have positioned us well to meet our objectives for the full fiscal year. We have a difficult comparison to overcome in 2012, but we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.84, an increase of 8% to 12% over fiscal 2011.
 Looking further ahead to 2013, we should have a carryover from some of the launches that occur late in our fiscal 2012 including the relaunch of Oxaliplatin, and we should begin to benefit from the completion of our SAP implementation.
 In fiscal 2014, we should begin to see the 30 million to 40 million uninsured patients in the healthcare market driving demand for pharmaceuticals that should carry over into 2015 and beyond. In addition, 2014 and 2015 are expected to be good years with generic conversions, and of course, there's a chance that biosimilars may also come to market in that timeframe.
 Before I turn it over to Mike for a detailed look at the financials, I want to reiterate the confidence that I have in our business and our future because demand is strong for the products we distribute and the services we provide. We were pleased to be recently be ranked 24th on Bloomberg Businessweek's list of the top 50 performing companies in the U.S. in recognition of our historic financial performance and our future growth opportunities.
 As I stated earlier, we play an essential role in the pharmaceutical supply channel, we positioned ourselves well to benefit from generics and specialty products, and we have continued to invest in our existing businesses and opportunities we see in our future.
 Finally, our exceptional associates at ABC set us apart in our industry and I'm proud to be their leader. Here is Mike. 
Michael Dicandilo: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2012 results on track with our internal plans, highlighted by good performance on new generic launches, strong expense discipline, significant progress towards integrating TheraCom into our consulting group and exceptional cash generation, all of which gives us confidence in reaffirming our annual EPS guidance.
 As we go through our quarterly results, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a $12 million or $0.03 benefit reflected in gross profit from the Duane Reade contract termination last December.
 So let's turn to the quarter, and starting with the top line, revenues were $20.4 billion, a 2.4% increase over last year's quarter. Drug company revenue was up 2% as strong growth in the alternate site hospital and independent customer groups offset the expected decline on the chain side, as this is our first quarter without the Longs/CVS contract. 
 The Specialty Group revenues increased 4% with our 3PL business especially strong this quarter. The Consulting group, though small to the overall company top line, had a very strong quarter in our acquisitions, with TheraCom being the biggest contributor, added about 0.6% to overall ABC revenue growth in the quarter.
 Gross profit was $593 million in the quarter, up 2% from last December, and gross margins of 291 basis points in the quarter were down 1 basis point from last year. As I mentioned earlier, the prior year quarter included a $12 million benefit related to the completion of the Duane Reade contract and the contribution to current quarter gross profit from our acquired companies helped to offset this headwind.
 Performance from new generic launches were in line with our expectations as were benefits from price appreciation. We gave an early update during our Investor Day in December on trends with generic Lipitor scripts. And since then, trends have normalized very much in line with our expectation of approximately a 70% conversion rate to the generic. Specialty generic trends were also in line with our expectations.
 Our LIFO charge in the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $9.9 million last year, reflecting the brand to generic conversions, and we continue to expect a full year charge of approximately $15 million.
 We did a very nice job managing our operating expenses this quarter despite our acquisition-related transaction costs and the inclusion of our acquired companies' ongoing operating costs, including 2 months of TheraCom's results.
 Operating expenses were $308 million, up 1.6% and included $3.6 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Operating expenses in the quarter would have been down year-over-year x the impact of our acquisitions, fueled by a year-over-year decline in compensation costs including favorable benefit comparisons. Keep in mind that our operating expenses are usually at their lowest level in our first quarter and should increase sequentially as we progress throughout the year. Our guidance continues to include an annual expense increase of about 3% related primarily to our acquisitions.
 Operating income of $285 million in the quarter increased 3% and operating margins expanded by 1 basis point compared to last December. Again, this year-over-year growth was slowed by the $3.6 million of acquisition costs in the current quarter and the previously-mentioned $12 million gross profit benefit realized in the first quarter of fiscal '11.
 Moving below the operating income line, interest expense of $23 million in the December quarter increased 18% compared to last year, primarily as a result of our $500 million, 3.5% bonds that we issued in mid-November. Proceeds from this debt offering helped to fund our acquisitions and will also contribute to the retirement of our 2012 bonds that mature in mid-September. As a result, our expected interest rate expense will continue to trend higher than last year for the rest of fiscal '12.
 Our effective income tax rate of 38.2% was slightly higher than last year's 38.1% and slightly below our expected annualized rate of approximately 38.4%. Our diluted earnings per share of $0.62 was up $0.05 or 9% compared to last year and exceeded our net income growth due to the reduction in our average diluted shares related to our ongoing share repurchase program. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 263.1 million, down over 6% from last December.
 Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flows where trends continue to be very favorable. We generated $432 million of cash from operations in the quarter compared to using $99 million of cash in last year's first quarter. Much of that increase came from very favorable working capital at quarter end, particularly in the timing of our payments to vendors. As I have discussed often with our daily volume exceeding $300 million per business day, our quarter end working capital snapshots are subject to great volatility, and one should be careful not to extrapolate the first quarter's results to the full year cash flow forecast.
 Capital expenditures were $48 million in the quarter compared to $50 million last year, and as we mentioned in December, included significant investments to expand our infrastructure in Canada as well as some discretionary buyouts on leased equipment, offset in part by declining ERP spend.
 We continue to expect the capital spend for the year in the $150 million range. We bought back $128 million of our shares during the quarter and we also closed our $250 million TheraCom acquisition. 
 With our strong free cash flow performance in the quarter, we continue to be comfortable with our estimate of free cash flow in a range of $700 million to $800 million for all of fiscal '12. We had our normal seasonal increase in inventory in December. But despite the higher-ending balance, our average day sales in inventory for the quarter remained at 25, consistent with fiscal '11. Average DSOs of 17.7 in the December quarter were up slightly from 17.4 days last year and the favorable payables timing helped raise average quarterly DPOs by over 2 days compared to fiscal '11.
 With our recent debt offering, our gross debt to total debt in capital ratio at the end of December was 39.9%, above our target range of 30% to 35%, and will remain above the range in the next couple of quarters until we pay off our $392 million of debt, which matures in September.
 Our cash balance of just under $2.4 billion at the end of December leaves us with great financial flexibility to fund our strategic initiatives, return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders and pay off our maturing debt.
 Now let's turn to fiscal '12 guidance. And with our first quarter on track, our outlook is unchanged. Our diluted EPS guidance remains at a range of $2.74 to $2.84. Our assumptions behind this guidance also remain the same and include flat-to-modest revenue growth, operating margin expansion in the high single-digit to low double-digit basis point range and free cash flow in the $700 million to $800 million range. Additionally, we continue to expect to spend approximately $400 million for share repurchases.
 So before I turn it back to Barbara, let me reiterate that 3 months into the year, we are performing well in our key areas of the business. And despite some tough comparisons ahead in the next couple of quarters, we are well-positioned to meet our financial targets for all of fiscal '12.
 Now here's Barbara for Q&A. 
Barbara Brungess: Thank you, Mike. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Cara. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci. 
Thomas Gallucci: Steve, I think you touched on in your prepared remarks briefly, but I was wondering if you could sort of expand a little bit. The competitive landscape obviously has got a lot of attention in the investment community lately, whether it's because of the VA or the impact of the various M&A activity out there potentially. What are you expecting in terms of contract churn over the next year? Similar to the last year? If it's higher, is it because of certain unique reasons? Or do you see sort of the potential for more churn out there because of other types of reasons and maybe decisions that specific customers may be making? 
Steven Collis: I think that these are really 2 or 3 really isolated events. I mean the VA comes up every 8 years. It's not a surprise to anyone that it comes up in this particular time frame. And obviously, we've gone to great lengths to point out that the industry is a lot different than it was in 2003. And we bid that as you would expect us to bid a large contract. And then, of course, there's been a couple of big M&A deals, which one in particular was not at all expected, but we expect to participate in that. Our focus has been on servicing the companies that we do service to the best of our abilities. And I think we do a great job for them. And we expect that will be a part of any discussion going forward with those businesses. So just to sum it up, the competitive environment remains very similar to how it's been in the past. And we don't have a particular large amount of contracts coming up in the next couple of quarters. I mean, Mike, anything to add? 
Michael Dicandilo: No, Steve. I think you said it well. The atmosphere is always competitive but stable as you mentioned. 
Thomas Gallucci: Okay, great. And then now just on the follow up there, maybe a smaller topic but there's been some activity around generic Lovenox today. Just curious if you could frame that drug for us and the potential impact, roughly speaking, if there were more supply on the market. 
Steven Collis: Well, Tom, generic Lovenox, we have done very well with that. It's part of our pro-generics offering and we already have had expectations that there would be competition in the marketplace. And that's built into our expectations. 
Operator: The next question comes the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. 
Robert Jones: Just trying to get a better sense of some of the individual impacts in the quarter. First, I guess in the acquisition side, aside from the announced severance costs, was there an impact on operating expenses from the acquisitions in the quarter? And then I guess along those lines, if you could give us some color around how Lipitor and Zyprexa contributions ultimately shaped up relative to your expectations? 
Michael Dicandilo: Well, let me -- I'll start with the cost of the acquisitions. I think we highlighted on the face of the P&L that we had $3.6 million of transaction costs related to closing the deal that we did in this quarter, the TheraCom deal. In addition, we obviously have an ongoing operating cost from all 3 of the companies we've acquired in the last few months that are incremental to last year's first quarter. And as I mentioned, they're included in our normal SG&A. And if you took out the normal run -- the ongoing operating costs, our year-over-year SG&A would have been down. So I think that speaks well to the rest of our business and the continued impact of our productivity efforts throughout the company and our continued focus on keeping our costs down. 
Steven Collis: Yes. And on the 2 big generic launches in the quarter, I mean, we had said on our Investor Day which we really were into the very big one -- the prominent one, we were only about a week or so into it that conversion rates were slightly lower than expected, but it settled down around about that 70% level, which is a little bit less than you'd expect. But it's definitely trending in the right direction. And Zyprexa's right around where we expected it, around 80%. And we performed very much at expectations for both of them with the exception of the Lipitor, which we discussed at Investor Day, but which we now feel is back on track as we sit at the end of January. 
Robert Jones: Okay, got it. And just a follow-up, I guess around the buyback, it's $750 million left on the authorization and reiterating the $400 million that's stays in the guidance. I was wondering at what point in the year, what would trigger you to maybe look to upsize the buyback in fiscal '12? 
Michael Dicandilo: First off, let me just clarify, we've got $380 million remaining on our current authorization. And obviously, our guidance for the year is $400 million of share repurchases. And I think you can look back to our historical performance to understand how we might deploy additional capital for repurchases. If we don't make any other larger strategic moves, we certainly have the capacity to increase the share repurchase. And once again, we've shown that we would do that, similar to what we did last year if that's how the year progresses and we continue to meet our cash forecast. So we're in a very good position. 
Operator: The next question comes the line of Larry Marsh with Barclays Capital. 
Kipp Davis: This is actually Kipp Davis in for Larry. So this is just sort of a follow-up on Lipitor. So it sounds like you're communicating that it came a little bit slower initially than you would expect it in terms of generic conversion. Now you're sort of more comfortable with where it is. Just kind of curious after we think about Zyprexa, and of course, other generics that are going to come on line, how have your thoughts changed for the rest of the year? What do you think some of the key variables are with regard to whether it's manufacturer, strategies, et cetera, that might cause you to change your thoughts about the generic contributions throughout the year? 
Steven Collis: Yes, this is -- Lipitor was as we said a lot, is really a unique product. I mean, first of all, just the size of it, just the prominence of it. And we think that it's also uniquely a mail-ordered drug. So Pfizer was able to contract with large purchases of the product directly. We think that this is an unusual situation. We don't think it's been particularly successful. And we don't -- we have not changed any of our plans for any other generic launches this year. And as I said, we feel very reassured by the fact that the conversion rate is now approaching 70% and looks like it could go up from there. 
Kipp Davis: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up. This is also sort of around consolidation. How do we think about -- with a broadened specialty offering, how do we think about customer consolidation in the specialty space? And would we think that specialty would always be serviced as part of a larger PBM contract or would that sort of business potentially be carved out? How do we think about that sort of relationship there? I don't know if that's a question for James or any of you folks. 
Steven Collis: Well, you raise a good question. I understand -- I think I understand what you're getting at. First of all, let me distinguish that our Specialty Distribution business is really dealing with physicians who administer products in their office. And there's been numerous articles, there's no doubt that AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group is the leading company in that area. And we're very, very successful there. In our drug company, we do have, within our ultimate side segment, several large companies that are involved with specialty products more on the mail-order side and on the patient delivery side. And we definitely have expertise in servicing those customers. So overall, AmerisourceBergen really services a huge part of the specialty industry, and we expect that to continue. So I hope that's helpful. I think both aspects of the Specialty Distribution are important to our company, important to manufacturers and important to the patients. 
Operator: The next question comes the line of Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. 
Eric Coldwell: I realize that all but one of your major customers purchase generics through AmeriSource. But there have been rumblings in the market that perhaps 1 or 2 of the larger retail systems are looking at  internalizing generics, perhaps slowly but are testing the market there. Have you seen any shift in your customers' buying behavior around generics recently? Whether it be asking for greater discounts or looking to perhaps internalize some of the work? 
Steven Collis: No, I mean obviously, generics are becoming more and more important. They're a bigger part of the prescriptions that the patients get in the U.S. every day, and that's certainly what we expected. But we really haven't seen any different shifts. I mean, we believe that our ProGen formerly and our overall generic offering offers the best everyday value to our customers. And we continue to work very hard at keeping that to be the case. And I think our customers appreciate it, Eric. 
Eric Coldwell: That's great. Just one quick follow-up. Another healthcare distributor this morning highlighted that physician activity was slower than they expected. They saw less flu -- seasonal flu impact due to lower illness rates and the weather, obviously. I realize that's also a very small piece of your total business, but can you give us any comments on what you're seeing around primary care and the flu market, both for December quarter and where we are early this year? 
Steven Collis: The flu vaccine has become a very small part of our over $8 billion in revenues. The most activity actually takes place for flu vaccine in our fourth quarter of our fiscal year, so the September quarter last fiscal year. We have some modest activity in this quarter but it really is primarily now become that September quarter. Of course, our retailers are impacted by seasonal trends. If there's a lot of flu, a lot of cold, that does help patient traffic. But we really focus on overall top line growth, not as much on individual prescription trends at the retail level. So hopefully, that's helpful for you. Mark, anything to add? 
Michael Dicandilo: No, and they've been good, Eric. We're up year-over-year despite the completion of the Longs/CVS contract last quarter, which I think is an indication of strength in the top line force. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. 
Lisa Gill: Steve, you made a comment on the revenue line that you're seeing strength on the hospital side as well as in the independents. Can you maybe just talk about -- is this that you've picked up any incremental customers? Or is there some other reason why you're seeing increased strength in those customers? Because your revenue came in much better than we would've anticipated. 
Steven Collis: I think we had some mix. I mean, the big customers grew pretty well in the quarter. But our hospital business is -- we believe we have good market share there. And really nothing extraordinary that happened, I mean, just good solid demand for our products. 
Lisa Gill: What was -- did revenue come in where you were thinking? Or so do we have it wrong? Or is it just that this is what you were expecting based on what you've seen in your book and all of us got a little carried away on what our expectations were for the impact of generics? 
Steven Collis: Revenues came in very close to what we're expecting. I mean, maybe slightly ahead of expectations. But very close to what we were expecting. 
Lisa Gill: Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, as we think about the oncology offices and we think about reimbursement as well as some of the programs for example, that United is doing around bundling of services, et cetera, are you starting to see any change as we move into the next year? And we start thinking about planned design changes and changes with the managed care companies around how they pay for oncology. Has there been any noted change this year? 
Steven Collis: This discussion has been around for several years and I think it's just really -- it's why our offering is so important. I mean, you look at why we acquired IntrinsiQ and you look at the investments we make in our ION business, our physician services company. We really want to enhance the dialogue between managed care companies and our community oncologists then. Our strategy is not to be a principal in those negotiations, but really to assist our customers so they have the information available and they have the sort of data that managed care companies are looking at. And we think are definitely enhancing that dialogue. It's not -- we're stopping that trend. I think as we sit here today -- I was in D.C. last week and often obviously with some of our large oncology practices, people are starting to recognize us. It's very important to keep cancer care in the community setting, not only from a patient point of view, clinical point of view, but also from an economic point of view. And that's obviously a trend that AmerisourceBergen supports and a big part of what our Specialty Group practice -- is able to demonstrate everyday. 
Lisa Gill: So just to understand it, then you're not seeing anything as far as trends go -- and we think about how would it impact your revenue, you're not seeing any changes to utilization or the way that the product is delivered based on these discussions? 
Steven Collis: No. And again, we've had that SP formerly -- for over 6 years now. So I think our practitioners are used to it. Everything as we said in the release, everything went very well in our oncology business this quarter. 
Operator: The next question comes the line of A.J. Rice with Susquehanna. 
Albert Rice: I guess because there's so much focus on the VA contract, I'd love to get any perspective you'd be willing to offer on sort of the rebidding and the ask for additional information and say taking a second look, what does that imply about what they're trying to do there? And I guess, I'll ask you a similar question to the one I asked at the Investor Day. If you guys, with what you now know, if you were to be successful and get the contract, would you consider that to be something that would be additive to your results almost immediately? 
Michael Dicandilo: Yes, A.J., this is Mike. I'll give a go at it and I'll let Steve add any additional comments. But when we got the additional information from the VA, it essentially clarified that there is a small part of purchases approximately 3% that were off contract and clarified that fact and asked us to rebid based upon that new information. I would go back to what we said, when we bid this contract back in June, we considered that to be our last and final bid. We took it very seriously. We considered the new information. We made the appropriate modifications, but it did not change our bid material from what we had done at the end of June. Should we get the VA contract? Yes, we think it would add right away. I think our expectations, it's a several billion dollar contract. There's not many of those out there. And typically, the largest contracts in our industry get the best price. And I would expect this to be similar and have the appropriate contribution for a large contract. 
Albert Rice: Okay. Just maybe then a follow-up on the comments you made in the prepared remarks. I think, maybe Steve made this comment about outpatient in the drug corporation being particularly strong. And I just was wondering -- maybe there's a little more color on what was exactly going on there in your opinion. 
Steven Collis: I think, A.J., you talked about really our old site? That maybe my accent. That's really our nonhospital institutional business, our mail-order, skilled nursing facility, institutional pharmacy, et cetera. And we did have good revenue trends in that sector. And we have a couple of new customer wins there, particularly we've talked about the Humana contract where we had good revenue performance. 
Albert Rice: Okay. Yes, and I understood it was the alternate site. I guess, that's probably my lingo. I was just curious if it was -- if there was underlying pickup in trend or is it new business? So it sounds like it's mostly new business, maybe? 
Steven Collis: Yes. Yes, you could say new business. But just good high-growth sector. I mean, benefiting from favorable demographics. 
Operator: The next question comes the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. 
Charles Rhyee: I guess, one real quick follow-up about the VA here. Obviously, investors and analysts are all focused on this contract, but can you tell us essentially when you're in discussions with clients, I mean, is this something that ever comes up? Or is this something that people ever look at and refer to? 
Steven Collis: No, I think everyone understands that it's a very, very different contract. The way it works, it's very unique both as in the DOD and it doesn't really come up. 
Charles Rhyee: Okay, that's great. And then, Mike, maybe a question for you. And I guess this kind of gets back to your original comments about how you see Lipitor come on. When we look at the LIFO charge in the quarter, obviously down less than a year ago. Should we expect that to sort of increase as we see more of this -- the rate of adoption on like Lipitor and some of the other generics come on? Is that a good proxy then for us to think about how the pace of generics are coming onto the course of this fiscal year? 
Michael Dicandilo: Yes. The LIFO charge as expected, Charles, to be significantly below what it was last year and really 2 reasons. Last year was actually much higher than we expected because of how high the brand price appreciation was. And again our expectation is it's still going to be strong this year but may moderate a little bit versus last year on the brand side. But certainly, with all the new generic introductions and 34 launches, there's going to be a big impact on the generic price deflation this year from products coming off exclusivity. And that has led to lower overall expectation of what a LIFO charge is going to be. And that's really starting in the beginning of the year and will be pretty consistent the rest of the year as a lot of the launches are pretty well spaced throughout the year. And we'll continue to have launches next quarter and all the way through to the end of the year. 
Charles Rhyee: And so that sequential change, that's a good signal for us? And was this quarter sort of in line with what you had expected? 
Michael Dicandilo: Yes. Yes, very much in line. And again, it's a $15 million annual expectation. We're always a little bit higher in the second quarter because that's where a lot of the brand inflation occurs. But otherwise, very much as we expected. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. 
Ricky Goldwasser: So just as a thought to the last question but taking it from a revenue perspective, so you grew revenue at about 2.4% and you're guiding us for flat revenues. So should we assume that second half revenues might decline given the timing of drugs going off 180s that you just mentioned? 
Michael Dicandilo: Yes, some of that sequential change, Ricky, has to do obviously with our largest customer who only buys brand-name drugs from us and there's more products, though generic, their revs will moderate some over the rest of the year. 
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. So when we model, I just want to make sure that our model is kind of like accurate, should we assume kind of like a first half kind of like 2%? And then sort of like negative growth in the second half to get to kind of like flat year-over-year? Or is it going to be smoother than that? 
Michael Dicandilo: I think it's going to be a little bit smoother. 
Ricky Goldwasser: Okay. And then on the generic side, I know we talked a lot about that, but can you quantify kind of like the EPS impact for new generics? Is it back at this quarter? Just to give us a sense of how does it relate to kind of like this $0.05, $0.06 of benefit that you're seeing from Gemzar and Taxotere? 
Michael Dicandilo: Ricky, I don't think we went -- get into a quarter by quantification of the impact of the new generics. And obviously, what happened last year has an impact as well the year-over-year impact. I think again our guidance for the year's, we expect that the cumulative impact of the 34 launches will offset the decline on the specialty generics side. From a specialty generic perspective, we had about a $0.06 benefit in the first quarter of last year. And this year was pretty similar down about $0.005 or so. Those comparisons will get more difficult the next couple of quarters as they were very big quarters here for Specialty. But I think the beneficial impact of the oral solids will also increase in those next couple of quarters as well. So we really haven't changed our viewpoint on the year about the offset on the oral solid side to the headwind on the specialty generic side. 
Ricky Goldwasser: Directionally, will Lipitor and Zyprexa combine again directionally, no specific numbers higher or lower than that kind of like $0.05 to $0.06? 
Michael Dicandilo: Again, Ricky, I don't want to get into the quantification. I think we gave a pretty good view at Investor Day that the top 2 players were a significant part of the year, in the 40% range, I believe we gave. And I think that's the best quantification that we want to get into at this time. 
Operator: The next question goes to the line of George Hill with Citigroup. 
George Hill: Most of my questions have been answered. Mike, I just want to ask another guidance question directionally. I know that you guys don't like to give quarterly guidance but straight expectations for Q2 or for a big number. And as we think about the branded Lipitor to generic conversion, I guess, I'd ask 2 questions, one, do you expect the Pfizer retention rate to stay at the 30-ish percent range? Or how quickly do you guys think that'll continue to fall? And if it hovers at 30%, it would look like the most profitable period for generic Lipitor to kind of be that first month right after May when there's no limit on multisource introductions and the whack probably won't catch up with the falling rate at which you guys can acquire the price. I guess, is it your sense that we might be -- I guess, is the consensus maybe seem too ambitious for fiscal Q2? And maybe should be a little more optimistic on fiscal Q3? 
Michael Dicandilo: No, I'd say, again we do not -- let me make clear, we do not give quarterly guidance. And directionally, the March quarter has always been our strongest quarter because of the timing and the impact of manufacturer, our brand price increases and the impact that has on some of our fee-for-service agreements, that trend is -- continues to be our expectation this year. Certainly, the second quarter is a big quarter for the oral solid generics as well. Keep in mind, the first quarter, we only had a month of the Lipitor, 2 months of the Zyprexa generics. In the second quarter, we have a full quarter benefit from those plus some new introductions. So certainly, we think the year-over-year benefit from oral solids is going to increase in the next quarter from the first quarter. So the trending, I think is, again, very similar to where it's been historically. The second quarter continues to be our peak. The number of suppliers that come on board after the exclusionary period for Lipitor can impact our numbers somewhat. But again, we're expecting a handful of people there, and we're expecting a pretty significant price drop after exclusivity is over. As far as the 70:30, that's in line with our expectations. If it's a little bit more generic, it helps us. It helps us. But again, I think the historical trending, as far as quarterly progression is still intact, and as I've mentioned, we've got tough comparisons of 2 and 3 on the specialty side, but good performance on the oral solid side. And the fourth quarter continues to be our easiest comparison. 
George Hill: Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up to Tom's question that's actually where investors worry about clients' trend being unusually high given what's going on in the M&A space. A lot of the big clients tend to see their relationships with the wholesalers as pretty transactional with low switch in costs. What can AmeriSource do, I guess, to make these relationships more sticky? 
Steven Collis: Well, I think obviously, with the smaller customers, we have different services. But in the larger customers, I think we've proven time and again that our relationship to our largest customer is very valuable to them. We were happy to receive the VIP award the last 2 years in a row. And I think we can do different services especially around logistics, cash flow, joint negotiations, even look at some generic lines with large customers. I think there's lots of opportunities in the industry to work together. And then, of course, I just -- I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our specialty franchise, which I think is of great interest to almost anybody in the healthcare space. Specialty is really where the innovation, action's going to be in the years ahead. And definitely our expertise, our physician connectivity, our understanding of the trends there, some of the contracting we do with manufacturers is definitely of interest to all large participants from mail-order to retail to hospital, et cetera. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. 
Steven Valiquette: So just to confirm, it sounds like there's no change to the $0.14 to $0.15 EPS expected from the -- in fiscal '12 from the big specialty generics. And then, is the reintroduction of generic Oxaliplatin in August, does that account for any material portion of that? Or is that going to be basically a rounding error at the end of today within fiscal '12? 
Michael Dicandilo: It's included in the $0.14 to $0.15. But as you said, it's only a little bit more than a month of inclusion in our fiscal '12. But it is in there. 
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Matthew Coffina with Morningstar. 
Matthew Coffina: Two quick questions. So you said before that Medco is only about 5% of earnings. Maybe to help us get a better understanding of the flexibility in the cost structure here, what, from a specific standpoint -- what, from a practical standpoint, can you do in terms of reducing SG&A when you lose a large customer like that? 
Steven Collis: Well, I think you look at our year and we always do a good job. I think ABC's got a history of always continuing to look for new efficiencies. And we continue that trend I think I highlighted in my remarks. Medco is unusual because we really had very few sites, it's a concentrated delivery, they actually work primarily with our large greenfields, so highly automated facilities. So I think that, that's why we pointed to a 5% contribution that also did contemplate the operating expense increase. But in that particular case, it's unlikely we would shut down any distribution centers or anything like that because of the way the business is currently contracted for and operates. Want to say anything else, Mike? 
Michael Dicandilo: No, I think that's right. I mean, most of that impact is on the gross profit side. Our expense to serve is very low in that contract as it is with high-volume concentrated location type customers as Steve mentioned. 
Matthew Coffina: Okay, great. And how do we think about Express Scripts in there, a CuraScript subsidiary? And would that be seen as a competitor to you? And how do you think they'll be thinking about that? 
Steven Collis: Well, I think CuraScript does have the physician distribution business. They also have, I believe, a large amount of order specialty pharmacy business. But nothing extraordinary. We work with all channel participants. We do have some business relationships already with Express Scripts. And obviously, we think that there will be a subject for discussion should the merger be approved. 
Operator: There are no further questions. I turn the call back over to Barbara Brungess. 
Barbara Brungess: Thank you, Cara. And now, I think Steve would just like to make a few closing remarks. 
Steven Collis: Yes. Thank you, everyone, for your interest and for joining the call today. We -- Mark and Barbara and I certainly do enjoy the exchanges. Our take away message that you should all receive from ABC today is that we're off to a solid start with our results for this first quarter. And we are well-positioned to meet our objectives for the year. And we also hope to see you at one of the upcoming conferences that we'll be presenting at. Thanks for your attention. 
Barbara Brungess: Thanks, Steven. Before we go, I'll just highlight a couple of our upcoming events. On February 8, we'll be attending the UBS Healthcare Conference in New York. On February 28, we'll be attending the Citi Healthcare Conference, also in New York. And finally on March 14, we'll be attending the Barclays Healthcare Conference in Miami. So thank you, all, very much for joining us today.
