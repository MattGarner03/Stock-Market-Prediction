===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-02 11:00:00) =====
Kim Callahan: Good morning, and welcome to Camden Property Trust's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's event is being webcast through the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and a replay will be available shortly after the call ends. And please note, this event is being recorded. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2025 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. We would like to respect everyone's time and complete our call within one hour. So please limit your initial question to one, then rejoin the queue if you have a follow-up question or additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. The on-hold music for our call today featured the 1970s rock band Bad Company. This week, Bad Company was finally admitted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, filling one of the most glaring emissions from Rock Music Hall of Fame. Also, in April, Camden was once again named by FORTUNE magazine as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. This marks the 18th consecutive year Camden has achieved this honor. So this April was an excellent month for 100 great companies, but also an excellent month for one Bad Company. If FORTUNE magazine ever decides to select a best company to work for Hall of Fame, we suspect Camden would be a first ballot inductee. Thank you to our Camden team for your unwavering commitment to improving the lives of our teammates, our customers and our shareholders one experience at a time. We had a great first quarter and exceeded our operating expectations, beating our guidance by $0.04 per share. Clearly, in the last month, the operating outlook has become more complicated, but the good news is clear. New supply has peaked in our markets, and apartment absorption continues to be strong. In fact, new starts are at a 13-year low and are down 80% in Austin and between 65% and 80% in Houston, Denver, Charlotte, Raleigh, Atlanta, Nashville and Washington, D.C. Rent affordability continues to be a tailwind, with wage growth outpacing rent growth by over 300 basis points for the past 28 months. The premium to own versus rent continues to be at historically high levels, making apartment homes more affordable. Camden's Sunbelt markets continue to dominate job growth, population growth and growth in young adult households between 20 and 39 years old. Camden's Sunbelt markets are 50% to 60% less expensive for residents than high-cost coastal markets. Today's economic uncertainty is not new for us. We have positioned our company to do well in all market conditions with a strong balance sheet, a geographically diverse portfolio and a great team, where you are in the Sunbelt, because that's where the growth is. And the Sunbelt has historically weathered tougher economic conditions better and bounced back faster than other markets. People always need a place to live, and our Camden teams will welcome them home. Thank you, and Keith Oden is up next.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Operating conditions across our portfolio are playing out as we expected. In our market outlook on last year's call, we projected our top five markets for revenue growth this year would be Tampa, L.A./Orange County, San Diego Inland Empire, Washington, D.C. Metro and Houston. Not surprisingly, those were, in fact, the top five performers for the quarter, with same-property revenue growth ranging from 1.3% to 4.5% in those markets compared to our overall portfolio at 0.8%. Rental rates for the first quarter had effective new leases down 3.1% and renewals up 3.3% for a blended rate of negative 0.1%. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter and reflected a 100 basis point improvement from the negative 1.1% blended rate we reported in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our preliminary April results are also on track and showing improvement versus the first quarter of 2025. Occupancy for the first quarter showed slight improvement, averaging 95.4% versus 95.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we expect occupancy to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the year. Renewal offers from May, June and July were sent out with an average increase of 4.2%. Turnover rates across our portfolio remained very low, and our first quarter 2025 annualized net turnover rate of 31% was one of the lowest in our company's history. We attribute this in part due to continued low levels of move-outs for home purchases, which were 10.4% this quarter, along with high resident retention driven by the hard work, dedication and commitment of our team members in delivering exceptional service and support to our customers, as indicated by our customer sentiment score. Camden's customer sentiment score was 91.1 for the first quarter of 2025. This is the highest score we have ever received since we began measuring customer sentiment in 2014 and clearly demonstrates the appreciation and satisfaction of our residents and customers feel for Camden. And as Ric mentioned earlier, we are proud to have been recognized for the 18th consecutive year as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For by FORTUNE magazine, most recently ranking number 18. Thank you, team Camden, for your energy and commitment to maintaining a truly amazing work environment. We know that happy team members, along with happy residents and customers ultimately lead to happy shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's President and Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. I'll begin today with an update on our recent real estate and capital markets activities, then move on to our first quarter results and our guidance for second quarter and full-year 2025. We have been active this year on both the acquisition and development fronts, completing two acquisitions for a total of $199 million and commencing construction on one new development community with a total estimated cost of $184 million. Our acquisitions to date included Camden Leander, a newly constructed 352-unit suburban Austin community, and Camden West Nashville, a 435-unit community built in 2020. During the quarter, we also broke ground on Camden Nations, a 393-unit Nashville development community, which is expected to open for leasing in early 2028. These transactions enhance our presence in two of the fastest-growing high demand markets in the nation and will ultimately serve to double our presence in a dynamic Nashville market. We continue to make progress leasing up our three development communities which completed construction during 2024. Camden Woodmill Creek and Camden Long Meadow Farms, our single-family rental communities located in suburban Houston, along with Camden Durham, a traditional multifamily community located in the Raleigh-Durham market of North Carolina, and we expect to achieve stabilization at each of these communities later this year. In addition, we've recently began lease-up at Camden Village District, a 369-unit new development in Raleigh, which is currently 14% leased and 8% occupied. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we are still anticipating $750 million of both acquisitions and dispositions. While we did not complete any dispositions during the first quarter, we are actively marketing a few of our older, more capital-intensive assets for sale and anticipate some closings in either the second or third quarters of 2025. Our original guidance for development starts in 2025 was $175 million to $675 million. And to date, we have started $184 million. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may start additional projects later this year. Additionally, in the first quarter, we entered into a $600 million commercial paper program to supplement our existing line of credit. As our line of credit backstops this commercial paper program, we have not gained incremental borrowing capacity, but we have successfully added another financing vehicle which often produces lower interest rates. Turning to financial results. Last night, we reported core funds from operations for the first quarter of $189.8 million or $1.72 per share, $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance. $0.02 of this outperformance came from higher revenues resulting from the combination of lower-than-expected bad debt, higher occupancy and higher other income. $0.01 of the outperformance came from favorable timing of repair and maintenance and property tax refunds, partially offset by slightly higher utility expenses. The remainder of our outperformance came from lower-than-anticipated interest expense, along with the timing of fee income and overhead expenses. While we are pleased with our strong first quarter outperformance, at this point, we are not adjusting our full-year same-store guidance. However, we are increasing the midpoint of our full-year core FFO guidance by $0.03 per share from $6.75 to $6.78, primarily resulting from lower projected interest expense incurred through our new commercial paper program. Under this program, we are currently borrowing at rates approximately 50 basis points below those of our line of credit. We anticipate an average of $565 million outstanding under the commercial paper program for the remainder of the year at an average rate of 4.2%. We also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2025. We expect core FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.67 to $1.71, representing a $0.03 per share sequential decline in the midpoint, primarily resulting from an approximate $0.02 sequential decrease in same-store NOI as higher expected revenues during our peak leasing periods are offset by the seasonality of certain repair and maintenance expenses and the timing of our annual merit increases, a $0.02 increase in interest expense due to higher borrowings and a $0.01 increase in overhead costs due to timing of various public company fees. This $0.05 per share sequential decrease in core FFO is partially offset by $0.02 of additional earnings from our new developments and completed and pro forma net acquisitions. Non-core FFO adjustments for 2025 are still anticipated to be approximately $0.10 per share and are primarily legal expenses and expense transaction pursuit costs. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please go ahead.
Eric Wolfe: Hi. Thanks. You mentioned that you're maintaining your same-store guidance given the recent macro uncertainty. I'm just curious, if there wasn't that uncertainty, and we were more in like an environment like we were last year or maybe earlier this year when you gave guidance, would you have raised your same-store revenue? Would you've lowered same-store expense? Just trying to see like what – how the environment is impacting your guidance specifically. Thanks.
Ric Campo: Clearly, the environment has everyone's head spinning in America, maybe the world today. And I would say that definitely has that – the uncertainty is the kind of the watch word today. And if we had more certainty about what the summer was going to look like and what the end of the year was going to look like, we might have been more constructive on our guidance change. But that isn't where we are today. So we are going to be, I think, like most other folks, in a wait-and-see mode. We feel really good about where we are. We have seen really no cracks in the ice, if you want to call it that, for the business. Things are going along very well for our business. But on the other hand, when you have these wild gyrations in the market and uncertainty about jobs long-term, you have to be a little cautious.
Eric Wolfe: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jamie Feldman at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. Can you talk about which of your Sunbelt markets you're seeing quicker stabilization of deliveries where new leases could turn positive as we enter peak leasing? And then in the opposite side, where do you think you'll see the biggest drag, whether it's Austin, Nashville, Raleigh or some of the more pressured? But just trying to get an update on when things could turn positive across the more challenged markets. Thank you.
Ric Campo: Yes. So Nashville and Austin, clearly are going to continue to be challenged throughout 2025. The level of deliveries in both of those markets came down slightly this year, but not meaningful difference between 2024 and 2025 deliveries. The good news is they trail off pretty significantly towards the back half of 2025. So things should – I think there's a good chance for improvement in those two markets. And again, that's measured by the trade out on new leases at some point in 2025, hopefully, getting to closer to a positive number. So those two are clearly kind of in their own little category. The other markets that performed well for us in the first quarter are the markets that have had the better supply-demand ratios both last year and into this year, and they're going to – I think they'll continue to perform at the top of our portfolio, and that would be D.C. Metro, Houston, for sure, San Diego Inland Empire, and L.A./Orange County both had really good quarters for the first quarter. I would expect that those will – because they're responding to the better balance between supply and demand, I think they'll continue to lead the portfolio throughout 2025, and that's why those markets were all rated at the top of the pack in our annual scorecard that we provided in the first quarter.
Alex Jessett: I would add that Tampa and Orlando, Tampa is definitely going to be one of the markets that turns in terms of positive – positive new lease rate growth for sure. The other thing I would just add to this is that while Nashville and Austin are definitely going to be slower out, we think they're going to be – once they come out, they're going to be faster up. And that's why we bought a property in Austin, and we bought a property in Nashville and we started a development in Nashville. Those two markets, it's always interesting because they're definitely the whooping markets today for oversupply, but they're also the best growing markets we have in America from a job growth perspective and future prospects. So when they turn, they're going to turn hard, hard up and high to the right.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, along the same lines, do you have a sense of what you're expecting for new and renewal leases in the second quarter given some of these tightening up?
Alex Jessett: Yes. What I would tell you is, is that the blend for the second quarter for us should be sort of flat to positive 1%. So a good increase from the first quarter and in line with the positive view of how we're looking at everything right now.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Can you give your perspective on DC and DOGE? Are you seeing anything on the ground right now? And do you expect to at some point? And when might that be?
Ric Campo: We are seeing absolutely zero anecdotal information about DOGE and the negative effect that I think some people think it's going to have on the D.C. market. As a matter of fact, D.C. continues to be really good, high occupancy, very good new lease rate growth and renewal growth. The highest blended lease rates that we have in our system is in D.C. And when you look at – so it's sort of the – I think it's the same kind of – like the initial question I got about guidance, and that is that people's heads are spinning, right, but because of all the rhetoric and all the uncertainty out there. Yet on the ground, people are signing new leases at incredibly high rates relative to what they were. And our occupancies are really high, and we haven't had people coming in and say, "Oh my god, I've lost my job in the federal government, you need to let me off my lease." We just haven't seen that. When you look at – if you look at the employment data today, I thought it was really interesting. If you dig down into it, it was obviously a good print nationally. But when you look at the government side of the equation, I mean, the actual government, if you take the gross number was up 10,000. Now federal government ex-Postal was down 9,000, but state and local governments were up more than the federal government was down. And so you had an actual increase in government employment in April. So I think what's happening out there when you think about a low unemployment rate, so we have a 4.2% unemployment rate. If you look at the unemployment rate for people that are 25 or older with college educations or higher, the unemployment rate is 3.2%., D.C. has the highest percentage of college graduates, and most of our residents are high – or medium income, but they're definitely college students or college graduates, a lot of them. And so you have this situation where even with the noise from 9,000 federal government job losses, you still have so much tightness in the labor market relative to the people that are in our customer base that we just haven't seen a major impact. And unless you multiply those government job losses by five or 10 and maybe you start having 10x and maybe you start having some issues, but a lot of the folks that are losing their jobs are people that own homes and aren't living in apartments. The other part of the equation is 75% of our portfolio is outside the district, and we're in the suburbs. And so to me, there's a lot of discussion, a lot of noise, but absolutely zero evidence on the ground that it's having any kind of negative effect on our business at all.
Alex Jessett: I'd add some numbers around that. If you look at our effective blended rent increases for the DMV in the first quarter, it was up over 4%. If you look at signed blended leases, which is obviously a leading indicator of what the second quarter is going to look like, so signed blended leases for the first quarter was higher at 5%. And our occupancy in the DMV is the highest in our system at 97%. So very, very, very strong.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. So Ric, I guess I wanted to follow-up on your comment about the developments. And I know you're being a bit careful on the starts. But how are you underwriting construction costs today? And what are you sort of putting in for tariff impacts on that part of the development that's being impacted? And what adjustments, if any, are you making on kind of the rents and expense side of things? Thanks.
Ric Campo: Sure. In terms of cost, we're putting roughly 2% to 3% in costs related to tariffs. And the reason it's not more is that we've been to this movie before. Under the administration 1.0, there were tariffs. And there were issues, and COVID created a lot of interesting supply chain issues, as we all know. And so what a lot of folks have done, including the apartment industry and construction industry, is we have tried to get our supply chain more closer to our projects and a lot of effort has gone into getting supply chains that are not as vulnerable as Asian supply chains. And I would say that that's part of the reason why we're talking about 2% to 3%. On the other hand, if you think about margin compression on the construction – on contractors profit margins are coming in because if you think about the peak construction, we're 50 years peaks in new construction. And you look at the forward starts, and they're falling off the edge of the earth. And the builders out there that are subcontractors all see their business shrinking. So what they're doing is they're shrinking their margins to offset these costs. And keep in mind, when you're at a 50-year high on construction, the margins are wide because there's not enough people to go around from a business perspective. So there's a lot of room in the margin for people to bring that down and to offset these kind of costs. So I think that's the good news. The bad news, though, I think, is that we are worried that there are going to be certain components that might have supply chain challenges. And not just price, but just getting the product. And that's kind of like are the shelves going to be full of the things that you need? And if there's one component that's not available, that could slow your whole project down. And I think there's a little – there's definitely some risk in that for sure. In terms of how we're underwriting today, we're underwriting with a view that rents are going to be flat-ish for this year, and then they're going to start to rise next year at probably better than normal rates. And then within – in 2027-2028, we're going to have outsized revenue growth. So we're starting with current rates, and then we are putting in our models, the effect of what we think is going to be some of the best rental growth markets that we've seen since the end of the financial crisis, that maybe the COVID craziness that happened in 2022.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, guys. Good morning. Alex, maybe a question for you on just the FFO guide here. You gave a second quarter guide, we back into kind of full-year first half versus second half numbers of kind of [3.41-ish] for the midpoint of the first half, [3.37] in the back half of the year. So I know that market conditions are expected to improve as supply falls. You have some developments coming online, your borrowing costs are lower. And it's early in the year, but maybe you can help us understand if there's anything contemplated in the second half that we're not aware of? Because again, there seems to be some deceleration implied in the back half of the year based on this updated guide. Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yes, Haendel, absolutely. If you remember, we've got $750 million of acquisitions and $750 million of dispositions built into our math. And as I said on the last call, because the initial assets that we're going to be selling are older, more capital-intensive assets. They are going to be trading at a higher yield than our acquisitions. And so we're going to have some negative impact on that spread on an FFO basis in the latter part of 2025. But remember, that's on an FFO basis. On an AFFO basis, these assets will probably trade pretty much in line with one another. And then the second thing you have to remember is that as we're selling these older assets, although the yield is a little higher today, the newer assets that we're buying are going to grow at a faster pace. So the dilution that you're seeing or that we expect to see in the latter part of 2025 should be eliminated in pretty short order as we go into 2026 and 2027 and beyond. But that's what you're looking at.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you.
Alex Jessett: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good morning down there. Alex, a question for you on the commercial paper program. You're following a long list of other larger REITs that have entered this. And I always – whenever I speak to like unsecured – the unsecured mafia, I always hear some pushback on the CP program. So can you just elaborate a little bit more what the cost advantages versus line of credit, why you do it? Is there any impact from the – I mean, the unsecured community is a pretty powerful community. You want them on your good side. So is there a pricing impact to your bonds? Or like why is there all this commotion that I hear about?
Alex Jessett: So first of all, I absolutely love our unsecured community. So any of you that are out there listening, we love you guys. What I would tell you is those folks that generally were against it, a lot of them have changed their tune. There are a few that are vocal and that push back against it. But the real thing is that you have to be prudent in how you use it. And we're absolutely prudent how we use it. It is not in addition to your line of credit. As your line of credit backstops it, it is merely a substitute for your line of credit for short-term borrowings. A lot of the unsecured community gets worried that people will use short-term debt to fund long-term assets. It's absolutely not what we will do. It is just in lieu of our line of credit. The pricing differential is fairly significant, 50 basis points. Obviously, as you can see in our guidance increase, works out to be $0.03 per share for us in 2025. So that's why we do it. It's a large pricing increase, but we absolutely will use it in a prudent effective manner. There will be no impact to our bond pricing. As you pointed out, the largest REITs in the REIT universe to have a commercial paper program in place. And so this is not something that we think will cause us any disadvantages on the unsecured side.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Alex, we love you too. I was wondering on the April commentary of basically showing positive momentum versus the first quarter. I was wondering if you could provide that information on new leases as well? If we look at the CoStar data, it seems like April has kind of stalled out for you and some of your peers. I know that's not really apples-to-apples comparison necessarily, but I was wondering if you can comment if you've seen any softness on new leases in April?
Alex Jessett: No, we have not. Not at all. So I'm not sure about the data sources that – and what they're pulling, but we're not seeing that one bid. In fact, we are seeing the uptick that we would expect going from the first quarter to April.
John Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Rich Hightower of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Richard Hightower: Hi. Good morning, guys. So I was wondering if you could maybe give us a sense of your projections for A assets versus B assets kind of in the Sunbelt markets? And is there any difference in history if we go back and look at historical patterns? Because you've got sort of a different composition of the workforce, higher income, higher education, all that kind of stuff versus maybe where we stood 10, 20 years ago, just how those assets will perform?
Alex Jessett: Yes. I'll tell you one of the reasons why we always have a blend between Class A and Class B and a blend between urban and suburban as we know that those different classes behave differently at points in time. If you look at over the past four or five years, Class B suburban absolutely was outperforming. But a lot of that was a function of where the supply was. The supply was Class A urban assets. As we're working through the urban Class A supply, what we're actually seeing this year in actuals from the first quarter and what we have for the full-year is that Class A and urban assets are performing slightly better. Pretty close, but still slightly better on that side.
Richard Hightower: Okay. That's interesting. And then maybe just a follow-up. But on the $750 million of acquisitions and dispositions, I guess maybe on the disposition side. Just help us understand who the buyer pool is, cap rates, capital structures, just who's got the capacity to buy, who's lending against those assets? Is it a value-add type of plan generally? Just what's going on there?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. It's value-add. What's interesting, there are so many funds out there and a lot of funds that you've never even heard of that have a great deal of capacity. We do have deals in the marketplace. I'll tell you that folks that are showing up that are making strong bids are sort of more of the local operator, local shops with good sized funds, good operating histories. They are treating them as value-add opportunities. If you look at the spread differential on cap rates, as I said a little while ago, it's probably around 100 basis points on a pure FFO type yield differential between the acquisitions, but that's not what it is once you put real CapEx in because these are older assets, more capital-intensive assets. But there's a lot of folks out there with money, and they really do like this product type.
Ric Campo: Yes. Just to put a fine point on that. We have a property in Dallas that we're marketing in, and I think the number of offers, like 35 offers on it. And so it's a bite-sized kind of deal. So there's a lot of people who want to do these size kind of transactions. And they're right in the sweet spot of Freddie and Fannie financing. And there's really no limit on the financing side of the equation. Insurance companies, banks are still out there in the marketplace. So there's plenty of capital out there. And as to Alex's point, even the private capital is probably more aggressive today than the broader maybe pension capital because I think they're out there kind of nervous about the market the way most people are. But these private equity slash sort of private office or family office groups have been consistent buyers and have consistent capital over a long period of time.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jana Galan: Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate your comments on the renewals being sent out at about 4.2%. Can you remind us what the historical take rate is there, post negotiations?
Keith Oden: I'm sorry, did you say take rate?
Jana Galan: Yes, where they kind of settle out on the renewals?
Keith Oden: Yes. From the stated rate or what we go out at, there's usually about a 50 basis point decline to what leases get entered into. Our renewal rate is one of the highest that we've seen ever in our company's history. So it's pretty interesting that despite all of the – and maybe Ric's point about head's spinning, maybe part of the heads spinning is I think I'm just going to stay here where I'm comfortable and where I've been treated well and renew my lease and kind of think about it – reconsider that somewhere down the road. But our renewal rates were really high. And our take rate is about a 50 basis point spread.
Jana Galan: Thank you.
Alex Jessett: We're assuming that renewals in the second quarter are going to be up in the high 3% range. And so that's in line with what we're sending out and what we would expect to sign.
Jana Galan: Thank you.
Operator: Apologies. And our next question today comes from Adam Kramer of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Adam Kramer: Great. Thank you for the time here. I think on the last call, you guys talked about full-year blended lease growth between 1% and 2% with the new lease that's slightly negative and renewals in the high-3% range. And then I think you also kind of talked about the cadence of that over the course of the year. I'm wondering if there's any change to, I guess, number one, the full-year numbers, both the new and renewal? And also wondering, number two, if there's any change to kind of the cadence of new lease growth and kind of the max new lease growth that you expect at some point this year?
Alex Jessett: So first of all, you're exactly right. That's exactly what I said last quarter. And at this point in time, there is no change to our full-year assumptions nor any changes to the cadence of how we get there. And we still do believe that sometime in the third quarter is when you should see some positive – positivity on the new lease side.
Adam Kramer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wesley Golladay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. When you look at your acquisition pipeline, are you going to make a big push in Austin and Nashville this year? And are there any other markets you want to boost exposure to?
Ric Campo: Definitely, Austin and Nashville are on our radar screen big time, and primarily because of the – just the percentage of net operating income we have from those markets. We've stated we don't want markets to be over 10%, but we want them to get closer to that and Austin and Nashville are in that zone in terms of we need to increase our exposure there to get closer to those numbers. And there are other markets as well, like Raleigh, that we're looking at as well.
Alex Jessett: Yes. Certainly, Tampa is a market that's high on our list. Dallas is a market that's high in our list. Dallas will be a little bit of trading assets in and out. But really every single one of the markets that we operate in, with the exception, as we talked about last quarter being Houston and the DMV because our two largest markets. We're looking for quality real estate in all of those other markets, real estate where we think we can create value for our shareholders.
Wesley Golladay: Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Goldsmith at UBS. Please go ahead.
Ami Probandt: Hi. Thanks. This is Ami on for Michael. First, compliments on the music choice. And then I was wondering, as you're seeing a much better outlook for your markets as we head towards 2027, could you look to rebuild the land bank to be able to start more projects?
Ric Campo: Absolutely. We definitely – you're asking about rebuilding our development pipeline so that we can bring more projects on?
Ami Probandt: Yes, because you recently sold down the land bank a bit, and wondering if you'd look to rebuild?
Ric Campo: Absolutely. We are in the marketplace trying to rebuild the land bank. We are definitely a developer and have created significant value over the years through development, and we will continue to do that. Even though I will say it is much more difficult today to underwrite projects given cost and that rent growth has been flat for the last couple of years. So you definitely have to be very optimistic about the future, but also disciplined about what returns you're willing to take as well.
Ami Probandt: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi. On the SFR product, Woodmill Creek and Long Meadow Farms in suburban Houston, how is lease-up trending relative to expectations? And can you share what you're learning in terms of how residents are responding to the projects and maybe how you're driving traffic to these assets?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. And I talked about a little bit on the last call. This particular product type, we were warned when we got started that it's a very slow lease-up. It's just the demographic that generally moves into this product takes longer to make decisions. And they were right. So it has been a very slow lease-up. The good news is, is that we're almost across the finish line, and we'll get – we'll have both of them stabilized later on this year. Now the other good news about it is – and I talked about this last time as well – is that if it takes somebody this long to make a decision to move into a community, we think they're going to be sticky. We think it's going to take them quite some time to make a decision to leave the community. So all-in-all, we feel very good about the product. What we really need to see is how is it to operate once it becomes stabilized, if we can operate it efficiently like we think we can with nesting it with our existing traditional multifamily communities, then you're likely to see us do more of this. But at this point in time, probably the biggest lesson we learned is, yes, it does take a while to lease up, but feel very good about where we are with them.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Conor Peaks at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Conor Peaks: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Bad debt continued to improve this quarter at 60 basis points. So would you say you've reached a normalized level at this point? Or are you seeing further improvement or maybe upside pressures?
Alex Jessett: I would tell you that we are pretty close to reaching a normalized level. Keep in mind that normalized for us is 50 basis points. And so we're 60 basis points in the first quarter. So we're still 10 basis points high, but we've seen really significant improvements in the markets that were more problematic for us, primarily in California and in Southeast Florida. So I think we've got – hopefully, we've got another 10-plus basis points to go, but feel very, very good about where we are. We're certainly ahead of plan for the year. And a lot of this is tied to some of the technology initiatives that we've rolled out to make sure that we sort of close the front door on folks coming in on a fraudulent basis. And that technology is absolutely working. We can see it in our results, and we feel good about the progress.
Keith Oden: Yes, Conor, I just a point on that. I recall during the midst of the COVID mess when our bad debt expense went to levels that we thought we would never see. And we got a question on the conference call that someone asked, do you think that bad debt expense will ever get back to what it was pre-COVID? And my answer was, ever is a long time. And we probably will. We just couldn't see it at the time. But as Alex said, we're basically 10 points away from our 30-year average bad debt expense. So we're definitely trending in the right direction, and I think ever will come eventually.
Conor Peaks: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Alex Kim at Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alex Kim: Hey, guys. Congrats on the strong quarter. I just wanted to pull the thread a little on the transaction market. You quoted that Camden Leander was able to be acquired 15% below replacement costs previously. And that ability to buy replacement cost has been a boon thus far. I’m just curious, is that still the case in your markets? How long do you expect that to last, especially as forward outlook just grows more positive consistently?
Ric Campo: I think it's going to last for a while in Austin and Nashville because the markets are going to take longer to recover. And so there are folks who are just not going to buy there until they see more light at the end of the tunnel there. And I think the economic uncertainty has made people nervous, especially when you saw the technology shares collapsing as a result of tariffs and stuff like that. And Austin and Nashville are very high tech or medical kind of market. So I think you're going to still be able to buy properties below replacement costs in those markets. I think in other markets that are – that have the view that the market is going to – that rental rates are going to turn positive sooner rather than those other two markets are probably going to be a little less able to buy below replacement cost. But it's still – I still think there's a fair amount of uncertainty in the marketplace that's keeping a fair amount of institutional investors on the sidelines. I mean, when you have the volatility you do in the tenure, I mean that's – I know it's just makes people kind of wait, right? And that waiting is, I think, going to continue to keep prices in a reasonable level where we can buy below replacement cost. I think the – ultimately, the other sort of driver is how many properties are coming into the markets. And the banks that need to be paid off on merchant builders, banks are – have been very accommodative, over the last couple of years, and they see the light at the end of the tunnel as well, and they're going to start putting more pressure on people to sell or refinance in some fashion, and there are a lot of merchant builders out there that have to write checks to refinance, and they probably aren't going to want to do that, they're likely to sell. And so you should have more merchant builder product in the market as a result of that over the next 12 months. So with all that said, I think it's going to be a reasonable place to – a reasonable environment to acquire properties. And in some markets, you'll get big discounts like Austin and Nashville. In other markets, it's going to be closer to replacement costs or maybe a little slightly less, but not the 10% or 15% number that we've seen in Austin and Nashville.
Alex Kim: Got it. I appreciate the level of detail there.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Thank you for the follow-up. Two, a combo market question on Houston and L.A. Ric, obviously, oil back in the limelight. And so just curious, with the drop in oil prices, any ramifications down the Houston market? And out in L.A., with what's going on in Hollywood, the delayed reboot, how you're thinking about your Hollywood and Glendale assets?
Ric Campo: Sure, let's start with oil. Oil prices obviously are lower and they were lower for two reasons. One, people worried about the economy, but more importantly, the OPEC, probably more oil. And so what we hear from oil executives – and I was talking to some CEOs of oil companies here in the last week or so. And their view is that oil prices cannot stay at these levels very long for a couple of reasons. One is that the OPEC needs – even though they have a lower breakeven price for oil than the U.S. does, they need $70-plus oil to make their economies work. And so bringing the oil prices down, maybe for political reasons, is what they're doing now, but ultimately and probably fairly short-lived if the economy doesn't kind of – doesn't crash and you have a more accommodative economy. Most people think the oil prices are going to be 70 plus fairly quickly. On the other hand, the – when you think about Houston specifically, the price of oil has really not – unless it's like a massive decline because of COVID or something like that, it's really not changed the dynamic of the energy business because the energy business today has consolidated so much and has become more efficient and that it doesn't – that the price of oil doesn't really drive their business as much, especially the Big Oil. Chevron and Exxon, both announced earnings today. Chevron's wasn't as good as Exxon's, but both said that they're going forward with their projects, they're not changing their capital allocation strategies. They're not doing much other than just dealing with the current environment. Both companies have moved their headquarters, Exxon from Dallas to Houston, and Chevron last year moved their headquarters from the Bay Area to Houston. So we continue – Houston continues to get consolidation effect and the employment from moving those headquarters. And so I don't think that oil prices are going to be a big issue to Houston at all. In terms of L.A...
Keith Oden: Yes, Alex, the two properties you mentioned, Camden Hollywood and Glendale, they averaged – both averaged 96% occupied in the first quarter. They continue to have a really good – even recently in April, they're doing really well. They also are – we're down to probably a handful of holdover bad actors from the COVID experience. So we've almost – in a lot of cases, we turned over a pretty significant percentage of the tenancy in both of those communities. 96% occupied feels like a really good place to be versus our overall portfolio average of 95.4% occupied right now. So I think we're fine there. You're always going to have the – what's the next bullet in California from a regulatory standpoint. But actually, there's been some pretty interesting news from a positive sense on the regulatory zeal for jumping into regulatory regimes around rent control, et cetera, in the last six months in L.A. I hope it's a trend that continues.
Ric Campo: I'll just add one last thing on Houston that I wanted to mention. That is you probably saw the announcement that Apple is expanding a plant here in Houston. Apple and Foxconn just bought 175 acres adjacent to the existing manufacturing facility they have. So a lot of the discussion about onshoring or reshoring or whatever you want to call it is starting to take place. And places like Texas are drawing those companies here for all the reasons that – when you think about Houston, it gained – Houston gained 1.1 million people in the last 10 years. And it's a combination of domestic migration and international migration. We're projected to have 100,000 more people this year. So – and people go, well, that's changing. And I think that the answer is it's not really changing because the reason people come to this market is because we are low-cost, highly productive and low risk. And when you think about those – and we have energy, by the way. And when you think about data centers – when you – and data center production is exploding here locally. And so the reason data centers are coming to Texas is because we have the thing they need, which is power. We allow new power plants to be built. I'm trying to think when the last new power plant was built in California. So those – the reshoring, the data center activity, it's all continuing to produce lots of jobs and lots of growth for Houston. So I think that – and for Texas overall. So that really applies to all the Texas markets. But it's just a good story that continues to keep going.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Thanks for the follow-up. Another one on D.C. So last quarter, you formalized the plan to work down the exposure to both Houston and D.C. Obviously, you made the positive comments on the fundamentals in D.C. But are you planning to market assets in D.C. in the near term? Or does the uncertainty there push out your transactions and presumably, other transactions as well?
Ric Campo: I think it definitely makes sense to slow down on dispositions in D.C. in this current environment. Until you get more certainty about what's going on, I think investors are all kind of wait-and-see attitude, and that makes a lot of sense for us as well. And the Texas markets are buoyant and lots of excitement about expanding Texas exposure for investors. And so yes, we'll definitely – we're not going to sell because we said we will into a market that we maybe think is a little less constructive for sales.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next follow-up comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, there. Alex, I wanted to go back to the question asked earlier on kind of the first half versus second half in terms of FFO. But maybe from a blends perspective, you gave some updates on expectations for second quarter, and it still seems like the first half looks for blends is looking to be somewhat flattish. And so to get to your full-year guide, it implies a pretty meaningful ramp in the back half of the year to, I think, over 2%. So maybe help us understand kind of – what's driving that, your confidence threshold, and maybe any additional perspectives? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So once again, the blended trade out that I've got for the full-year is 1% to 2%. So clearly, there's a range and there's different ways we can get to the range. But one of the things that I do want to remind folks about is – at the – in February or March of last year, if you'll recall, we ran a special program to move all of our stale units. We had lower pricing when we went through that particular program. I will tell you that on average, most of those leases were signed were 16-month leases. And so 16-month leases clearly becomes helpful for us when you start to look out 16 months from March of last year. And so that certainly does help a lot in our comparison basis. But yes, we still feel very comfortable with the range of 1% to 2%, and we feel comfortable that there's a path that we can absolutely get there.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Jamie Feldman at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for the follow-up. Just quickly on your insurance renewal coming up in May. I'm just curious, what have you included in guidance for that? And how are things trending in those conversations?
Alex Jessett: So we actually renewed yesterday. I will tell you, as I've said many times, there's a very cyclical market when it comes to insurance. And a lot of insurance providers made a lot of money over the past several years. And insurance, as we know, is oftentimes a commodity and the best way in which insurance providers can get more businesses to drop rates. And that is exactly what we saw. So our total premiums were down a little bit over 10%. So feel very good about that. Now keep in mind that premiums are only one component of our total insurance costs. The second component is obviously losses. If you look at 2024, we had a very low year in terms of losses. We are not currently anticipating that 2025 is going to be as low as 2024 just because we're looking at historical trends. So when you put the very successful insurance renewal in light or you combine that with the idea that losses will likely be up from 2024, we are assuming that insurance for us for 2025 is going to be a flat number. That being said, we obviously did not change our full-year expense growth assumptions. We are anticipating that perhaps some of the savings that we're seeing on the insurance side may get eaten up with slightly higher R&M tied to some of the tariff activity. And we're also seeing a little bit of slightly higher utilities as well. But very, very good insurance renewal.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to [indiscernible].
Ric Campo: Okay. Great. Well, thank you for being on the call today, and we look forward to following up with you in the future and seeing you at future meetings. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-07 11:00:00) =====
Kim Callahan: Good morning, and welcome to Camden Property Trust's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. I'm Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman, and Alex Jessett, President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's event is being webcast through the investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and a replay will be available shortly after the call ends. Please note this event is being recorded. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2024 earnings release is available in the investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. We would like to respect everyone's time and complete our call within one hour. So please limit your initial question to one, then rejoin the queue if you have a follow-up question or additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. Good morning. The theme of our on-hold music this quarter is it's time to move on. The late great Tom Petty captured the current sentiment of team Camden in this verse. It's time to move on. It's time to get going. What lies ahead? I have no way of knowing. But under my feet, baby, grass is growing. It's time to move on. It's time to get going. After a few years waiting somewhat impatiently for better investment opportunities in our markets, we believe 2025 is the year for Camden to move on. In 2024, we saw multifamily deliveries reach a peak level, not seen in over forty years. We expect new supply pressure to lessen throughout 2025, setting the stage for a return to improved revenue and net operating income growth. As the headwinds in recent years turn into tailwinds in 2025 and beyond, there are attractive opportunities for us to continue development starts and to pursue acquisitions. The positive market backdrop positions Camden to begin executing our 2025 strategic plan. The plan follows a similar playbook that we executed after the great financial crisis where we acquired $2.7 billion in apartments with an average age of four years, developed $4.2 billion of apartments, and sold $3.8 billion of apartments with an average age of twenty-four years. Recycling capital in this way keeps our portfolio competitive, lowers capital expenses, and accelerates our return on invested capital, driving long-term core FFO growth. It's time to move on. Time to get going. I want to give a big shout-out to team Camden for their outstanding performance in 2024, exceeding our operating budgets by a wide margin despite record supply. Team Camden works smart, implementing new technologies that continue to improve customer experiences and reduce costs. Occupancy and rents in most Sunbelt markets have likely bottomed. Resident retention and customer sentiment remain high. The premium to own versus rent continues to be at historic levels, making apartment homes a more affordable and attractive option for consumers. Wage growth has outpaced rent growth for the past couple of years, strengthening our residents' financial prospects and improving rent-to-income ratios. Population growth to our Sunbelt markets continues to outpace the nation. Texas and Florida added over a million new residents in 2024, which was nearly one-third of the nation's population growth. Each new family needed a place to call home. Texas and Florida are projected again to lead the nation's population growth over the next five years. The states in which Camden operates capture 58.3% of the US population growth. This long-term megatrend continues to produce outsized housing demand in our markets. We know it's time to get going, but we will not move on from Camden's why, which as many of you know, is to improve the lives of our teammates, our customers, and our stakeholders one experience at a time. Keith Oden is up next.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Camden's same property revenue growth was 1.3% in 2024, with most of our markets achieving results within a hundred basis points of their original budgets. San Diego Inland Empire and Washington DC metro both outperformed our expectations, while Austin and Nashville came in slightly below budget. For 2025, we anticipate same property revenue growth of 1% with falling between 0 and 2%. Our top five markets should see revenue growth in the range of 2 to 2.5%, and these markets account for over 40% of our budgeted revenue. Several of these markets were top performers last year, including Southern California, Washington DC metro, and Houston, and we expect Tampa to join them as one of our top markets this year. Our next eight markets are budgeted for revenue growth between 0 and 1%, and they comprise over half of our 2025 budgeted revenue. These markets include Denver, Atlanta, Phoenix, Raleigh, Orlando, Southeast Florida, Dallas, and Charlotte. In our last two markets, Nashville and Austin, which represent 6% of Camden's revenues, these markets were down roughly 3% on revenues last year and are expected to remain challenged this year given the continued levels of new supply coming online. Expect them to decline another 0 to 3% this year, but we're cautiously optimistic that they will end 2025 in a better position than where they started. As many of you know, we have a tradition of assigning letter grades to forecast conditions in our markets at the beginning of each year and ranking our markets in order of their expected performance during 2025. We currently grade our overall portfolio as a B with a stable outlook, slightly better than our B rating with a moderating look last year. Our full report card is included as part of our earnings call slide deck, which is incorporated into this webcast and available on our website. The overall economy remains healthy, and we expect our Sunbelt-focused market footprint will allow us to outperform the US outlook. We expect to see continued in-migration into our markets and strong demand for apartment homes given the relative unaffordability of buying a single-family home. We reviewed supply forecasts from several third-party data providers, and their projections range from 160,000 to 230,000 completions across our fifteen markets over the course of 2025, compared with 230,000 to 280,000 apartments delivered in 2024. Despite the wide range of estimates, the unanimous conclusion from each firm was that supply in our markets peaked during 2024 and will be declining as we move through to 2025, setting up 2026 to be a below-average year for new supply. As a reminder, these supply estimates are totals for each of the MSAs, and not all of this new product will be competitive with our existing portfolio given various submarket locations and price points. As I mentioned earlier, we expect revenue growth in the range of 2 to 2.5% for our top five markets. Four of Camden's markets received a grade of A-minus with varying outlooks of improving, stable, or moderating. Tampa earns an A-minus with an improving outlook; it should be one of our best performers this year given strong occupancy levels, manageable supply, and a boost in demand that we saw during the fourth quarter of 2024. Our Southern California markets would be next, with both LA, Orange County, and San Diego Inland Empire expected to finish in the top three again as they did in 2024. Growth rates are expected to slow a bit during 2025, given slightly higher levels of supply and less of a tailwind from bad debt declining. Thus, they received stable to moderating outlooks. Washington DC Metro would also rank as an A-minus with a moderating outlook. Supply remains in check, particularly in our submarkets in Northern Virginia and Maryland, and we expect revenue growth to be slightly below the 3.7% achieved last year. Houston rounds out the top five with a B-plus rating and a stable outlook. Houston ranked number five for revenue growth in 2024, and this year should see more of the same with limited supply and healthy demand. Most of our eight markets received a B grade with one B-plus and two B-minus ratings. We're budgeting revenue growth of 0 to 1% in all eight. We rate Denver as a B-plus with a moderating outlook, expect their revenue growth to be closer to 1% this year versus 1.6% last year given moderating supply coupled with moderating job growth. Atlanta ranks as a B performer with an improving outlook, mainly due to the progress we've made in reducing bad debt and fraudulent activity. Phoenix and Raleigh are next, integrated B with stable outlooks, followed by Orlando and Southeast Florida with B's but moderating outlooks. Phoenix, Raleigh, and Orlando should all see slight declines in supply over the course of 2025, but pricing power in those markets will likely be limited for most of this year. Southeast Florida was one of our top performers in 2024, and we expect to see moderation this year from the above-average occupancy levels we achieved there last year. Dallas earns a B-minus with a stable outlook again this year, with minimal revenue growth expected in 2025. While Dallas still ranks as one of the nation's top metros for job growth, in-migration, and quality of life, the market is still working through much of the new supply that was delivered over the past year. And Charlotte is rated B-minus with a moderating outlook. The aggregate level of new supply coming online in the Charlotte MSA is still elevated this year, and we expect our main competition will continue to fall in the uptown south end submarket. And finally, Nashville and Austin received the same grades as last year with C and C-minus respectively. Both markets posted negative revenue growth in 2024, and we'll likely repeat that in 2025 as new supply continues to pose a challenge. Our outlook for Nashville is improving, particularly outside of the downtown CBD area, while Austin's outlook is stable. Now a few details on our fourth quarter 2024 operating results. Rental rates for the fourth quarter had signed new leases down 4.7% and renewals up 3.2% for a blended rate of negative 1.2%. Renewal offers for February through April were sent out on an average increase of 4%. And as expected, move-outs to purchase homes remained very low at 9.6% for both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year of 2024. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's President and Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we completed construction on Camden, Durham, a 420-unit, $145 million community located in the Raleigh, Durham market of North Carolina, which is now almost 80% leased. In Camden, Longmeadow Farms, a 188-unit, $72 million single-family rental community located in suburban Houston, which is now almost 55% leased. Additionally, we continue leasing at Camden Woodmill Creek, a 189-unit, $72 million single-family rental community also located in suburban Houston. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired for approximately $68 million Camden Leander, a newly constructed 352-unit suburban Austin community which is currently 85% occupied. This community was purchased at a stabilized yield of 5%. Turning to financial results. Last night, we reported core funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2024 of $190.4 million, or $1.73 per share, three cents ahead of the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance. This outperformance resulted from 0.5 cents in higher other income, and 2.5 cents in lower operating expenses driven entirely by lower than anticipated core property insurance claims and lower final tax valuations. In 2024, we delivered same-store revenue growth of 1.3%, expense growth of 1.8%, and NOI growth of 1.1%. Our 1.8% full-year expense growth was driven primarily by a decline of 0.2% and 16.9% on property taxes and insurance, respectively. You can refer to page 24 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2025 financial outlook. One of the key drivers of this year's guidance is an uptick in acquisitions and dispositions with a midpoint of $750 million anticipated for each. Operating a geographically diversified portfolio helps ensure consistent cash flow for our investors. Over the next few years, consistent with past messaging, we will seek greater market balance by reducing our exposure to our two largest markets, DC Metro and Houston, through a combination of select dispositions and growth in our other existing markets. With a target of no one market representing more than 10% of our net operating income, and no market representing less than 4% of our net operating income by the end of 2027. Additionally, we will dispose of older, more capital-intensive assets and redeploy the proceeds into newer, faster-growing communities. We execute this plan, dependent upon the location and age of the disposed communities, there may be 0 to 100 basis points negative FFO yield differential for these matching transactions. While we expect AFFO yields to be relatively flat, the end result will be a more geographically diverse, newer, and faster-growing portfolio. We expect our 2025 core FFO per share to be in the range of $6.60 to $6.90, with the midpoint of $6.75 representing a 10 cent per share decrease from our 2024 results. This decrease is anticipated to result primarily from an approximate 6 cent per share increase in core FFO related to the growth in operating income from our development, non-same store, and retail communities resulting primarily from the incremental contribution from our five development communities in lease-up during 2024 or 2025. A 1 cent per share net increase from the timing of our assumed $750 million of offsetting acquisitions and dispositions, for tax efficiency purposes and to facilitate reverse 1031 exchanges, we are anticipating completing the acquisitions on average two months before their matching disposition. This 7 cent cumulative increase in anticipated core FFO per share is offset by a 10 cent per share increase in interest expense, attributable to $250 million of higher average anticipated debt balances outstanding in 2025 as compared to 2024, and lower levels of capitalized interest as we complete certain development communities. The higher debt balances result in part from the timing of our acquisition and disposition. For 2025, we are anticipating $485 million on average outstanding under our line of credit, with an average rate of approximately 4.9%. A 4 cent per share decrease in interest and other income due to minimal cash balances in 2025, and an approximate 3 cent per share decrease in core FFO resulting primarily from the combination of higher general and administrative, and property management expenses. At the midpoint, we are expecting flat same-store net operating income, revenue growth of 1%, and expense growth of 3%. Each 1% increase in same-store NOI is approximately 9 cents per share in core FFO. Our 2025 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 1% is based upon a flat earn-in at the end of 2024 and an effectively flat loss to lease. We expect a 1.4% increase in market rental rates from December 31, 2024, to December 31, 2025. Recognizing half of this annual market rental rate increase results in a budgeted 70 basis point increase in 2025 net market rent. We are assuming occupancy averages 95.4% in 2025, a 20 basis point annual improvement, and then bad debt averages 70 basis points in 2025, a 10 basis point annual improvement. When combining our 70 basis point increase in net market rents, with our 20 basis point increase in occupancy, and our 10 basis point decline in bad debt, we are budgeting 2025 rental income growth of 1%. Rental income encompasses approximately 90% of our total rental revenues. The remaining 10% of our property revenues is primarily comprised of utility rebilling and other fees and is anticipated to grow at a similar level as our rental income. Our 2025 same-store expense growth midpoint of 3% does not contain any significant category outliers. Page 24 of our supplemental package also details other guidance assumptions, including the plan for up to $675 million of development starts, spread throughout the year, and approximately $285 million of total 2025 development spend. Non-core FFO adjustments for the year are anticipated to be approximately 10 cents per share and are primarily legal expenses and expense transaction pursuit costs. We expect core FFO per share for the first quarter of 2025 to be within the range of $1.66 to $1.70. The midpoint of $1.68 represents a 5 cent per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2024, which is primarily the result of an approximate 4 cent per share sequential decline in same-store NOI, driven by an increase in sequential same-store expenses, resulting from the timing of quarterly tax refunds, the reset of our annual property tax accrual on January the first of each year, and other expense increases primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends including the timing of on-site salary increases. And an approximate 1.5 cent per share increase in interest expense from our higher debt balances resulting in part from our actual and anticipated first-quarter acquisitions. This 5.5 cent per share cumulative decrease in quarterly sequential core FFO is partially offset by an approximate half-cent per share increase in core FFO related to our first-quarter acquisition activity. We are anticipating blended lease trade-outs for the first quarter to be relatively flat. At year-end, approximately 80% of our debt was fixed rate, we had less than $200 million outstanding on our $1.2 billion credit facility, no maturities over the next twelve months, and less than $250 million left to fund under our existing development pipeline. Our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt to EBITDA at 3.8 times. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I was just hoping you could provide some more color on your blend assumptions. Can you talk about what you're thinking in a new and renewal lease growth throughout the year? And how do you think it trends, you know, first quarter through fourth quarter?
Alex Jessett: Sure. Absolutely. So the way I would look at it for the full year is we're anticipating somewhere between 1 to 2% on a blend. And if you look at new leases, new leases will be slightly negative for the full year. And renewals will probably be in the high 3% range. If I look at how that progresses throughout the year, obviously, we are very optimistic about the way 2025 is gonna unfold, in particular with the absorption of the new supply. And so we're anticipating that by the time we get to the third quarter, this is when we'll start to see positive new leases. And then it'll continue from that point on.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Are you seeing signs right now of the impact of supply fading on the ground? And if so, what are those signs?
Alex Jessett: Alright. So we absolutely are.
Keith Oden: Alright. Go ahead. Go ahead, Alex.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. We absolutely are. And the largest indicator that we're looking at is the new signed new lease improvement throughout the fourth quarter. And although we are not gonna give quarterly, excuse me, monthly new lease and renewal data, I will tell you that we're very encouraged by what we're seeing so far in January in terms of signed new lease agreements.
Operator: Your next question today will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Hi. Thanks. This is Sanket on for Steve. I had a question around transaction guidance. So after a muted couple of years from the transaction market, it seems like things are opening up and you're guiding to $750 million of acquisition and dispositions. Can you help us provide more color on this in terms of timing, cap rate, other types of buyers and seller pools, are seeing in the market today?
Ric Campo: Sure. So when you think about the last couple of years, it's been a very muted sales transaction market, and what's happened primarily is that buyers and sellers have been sort of at odds. Right? Sellers want high prices, buyers don't want to pay high prices. And so that's created a standoff between our sellers. So transaction volume has been significantly lower in the last couple of years. But I think what's happened now is that with rates continuing to be higher for longer, it sort of put pressure on the sellers and then also on the buyer side, you have a pretty constructive view of the future. Going to be a better year than 2024 from an accelerating growth perspective. And then in 2026, 2027, you're gonna have some pretty outsized rent increases. So what that's allowed buyers to do is to increase their pro forma rent growth and feel pretty confident about that so that they could actually pay maybe a higher price than they thought before because the inflection point of positive, you know, second derivatives on rental rates is gonna happen sometime during 2025. So what that's led to then is sort of a closing of the gap if you want to call it that, between the buyers and the sellers. From our perspective, since we're going to be recycling capital, we were gonna be buying and then as Alex pointed out earlier, we're gonna be selling to fund those acquisitions and as we did, you know, in our last, you know, big acquisition slash development disposition cycle, we thought we think that this next couple of years is gonna be pretty much like it was sort of after the great financial crisis and where you have a lot of transactions that have to move and you're gonna have a lot of activity and I think that it sets up really well for us to recycle capital into getting more aggressive on the acquisition side and the development side going forward.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you. Rick, I'll ask a follow-up. To that point. I mean, post-World Financial Crisis, there was a lot of distress and, you know, as of today, I'd say we're hearing mixed things or not really hearing distress. Or what do you I guess, what do you see and hear that gives you confidence that there will be similar distress that Camden can take advantage of? Thank you.
Ric Campo: Sure. Well, when you go back to the financial crisis, there was moderate distress, but it was primarily in '08, maybe '09, and '10. After that, there's really no distress. I mean, if you think about what happened, you know, the Fed took interest rates to zero, and the FDIC and the Federal Reserve propped up the banks by saying they didn't have to mark to market construction loans. And so that eliminated, you know, a lot of the distress that people thought was gonna happen after the great financial crisis. And today, the difference today during the GFC was that, as a result of the GFC, leverage is just overleveraging was just not part of the equation today. And banks have significantly decreased their commercial real estate exposure, and they've also diversified their commercial real estate exposure. So banks are stronger, borrowers are stronger, and you're in a situation where there's no real pressure on borrowers or the banks to force people to sell. And that, of course, is what creates, you know, the stress. Now there's clearly distress in the sort of C and D part of the market, you know, where you had syndicators, you know, raising money online and through GoFundMe pages, we're buying pretty low-quality properties and leveraging them up, and there's been some significant, you know, stories about that kind of distress, but not in the institutional investor quality space. I mean, today, investors are, you know, the sellers today are not financially stressed, so I don't think we're gonna get quote-unquote distressed out there. What we're gonna do is general pricing that we had during the peak. Right? Cap rates were in the threes, cap rates are gonna be four and a half to five. And, with a better growth prospect, you know, in your pro formas going forward so that you can get your IRRs, you know, up into the sevens on an unlevered basis. So it's a little different today. So I don't think that we're gonna have distress in the market and buy all these great deals. On the other hand, the deals are good. When you look at our Camden Leander transaction, it's a project and lease-up in Austin, a very complicated market. Obviously, Austin has more supply than most. We're buying the property at 15% below replacement cost. Rents are depressed. And once the supply gets worked out in Austin over the next year, you know, or so, you're gonna see outsized growth in Austin. If you look at Austin, in terms of its population growth, it's, like, number one in America on a percentage basis for population growth. So Austin's not Austin's gonna be great. 2026, 2027, and 2028. So we're able to buy below replacement costs, like they'll build there, but buy build when I can buy it below replacement cost and then be positioned in the marketplace to have outsized growth to drive that cap rate, you know, up into a really good number.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, guys. Good morning. So if somebody could walk us through the quarter a bit and give us some color on how the portfolio performed in terms of new lease rate expectations. They seem to be a bit more resilient in the fourth quarter versus your peers. And with the stability in new lease rates, and improvement, you know, that in January occupancy, above 95%. It seemed like you could push rate a bit sooner this year than we might have previously expected. So maybe give us some color on, you know, how you think what new lease rates are embedded in the first quarter guidance provided, but broadly, you know, the sense of how much perhaps the improvement or stability you're seeing here can result in perhaps you perhaps seeing a bit more aggressive on that front. Thanks.
Keith Oden: Yeah. So, Haendel, we did have a, you know, our fourth quarter was actually a little bit better than we thought it would be, and it was pretty broad across all of our markets. And it's not, you know, in terms of expectations for next year, I think, Alex walked through those in his commentary regarding the, you know, what the full-year guidance is, etcetera. I think that the improvement that we're seeing is just stickiness around occupancy rates across our entire portfolio, which allows us to do, you know, and our pricing model to do what it does best, which is find strength and then price accordingly. So I think it's really good operating fundamentals had a good fourth quarter. As Alex mentioned, it's carried over. It looks like it's carried over into January. So, you know, last year, we had a we started out really strong in January. Good month. You know, that led into some optimism around here and maybe other places for, you know, what that foretold for maybe the first quarter full year. It turned out that wasn't really the case, and we had a kind of an air pocket in February of last year, and we don't think we're gonna see that this year. Don't anticipate that. But so far, so good. Good month in January for sure, and we expect that this is gonna, you know, it's gonna continue to improve throughout the year because every month that goes by, we're taking another big chunk out of the supply bubble that we've been fighting and continue to have in front of us, but I think things, you know, on the horizon back half of 2025 looks to be pretty constructive for us. But I think more importantly, when you get past the 2025's kind of a transition year between getting back to normal more normal supply-demand dynamics. But when you look out to 2026, and what's happening what's been happening on starts and what's likely to happen on completions in 2026 and 2027. I think we're set up for, you know, one of those two or three-year runs that are gonna be pretty impressive for the entire multifamily sector. I think, you know, where Camden's located in our markets, we're gonna benefit more than most from that.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please go ahead.
Eric Wolfe: Hey. Thanks. It seems like based on your interest expense guidance, you're front-loading the acquisitions. Can you just talk about the rationale around the strategy? And also, you mentioned, I think, zero to a hundred bits of potential gap dilution from this activity and that this transaction activity could last through 2027. So should we be building in our models, like, say, fifty bits of gap dilution on $750 million of transactions for the next couple of years, or is that sort of not what you meant by the sort of this continuing through 2027?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. So we'll hit both parts of it. Absolutely. The first thing is that we anticipate that we're gonna buy before we sell. And we're doing that for tax efficiency purposes. We'll do these in reverse 1031 exchanges. The second part that you have to look at is what we're looking at for 2025 is the dispositions that we will first complete will be our older, more capital-intensive assets. And so because of that, you're probably gonna see a larger spread between FFO on the assets we're buying and FFO on the assets we're selling. I think it's important to note that on an AFFO basis, that spread will be very tight. But on an FFO basis, it's gonna be a little bit wider. Call it around the hundred basis point range for what we're gonna look at for 2025. If you think about what happens as we go throughout 2026 and 2027 completing our plan, we're gonna get to a point in time where we're gonna be trading very comparable assets but just not in the geography where we want them. So for instance, we talked quite a bit about how we'll lower our exposure in DC and we'll lower our exposure in Houston. We're gonna sell a community in DC in 2026 and in 2027, I think likely that it will be a particular community that will probably trade at a pretty good cap rate, and we'll be trading that for a community in, you know, call it Nashville or call it Austin. They will also be trading at a comparable cap rate. So I don't think it's fair to take the dilution that you're seeing in 2025 and extrapolate that into 2026 and 2027.
Ric Campo: Yeah. The other thing I would add to this is that if you look at the last time we did this where we did $2.7 billion of acquisitions and $3.8 billion of dispositions. At that time, we were budgeting over a hundred basis point negative spread. Turned out to be flat. And so, you know, once the market starts getting attuned to higher revenue growth and higher NOI growth, those cap rates are gonna compress and older property cap rates are gonna converge to newer property cap rates. And then part of the challenge is that if you look at the or part of the part of the dilution issue, it's not that it's permanent dilution because of the spread but when you look at the Camden Leander transaction, it's 84% occupied. It's not finished. Right? It's not finished leasing or stabilized, so you're gonna have more dilution when we're buying, you know, properties that are not necessarily fully leased up yet. And so that's part of that equation. But I expect that the transaction market through the middle of the year will start gaining steam, which means that you'll have the $300 or $400 billion of capital that's still waiting in the wings entering the market. So cap rates, I think, are gonna be tighter and the spreads will be tighter, you know, towards the back half of the year. But we're gonna, you know, we have budgeted this hundred basis points, but I'm sure we'll do better.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Austin Werschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Werschmidt: Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. So keeping the conversation going on your portfolio management objectives, and, Alex, you hit on this with your comments about, you know, selling down some DC and Houston, which you guys have talked about. I guess, what's kind of the right exposure for those top markets? You know, are there any new markets that you could enter, you know, with this strategic plan? And then I guess just given the constructive outlook for fundamentals the next few years, what would it take for you to lean into your balance sheet capacity instead of kind of the tax-efficient paired trade strategy? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. So what I said on the call is that by the end of 2027, we do not want to have any one market that's over 10% of NOI. So if you think about it, there's only two markets that we have today that are over that, which is DC Metro and Houston. So that's where we'll be bringing that down. Additionally, it just doesn't make a ton of sense to us to have a market that has less than 4% of NOI. The only market that falls into that category today is Nashville. So we'll be bringing that up, and that'll obviously be one of our main target markets. When you think about leaning into our balance sheet, absolutely. The reason why we have a 3.8 times debt to EBITDA, which is number one in the multifamily sector, is because it gives us capacity and ability to take advantage of opportunities. If there are opportunities there where we can create some real value for our shareholders, and increase a little bit of leverage, but still stay below the five times level, and we can take advantage of your opportunities, we're gonna absolutely do that. So that's something that we're absolutely looking at. I think you're not gonna see that right now because right now what we're looking for is some more stability in the transaction market. And right now, there's just not a tremendous amount of opportunity. So the opportunities that are there, we will match fund with the positions in the near term. But as we go forward and execute the plan, you should see us buying and building more than we are selling.
Operator: And your next question today will come from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thanks. I want to ask about revenue-enhancing and repositioning CapEx, which you're looking to increase this year versus last year. Can you remind or update us on the typical return or rental uplift you get? What was the contribution to either blended rents or same-store revenue of $86 million last year?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. Well, first of all, this is the first question we've had on repositioning in about three years. So thank you, John, for bringing those back in. Our reposition program has been an absolutely tremendous success. We are generally getting somewhere around an 8 to 10% return on invested capital for what we're doing. And the way you should think about that is that generally equates to about $150 plus or minus per door in additional rent. When I look at the impact in 2024 from repositions, on an NOI basis, it was, you know, call it 10 to 15 basis points, which is certainly not nothing. I mean, certainly something that makes a ton of sense to us. But you have to really remember that the real reason why we do repositions is it refreshes our portfolio. If you think about the type of real estate that we build, on the exterior, it is absolutely timeless. But like everything else, kitchens and bathrooms are what really shows the age of a development. It shows the age of your house. And so if we can go in and we can refresh a kitchen and a bathroom and make it look brand new, and on the exterior, it looks brand new, it really does create a natural defense against the new supply that we see in the market. You think about a brand new asset has a much higher basis, and, of course, whoever owns that. We can have an asset directly next door or directly adjacent that looks brand new, has brand new kitchens and bathrooms, and because we have a lower basis, we can charge a lower rental rate, and it positions us incredibly well. So the reposition program is something that makes a ton of sense to us. Something that you're gonna see us do quite a bit. The other thing that I'd point out is that we're also looking at repurposing some of our real estate. And what that means is looking at space that we have at a community, call it a basketball court, an indoor basketball court that nobody uses, etcetera, and turning that into additional units. And that makes a lot of sense to us as well.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Rich Hightower with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Hey. Good morning, everybody. I just want to get a sense of, I mean, I think it's been a pretty consistent theme this earnings season that there is a, you know, a pretty progressive step up in blended rents and ultimately rent growth in Sunbelt markets over the course of the year, but I'm trying to get a sense of the risk that all of us are wrong about the pace of supply dropping off over time and how much of that cushion is baked into current same-store guidance?
Ric Campo: Well, I think, you know, when you look at anyone's numbers, whether it be Wint or RealPage or, you know, the supply is baked. I mean, you know, for the next two years right now, you're not starting a bunch of units. I mean, most supply is down and markets are down or starts are down 50, 60%. You know? In a couple of markets, it's up a little like Phoenix, but it's all on the west side of Phoenix, and we happen to be on the east side of Phoenix, which is a big difference. And so I think I don't think there's a lot of risk on the supply being ratcheted up. I mean, when you look at the pressure on the developers today, when the ten-year is pushing four and a half, and short rates haven't dropped as much as people thought they would they dropped. Construction costs, while they're not up dramatically, they're also not down dramatically. There's still a lot of pressure on construction costs just to keep them. We've done we submit that they're up maybe one or two percent from last year, but that doesn't include tariff issues. We did an analysis on tariffs. On tariffs, we'll add another two to three percent in cost. Most of the products are bought. Lumber comes out of Canada. A lot of products from Mexico, electrical boxes, and things like that. So, you know, there's I would say that with the current cost structure, you have to really pro forma significant rent increases in 2026, 2027, 2028 in order to make a pro forma work. So I don't think that there's a big risk in a big, you know, upturn in development starts. Unless you have rates fall dramatically, construction costs fall dramatically, and that's just not happening. So I think there's pretty low risk from a supply perspective. I think the bigger risk probably is in what happens to the overall economy. I mean, if we have a recession in 2025, then I think all bets are off on how well the, you know, how well things progress, and that's that I don't think that's on people's radar screens, but I do think that's probably the bigger risk when you think about how 2025 could play out versus but it's not gonna be on the supply side. I mean, the supply is coming. We know it's coming, then it stops. And it's gonna take even if it even if you had a 50% increase in starts this year, wouldn't come into play until 2027 or 2028. It just takes that long to deliver. So I think we've got clear sailing on supply. At least through the end of 2027, end of 2028.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Amy Probandt with UBS. Please go ahead.
Amy Probandt: Hi. Thanks. So you discussed Tampa, LA, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Houston as the top market. Do you think that Camden's performance in these markets is representative of the overall market, or are there some Camden-specific attributes that are leading to stronger performance? And then specifically, on Tampa, you mentioned a boost in demand in the fourth quarter. So I'm wondering if that's hurricane-related. Thanks.
Keith Oden: So, yeah, on Tampa, it is hurricane-related for sure. And eventually, that will, you know, that will moderate over time. I mean, we've seen that happen in Houston with Harvey, etcetera. So that was definitely a hurricane-related thing. On the performance in those other markets, I think you look at, you know, look at the peer group, and then in those other markets, the biggest overlap that we have with the public market peer group is in Washington DC metro, and I think everybody had pretty constructive commentary around what's happening in Washington DC metro. Houston is the differentiator for us because we're the only public company that has any meaningful presence. And as Alex pointed out, it's 13%. It's our largest NOI concentration market that we have. Now we're committed to bringing that down to single digits over some period of time, but the reality is that Houston has just been a great performer for the last year and a half and again looks like it will be in 2025 as well, and that's a combination of relatively low supply. You just didn't have the waves of when all of that the current pipeline was being put in play, a couple of years ago, Houston sort of got missed because of a lot of other issues. But the energy sector is performing incredibly well, and I think all indications are that that's gonna continue to be supported and maybe even much more supported than it has been in the last four years. So those two markets for sure, I think, you know, anybody that has assets in those markets done pretty well on California. Southern California's story is pretty good as well, and a lot of that is driven by the cessation and working through all of the COVID-related initiatives to include, you know, coming down on bad debts, etcetera. So I think that that's also a pretty good story for anybody that owns assets in Southern California. So, you know, we tend to operate better in our markets on metrics, on occupancy, and NOI growth across the board. So there's probably some candidism just the way and the efficiency with which we operate our portfolio and our time in these markets and understanding on the helps. But, you know, all five of those markets, if you got assets in those markets, you're probably really happy right now. And looking forward to, you know, let's bring on 2025.
Ric Campo: I would brag a little bit more on Camden's execution ability. You don't become one of the one hundred best companies to work for on Fortune's list for seventeen years straight if you don't have a great team. And, you know, we all know the Super Bowl's coming up on Sunday. We know that it's not just one player, it's team, it's philosophy, it's energy, it's that synergy that brings the best out of the players, and in our case, our players are, you know, working every day and believing in that they need that they really want to take care of their customers, and that just adds value and customers feel it. And so when you have a really, you know, very great team, it's gonna have incrementally it's gonna benefit customers and lower turnover. And when you ask somebody to raise their rent, they're gonna say, yeah. Okay. I like this place, and you guys are fun. And great people. And so, sure, I'll pay more. But, that's, I think that's a big part of Camden. There's a question.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Hi, good morning guys. Regarding the $175 million to $675 million development start guidance, can you talk about where expected yields on any of these new starts are penciling today given construction costs and expected rents if you need to wait for anything to start those projects, and also, where is the expected yield there versus the expected yield on the three North Carolina assets you currently have under construction?
Ric Campo: Sure. Our projected yields given the current, you know, backdrop with cost and rental rate growth and what have you, is around 6%. And that's kind of where our starts, you know, our development numbers have been. Including the ones that were currently under construction. But I will tell you it's not easy to find a lot of developments that pencil to those numbers. And so that's why we haven't been able to lean in as much as we'd like to, but, you know, I think given the markets that we're in and where our developments are located, we should have access, you know, outsized rent growth that can get us to those numbers or better.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Adam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time. Wanted to ask about Washington DC a little bit and maybe a few questions in here. But I think just first, just maybe the latest on demand there. Obviously, a lot of headlines around what's happening with kind of federal workers and maybe, you know, smaller federal government. So maybe just what's happening from the demand side in the last couple of weeks there and maybe what your outlook is as maybe the composition of the government changes. And then just as the second part there, again, still in DC, what are you guys seeing in terms of cap rates or even you on a per square foot basis in terms of the transaction market in DC?
Ric Campo: Let me hit the current transaction market first. DC is a great transaction market. Cap rates are in the, depending on the property, in the mid-fours to, you know, high fours. Plus or minus. So there's still a decent demand there. And when you look at the fact that DC has been an outperformer from the revenue growth, last couple of years and will continue, we think, be in that kind of a category range, I think that transaction volume will be good. When you think about government changes, it's really interesting. Look at some of the single-family markets there. I mean, there's been a spike in prices for for-sale property there because of the transition, because of the new administration. There always tends to be more demand during transitions than if you just had an incumbent win. I'll let Keith talk more about the current demand. Go ahead, Keith.
Keith Oden: Yeah. I mean, you know, it's trying to figure out the cross-currents right now between, you know, kind of what's being talked about versus kind of thinking about what he thinks is actually gonna happen as Venice it's a crapshoot, I think. And, you know, for every time you hear, you know, government potential of government downsizing of people, I think, the latest number I heard was out of they offered everybody in the entire federal government, you know, a buyout, a package, and the last count of I think it was up to twenty thousand or twenty-five thousand people who said they're gonna sign up for that, which is a rounding error of the total federal workforce. So I think at the same time, that conversation's going on. You're having a it's another broader conversation about if you're a federal employee, that you're gonna have to come back to the office. And so I think that there's probably a knock-on effect there of DC proper, which frankly for us has been the weak link in our DC metro portfolio for the last two years. And it could very well be that as people have to return to work in an actual office, a preponderance and a big portion of which are in DC proper that it's gonna make more sense for them to potentially move back closer to or into DC proper. So I think there's a lot of cross-currents, I think there's a lot of talk. And I think you're probably never gonna go broke betting on the under on, you know, how many federal employees are actually going to go do something else regardless of who asked them to do so.
Alex Jessett: And I'll tell you, year to date, DC Metro has our highest increase in signed new lease rates.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Julian Bloyne with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Julian Bloyne: Yeah. Thank you. I just wanted to ask on the spread between the low end and the high end of development starts in 2025? Sort of what drives you to sort of trend closer to the low end versus the high end this year?
Ric Campo: It's just a matter of making sure that we hit what we believe would be reasonable spreads and a reasonable return. I mean, if one of the things that we've seen just take Nashville as an example, I mean, Nashville is so busy from a development perspective, costs were enough so dramatically, you couldn't get anybody to bid your jobs. We have seven deep of subcontractors bidding on our Nashville nation's property. So what happened then is that a, you had construction costs flattened maybe go down a little, and then b, on the other hand, you have a broader subbase which means that that tells me that once we execute contracts, we can probably get buyout of anywhere from two to three or four percent less when we buy out the contracts rather than just asking them to tell us what they would go for. So it's gonna be so towards the middle of the year, we will have a better view of when that second derivatives turn positive in a lot of these markets. On rental rates, and that would just give us more confidence to lean in. So it's really a decision about we need to get paid for development risk. So we need a hundred to a hundred and fifty basis points positive spread between what we can buy for and what we can build for. And then we have to have the confidence that the revenue growth is gonna be there in 2026 and 2027 and 2028. We'll get more confidence to that midyear. So that'll determine, you know, sort of whether we get to the high end of that range. One of the other, I think, opportunities that we could see basically as merchant builders who can't get their deals done and we can then step into those deals and get those done. We have historically done that a lot over the years, especially during transition times like we have now. And so we might be able to pick up some of those that can't get done either. So that could, you know, push us towards the high end of that range as well.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Connor Mitchell: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just going back to the broader transaction market, appreciate all the color so far. And it just seems like there's still a ton of money bidding on apartments inside financing costs and the expectations for rent growth to eventually overcome that obstacle. But you guys had talked about the maybe the increased pickup in the back half of the year. So I guess my question is just how much longer do you think the negative leverage will last, especially thinking about how much more there is to come in transactions in the back half, and I guess just a quick follow-up on that. Do you think that the market might be too aggressive on the rate of growth being underwritten for 2026 to 2027, or is it really that high of an expectation that justifies the negative leverage? Thanks.
Ric Campo: Well, that's what people are betting on. For sure is that 2026 and 2027 are gonna be outsized growth years. And, you know, if history is any indication of, you know, of what might be the future, that's exactly what's happened over the years. You have a downturn, have excess supply, you have a recession or what have you, and then what happens is you have a snapback. And, you know, usually, supply continues to be robust, but we know that supply is not gonna be robust. And if the job market just holds up, the economy holds up, and we get, you know, 2% GDP growth through one and a half to 2%, you can or develop buyers are gonna be underwriting, you know, significant rent growth in 2026 and 2027, 2028. Otherwise, they would never they can't make their numbers. Right? And especially when you look at where the prices are today. So I think what's gonna happen that will drive buyers and sellers closer together is the NOIs are gonna go up in some markets in 2025, and when you think about our top markets, our NOIs are growing. And so even if the cap rate stays the same, the cash flows are growing, and you have a trajectory that you can count on. And then, hopefully, you know, I think people are betting on even though rates are gonna be higher for longer, over a longer period, they believe that they're gonna come down some. So I think the combination of supply, the ability to drive your revenue growth and your NOI growth, gonna keep people in the belief that they will continue to buy even with negative leverage today. I think long term, if the NOI growth isn't there and if rates don't come down some, cap rates have to go up. Or you're gonna have a sale made between the buyers and the sellers. And so we'll see what happens, but right now, the market's pretty robust and what happens is really interesting. There was a transaction, for example, that we're bidding on in Nashville recently. And, you know, if you're trying to buy at a specific cap rate like we are, the seller basically just said, look. We hear your number, and we're gonna pull. And their view is that they're gonna get a higher price in the future. The cap rate will be the same perhaps, but their cash flow growth will be higher. And so I think there'll be an interesting it'll be very interesting to see what happens between now and mid-year to the end of the year. In 2025, but I think it's gonna be a more robust transaction market. I think all the signs are that that will get that positive second derivative on new rent growth, and that's going to create a lot of opportunity for sellers to come into the market and for buyers to buy.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Michael Lewis with Truist Security. Please go ahead.
Michael Lewis: Thank you. I wanted to come back to this decision to have no more than 10% of your portfolio in any market. So, you know, there's been this trend toward diversification in apartment REITs lately. As you know, a lot of that is coastal investors diversifying into more of your markets. Are there any markets that you just think are better? Right? They're just flat-out better apartment markets for the next ten or fifteen years or whatever it might be. Or is that not really the case? There's nothing structural or secular there. I'm just thinking about, you know, does this decision say more about Houston and DC or does it say more about, you know, a wide opportunity set across your markets and being a little bit difficult to distinguish?
Keith Oden: So I would say it's more about the opportunity set across all our markets. And when you say some markets are better, well, it depends on when. For example, three years ago, Houston would have been at the Houston and Washington DC were the problem children in Camden's portfolio. It's all anybody wanted to talk about, and it's a lot of what we talked about internally because those are our two largest markets, and they were underperforming and had been for about two, you know, two or three years straight. So fast forward, here we are today, Washington DC Metro and Houston are a top two performer or in the top five and probably slated to be, you know, in the top two or three for this year and probably next year as well. So if you'd ask that question, you know, or are some markets just better. Yeah. I mean, four years ago, all of them would have been better than Houston and DC Metro, and today, it's reversed. It's more about just having a balance among fifteen markets that we absolutely love. You know, every market that's in our portfolio has the characteristics that exemplify what we want to see. In-migration, job growth, you know, consistently performing on the ability to move rents over time and to operate done. Assets at an, you know, from an expense standpoint, at a level that allows us to grow cash flow. So it's not a statement anyway about DC and Houston. It's just a statement about we got great opportunity in other markets, growth opportunities in markets like Austin and Nashville where we're underweight. And it's just balancing those opportunities.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Nick Uhlico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Nick Uhlico: Hey. Good morning. This is Daniel from Paragon with Nick. Alex, I wanted to clarify your answer to Jamie's question at the beginning. You said new lease rates turning positive in Q3. Continuing from there. You know, does that mean it's gonna continue to improve on an absolute basis? Like, are you assuming, like, a normal seasonal pattern into the fourth quarter? Or is there a, you know, is there a comp benefit with being absorbed that would cause Q4 to look seasonally?
Alex Jessett: Right. So we're gonna return to seasonality, and at least that's what's in our budget. And so what that means is that you see the positive new lease rates in the third quarter and then in the fourth quarter, that's always our softest quarter. It's just there's just not a lot of people who want to move around the holiday season, etcetera. And that's usually when we have the least amount of pricing power. And so you should see it start to return to a more normal seasonal pattern at that point in time.
Operator: And your next question today will come from David Segall with GreenTree. Please go ahead.
David Segall: Hey. Thank you. I just wanted to drill down a bit more onto the proposed developments part development starts. Can you ballpark the rents or rent per unit you would need to achieve in Nashville and Denver to achieve the 6% yields?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. There's Alex. I don't. We'll have to get back to you with that.
David Segall: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Alex Kim with Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.
Alex Kim: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I always appreciate the sound choices leading up to the call as well.
Alex Jessett: No problem.
Alex Kim: I was wondering if you could talk about your leasing trend so far for the three communities in lease-up. And how that flows into the lease-up revenue line for the quarter and then more broadly for your 2025 view. Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So if you look at the communities that we have in lease-up, two of them are the single-family rental communities. And we've been very upfront that our single-family rental communities are the particular demographic that they're slowly leasing. They just are. It's that looks for that product type has a tendency to show up once, then they show up again, then they show up and they measure a bedroom and make sure that their furniture can fit, etcetera. And so it is a slower leasing. The good news is that we think they're gonna be really sticky. And we think once they're in, the turnover if it takes them that long to make a decision to move in, we think it'll take them equally as long to make a decision to move out. But that's what we've been seeing. When I look at Camden, Durham, which is our last, the third one that's in lease-up. During the fourth quarter, we had the type of leasing that we'd expect, which is slower. As I said, to one of the previous calls, the fourth quarter is always the slowest quarter and that's no different whether or not it's a new lease-up or an existing asset. That being said, if you look where they are, so Woodmill Creek is 89% occupied, Durham is 78% occupied, so both of those are getting very close to stabilization. And so, obviously, we should get some uptick in 2025 from those two as they stabilize. And then Longmeadow Farms is a little bit behind the other two just because it started after them. At 53% leased.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Well, I appreciate your time today, and we're glad to close out the earnings season for the large-cap multifamily. So we'll see you at the next conference or next roadshow.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Today's event is being webcast through the investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and a replay will be available shortly after the call ends. Please note this event is being recorded. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete third quarter 2024 earnings release is available in the investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. We would like to respect everyone's time and complete our call within one hour. So please limit your initial question to one, then rejoin the queue if you have a follow-up question or additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we would be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. The theme for our hold music today is coming together and getting along. With our national elections just four days away, and what looks like an even split among voters, a message of unity seems appropriate. All of our Camden associates, if you have not already done so, please use the time off Camden allows for you to get out and vote. And whether your preferred candidate wins or loses on Tuesday, please remember Tim McGraw's advice: "When the dreams you've been dreaming come to you, when the work you put in is realized, let yourself feel the pride, but always stay humble and kind." We had a good third quarter with earnings ahead of expectations, and the rest of the year is playing out as we had anticipated. Apartment absorption in our markets has been the best in twenty years, excluding 2021. Strong multifamily demand continues to be driven by strong job growth. Camden markets are growing faster than the U.S., with in-migration to Camden markets, and fewer consumers choosing homeownership and instead renting well-managed apartments from Camden. Apartment rents continue to be more affordable than buying a home. High prices for homes, mortgage rates, property taxes, and insurance continue to support rental demand, and this is not changing anytime soon. A recent Wall Street Journal article on October 27th titled "This Year's Housing Turnaround Ended Before It Started" reports that 2024 sales of existing homes are on track to be the worst year for housing since 1995. New apartment supply is at an all-time high, a fifty-year peak as we all know. And while absorption has been great, filling these apartments has limited meaningful rent growth in most of our markets. Trailing twelve-month starts are off thirty-five percent with monthly starts off forty-nine percent from the highs. This backdrop should put new multifamily starts in the mid two hundred thousand range next year. Witten Advisors projects rents bottoming out in 2024 and through the first half of 2025, and then starting to accelerate through 2026 and 2027. We look forward to sharing additional details on our strategic plan and future market concentration goals along with our 2025 guidance when we report fourth quarter and full results next year. I want to give a big shout-out to our Camden teams. Thank you for a great quarter and knowing that they are ready for a strong finish to the year. And thank you for improving the lives of our teammates, our residents, and our shareholders one experience at a time. Keith Oden is up next.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Our third quarter same property results had revenues in line with expectations, with slightly lower than anticipated operating expenses. Our top markets for same property revenue growth this quarter were the same as last quarter and included Southern California, Washington DC metro, Southeast Florida, Denver, and Houston. All with revenue growth above the portfolio average of six-tenths of a percent and ranging from up one to up five percent for the quarter. Rental rates for the third quarter showed signed new leases down 2.8% and renewals up 3.6%, for a blended rate of up one-tenth of a percent, with an average occupancy of 95.5%. Preliminary results for October reflect moderation in both new lease and renewal pricing and overall occupancy levels. Renewal offers for November and December were sent out with an average increase of 3.5%. Resident retention remains high, and turnover remains low, with less than ten percent of our third quarter move-outs attributed to home purchases. Net turnover for the third quarter of 2024 was 46% compared to 51% in the third quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, net turnover was 41% compared to 44% in 2023. I would also like to encourage all of Team Camden to do three things. Number one, get out there and vote. Number two, finish the year strong. Number three, always stay humble and kind. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's president and chief financial officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Recently, the Southeast United States experienced two hurricanes, Helene and Milton. And although our thoughts and prayers are with those affected, we are very thankful that our team members and residents were safe, and that we have only minor property damages reported. We issued a press release shortly after Hurricane Milton, with a preliminary assessment leading one of our analysts to ask if Camden communities are built like Fort Knox. To which we replied, that we attribute our minimal damage to quality construction, great preparation, and a healthy serving of luck. Quality construction really does matter. And we built over sixty percent of our Southeast portfolio. And great preparation matters, including making sure trees are appropriately trimmed, drains are clear, pools are drained, and roofs are strong. Solid vendor and supplier relationships to ensure mitigation is prepositioned, and great communication with our residents and staff to ensure the communities are storm-ready. So thank you, Camden team members, for doing such an amazing job to enable us to fare so well through the storms allowing us to continue to provide quality housing in the incredibly high demand high growth Southeast markets. Moving on to our development activities, in the second half of 2024, we commenced construction on approximately $320 million worth of new developments. We anticipate starting an additional $375 million of new developments in the early part of 2025, and we plan on starting our remaining owned land parcel which is a $300 million development in either late 2025 or early 2026. And finally, we have additional land parcels under contract which may lead to future starts in either 2025 or 2026. Turning to our financial results. For the third quarter, we reported core FFO of $1.71 per share, three cents ahead of the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance. This outperformance was driven in large part by one and a half cents per share and lower than anticipated operating expenses, resulting primarily from continued lower core insurance claims. Additionally, during the third quarter, we had one and a half cents per share of favorability resulting primarily from higher fee income, lower interest expense, and lower income tax expense. These favorable line items were driven by the combination of cost savings and additional fee income from our third-party construction business, higher interest income from our cash balances, lower line of credit interest expense, and lower franchise taxes in Tennessee resulting from recently enacted legislative changes to the applicable calculation. Property revenues for the quarter were in line with our expectations. Last night, we maintained the midpoint of our full-year same-store NOI guidance at 0.75%, but narrowed the ranges and slightly adjusted the components. We now anticipate full-year same-store revenue growth will be within the range of 1.1% to 1.5% with a midpoint of 1.3%. And full-year same-store expense growth will be within the range of 2.1% to 2.5% with a midpoint of 2.3%. Our twenty basis point reduction in full-year revenue guidance is nearly by slightly lower blended lease trade-out in line with typical seasonality. We are assuming fourth-quarter occupancy will be in the range of 95.2% to 95.4%, blended lease-outs will be slightly negative, and bad debt will be within the range of seventy-five to eighty-five basis points in line with the full year. Our fifty-five basis point reduction in full-year expense guidance is driven primarily by continued lower than anticipated insurance and property taxes. We are increasing the midpoint of our full-year core FFO from $6.79 to $6.81 which results entirely from the non-property components of our third-quarter output. We also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect core FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.68 to $1.72, representing a one-cent per share sequential decline at the midpoint. Primarily resulting from an approximate one-cent and higher property NOI resulting from two and a half cents in decreased revenue driven primarily by the typical seasonality of occupancy, offset entirely by three and a half cents in lower property expenses, resulting from typical seasonal declines. This one-cent per share increase in sequential property NOI is entirely offset by a combined one and a half cent per share decrease in interest and other income, as we are no longer in a net cash position and fee and asset management income due to the timing of our third-party construction activity. And an approximate half-cent per share increase in net interest expense driven by an approximate one-cent per share impact of no longer capitalizing interest on development sites that we have decided to not move forward with at the present time, offset by half a cent in lower interest rates on our floating rate debt. As of today, approximately eighty percent of our debt is fixed rate. We have less than $200 million outstanding on our $1.2 billion credit facility, only $65 million of maturities over the next twenty-four months, and less than $270 million left to fund under our existing development pipeline. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong, with net debt to EBITDA at 3.9 times. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, you may press star and two. We will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Today's first question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please go ahead.
Eric Wolfe: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. If you think about the four pre-development projects that you paused, how much would rents have needed to be up from current levels before those projects made sense? And then more generally, how much do you think rents need to rise relative to construction costs for development to be more economic?
Ric Campo: Well, let me just start out broadly first, then I'll ask the question about what rents tend to do because clearly what's happened in the development market today is that construction costs have not come down and rents have come down. Clearly, the supply that is coming into the market has had a muting effect on rents in all markets. Right? And so we, as part of our planning process for 2025 and 2026 capital deployment, review all of our properties and decide what we're going to start, what we're not going to start. And, you know, we've operated over the years with maybe this is the old CPA in me and Keith. And that is that, you know, we employ conservative financial policies, and when we reviewed those projects, the four projects that we wrote down on, it was about making sure that we focused on proper capital allocation. These properties today do not meet our investment criteria. Then more than that, these well, when you think about the four properties specifically, they're sort of three categories. One is California and we have been reducing our exposure in California and there's lots of California issues that we all talk about. The second issue would be Houston. And Houston, we talked for a long time about wanting to lower our exposure in Houston and also wanting to have less urban and more suburban exposure in Houston in the two projects in Houston. Are both urban projects. And we would much rather deploy capital in the suburbs rather than the urban core. And then the Atlanta project we have two projects that we did. We bought this land in the financial crisis, and the interesting thing is the land that we're holding on our books today when you look at the total purchase price for the land, in Atlanta is substantially less than what we have this one on our balance sheet for. It's pretty amazing. And in Atlanta, we just have a concentration issue in Buckhead. And have seven hundred plus units that are really high-end units with, you know, two high rises or three high rises and a mid-rise and a stick construction built. So we just don't want more exposure in Buckhead like that. And the highest and best use could be a condo or hotel or something which would actually benefit the neighborhood, including our properties as well. So, you know, it's really about capital allocation and we're disciplined in our capital allocation. We think 2026 is going to be a really interesting year. A couple of years, you have $650 billion worth of multifamily debt coming due. You have merchant builders who have prefs that are eating into their profits, banks who want their loans paid down, and so there'll be, I think, a very robust transaction market between, you know, over the next couple of years. We're going to take advantage of that to increase our market balance, try to move the portfolio from a more, be less urban and more suburban, and we just think that capital allocation makes sense rather than starting developments today.
Eric Wolfe: You could raise rents maybe, you know, when you look at long-term growth, when we do underwriting, it's about we look at a seven-year untrended IRR. And most of the time, we use anywhere from, you know, three, three and a half percent compounded growth rates in our rents to make those numbers. We don't want to have to take that number up much more than it's than the long-term average rent growth. To get these four developments to work in today's market, you probably have to have a hundred basis points growth of growth wide of that. And I guess if you look at the wide of average, so call it four and a half maybe plus or minus, when you look out at the projections out there, I mean, Witten and Associates has markets like most of our markets growing at four to six percent in 2026 and 2027. So theoretically, if you had to build you could, do a pro forma that showed outsized rent growth in this second, third, fourth, fifth years that could get those IRRs to work. The challenge that we have is we just don't want to push the edge of the envelope that hard today. We have to build and we would rather deploy the capital in markets they want to grow in and buy existing properties at below replacement cost that don't have the lease-up risk. That doesn't mean we're not going to be in the development business. Alex mentioned we're going to two properties in 2025, and we still have additional development pipeline coming. And I'll just put this big caveat on this. If you look at the last write-down that we did, we did a write-down of multiple properties right after the financial crisis because nothing underwrote after the financial crisis. Right? And so, interestingly enough, we never sold one of those land parcels, and we developed all of them. And today, if you take the written-down value for land at the time plus the land the book the value we had on the books, those properties are all probably worth fifty percent to seventy percent more today than the cost plus the write-offs that we did before. So at the end of the day, you know, it's really just about capital allocation and we want to allocate capital to some of our smaller markets and build up that operating income from there.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good morning down there. Rick, maybe just keeping with that merchant developer theme, you know, you guys for the past number of years and the industry overall has been waiting to capitalize on developers that have to sell, you know, the financial clock is ticking, they need to pay back, etcetera. And yet all these developers seem to get lifelines. The banks don't pressure them. The rents come back or something happens. So do you have confidence or, like, what gives you confidence that, you know, in the next few years, you'll see more opportunity from these sort of forced sales or are your comments more just in general that, hey, it's one area that we think that's going to provide opportunity rather than we think there's a huge opportunity from these merchant guys?
Ric Campo: Yeah, I don't know. I think the huge opportunity is just there's going to be more transaction volume. I don't think you're going to find distressed transactions. I mean, you could find distressed transactions at their properties that we don't want. I mean, a lot of the syndicators that thought, you know, really, really substandard properties or CND properties are definitely having serious trouble. You can go buy those at a discount, but I wouldn't want to take you on tour of those properties, and you wouldn't want a tour as well. And so the merchant builder model, you think about it, it's merchant builder. Right? You build, you lease up, you sell. You build, you lease up, you sell, and it's a cycle. And that's their profit motivation is to build and lease up and sell. And so in order to reload their pipeline in the future, and we know that with development starts going below two hundred thousand, that and I think the reason why multifamily is so desirable today on the private side of the ledger is because people can look at 2025 maybe end of 2025 and then 2026 and 2027 and see above-average rent growth, and so they're willing to buy today. So the merchant builders don't have a gun at their head to sell. When you have an eight percent pref eating into your profit, and every month you stay, and you haven't sold and paid those investors back, plus their pref, the developer profit goes down. So the developers are incented to maximize their profits, and they can't do that if they don't stop. Banks, on the other hand, if you look at 2023 and 2024, there was a lot of multifamily debt that came due, and banks kicked the can down the road. Banks let people if you had a maturing loan, they renewed the loan and moved it into the future under the theory that the Feds were going to cut rates and rates will come down, and therefore, you won't have to put as much equity in the project. So the $650 billion worth of debt that's coming due, a lot of that is from 2023 and 2024 where lenders moved the maturities into 2025 and 2026. And so the market is just a natural market that needs to move. Now on the acquisition side, people have been holding, you know, got tons of dry powder. People have been holding their powder waiting for the signs, right, that the fifty-year supply is going to start going down, and there'll be an inflection point where rents will have a positive second derivative and start rising again, and that I guess in the first if you look at sales in multifamily, assets in our markets, they're pretty much the same level they were in 2022. They're still below 2021, but the market is starting to thaw, and people are starting to come into the market. So I think there's a reason you're going to have you won't have a real distress scenario is there's just a massive wall of capital that needs to get deployed, and it's going to deploy into multifamily.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Austin Werschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Werschmidt: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Haven't really come up for a while about Houston. So just kind of revisiting the comment about reducing exposure to this market. I think it's around thirteen percent of NOI today. I guess how much of a decrease makes sense to you today when you kind of revisit, you know, strategically, you know, take a look at the portfolio and could dispositions from this market be a source of funds to redeploy into some of the investment opportunities you just spoke about to the earlier questions?
Ric Campo: Absolutely. We talked about wanting to lower exposure in DC and Houston. And Houston right now in DC are actually two of the best markets, which is kind of good for us. On the other hand, we've been painted with Houston when oil prices fall, you know, people think they can play that or investors either buy or sell Camden based on Texas and oil prices, and that's been a challenge over the years. And so clearly, we can grow in other markets. And we have a very low levered balance sheet, so we don't necessarily have to sell a lot to grow or to lower the exposure. But, you know, we've continued to look to trim our portfolio in Houston over a period of time, and we'll continue to do that. We'll sell, you know, assets that are growing slower than the rest of the portfolio, and I think when you think about market balance, anywhere from, you know, six to eight, nine percent of assets in a certain market is probably the right place to be. One of the things we also do is weight the weighting of where we want our markets, our balance to be based on population inventory in that market because you don't want to be too overexposed to that market. Houston, being a unit market and the fourth largest city in the country, you can have a little bit overexposure relative to, say, maybe a Tampa, which is much smaller.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Yeah. Thanks. Morning, everybody. You maintain leasing spreads higher through September than your Sunbelt peers, but then it seems like there was significant falloff for the October both effective leases and the signed leases. Was there a strategy change there moving towards occupancy? Was that more of an impact from supply? What would you attribute that to?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. What you saw in the third quarter was absolutely a drive more towards occupancy, and you're seeing that impact roll over into the fourth quarter. So that's exactly what it is.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I want to go back on the development. A couple of things. You know, I noticed that the projects that are currently on lease-up didn't seem to have a huge movement in percent lease from kind of mid-July to mid-October. So I was just wondering if you could comment on that. And then for the projects that it looks like you're going to start in the near future, the cost went up quite a bit. And I realized the Nashville project got more units, but I think the cost went up considerably versus the number of units. So can you maybe just talk about the cost creep and whether those yields really still hit your return thresholds?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So we'll talk about leasing first. So we've got the three developments that we have in lease-up. If you look at the two that are single-family rental communities, we've settled along those generally, lease-up slower than a typical multifamily and somewhere in the range of call it, ten to fifteen units a month, whereas with a typical multi, we'd say somewhere between twenty to thirty units a month. If you look at our Durham development, that one's actually leasing up twenty-five units a month. So that one's doing in line with what we would expect, if not even a little bit better. So we feel good with all of the leasing trends. As I said, they're really pretty much in line with what we had expected. When you think about the overall construction cost of our pipeline, as Rick said in the very beginning, we did a full analysis of all of our developments as we do on a periodic basis. We got the most up-to-date pricing that we've seen. And that is what's represented on the development pipeline page. I will tell you that at this point in time, we think that all of these yields work, and that's why we said that we anticipate starting one of the Nashville deals and the Denver deal in the first part of 2025 and why we anticipate starting the remaining Nashville deal in either late 2025 or early 2026. So we think all of those returns still work for us.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. So a question on cap rates and Rick, you mentioned the opportunity set with a debt coming due and merchant developers being stretched. In a few years. If there's a sort of a lack of transaction activity, but when we do see something, it's a five or lower perhaps, is that just a function of the moment something does hit, you know, there's a wave of capital and I use the example of senior housing, which, you know, the opportunity set in front of it right now is very positive, yet cap rates are seven and a half, eight percent. Your the opportunity set in front of multifamily and, at least, in your markets, may get positive soon, but, you know, for the time being is a bit you know, a little bit of a question. And yet cap rates are still in the five. Is it just there's just so many people that want so few deals? If that's kind of question number one. And then corollary to that is do cap rates need to adjust for you to be active on that opportunity set I described earlier? Or are you willing to, you know, sort of take a little bit of a hit upfront get a deal that will make sense for you two or three years later?
Ric Campo: Sure. So I think that multifamily has come to the forefront again of investment choice for institutional investors. At the beginning of the year, there are a lot of, you know, sort of surveys of what properties you want to invest in and multifamily was down on the list at the beginning of the year. And, you know, people wanted retail and they wanted industrial more than multifamily now. If you take third-quarter numbers, whether it be from Axiometrics, a lot of different groups that look at investor preference. Multifamily is now number one in terms of commercial real estate that people want to buy. It's multifamily, industrial, retail, and then office is a way distant fourth. And what's happened is that we've gotten closer to what people think is going to be an inflection point in the supply and demand equation. And when you think about, we're at a fifty-year high, in terms of deliveries. And yet, when you look at our markets, only two of our markets on a year-to-date basis have negative rent growth, and that's Austin and Nashville. And the reason Austin and Nashville definitely the two most overbuilt cities in America. And double the supply of all the rest of the markets. And all the rest of our markets are either flat or up even in spite of massive supply relative to historical norms. Right? So I think what's happened is investors are now private investors are pivoting towards multifamily, and exactly right. There's the developers out there who still have they don't have a gun at their head to sell. And so they believe also that as the supply picture continues to improve and continue and when you get that first sort of positive second derivative on revenues, that there's going to be a flood of buyers in the market. And the thing that's really interesting too is over the last sixty days, cap rates were in the fives. Then they went into the fours. The last few deals that we've looked at you've had multiple buyers, and the cap rates are mid-fours today. No. Five or five and a half. The reason for that is there's more buyers and sellers and, ultimately, the only way that you make a seven unlevered IRR, which is what people are trying to get, I think, generally, is you have to have outsized growth, you know, two, three years, four years out, which most people are pretty comfortable in underwriting. Now the last thirty days, has been a different animal. Right? You've had the ten-year go up fifty basis points or more in the last thirty days. And that changes the calculus a little bit so the question will be, will we, you know, in order to get your because you're back to negative leverage when you start with ten-year the way it is today. So the question will be, will the ten-year or will the treasury stabilize, and then how will people underwrite, and will that drive cap rates back to five? But from our perspective, as long as we can buy below replacement cost, in that four and a half to five zone and we believe that we can improve operations. We believe that we can catch that above-average long-term rental rate growth in 2026, 2027, 2028, will transaction in that environment we'll also sell properties to fund it and continue to sort of try to rebalance our portfolio where we want it. We'll spend a lot of time on that in the first quarter call because we're going to lay out kind of where we want our markets to be, but we have not done that yet exactly. So we'll get that to you all in the first quarter.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Mister St. Juste, is your line muted?
Ric Campo: Maybe come back to him.
Operator: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe one for Alex. You think about, you know, I think you and several of your peers the course of this year has been, you know, reducing your top-line outlook. By getting nice cost savings to keep your NOI outlook. So I guess two questions here. Number one, you know, can you talk about where you probably were most conservative to start the year and where you got the benefit throughout the year? And then secondly, as we think about 2025, I mean, do you think there's still enough juice in expense savings to have a similar outcome given there is a lot so much uncertainty along around top-line revenue, you know, where you could start the year on a conservative basis and get some upside?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. So, clearly, where we were the most conservative although I didn't think we were at the time, was insurance and taxes. Those have been the two really bright spots for us. We think that taxes for us for the full year for 2024 are going to be basically flat. And keep in mind that taxes make up about thirty-six percent of our total expenses. And when we started the year, I thought they were going to be up three percent. So, obviously, that was an incredibly pleasant surprise. And then on the insurance side, you know, keep in mind, insurance last year was up something like forty percent, and this year, it's going to be down something like ten percent. So you really have a couple of factors that drove that. Number one, we had a flat renewal, which was fantastic. But then number two is we were very, very proactive in addressing, sort of the root causes of some of our insurance claims and making sure that we were putting the appropriate R&M and CapEx in to make sure that we can minimize those risks on a go-forward basis, and we're absolutely getting the positive results from those actions in our insurance number today. If you're looking at 2025, you know, it's a little early. We're still in our budgeting process. What I would tell you is yeah. Getting another year of property taxes flat is probably unlikely. Over a long period of time, property taxes are generally up about three percent. Now the good news is that if you go back and you look at real values today and you compare them to two to three years ago, there's no doubt that real values are down. And so, hopefully, we still have a little more juice that we can squeeze out of that, and we'll fight as best we can against the taxing authorities. Then when it comes to insurance, you know, our policy renews at the beginning of May, and so we'll have to see what the rest of this year and the early part of next year does in terms of global insurance claims because this is the global market. And if we have light claims, then we may have another productive year on the insurance side. When I think about the rest of our expenses, the rest of our expenses, you know, it's a three percent business and I think that's what you'd expect to see.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. The next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: I'm afraid to talk.
Ric Campo: Maybe it's Halloween at Vancouver.
John Kim: Very scary. Go ahead. I wanted to follow-up on Austin's question on Houston. If you look on your presentation, page six, the migration trends for Houston look like it's going to accelerate quite a bit over the next couple of years. I'm wondering what's driving that. And also, I mean, we do have a chance that we'll have another Trump presidency. He's been very supportive of the oil and gas industry. Can you remind us if that's a positive for the Houston economy, and as either of those items come into fruition, the acceleration in migration or Trump winning the presidency, will that impact your decision to reduce your exposure to the market?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So, you know, Houston continues to be very much impacted by what goes on in the oil and gas industry. And higher oil prices historically have been great for Houston, lower oil prices have not been great. So, you know, anything that is good for the oil and gas business ends up being good for Houston and ends up being good for Houston real estate. So without prognosticating on outcomes of elections, our strategy to lower our exposure in Houston predated Trump's first election. So it's been out there for a long time. We've made some progress. Obviously, we had a fairly sizable acquisition that increased our exposure to Houston, but we're still committed to getting it more in line with our other markets. And, you know, for a long time, when we were in nine to ten markets, we talked about having a market balance that would be, you know, no double digits in any single market. I think you'll see that that's the direction that we're headed. Markets that we have that are double-digit concentration, it's Houston and Washington DC metro. And those obviously will be part of the rebalancing effort that we do.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Go ahead.
Amy Probandt: Hi. This is Amy with Michael. I was just curious. Was there anything that changed on the demand side that led to blended spreads in the third quarter and fourth quarter coming in really well below your prior expectations in the mid one percent range? And how should we be thinking about the supply-demand balance as we head into 2025?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. I don't know if there was anything significantly different. Certainly, we made a decision and we talked about it last quarter, the third quarter. We made a decision to push occupancy at the expense of rates as we said several times, we don't really tell our teams, this is the rate you must get or this is the occupancy you must get. We're really trying to maximize revenue. And so we feel really good about what we did in terms of maximizing revenue in the third quarter, which is why our third-quarter revenue results were in line with expectations. When you look at what we're going to see in the fourth quarter, clearly, when you do push occupancy, rates are going to come down a little bit, and that's what you're seeing rolling through the fourth-quarter numbers. But keep in mind, you know, we started the year thinking that at the midpoint, that revenue was going to be up one and a half percent and we're within twenty basis points of our initial guidance despite record levels of supply. So we feel very good about the way that we've worked through this year.
Keith Oden: And, Amy, to your question on 2025, if you look at Witten's numbers for employment growth across Camden's markets in 2024, he's got us at about four hundred and sixty thousand. I'm not sure what he modeled for the most recent report, but it probably wasn't ten grand. But in any case, he's got that number at about four hundred and forty thousand in job growth across Camden's markets in 2025. On the supply side, 2025 is going to look a lot like 2024 across most of Camden's markets in terms of new deliveries. So supply-demand dynamics in 2025 are going to look fairly similar to what they've been in 2024.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, guys. Sorry about that. Got disconnected. Hey. So I wanted to ask, I know you're not giving guidance at this point, but was hoping you could perhaps provide some color on some of the building blocks, like the estimated earning for next year, like some of your peers have provided, and maybe some thoughts on where you think you can get bad debt to overall by the end of next year and maybe some thoughts on Atlanta and LA specifically. Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So if our plan works out for the next two months of the year, our earn-in for 2025 should be, call it, flat to slightly positive. If you think about bad debt, you know, I think it's very reasonable to anticipate that debt's going to be back down to about fifty basis points by the end of 2025. If you think about our portfolio, in the whole once you strip out Atlanta and you strip out California, that's pretty much where we are. We're pretty much back to the fifty basis points. And the good news is that we can work through and we are working through Atlanta and LA County in particular because that's where most of the issues in California are. We've completely shut down the front door, so we know that we're not getting any bad actors in currently. And so we've got some folks that came in from fraud in the past. We're working them through the system. We feel pretty good that we're going to get this problem solved by the end of 2025.
Ric Campo: Keith, you want to take Atlanta and LA?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So LA is you got to kind of have it into the three communities that we have there in LA County, and they all have their challenges that started some of them started back in COVID, some of them continue today, but the biggest challenge that we continue to have in LA is just the time component between when somebody first becomes delinquent and when you can get it processed for them to move on, and it's still way too long. And so we do and we have seen improvement. And we hope to continue to see improvement both in LA and in Atlanta. In Atlanta, it's the same story. It's really a processing issue with regard to just how long it takes to get someone from delinquency through to a new home address. Again, both of them have made progress. There's room to go. I think Alex is right that in 2025, we'll work through that, those both LA and Atlanta will be able to get back to more of a normal cadence for processing evictions. And so I'm certainly hopeful that we can make good progress and as Alex mentioned, most of our other markets are back to regular order with regard to processing delinquencies.
Ric Campo: The issue in LA from a revenue perspective is LA has a demand problem, not a supply problem. And when you look at just to give just to put a couple of points in this, Houston has since February 2020, Houston added two hundred and sixty-eight thousand jobs and LA is down sixteen thousand jobs from that point in time. Dallas added four hundred and sixty-seven thousand jobs. San Francisco has lost nearly fifty thousand jobs. And so even though you have low supply in those markets and their revenues are growing a bit better than the supply markets, they're basically just growing because they went down so much to start with. Right? So they had a bigger hole to climb out of. And the demand is the real issue there in long term I don't see that changing dramatically.
Operator: The next question comes from Julian Bloyne with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Julian Bloyne: Hi. Thank you for the question. Just want to ask, what do you expect for the trajectory of new lease rates into November and December relative to the negative 4.8% you saw in October? It does seem like comps year over year seem to get a bit easier in November and December. And then on the renewal side, I guess, you said you sent out offers in sort of the mid-threes for November and December. Where do you think that actually shakes out? Like, could it be, like, a hundred basis point lower or any sort of guidepost you can give us on that side?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. So I think the fourth quarter is going to look probably pretty similar to what you see effectively for October. Right? So if you look at October, the effective new lease rates are down 4.4%. That feels about right. Effective renewal rates, up 3.4%. Once again, I think that's going to be right. The difference, and there's going to be a slight difference, is that when you get to November and December, you start to have more renewals than new leases and so the blend changes a little bit. And so if you look at what we had for our October effective blended lease rate of down 0.8%. I think it's going to get a little bit better than that for November and December just because, as I said, just the waiting changes with more renewals versus leases.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lewis with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Michael Lewis: Great. Thank you. Rick, you mentioned keeping some land parcels that you had written down in past downturns, and those eventually, you know, recovered in value or, you know, the development viability came back. The parcels that you're writing down now, do you intend to sell those and then, you know, also related to land, I think Alex mentioned that you have some additional parcels under contract. So, you know, maybe where are you looking to buy land at?
Ric Campo: Oh, if the development numbers don't work, don't pencil, you know, before we sell land, we'll sell land. It's not a great time to sell land today. And so, you know, when you think about the transaction environment, we don't have to sell land, so we don't need to sell land. And so we'll just hold them on our books until we think that it's the right time to sell it. And then we'll look at the analysis again and decide whether we should build it or sell it. And that's, you know, there's no pressure on us to sell. And, you know, when you think about the merchant builder market today, you know, starts are going to be down significantly, and part of that is deals don't pencil and two they're stuck in deals that they already have and they haven't sold them yet. They don't have good capital to be able to put in new deals. So if you're selling land today, probably not a great land sale market, and that could create opportunity for us to buy shovel-ready deals. We've definitely bought a lot of shovel-ready deals over the years. The transactions we have under contract right now are in Tampa. And we have a large land parcel that's a suburban, you know, three-story, four-story stick construction project and we will continue to you're going to see us move more from urban mid-rise to more suburban simple construction. That's just a direction that we have been moving, and that's why you have the four projects that we have identified, those were all urban projects, and if they were suburban walk-ups, we probably wouldn't have written it down. We probably started it by now.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Adam Kramer: Hey. Thanks for the time. Just wondering, you know, obviously, with the development kind of shift, you know, I was wondering kind of where you would rank acquisitions versus developments maybe other uses of capital, if you were to kind of rank the different capital allocation possibilities here. I noticed that you guys haven't bought anything in some time. Maybe if you could also just kind of categorize the state of the acquisition market and maybe early expectations for kind of, you know, deal flow in the coming quarter or two.
Ric Campo: Oh, we think there's going to be big deal flow in 2025. From an acquisition perspective for all the reasons that I've already gone through. And, you know, it gets down to when you think about capital allocation, you know, it's all about driving cash flow growth, and we look at our weighted average cost of capital, and we're going to invest in new transactions that will give us a reasonable spread over our weighted average cost of capital. Development makes sense, and that's why we've started three hundred plus million this year. We'll start three hundred and seventy-five million next year. But the balance between how much development, how much acquisitions you'll do will really be just a function of, you know, what the market allows. And so far this year, we just didn't see a great amount of opportunity, you know, on the acquisition side, and that's why we didn't really do anything. But you can expect us to be more active in 2025 and 2026 for sure. I guess one of the when you think about capital allocation, if stock prices get to the point where they were when we bought fifty million of shares at ninety-seven bucks, you know, with today's stock price, it's pushing up on a six cap rate. And it's hard for me to find us going in six. That's existing today or a development going in six. So if the, you know, public markets, don't believe the private markets that cap rates are four and a half. We can buy our stock at six. Can expect more of that.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey, everyone. I just want to go back to that comment about construction costs going up. Was that a market-specific labor thing? Was that pretty broad-based? And then can you comment on how land pricing is versus the peak?
Alex Jessett: I'm sorry. The first question was?
Wes Golladay: Go ahead. Go ahead.
Alex Jessett: No. I was just trying to make sure I heard the first question. The structure cost going up, but they're really not going up. They're flat. No. They're going up.
Wes Golladay: Well, I was looking at the Camden Baker and the Camden Gold the cost not for the active construction, but the shadow pipeline. The Baker and the Gulch went up. I didn't know if that was market-specific labor that went up or just construction costs overall. And then the follow-up question was how is land pricing versus the peak?
Alex Jessett: Okay. Absolutely. So if you look at what's in our pipeline, we have gone through and substantially redesigned those sites and we've come up with most of what you're seeing on cost changes is really, you call it enhancements. We're building a much better product than what we originally had laid out, and so that's what you're really seeing there. Land prices today, Rick, I don't know if you want to hit that one.
Ric Campo: Yeah. You know, land prices today are lower than they were at the peak, probably fifteen, twenty percent. Maybe more. But landholders are just like, you know, merchant builder holders, you know. If you don't have to sell, why would you sell into a weak market? And most people don't have to sell. So there hasn't been a lot of major land transactions get done and it's just a sit and wait kind of scenario. So it's hard to kind of put a pin in, you know, is it down fifteen, twenty or what? Because it really hasn't been a lot of land transactions out there.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Thanks for taking my question. Given your comments about the quality of your construction building a better product, and luck helping you avoid the worst of some of the recent hurricane impacts. The average age of your portfolio is also lower. Is there any way to quantify the resiliency of your portfolio versus the surrounding multifamily buildings in the regions in which your portfolio operates?
Alex Jessett: I think it's very hard to quantify other than to say that clearly when we were once Milton went through and our teams were out on our sites assessing what they would report back is that our neighbors certainly looked a lot different than we do. And a lot of that is, we talked about the quality of the real estate, but it is also the upkeep. Right? It's very important that you put the money in and you make sure that as the trees are appropriately trimmed, that you do the things to make sure that your drains are clear. You know, we go through and we'll drain all of our pools to make sure that we don't have overflow from that. There's just a lot of factors that we do because quite frankly, we look after our real estate. And I will tell you that when you drive around and you look at the other look at the neighborhood, it's not always the same.
Keith Oden: I'll just keep going. Can you talk about Harvey? And the portfolio here and how we fare?
Ric Campo: Yeah. I mean, just to follow-up on Alex's comment, our hometown is Houston, Texas. We've had a lot of experience with dodging hurricanes and making sure that we're prepared. And then in the aftermath of hurricanes, making sure that our residents are taken care of. But then Harvey, which is the flood of record, in Harris County, if, you know, probably by most people's estimation a five hundred year flood, we had one building or one community that actually had flood water damage, and it was only two buildings within that community. And all of our we're spread all over Harris County. So first of all, it starts with having your making sure that you buy communities that are out of the floodplain and out of the floodplain by some measure and so that when the storm does happen, you know, the things that we have to deal with most of the time are things that deal with the quality of the asset that you built, but then that's windstorm damage. But it doesn't make any difference what kind of quality you build. If you have rising water damage to your community. And there's just no way to mitigate that in either before or during a storm event. So it starts with knowing where to own real estate in the market that we're in, and then it runs all the way through the things that Alex talked about is right preparation in the event you are going to have a windstorm event.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from David Stable with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
David Stable: Hi. I was curious what kind of difference in performance do you see between your urban and suburban assets and submarkets? Is it just not driven by rent growth? Is there an element of CapEx differences? And I'm also curious if you're thinking on the urban-suburban divide is consistent across markets, or are there any exceptions?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. I mean, what I'll tell you is suburban continues to outperform. And when we look at revenue growth, our suburban assets in the aggregate are doing about eighty basis points better than our urban assets. And by the way, that's across our entire portfolio.
Ric Campo: When you look at demographics, two-thirds of our sort of demographic target lives or more than two, it's like seventy-five percent of the demographic target that mid-thirties, you know, twenty-one to thirty-two-year-old resident live in suburbs. So that's where the customers are. That's why suburbs tend to be better than urban. And if you think about the development mindset over the last ten years, everybody wanted to do urban. And it was driven by institutional investor appetite. And so urban markets had more supply put in them, which created more downward pressure on rents from the urban core versus suburban, and that's changed some, but because, you know, the last slug of supply, there's definitely more in the suburbs, but there's still plenty of urban. So I think suburban is going to continue to outperform urban over a long period of time.
Operator: Thank you. Today's last question comes from Alex Kim with Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.
Alex Kim: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about turnover quickly, which was down four percent year over year in the third quarter. Could you talk about some of the drivers there and your expectations moving forward?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So one of the biggest changes in turnover rate goes straight back to move-outs to purchase homes. We were in the nine percent range and have been for the entire year, which is historic for us. We had normally averaged somewhere between fifteen to twenty percent move-outs to home purchases depending on where you are in the cycle. So a nine percent rate over an extended period of time makes a huge difference. That's five to eight percent differential, and in residents that historically would have purchased a home who are not doing so because of the conditions in the housing markets. Is a difference maker. So we've seen results on retention and that's been really for the last couple of years, and we certainly expect that that will continue into 2025. Because as Rick said, really no short-term solution or change that's coming in the single-family home market that's going to change that dynamic.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Well, thank you. Appreciate your being on the call today, and we will see you in NAREIT in Las Vegas here in a couple of weeks. Thanks.
Operator: The conference is now concluded.

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. The theme of on-hold music today is waiting. During our meetings with multifamily stakeholders in recent months, the consensus view seems to be that everyone in multifamily is waiting for something. Operations teams are waiting for the pace of multifamily completions to reach a peak and begin to come down and for bad debts to return to pre-pandemic levels. CFR are waiting for the long anticipated first interest rate cut by the Fed as well as a relief in property insurance and property tax expenses. Transaction teams are waiting for the standoff between buyers and sellers to end. Sellers are waiting for buyers to throw in the towel and start buying while buyers are waiting for the towers to go on sale. While we are certain that the waiting will end eventually, the timing is the debate. In the meantime, as a late great Tom Petty reminds us, the waiting is the hardest part. With the second quarter behind us, I'm going to reprise most of my comments from last quarter since the markets are playing out as we have expected. We spent most of our time talking about supply in our markets. Yes, we are at a 30-year high for apartment deliveries. And yes, this is limiting rent growth in most of our markets now. The good news is that our markets are adjusting quickly to the post-pandemic low interest rate development frenzy. Starts are still projected to fall to just over 200,000 apartments in 2025. New deliveries should peak in 2024, falling 21% in 2025 and another 54% in 2026, which would be a 13-year supply low point. Apartment demand continues to be strong during the first half of the year, net apartment demand was over 200,000 apartments matching 2018 and 2019. With advisers projects 20 apartment demand to be in the 400,000 range. The main driver of apartment demand is household formation driven by population and employment growth, apartment affordability and positive demographic trends. The most recent 2022-2023 census data reported that the top 10 cities increased our population by 710,000. Nine Camden markets are in the top 10. The bottom 10 cities reported a loss of 200,000 people. These were major cities on the West and East Coast where Camden has limited exposure. Employment growth has been robust in all of our markets except Los Angeles, which continues to struggle. Ten of our markets have had job growth greater than 10% compared to the pre-pandemic levels. Apartment affordability continues to improve as resident wage growth has been over 5%, while rents have been relatively flat. Consumers are spending less of the take on pay for apartments. New Camden residents paying 19% of their income towards rent. Mortgage rates and rising home prices have kept move-outs to buy homes near historic lows, 10.3% of Camden residents moved out to buy a home in the second quarter. The monthly cost of owning a home today is about 60% more than leasing an apartment. This is not going to change anytime soon. Demographic trends continue to be a tailwind, supporting demand for high propensity to rent groups, including young adults age 35 and under. Apartments should take a larger share of household formations given these demand drivers. 2024 demand should be sufficient despite supply concerns to set up accelerating rent growth in 2025 and 2026, assuming that the overall economy continues the current trajectory. To take advantage of what we believe will be a robust multifamily leasing environment beginning in 2025 and beyond. We are starting construction on Camden South Charlotte and Camden Blake Me 769 suburban apartment homes located in the Ballantyne submarket of Charlotte, North Carolina. I want to give a big shout-out to our Camden team members for their hard work and their commitment to providing living excellence to our residents, which they never wait to do. Keith Oden up next. Thanks.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Operating conditions across our portfolio are generally playing out as we expected. Our second quarter 2024 same-property performance exceeded our forecast primarily due to continued lower insurance costs and property taxes, which we discussed a bit on last quarter's call. Our top markets for same property revenue growth were San Diego, Inland Empire, Washington, D.C. Metro, L.A., Orange County, Southeast Florida, Houston and Denver, all posting revenue growth above our portfolio average of 1.4% and ranging from 1.7% to 6.1% for the quarter. Austin and Nashville remain our most challenged markets with revenue declines of approximately 2% and 4%, respectively, for the quarter. Rental rates for the second quarter showed signed leases down 1.8% and renewals up 3.7% for a blended rate of positive 0.8% with an average occupancy of 95.3%. Preliminary results for July indicate slightly better levels of rate growth with occupancy averaging 95.6%. Renewal offers for August and September were sent out with an average increase of 4.6%. And finally, turnover rates across our portfolio remained very low driven by fewer residents moving out to buy homes. Net turnover for the second quarter of 24% was 42% compared to 45% in the second quarter of 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's President and Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activity. During the second quarter of 2024, we completed construction on Camden Wood Mill Creek, a 189 unit, $71 million single-family rental community located in the Woodlands, Texas, and we began construction on Camden South Charlotte, a 420-unit, $163 million, 4-storey garden-style new development and Camden Blakeney, a 349 unit, $154 million, 3-storey garden style new development, both located in the Ballantyne submarket of Charlotte. Turning to our financial results. For the second quarter, we reported core FFO of $1.71 per share, $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance. This outperformance was driven in large part by $0.02 per share and lower-than-anticipated operating expenses resulting from lower core insurance expense and lower property taxes. Approximately half of this expense outperformance was timing related as property tax refunds we expected in the third quarter were actually received in the second quarter. Additionally, during the second quarter, we had $0.02 per share in higher fee and asset management and interest and other income driven by the combination of cost savings and additional fee income from our third-party construction business and higher interest income from our cash balances. Property revenues for the quarter, including bad debt expense were in line with our expectations. Last night, we maintained the midpoint of our full year revenue guidance at 1.5%. We also lowered our full year expense guidance from 3.25% to 2.85%, driven primarily by the assumption of continued lower-than-anticipated insurance and property taxes. Insurance represents 7.5% of our operating expenses and was previously anticipated to be flat year-over-year. We now anticipate it to be down approximately 3% or $0.01 per share favorable to our prior guidance, with the entire amount of the savings occurring in the second quarter. Although, we hope the second quarter trend of lower core insurance claims continues, we are not assuming it will in our forecast. Property taxes, which represent approximately 36% of our total operating expenses, were previously projected to increase 1.5% year-over-year. Based on lower Texas property assessments and higher refunds, we are now anticipating that property taxes will be up approximately 1% and a favorability of approximately $0.01 per share. After taking into effect the decreases in expenses, we have increased the midpoint of our 2024 same-store NOI growth guidance from 50 basis points to 75 basis points. We are also increasing the midpoint of our full year core FFO from $6.74 to $6.79, a $0.05 per share increase. $0.02 is from the increase to our same-store NOI, of which $0.01 was non-time related in the second quarter from lower core insurance costs and $0.01 is spread throughout the latter part of the year from anticipated lower taxes. $0.02 is from the higher fee in asset management and interest and other income in the second quarter, which is not anticipated to be repeated and $0.01 is from the lower anticipated property taxes on our development and non-same-store communities. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we are still assuming $250 million of acquisitions, offset by an additional $250 million of dispositions with no net accretion or dilution from these matching transactions. Our development starts for the year totaled $317 million, in line with the top end of our initial full year guidance, and we are not anticipating any further 2024 starts. We have approximately $55 million of remaining 2024 development spend. We also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2024. We expect core FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.66 to $1.70, representing a $0.03 per share sequential decline at the midpoint primarily resulting from an approximate $0.03 sequential increase in same-store operating expenses resulting from the second quarter lower interest expenses and the seasonality of utility and repair and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a sequential reduction in property taxes due to additional property tax refunds in the third quarter and a $0.02 decrease in fee and asset management and interest and other income due to the nonrecurring components of the second quarter outperformance. This $0.05 per share cumulative decrease in sequential core FFO per share is partially offset by a $0.01 per share increase in same-store revenue as we continue through our peak leasing season, and a $0.01 decline in net overhead expenses primarily associated with the timing of certain public company and compensation costs. As of today, approximately 85% of our debt is fixed rate. We have no amounts outstanding on our $1.2 billion credit facility, only $300 million of maturities over the next 24 months and less than $300 million left to fund under our existing development pipeline. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong with net debt to EBITDA at 3.9x. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: It seems like July was a really strong month for you in a way that it wasn't for your peers. Can you talk about what you would attribute that to? Did you get more aggressive just based on the demand that you were seeing? Was there some sort of comp impact or anything else that you'd like to call out?
Keith Oden: Yes, July was a good month. And the only thing that we have done just from the -- sort of the 10,000-foot level, is that we have increased our marketing support to make sure that our traffic counts remain kind of where we need them to be. So we had a little bit of additional spend in marketing. But overall, if you think about where the our strength in our portfolio has been really impactful for us has been Washington, D.C. Metro in Houston and that they are our 2 largest markets and although in the last year or so, they've lagged the portfolio. Right now, they're leading the portfolio. So the strength in those 2 markets, some of which we anticipated a good year, we certainly didn't anticipate as good a year as what we're having in D.C. Metro this year and it's enough to move the needle on our portfolio.
Ric Campo: I mean the other part of the equation is that July, if you think about last year, July and August, we saw seasonality earlier in the year last year. It was -- and the seasonality, I think, was caused by sort of consumers running out of their pandemic money, and they moved out quicker. And so we had more partners to fill in July and August. And if you think about sort of that setup for the third and fourth quarter of the prior year, it was probably one of the weakest that we've had in a long time, and it was primarily driven by that. This year, the COVID money has been gone for a while, probably, and and people are not just moving out because they don't have their COVID money anymore. So -- and with strong job growth, even though the weak print today was expected, but continues to be really robust in our markets. And we continue to take market share from single-family home market because of the costs associated with interest rates and home prices going up. So it just sets up for a pretty good high demand market. And I think our team did a great job building occupancy through the peak leasing season. It just gave us a little bit more pricing power.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: So Ric, you touched on employment growth as a driver of household formation in your prepared remarks, and we've seen some slowdown in the employment reports of late. And just curious what your thoughts are on that slowdown versus the strong gains we saw last year, early this year and how that's coincided with near-record absorption. And just curious, if we do see a continued slowdown in the employment market, how that kind of impacts the acceleration in pricing power and getting back to maybe a more historic market rent growth environment?
Ric Campo: Sure. I think the slowdown is clearly a good thing and a good thing because if you think about the dynamics that affect our business, high interest rates and one part of the equation. So I think the Fed sort of sticking the landing with maybe an Olympic comment. They seem to be going for the gold. And I'm good with a slower economy or slower job growth market. You saw the unemployment rate went up from up to 4.3% with the print this morning. And the good news about -- from our perspective is that our markets are where the jobs are. And even when they're slowing, there's still enough job growth and low enough in migration to continue to take market share from the household formation from single family. And so with that said, the key is having reasonable job growth and not a cracking the economy. Obviously, if you have if the Fed doesn't stick the landing and we end up with a recession in 2025, then all bets are off on what happens then. We think what's going to happen is strict landing. You're going to have moderate employment growth and that employment growth is going to be in the markets where employment growth happens the best, which is in our market. So I feel pretty good about where we are, and I like the idea that the slower employment growth gives us set on headroom to be able to start cutting rates, which is -- which would be really good for our long-term business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo.
Jamie Feldman: Great. So your comment about not starting any more new developments for the rest of the year. Can you just talk more about that? I mean, it seems like there's going to be a really good window in '26, '27 to be delivering. So how are you thinking about -- talk more about that comment? And then maybe as we think ahead to '25, that you think could be a bigger development year.
Ric Campo: Sure. So our development starts. We were prepared. These are really shovel readies and we had delayed them. And so we went ahead and started the 2 in Charlotte that we announced. And we have a decent pipeline that we can start. It's just hard to get positioned and to start those other properties that we have between now and the end of the year. There'll likely be 2025 starts. And I also think we'll be able to expand the pipeline by helping other developers out who can't get financing who have several ready land deals that they're willing to part with. And if you look at our history in cycles like this, we've always been able to ramp up our development pipeline. Even though the 2026, 2027 looks pretty amazing from an apartment perspective, you still -- private developers still can't get capital. I mean we were chatting with the largest provider of debt and equity capital to the multifamily industry and their business for new development, equity and debt is down 85% this year, and it's not moving up. At the same time, the same group said that their interest in acquisitions or in the sellers out there who are merchant [indiscernible] who really need to recapitalize their BOBs and listings are up 60% year-over-year, and it looks like it will be a pretty robust transaction market coming up in the fall and early next year. So when the sort of clouds clear a little bit more, we will be more active in development for sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: I wanted to ask about your views on blended lease growth in the second half of the year. Keith, I know you mentioned that you're sending out renewals at 4.6%. If you could just remind us where you think you typically would sign those at and also for the new leases where you think new lease rates go.
Keith Oden: Yes. So our renewals are generally within 50 basis points of the average of what we send out. So the 4.6% probably turns into something a little -- just above 4. Alex, on the new lease numbers.
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. Yes, John. So for the third quarter, we're assuming blended about 1.6%, and the fourth quarter blended about 1.3%. And by the way, that's exactly what we thought last quarter as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Connor Mitchell from Piper Sandler.
Connor Mitchell: You guys saw a pretty nice improvement in bad debt in the second quarter year-over-year. Just wondering if you could provide some insights to how this might be trending in July and what you guys are thinking about for the rest of the year. And then maybe what markets are causing the improvements, and if you're seeing anything on the other side with any slipping in bad debt in certain markets?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So bad debt is really getting under control now. What we had in the second quarter was about 80 basis points just closed out July. So it's a little bit early for us to have our July numbers, but we think that they're going to be in line with our expectations for the rest of the year, which is right at 75 basis points. And where we're seeing the biggest improvement is where we needed to see them. So for instance, California in the second quarter was 2.1% bad debt in the first quarter, it was 2.6% bad debt. So those -- that market was obviously one that we're focused on quite a bit as with Atlanta, which in the first quarter was 1.8% and is now 1.4%. So the markets that were being a little bit problematic for us are starting to get under control. And we do think that we're getting pretty close to getting back to a normal level, which for us is about 50 basis points.
Operator: Next question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Steven Su [ph] on for Josh. So my question is on the turnover. So if I look at the number correctly, it looks like there's a little bit pickup from July -- from 2Q to July. So I wonder if you have any color on that, on the turnover?
Alex Jessett: So we'll always see an increase in turnover in the third quarter. So that's very typical. I think the thing that I'd be focusing on more is that our July 2023 turnover number was 53%. And our July 2024 turnover number is 47%. That's a 600 basis point improvement year-over-year. So although we typically do see higher turnover in the third quarter, it's trending a lot better than typical right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney.
Rob Stevenson: What's the current expected stabilized yield on the development pipeline? And what have you been seeing in terms of material labor costs as you start those 2 shale projects?
Ric Campo: Sure. So the Charlotte projects are in the 6 going in yields with IRRs in the [indiscernible] and the development pipeline, our general development pipeline, if you work at the last couple of years have been suburban deals in the 6%, maybe and actually the [indiscernible] like in the 7% range. And then the more urban deals in the mid-5s to high 5s. And in terms of costs, costs are coming down in some areas but very, very slowly. Lumber costs have come down, for example. But -- the good news is we're not having 1% a month inflation like we were 1.5 years ago. But I don't think that we've seen much cost compression it will be really interesting to see as starts fall, and we will peak in construction this year. And next year falls substantially in the year after that. And generally, when you see construction starts fall like that, what happens is that the subcontractor margins compress. And if you go back to the financial crisis, people were [indiscernible] drop dramatically because people were just working for food at time. There was no margin. I don't know that that's going to happen this time because there is a lot of other development going on. And when you think about commodity prices, those are driven by the global market, not just multifamily, and so with the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the the government spend that's going on in infrastructure, concrete and steel some of those other products likely aren't going to come down. So as the labor market tightens, I think you will see labor prices come down and margins come down and how much that is really -- it's hard to say today. It's not going to crater the way it did during the financial crisis because that was a whole different animal compared to what we have today. And if we have a -- if the Fed does hit the landing, it will be a decent economy still for builders and labor.
Rob Stevenson: What about land costs? Are you starting to see any relief there in terms of being able to buy at a cheaper rate or any of these office sites that are going to get bulldozed and converted?
Ric Campo: Land is an interesting thing because it doesn't move as fast as you would think because sellers -- just like the sellers of existing multifamily are unwilling to drop their prices land people tend to be the same. What I think the -- where the opportunity can be, and we've generally seen this in past cycles is that you have developers who own land who have been positioning to to start the development and they can't start the development because the debt and equity markets won't allow it today. And so they end up taking they write off their sort of soft costs and then they sell the land for what it was worth beginning perhaps and that's generally where the opportunity is. But I think sellers are definitely understanding that the market is different today because of the cost of capital rise and construction costs not coming down. So land prices tend to be stickier than you would think. But I do think there will be opportunities and make these deals both on the land side and the buying from developers that can't get their deals financed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: Ric, I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more color around the 2 development starts. What kind of yields are you penciling? I assume, on un-trended rents, and then to the extent that you do trend or you look out on a stabilized basis, where do you see those heading?
Ric Campo: We do both. We look at un-trended yields, and then we also look at trend yields, and we are generally pretty conservative in our trended. And when you -- when we look at the un-trended yields, they're in the sort of mid- to high 5s and then when you look at trended during the 6s. I think that the -- and that's -- those are going in yields or stabilized yields, and we look mainly at IRRs. I guess the long term, we're in this business for the long term, you want accretion as you go, but you also want long-term capital placement that has a positive spread your weighted average long-term cost of capital. Some with that said, we're in high or mid low 8s and one of them is low 8, and the other one is higher 8 from an IRR perspective. So that's the way we look at it. But I think there is substantial upside in those yields just because of what the market looks like in 2026 and 2027. If you have a reasonable economy and no new supply coming to the market, you should get better than normal rent growth. If you look at long-term rent growth for our business, it's roughly a little over 3%. And if you -- but the site during the cycles, today, we're -- what is our revenue growth today is like 0.7 and to get to a long-term average from today, you have to have a whole lot better than 3 in those uptick market years, which would be in '26 and '27. So I think there's a fair amount of upside in this development that you start today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi.
Eric Wolfe: You mentioned where you're sending renewals out today. So I was curious based on what you're seeing with YieldStar and the other 4 indicators, do you think occupancy will stay at this high level? Because it looks like it came up in in both June and July, or would you expect it to start coming down seasonally?
Keith Oden: Yes. So we're at 95.5% now. And I think in the back half of the year, I think we're we have that basically flat. Maybe it comes down a little bit in the fourth quarter, but probably the trade-off between rate and occupancy, and it's something that our professionals that in our revenue management department deal with literally daily making adjustments to make sure that we're maximizing revenues. But the key to being able to push rents and to have any pricing power at all is to maintain occupancy at or above 95%. So we started the year at 95.3%. We've actually ticked up a little bit during peak leasing season. Seasonality will probably cause it to drift a little bit below 95.5%. I'm pretty comfortable with our forecast between now and the end of the year with regard to our guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Kramer: Great. Just wanted to know across the portfolio today, where does kind of the loss lease or gain to lease stand? And if you can even give maybe a few of the markets, in particular, be interested to hear.
Alex Jessett: Yes. So right now, we are in a loss lease position. And so it's right around 1%. And obviously, that is spread across the markets, as you would imagine, they would be based upon the revenue growth that we've had year-to-date. And so think about a D.C. or San Diego has got a much larger loss to lease, and obviously, we've got gains to leases in markets like Nashville and Austin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS.
Ami Probandt: This is Ami Probandt. Some of the higher supply market seemed like they might be reaching a bottom and maybe Phoenix is in this category. So are you seeing any signs of this happening? Or are we potentially reaching the bottom in some of these markets?
Keith Oden: Yes. So the markets that jump off the page to me still are Nashville and Austin, in terms of oversupply. And that -- I still think we're in the middle of the I don't know whether it's the 4th inning or 5th inning of the baseball game, but I don't think we're anywhere near the end in either of those markets. It's probably going to drift over into mid-2025 just based on if you look at the forward the completions that are still -- that we still kind of grind through. The good news is, is that despite these historic levels of new supply, there's also been a pretty historic level of new absorption. City like Austin where if you kind of do the math around jobs created and net absorption the numbers don't seem to make a whole lot of sense. But when you look at it in the broader context of not just employment growth, but in migration -- in domestic migration into markets like Nashville and Austin, that's been the game changer. And because -- I mean, by historical standards, the amount of supply versus kind of printed job growth would bode much worse for rental rate performance in both of those markets, and it just hasn't happened. But in terms of Being at the bottom, I don't know, we're probably kicking around the bottom because we're kicking around the peak monthly deliveries in those markets. But clearly, we're going to continue to to fight the supply challenge into 2025. The good news is our markets have remained robust, and we're still growing jobs and people are still moving here, and we're still leasing lots of apartments.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Anderson from Wedbush.
Rich Anderson: So -- can you hear me?
Ric Campo: Yes.
Rich Anderson: Okay, sorry. So you bought back stock during the quarter in $96 range. Your stock is now $119 or something like that. And consensus NAV is I don't know if you believe it, 120-ish. What -- I wonder what -- under what scenario could you start thinking about reversing course from an equity standpoint, not that your balance sheet needs it. But would you -- are you at all having sort of a thought about raising equity at some point, particularly if something of significance comes along and you get to below the capital and protect your balance set at the same time? Just curious what your thoughts are there.
Ric Campo: Well, we clearly are focused on where we can make the best returns and how do we fund that. And so I will tell you just the -- of course, the stocks $119 today, but in the last -- it was $110 just a little while ago and below that. And so we don't think of it that way. But I would say that the way I think about capital allocation, if we could acquire a portfolio that improves the quality of our portfolio is part of our strategic plan and it can be done on an accretive basis than -- and using equity and our debt to fund that and keeping our balance sheet strong. I'm sure that would be a interesting thing to do. We haven't found portfolios like that. I think that today, I think that the transaction market is going to be very robust over the next 18 months. And that should give us an opportunity to to play in the acquisition game significantly. And if it works out where the math works, then I'm sure you use all sources of capital leading equity.
Rich Anderson: What do you think about the $120 as an NAV estimate. Any thoughts on that or the consensus number?
Ric Campo: Well, at $120, I think that's an implied cap rate at Camden of about 65.7, and let's be the [indiscernible] transaction, the CFO for KKR came out and said it was a low 4. So winter cap rates today and most of the transactions that are going off today are in the low 5s. So I think that that the public markets are slow to bring cap rates down to where the real market is today. And ultimately, maybe the public markets are right and there's going to be a flood of properties that have to come to the market between now and the end of 2025. And so there you could argue that cap rates could stay higher or go higher because of that. But on the other hand, there's a massive wall of capital out there as evidenced by Blackstone taking out Aimco and KKR acquiring a couple of billion dollars of the Cutera portfolio. So we'll see, right? It's -- the Street tends to at least Wall Street tends -- the pendulum moves way -- one way versus the other. And if you're going to get back to the middle, if you come back to the middle of where cap rates are trading today, $120 would be low.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from Baird.
Unidentified Analyst: Can you provide some insight on how you expect D.C. in Houston to perform in the second half of the year.
Keith Oden: Yes. I think D.C. and Houston are going to continue to be in the top. I think clearly, D.C. is going to end up the year either 1 or 2 in our portfolio just from where we are today, Houston is -- continues to be really robust in terms of growth. This morning, I think I saw an announcement that Chevron was finally going to move their real live corporate headquarters from California to Houston. They've been saying they weren't going to do it for 15 years and yet their chairman and vice chairman are expected to move -- actually moved to Houston by the end of this year. So I think that's 2,000 jobs that probably is not a huge thing in the scheme of Houston's overall employment view, but it sends a really important message about Houston is the energy capital of the world. And it's not going away anytime soon. I think it's only going to continue to be -- to get stronger in the near term. So I'm really very constructive on Houston with what's going on here. And clearly, D.C. Metro having a year that is better than what we would have thought it would be. And they've got great occupancy right now and really good momentum, and our teams are doing a great job of taking advantage of the opportunity. So I think both those markets, I'm very positive on between now and the end of the year.
Ric Campo: I would add to Houston that Keith mentioned the energy capital of the world, but it's also the energy transition capital of the world. If you look at the government spend on energy, I mean, there was a roughly a $2 billion hydrogen hub that was granted to Houston. And a lot -- and these energy companies are all investing major dollars in clean technology and into the transition. And ultimately, the thing that's really interesting about the whole debate about energy transition and global warming and going green. You have to have a transition plan that works for people. And a transition plan that includes -- it has to include oil and gas, traditional oil and gas but the oil and gas companies are the ones who understand how to change how to get transition into hydrogen and other fuels that -- so I think long term, Houston is going to continue to do well as a result of both traditional energy and transition.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Segall from Green Street.
David Segall: I was curious if you could talk about how comfortable you feel about the development spread on the recent Charlotte starts, considering that citing assets trading in the low 5 range and the un-treaded yields for those starts, if I heard correctly, we're below 6 un-trended basis.
Ric Campo: Sure. So we look at it from a long-term cost of capital perspective, and we won 150 basis points spread from our long-term cost of capital for development on acquisitions. We want 50 to 75 and we can get that with development. The going in yields, if you use going in yields as your benchmark, then that always is dangerous in my opinion, because where you start is important, but where you finish is the key. And so long term, value creation to development, and we created billions of dollars of value at Camden through our development program over the years. And this part of the cycle is that when they're when there's going to be limited competition coming in at '26 and '27, billing today, those developments will be -- create value long term for Camden. When you look at -- if we were -- if we only had $1 to invest, that would be one thing, right? But we have one of the best balance sheets in the sector. We have unfunded line of credit if we could invest without doing any equity offerings and keeping our debt in the right level to keep our A rating, we can invest $1.3 billion. And so the $300 million development. If great acquisitions come along, we'll play in that game as well. But it's a long-term bet for a long-term business, and we think it makes sense to allocate that amount of capital to those transactions are great suburban really simple and no offense to my construction folks, but they're stick construction in the suburbs, and that's where we've made the most created the most value in our development business over a long time, a long period of time. So that's the way we think about it.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: Yes. Great. Just thinking about the expense growth this year, it's obviously come in a lot better than you guys expected. Taxes are only up 0.2%. I know the Houston or the Texas refunds and property tax changes have helped. I'm just trying to think through maybe some of the onetime benefits that you're getting this year as we think about expense growth into '25.
Alex Jessett: Yes. So I'll hit the items that seem to have the most variability first. So if you think about property taxes, obviously, we're having a fantastic year in 2024. My gut is, as we move on, we returned to a more normal level, which is about 3%. If you think about insurance, insurance was really a case of a pendulum that long. If you remember last year, our insurance was up 40%. And when we started this year, we thought insurance was going to be up 18%, and now we think it's going to be down 3%. Right now, this is still a great business for the insurance providers. And every insurance provider that we spoke to when we did our last renewal was trying to find out how they can have more of this business. And the simple way that they can get more of this business is to keep the rate low. And so what I would anticipate is that Insurance follows the normal cycle, rates are low for a couple of years. And then all of a sudden, you have some accumulation of global losses that causes rates to rise and then it's a rent and repeat cycle. When I think about the rest of our line items, salaries is obviously something that is very closely tied to inflation, and we think that's going to be typical. The same thing for utilities or repair and maintenance. Probably the one line item that I think there's some variability. The good news is that it's our smallest line item is marketing. And marketing really is a function of how much we want to spend to create the traffic that we want. And as we have more supply we'll spend more on the marketing dollars. But all that being said, I think if you look at where we are today at 2.85%, when you think about the long-term average for our business, it's 3%. So I think we're in pretty good shape.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS.
Ami Probandt: Another quick one from me, Ami on the line. How is the hurricane impact factored into the guide? And how should we think about that as we are modeling out the third quarter?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So it's a noncore expense for us. And you'll notice that we increased our core FFO by $0.05 per share, but a noncore FFO by $0.03 per share. The delta is the $0.02 that we are anticipating for the impact of barrel. And obviously, that's a net expense line after taking into effect insurance proceeds and additional dollars that may be capitalized.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: I wanted to follow up on the planned lease assumptions for the back half of the year. So in July, you signed blended at 90 basis points, yet you're expecting that to, I guess, accelerate or improve in the second half of the year. Is that based on easier year-over-year comps? Or are there other factors?
Alex Jessett: No, absolutely. So a component of that is easier comps, but you have to think about our effective. So our effective for July is up 1.2%. And so what I'm saying is that our effective for the third quarter is up 1.6% -- 1.2%, 1.6% is not that much of a jump. And then when you look at what was signed ignore the blend because in July, we sort of had a little bit of a unusual were a larger percentage of -- with the new leases versus renewals. If you look at that renewal number, which is up 4%, that's a really good renewal number for us. And if you think about turnover that's dropping, with renewal numbers staying that high, that should be a really good driver for us to get to the 1.6%.
John Kim: Can you confirm what you signed in June, I think May was at 1%.
Alex Jessett: I do not have the June number right in front of me, but yes, we'll get back to you on that.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no additional questions, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Very well. Thank you for being on the call today. And this is probably one of the -- given remember the last -- to report and call and what people probably have their questions answered. I want to make sure everybody recognize that we had the red, white and blue shirts going to support the U.S. the U.S., and I want to give a great shout out to Simone Biles, a Houston native who made history yesterday by being the most decorated gymnast in history. So with that, we'll let you enjoy the rest of your day and the rest of the Olympics. So take care and thanks. Bye-bye.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-03 11:00:00) =====
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning, and welcome to Camden Property Trust's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Today's event is being webcast through the Investors Section of our website at camdenliving.com, and a replay will be available this afternoon. We will have a slide presentation in conjunction with our prepared remarks and those slides will be available on our website later today or by e-mail upon request. 
 If you are joining us by phone and need assistance during the call, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key, followed by zero. All participants will be in listen-only mode during the presentation with an opportunity to ask questions afterwards. And please note, this event is being recorded. 
 Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. 
 As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2024 earnings release is available in the Investors Section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. 
 We would like to respect everyone's time and complete our call within one hour, so please limit your questions to one, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo. 
Richard Campo: Thanks, Kim. The theme for on-hold music today was celebrations. We recently learned that we were included once again on the Fortune Magazine's annual list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. This marks 17 consecutive years that Camden has been included on this prestigious list. We celebrate being on the list because it shows that Camden employees value and appreciate being part of a great workplace. 2/3 of a company's score for inclusion on the Fortune list is based on anonymous third-party administered employee survey. If a company's employees don't love what they do in their workplace, there's no chance that a company would ever make the list.
 The survey consists of 60 questions, and the most important is the final one, which asks employees if they agree with this statement. Taking everything into account, would you say this is a great place to work? 95% of the Camden teammates agree with this statement. This is truly remarkable and certainly a cause for celebration. We believe that smiling, motivated and committed Camden teammates serving our residents with purpose and commitment to living excellence, leads to smiling customers, which always leads to smiling shareholders. I want to thank Team Camden for their continued support of improving the lives of our teammates, our customers and our shareholders [indiscernible]. 
 With the first quarter behind us, I will jump right into the issue that we spend most of our time talking about, apartment supply in our markets. Yes, we are at 30-year highs for apartment deliveries. And yes, that is limiting rent growth in most markets for now. The good news is that the market is adjusting quickly to the post-COVID low interest rate development frenzy. March apartment starts were the weakest since April of 2020 and are down 53% from peak volume and falling. Starts will likely fall to just over 200,000 apartments in 2025, primarily driven by low income properties using tax credits and other government support. New delivery should peak in 2024, falling by 31% in 2025 and 50% in 2026, which would be a 13-year supply low point. 
 Apartment demand continues to be strong. During the first quarter, apartment absorption was over 100,000 apartments, the best first quarter demand in 20 years. The main drivers of apartment demand are population and employment growth, apartment affordability and positive demographic trends. The most recent 2022-2023 census reported that the top 10 cities increased our populations by 710,000. 9 Camden markets are in the top 10. The bottom 10 cities reported a loss of 200,000 people. These were major cities on the West and East Coast where Camden has limited exposure. Employment growth has been robust in all of our markets, except Los Angeles, which continues to struggle. 
 Apartment affordability continues to improve as residents wage growth has been above 5% for the last 17 months while rents have been relatively flat. Consumers are spending less of their take-home payout for apartments. New Camden residents pay 18.8% of their income towards rents. Mortgage rates and rising home prices have kept move-out to buy homes at historic lows. 9.4% of our move-outs in the first quarter were attributed to a resident's buying-a-home, lowest in our history. The monthly cost of owning a home today is 61% more than leasing an apartment. This is not going to change anytime soon. 
 Demographic trends continue to be a tailwind supporting demand from high propensity to rent groups, including young adults, age 35 and under. Apartment should take a larger share of household formations given these demand drivers. 2024 demand should be sufficient in spite of supply concerns to set up accelerating rent growth for 2025 and 2026, assuming the overall economy continues on the current trajectory. Keith Oden is up next. Thanks. 
D. Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Our first quarter 2024 same-property performance was better than expected, primarily due to lower levels of bad debt and favorable trends for insurance and property taxes, which Alex will discuss in detail. 
 Overall, operating conditions across our portfolio are playing out as we expected. In our market outlook on last quarter's call, we projected our top 5 markets for revenue growth this year, would be San Diego, Inland Empire, Southeast Florida, Washington, D.C. Metro, LA Orange County in Houston. Not surprisingly, those were, in fact, the top 5 performers for the quarter with same property revenue growth ranging from 3.4% to 6.2% in those markets. And as anticipated, we are seeing the most challenging conditions in Nashville and Austin, with those markets showing slightly negative revenue growth for the quarter. 
 As we previously disclosed, we initiated a marketing strategy during February to boost occupancy going into our peak leasing season, allowing us to then increase pricing power. Rental rates for the first quarter had signed new leases down 4.1%, and renewals up 3.4% for a blended rate of negative 0.9%, with average occupancy of 95%. Our preliminary April results show an improvement of 230 basis points for signed new leases to negative 1.8% with renewal rates at 3.4%, resulting in a positive [indiscernible] blended rate. We believe our strategy was successful with April occupancy averaging 95.2% and recently trending around 95.4%. Renewal offers for June and July were sent out with an average increase of 4.2%. 
 And finally, turnover rates across our portfolio remain very low, driven by fewer residents moving out to buy homes. Net turnover for the first quarter of '24 was 34% compared to 36% in the first quarter of '23. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Alexander Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate and capital markets activity. During the first quarter of 2024, we stabilized Camden NoDA, a 387-unit, $108 million community in Charlotte, which is now 99% occupied and generating an approximate 6.5% yield. We began leasing at Camden Long Meadow Farms, a 188-unit, $80 million single-family rental community located in Richmond, Texas, and we continued leasing at Camden Durham, a 420-unit, $145 million new development in Durham, North Carolina, and Camden Woodmill Creek, a 189-unit, $75 million single-family rental community located in The Woodlands, Texas. 
 Additionally, on February 7, we sold Camden Vantage, a 592-unit, 14-year-old community in Atlanta for $115 million. 
 At the beginning of the quarter, we issued $400 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes with a fixed coupon of 4.9% and a yield of 4.94% and subsequently prepaid our $300 million floating rate term loan. On January 16, we repaid maturity at $250 million, 4.4% senior unsecured note. 
 In conjunction with the term loan prepayment, we recognized a non-core charge of approximately $900,000 associated with unamortized loan costs. During March and April, we repurchased approximately $50 million of our common shares at an average price of $96.88, and we have $450 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. As of today, approximately 85% of our debt is fixed rate. We have no amounts outstanding on our $1.2 billion credit facility, less than $300 million of maturities over the next 24 months, and less than $100 million left to fund under our existing development pipeline. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.9x. 
 Turning to our financial results. For the first quarter, we reported core FFO of $1.70 per share, $0.03 ahead of the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance. Our first quarter outperformance was driven in large part by $0.015 per share and lower-than-anticipated levels of bad debt. All of the municipalities in which we operate have now lifted their restrictions on our ability to enforce rental contracts and in particular, Fulton County in Georgia has enacted legislation encouraging renters to abide by their contracts. As a result, we experienced 80 basis points of bad debt in the quarter as compared to our budget of 120 basis points. 
 Some delinquent renters did repay past due amounts, but more often, we simply received the benefit of having our real estate back, the opportunity to commence a lease with a resident who abides by the rental contract and lower bad debt from having a new resident who actually pays. The accelerated move-outs of delinquent residents did put pressure on our physical occupancy, so we made a pricing strategy shift during the quarter, reducing rental rates at communities less than 95% occupied in order to maximize pricing power as we entered our peak leasing season. As a result of this shift, we experienced higher occupancy during the quarter, but that was entirely offset by lower rental rates. 
 Our outperformance for the first quarter was also driven by $0.015 and lower operating expenses resulting from lower core insurance claims and lower property taxes. Although we are pleased with our first quarter revenue outperformance, at this point, we are maintaining the midpoint of our full year guidance at 1.5%. However, we are changing some of the underlying assumptions. Our original guidance assumed 1.2% of rent growth comprised of our 50 basis point earn-in at the end of 2023, effectively flat loss to lease and approximately 70 basis points of market rental rate growth recognized over the course of the year. We also assumed flat occupancy versus 2023 and a 30 basis point contribution from lower bad debt, bringing us to our 1.5% total budgeted revenue growth at the midpoint of our original guidance range. 
 Our current revenue guidance reflects the same assumptions of a 50 basis point earning in flat loss to lease, but now with 25 basis points of market rental rate growth and 10 basis points of occupancy gains as a result of our first quarter marketing initiative. In addition, our revised estimates for bad debt will add 65 basis points of revenue growth, bringing us back to the 1.5% midpoint for our current revenue guidance. 
 Last night, we lowered our full year expense guidance from 4.5% to 3.25% entirely driven by the assumption of lower-than-anticipated insurance and property taxes. Insurance represents 7.5% of our expenses and was originally anticipated to increase 18%. In addition to lower insurance claims in the first quarter, we just completed a very successful insurance renewal, and we are now anticipating insurance will be flat year-over-year. 
 Property taxes which represent approximately 36% of our total operating expenses, were originally projected to increase 3% in 2024. We have since received very favorable tax valuations, particularly in Houston, and we are now assuming a 1.5% year-over-year property tax increase. These positive expense variances are partially offset by increases in salaries, in part associated with increased performance incentives and higher marketing costs associated with higher search engine optimization expenses. 
 After taking into effect the decrease in expenses, we have increased the midpoint of our 2024 same-store NOI guidance from flat to positive 50 basis points. We are maintaining the midpoint of our full year core FFO at $6.74 as the accretion associated with lower same-store operating expenses is entirely offset by higher-than-budgeted floating rate interest expense, primarily as a result of fewer than anticipated Fed rate cuts. 
 At the midpoint of our guidance range, we are still assuming $250 million to the acquisitions, offset by an additional $250 million of dispositions with no net accretion or dilution from these matching transactions, and up to $300 million of development starts in the second half of the year with approximately $175 million of total 2024 development spend. 
 We also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2024. We expect core FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.65 to $1.69, representing a $0.03 per share sequential decline at the midpoint, primarily resulting from an approximate $0.01 decrease in interest income due to lower cash balances, a $0.01 increase in overhead costs due to the timing of various public company fees, and a $0.01 sequential decrease in same-store NOI as higher expected revenues during our peak leasing periods are offset by the seasonality of certain repair and maintenance expenses and the timing of our annual merit increases. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions. 
Operator: [Technical Difficulty] 
Unknown Executive: [Audio Gap] get to take -- through the full cycle, we're going to get more of our apartments back. So I think that it's -- the one thing that did make a big difference and probably accelerated our progress, believe it or not, in Fulton County, miracles happened in Fulton County, which was one of our most problematic areas for how long it took to process [indiscernible] and the amount of nonpaying residents we had there, they actually passed an ordinance that basically said if you don't pay, [indiscernible] rent and you don't pay your rent to the landlord in order to not be evicted. To avoid eviction, you have to pay your rent to the court -- and then the court will -- it's your day of reckoning, the court will either pay the landlord or not or return the rent. That alone was a huge change. 
 So the sentiment continues to move in a more positive direction around regulatory regimes, around nonpayment of rent. I think that it's happening a little bit quicker than we anticipated. I do remember that in previous calls, we've been asked are you ever going to get back to 50 basis points bad debt expense, which is what we had for 30 years prior to the change in -- from the COVID experience, and my answer to that was ever is a long time, forever. And so it looks like we're making pretty good progress. 80 basis points of bad debt expense is more than halfway back to our long-term 50 basis point experience for the last 30 years. So I'm more hopeful than I have been in the last 2 years of it that we could, in fact, get back close to that number. 
Richard Campo: I think the fact that we can pivot with technology the way we have through adapting to the sort of bad guys who come in and use identity theft to lease apartments and then go through the process. So the fact that we're trying to -- that we're able to pivot with new technology to be able to find out -- to meet those people out before they get into our properties is a big part of the equation. And it's sort of like anything else when you have -- when the bad guys figure out that they can't get in the front door, they go to somebody else. And so I think I'm really excited about being able to deploy technology as quickly as we did and adapt to that situation. 
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. 
Haendel St. Juste: Ric or maybe Keith, can you talk a bit about what the operating strategy here for the portfolio going into peak leasing? You talked about pulling back a bit on rate to get occupancy to 95%. It seems like you've maintained that in April. So I'm curious, is the plan to continue to push rate here? Are you willing to trade some occupancy, and maybe which markets do you expect to be able to push rent a bit more near term beyond [indiscernible]? 
Richard Campo: Go ahead, Keith. Go ahead. 
D. Keith Oden: We're back basically where we want to be from an occupancy standpoint. We were 95.2% at the end of the quarter, and we've actually trended up a little bit since then in the month of April, where we got to 95.4% occupied. And again, we're not looking for making the decisions on pricing. We're not looking at necessarily what in-place occupancy is. We're looking at 6 weeks, 8 weeks out on projections. And as we look at what we see right now, we've got -- regained the occupancy in real time that we wanted to. And the next step is you push rents. 
 So I think our -- the opportunity that we're going to continue to have in the better markets that are less supply impacted, we'll be able to push rents and should be able to hit our revenue targets for the year. I'm certainly pleased to see the kind of relative pricing power that we have in our D.C. Metro and in Houston. Those 2 markets are really important for us. They're 25% of our same-store pool. And those are both performing really quite well. And I think that there's a good chance that, that will continue. 
Haendel St. Juste: I appreciate that. If I could ask about new lease rates. You mentioned that you had tweaked some of the underlying assumptions within your same-store revenue, but can you talk about what your expectation on the new lease rate side is here? Maybe give us a sense of where you expect that to be broadly for the year and maybe over the next couple of quarters? 
Alexander Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So when we're looking at new leases, we're assuming that we're going to be probably right around a negative 2% for the second quarter and then negative 1% for the next 2 quarters after that. 
Operator: The next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. 
John Kim: Can I just follow up on that? So your guidance now has 25 basis points of market rental growth, and that's down from the original guidance that's offset by higher occupancy and better bad debt. But I guess my question is how realistic is that 25 basis points? Is that something that you just plug into maintain your same-store revenue guidance? Or do you think that's what you're going to achieve? 
Alexander Jessett: No. It's absolutely what we think we're going to achieve. Obviously, what we do is we look at the conditions on the ground, we look at our third-party data providers, and we take all that information and just like we do our original budgets, we do reforecast from the community level on up, and so this is exactly what we expect to achieve. 
John Kim: And is that the occupancy versus rate trade-off? Or are there some markets that are potentially underperforming your original expectations? 
Alexander Jessett: Well, if you think about it on the occupancy side, all of our markets are doing better than we thought on occupancy. And then clearly, we're bringing down the rental rates. The rental rate bring-down is generally across the board. The offset, once again, is the much lower bad debt. 
Operator: The next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Alex, just wanted to clarify what the revised lease rate growth assumption is for this year versus the 1.2% you had previously provided. And can you just share, I guess, what the implied lease rate growth is that you need for the balance of the year? 
Alexander Jessett: Yes. I mean here's probably the best way to think about it. We're assuming a 75% blend new lease and renewals for the full year, 75 basis point positive. And so you've got a component of that, that is picking up the earn-in. And then you've got -- which is about 50 basis points. And then you've got the 25 basis points that you're getting from the market rent growth to that. So I guess it is 75 basis points. To that, you're going to add to 10 basis points of higher occupancy '24 versus '23, that gets you to 85 basis points. And then we're assuming that our bad debt is going to be 75 basis points for the full year. That compares to 140 basis points last year. So that's a 65 basis point pickup, and that's how you get to the 1.5%. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Okay. So it seems like about 1.25% to 1.5% from here out on the blend is kind of the math I was getting to? 
Alexander Jessett: Yes. That's right. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Ric, I guess. Ric, with the set-up you highlighted in your prepared remarks around the strong absorption, supply is poised to hit multiyear lows in the next couple of years. I guess how do you further take advantage of that backdrop prior to development ramping back up and just -- other types of activity with others being in a better position from a cost of capital and financing market perspective? 
Richard Campo: Well, clearly, the -- when you think about how you set up for '26, '27, it would be on the development side of the equation, we have a decent pipeline that we can start. And -- and I guess the real question is, when do you pivot? And I think as we see more cards in terms of how the absorption and the demand continues, if it continues the way we think it could and should continue given everything that we talked about earlier, then you will see us pivot and get more aggressive on the development side towards the end of the year and beginning of next year. 
 Clearly, right now, the best trade in the first quarter was selling assets and buying stock. And we're buying stock at a high 6 cap rate when the market is trading today at a low 5 cap rate. And so it's a very reasonable trade to make. And so ultimately, we'll be able to pivot to a more aggressive mode when we start seeing that the supply does get taken up between now and, say, the middle of the summer. And we really need to see that the peak leasing season and how that unfolds for us to get more aggressive at this point. 
Operator: The next questions is from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. 
Richard Anderson: And I'm trying to keep to the one-question rule here. So yes, it's just observational stuff. It's pretty easy. So what do you think explains the difference in perspective between you guys saying accelerating rent growth in 2025 and '26 and Equity Residential and AvalonBay, which essentially think that you're not going to get any rent growth until 2026. Is there an interpretation issue? Is it just you have more information, so you have more sort of knowledge is a concern when you hear them say that because they're not dummies either. So like I'm just curious what you think the difference is? 
Richard Campo: I think the difference is, is that pretty much everybody talks to their book, and that's part of it. 
Richard Anderson: Is that what you're doing? 
Richard Campo: No. Well, sure, you're going to -- we're going to -- if we didn't believe what we're saying, we wouldn't say it, and I'm sure they believe what they say. But the issue is they're not operating in these markets. So I'm not going to opine about what San Francisco is doing, even though San Francisco hasn't added back their jobs that they lost during COVID, yet -- if you look at -- so we look at our markets, and I use a fair -- we use a fair number of data providers. And when you look at some of those data providers, they show pretty good demand and their numbers are sort of -- when you look at [indiscernible], for example, [indiscernible]  around for a long time, showing accelerating rent growth in 2025 because of the excess of this demand that's coming from multifamily because of all the things we talked about at the beginning. 
 So -- so I think there's a certain amount of bias that everybody has about their own markets, and we operate in these markets. We're seeing what's happening every day. Pretty hard for me if I had 2 properties or 3 properties in New York City, does that give me a sense of what's going on in New York City and the answer would be no. You have to have a broad sense of these markets. We've operated in our markets for over 30 years. We understand how the dynamics work -- and some of the numbers are just incredibly compelling. Like, for example, let's take LA and San Francisco. Both have -- LA still has 43,000 jobs lost since 2019, San Francisco, 52,000 jobs lost. Dallas added 418,000 jobs from '19, Houston 233,000, Austin 205,000, Phoenix 223,000. So the bottom line is, is that what's been driving the markets in the Sunbelt continues to drive those markets. And the fact that our West Coast and East Coast brethren are doing better than us from a revenue growth perspective is because their hole was so deep that they're just crawling out of a deep hole. And yes, that's a good way to place stocks now and then. But I don't understand the 100 basis point gap between the implied cap rate for Mid-American Camden versus Equity and AvalonBay. And so because ultimately, what's going to happen is that when the markets write themselves from a supply perspective, the same thing that drove outperformance of revenue growth in the past, which is job growth and household formation and all the positive things that are going on in these markets is going to continue. 
 So unless you bet that we're going back to the sexy 6 cities that get all the growth, I don't think that's going to happen. I think there's a fundamental change in the dynamics between growth in these markets and growth in the East Coast, West Coast markets. And we can all agree to disagree, but that's what you guys do is you buy stocks based on that, right? So we'll see who's right. 
Operator: Next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. 
Steve Sakwa: Great. Ric, I guess I wanted to piggy-back on your comment about the possibility of starting some new development. And I'm just curious which markets are kind of higher up on your list? And if you looked at the economics today, where do those deals pencil? Or how far away are they from actually penciling where you think the development needs to be? 
Richard Campo: Well, development needs, it would be -- if you look at our development page in our supplement, you'll see where we have development and where they're positioned. And we have developments. I would say that the closer ones would start would be Charlotte. And Charlotte is absorbing, you think about the supply push, and Charlotte has a big supply push, but we're leasing over 40 units. We're leasing 40 units a month at our new developments there. And it's just really quickly and at a decent rates and -- and so I would say it would be -- go down that list, and you'll see where it is. But the economic issues, some properties, clearly, depending on where you are, we have 2 developments in Nashville, for example, and Nashville does have a bigger supply issue than most cities between Austin and Nashville have the biggest supply -- the new supply coming online. So we're going to take a hard look at those numbers. 
 But when you look at current cap rates today, I know it hurts people's head to think that they're in the low 5s, we have trades that are going on today in the high 4s. And even though you have negative leverage, they're basically buying based on the pound. They're buying at 40%, 50% of replacement cost and their bet is, is that when supply is absorbed, that there is going to be rent spikes that happened in 2026, '27, '28 that are going to be similar to '12, '13, '14 -- and that -- and so if you -- if we do a pro forma like that, then most of our developments are going to be in the 6s. And so I think that makes sense. But the question is, we still need to see this the leasing season this year and have more confidence that before we commit a lot of capital to development, we need to see more cards. And so to me, it's just looking at the supplement, you'll see where our starts are. 
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Ric, hopefully, you trademark [indiscernible] that sounds like it could be a good moneymaker. So going to the jobs and the strength of the Sunbelt, clearly, a lot of supply, but what's been going on across earnings season is everyone is talking about the strong jobs in the Sunbelt, but at the same time, general, the talking heads and economists and everyone is talking about potential for recession, hard landing, hey, the job -- the economy is not great, and yet all the apartments are talking about really good demand. And it's hard to believe that it's only because move-outs to homes are low and your typical renter can't afford a home. So it does seem like the economy is stronger across the Sunbelt in your markets than what the talking heads would say. Would you agree with that? Or is there something else that's explaining the disconnect between the broader economic concerns versus the absorption and the demand that you're seeing in your markets? 
Richard Campo: Well, I think the idea that you have the risk of recession and hard landing or soft landing, that's out there for sure. There's no question about that. And I think that's what [indiscernible] about, right? I mean if you look at the first quarter and then the print -- the job print that just happened, 175,000 jobs that was published today, I think that job number -- the consensus was [indiscernible] -- and of course, the market rallies to 10 years rallying big time [indiscernible] because that's a kind of scenario, right, where it's not [indiscernible] and so I think that question is I think there's still a concern about what the Fed does and do they ease or do we have a soft landing. 
 If we have a hard landing, then all bets are off, right? I mean what drives multifamily demand and any demand for any product ultimately is economy, so economy today is good. The jobs have been plentiful, and they've been primarily in the Sunbelt. And I think as long as we have the same kind of economic construct or a soft landing scenario, then work demand to take up the supply and our numbers will be what our numbers are. But on the other hand, if you have a hard landing and we lose 2 or 3 million jobs, then [indiscernible]. 
Operator: Next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citibank. 
Eric Wolfe: I think you said that you expect a 10 bps contribution from occupancy now. So just trying to go through the math, I think that means that you're expecting like 95.4% through the year, which would mean they call it, like 95.5% through the remainder of the year just based on what you've done so far. Is that the right way to think about sort of what you think occupancy will average? 
Alexander Jessett: That's exactly right. So we're assuming that we're going to be at about 95.4% for the second quarter, 95.5% for the third quarter and 95.4% for the fourth quarter, so exactly in line with your math. 
Eric Wolfe: Got you. And then you touched on this briefly, but you said that the sort of forward indicators of occupancy were telling you that there could be some improvement. I was just wondering if you could maybe go through like the lease rate, the percentage of tenants renewing, just sort of anything that you're seeing that sort of gives you confidence that occupancy should continue to rise? 
Alexander Jessett: Yes. So what I was referring to, Eric, is the -- when we think about making adjustments to strategy, obviously, we use YieldStar and YieldStar is forward-looking. It's always looking at least 8 -- 6 to 8 weeks out for trends. It projects kind of what future occupancy is going to be based on where our portfolio is at the time, renewal -- lease renewals that are upcoming, et cetera. So when we have -- when we're making strategy changes, it's in conjunction with our revenue management team who are using the tool that we have, which is you'll start to inform us about not like what's on the ground today. That's obvious. We know what that is. 
 The question is, what is it going to be if we continue on this path and either don't make a strategy change or we do make a strategy change, what does that project our occupancy to be 8 weeks out? So as we look at it today, we're encouraged that to the point where we're going to -- the tool and the algorithm that is YieldStar is going to say, you have the opportunity to increase rents across certain markets, and we'll take advantage of that. But that's -- that's all I was referring to is that the model is forward-looking. We used the model and obviously, with a lot of history and experience and judgment applied to it to help us make decisions about strategy. 
Operator: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. 
James Feldman: Great. So I'd like to go back to your thoughts on just capital allocation. I know you had mentioned buying the stock near 6 and cap rates near 5,  but if you're thinking you get red spikes a couple of years out, I know you had mentioned $450 million or so left on the repurchase plan. But just how do you think about the next $100 million, $200 million as you think about what's going on in the markets. And if this is the window to actually buy or do any kind of -- I know you don't love JVs, but any kind of investment across the capital stack versus buying back shares? 
Richard Campo: Well, the -- you're right, we don't like JV, so we won't be doing that. We have the most pristine balance sheet from an ownership perspective. We own 100% of everything we own. We don't have any partners, so we do what we want when we want to do it. 
 The issue of capital allocation, it's one of those interesting discussions. We've always said that if there's a big disconnect between our stock price, our stock price is 20-plus percent below what we think the value of the underlying assets are and that it's persistent over time when we can sell assets and buy stock, that is something we do. And we obviously did that in the first quarter, and we'll be considering that again as we go forward into the rest of the year. 
 And then ultimately, when we decide to move to offense, in terms of starting new developments and potentially acquisitions as well, I think this market is an interesting market. If you look at just the -- maybe the [indiscernible] going to improve people's outlets on transaction volumes because it sort of people came in at the beginning of the quarter when the tenure was doing pretty well at the beginning of the quarter and then all of a sudden had the big run-up that sort of [indiscernible] the energy that people had in the transaction market because if you look back, we're at transaction levels that haven't been seen since 2014. 
 So there's just not a lot of deals going on. But there should be some interesting opportunities to buy and sell where we sell some of our properties, buy other properties just to move the [indiscernible] on our portfolio to improve the quality and ultimately, the growth rate going forward, maybe market concentration. 
 So we'll look at all of those things. But like I said before, -- the -- in order for us to go on offense, we really have to -- have the peak leasing season come through the way we think it will. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. 
Ami Probandt: This is Ami on for Michael. I was just wondering, it sounds like you've made a lot of progress on the bad debt, so that's good. Is this pace of bad debt reduction sustainable? And is there potentially room for you to improve bad debt below the historical average with the enhanced screening processes? 
Alexander Jessett: Well, so the first thing I would tell you is, we think bad debt as it is today is absolutely sustainable. Keith talked about it quite a bit. If you think about Atlanta was one of our problem markets. And obviously, we have legislation there that's really helpful for us today and making sure that we can enforce contracts. And so we think we are today is certainly sustainable, and that's why we have it running through the rest of the year. Getting below 50 basis points, which is the long-term average, I think we'll have to see. 
 What we're trying to figure out today is whether or not consumer behavior has changed for the worse. And if it has, then I think it's going to be probably a constant battle through the use of technology to offset consumer behavior. But at this point, we're optimistic that we can at least get back to 50 basis points, but certainly not putting any bets on getting better than 50%. 
Richard Campo: And let me just.  Go ahead, sorry. 
Operator: The next question comes from Daniel [indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank. 
Unknown Analyst: Alex, I just wanted to clarify the second half negative 1% new lease rate growth you mentioned earlier. Does that assume the leases get to flat or positive in the third quarter before normal seasonality kind of takes over in the fourth quarter? Or is there a -- is there like a different rent dynamic assumed given the supply backdrop? 
Alexander Jessett: Yes. No. So if you think about it, the negative 1% is fairly consistent from the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So -- but the offset to that is obviously renewals. And so we're assuming that renewals are going to be close to 4% for the third and fourth quarter. So that's the offset, and that's how you get to the blend that we're talking about. And just once again, the blend that we're assuming in the third quarter is 1.6% and 1.2% in the fourth quarter. 
 So whether or not there comes a point in time where new leases are flat, we do not have that running through our model today. 
Operator: The next question comes from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. 
Adam Kramer: I wanted to ask about the cadence of supply, really the cadence of deliveries in the coming quarters and really into next year. I think the improvement so far year-to-date in new lease and what you'd be able to do with occupancy at the same time, I think are impressive in the face of kind of this unprecedented supply. I really just want to know as deliveries presumably accelerate over the coming months and quarter or 2, kind of how you view absorptions kind of in light again on this kind of accelerating delivery cadence? 
D. Keith Oden: Yes. So the -- we use -- again, [indiscernible] numbers primarily because I think he does a little bit better work, more detailed work around the pace of deliveries. And across Camden's portfolio for 20 for this year, Witten projects about 230,000 of completions. Now if you get into the granularity of how that occurs, there's probably a slight deceleration to that because Witten's got deliveries in 2025 at about 200,000. So a decline overall of about 30,000 year-over-year between '24 and '25.  But the question of that deliveries that are going to happen in 2025, I don't think there's any question that that's going to be front-end loaded because if you go back and look at the [indiscernible] data was kind of falling pretty dramatically if you kind of go to reverse engineer it 18 months backwards. So my guess is that that's pretty front-end loaded in 2025. And obviously, supply is supply, and we'll have to deal with it. But I certainly don't see 2025 being a worse scenario for us than 2024 in terms of just the total number. 
 And so far, because of all the factors Ric mentioned, our absorption rates have been really strong. And if you look at what's projected under the sort of the status quo scenario for employment growth and then continued in migration to the Sunbelt, 2025 looks if all things are equal and no hard landing, 2025 looks like another really good year for absorption of apartments. So front-end loaded supply, continued really good demand in 2025 sounds to me like a pretty constructive environment. 
Operator: Next question comes from [indiscernible] with Baird. 
Unknown Analyst: Looking at your initial [indiscernible] from last call. Have any of the expectations changed amongst the markets and which ones are maybe better or worse versus your initial thoughts? 
Keith Oden: Yes, I don't. I always look at that prior to the call, and there's nothing that jumped out at me. If I were rating the portfolio again today, I can't tell you that I would have changed any of the letter grades. I suppose maybe I would have been a little bit harsher on Austin and Nashville than I was a quarter ago because we -- those are the 2 worst-performing markets in terms of new lease rates. But we have 2 assets in Nashville and then we have our Austin exposure. Those are the only 2 that kind of jump at me and say, probably should -- probably a little worse than I thought it was going to be just a quarter out. But the rest of them would be in the same. 
Operator: Next question comes from [indiscernible] with Green Street. 
Unknown Analyst: Just wondering, do you expect to enter any new markets or exit any existing markets over the next few years? 
Richard Campo: We clearly will -- we do -- we would like to expand some of the markets like Keith pointed out, we have 2 properties in Nashville. We definitely need to have more exposure there. And we've talked over a long period of time about lowering our exposure in Houston and lowering our exposure in D.C. and increasing our exposure in some of the other markets where we have 3% or 4% of our NOI in, and we will continue to monitor and manage our portfolio over the next few years in that regard. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference -- it looks like we have a follow-up today from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Just on the new lease rate growth assumption now, the minus 1%. I guess what periods historically have you seen that improve sort of in the back half of the year when you typically see seasonality take hold? Is it a something to do with comps or getting the long-term delinquent units back that gives you the confidence that you can kind of drive new lease rate growth in a period usually has a little bit less traffic and less demand? 
Alexander Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So first of all, the third quarter is a high demand quarter for us in our markets. So that's one point. The second thing that I will tell you is that with all the pricing initiatives that we ran through the first quarter that was -- that gave us the ability to have stronger pricing as we hit peak leasing. And so that's why we think that's going to be very sort of helpful for us as we move throughout the rest of the year. 
 And then the fourth thing is, is exactly right, is the comp become much easier as we go through the rest of the year. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks. 
Richard Campo: Well, we appreciate your time today, and we did get it done under one hour, which is a record, even though we are the last but not the least in terms of reporting. So we'll look forward to seeing you in NAREIT, and thank you for being on the call. Thanks. Bye. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-02 11:00:00) =====
Kim Callahan: Good morning and welcome to Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman and President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Today's event is being webcast through the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and a replay will be available this afternoon. We will have a slide presentation in conjunction with our prepared remarks and those slides will also be available on our website later today or by e-mail upon request. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2023 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. We would like to respect everyone’s time and complete our call within one hour, so please limit your initial question to one, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: The theme for our on-hold music today was friends and teammates helping each other. The verse from the theme song of the popular TV show "Friends" sums it up nicely. I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour. I'll be there for you like I've been there before. I'll be there for you because you've been there for me, too. One of Camden's 9 core values is team players. We recognize our employees who live Camden's values through our annual ACE Awards program. Each year, Camden employees nominate their peers and co-workers for an ACE award. And from our 1,700 employees are selected to be national ACE winners. Those 14 individuals are recognized and celebrated at our national leadership meeting. Being selected as a national ACE Award winner is the highest honor that Camden associates can achieve and represents the best of the best from Team Camden. I want to introduce you to one of our national ACE Award winners for 2023, Santos Castelo. [Video being played] It's folks like Santos who make it certain that no matter what's going on in the world, Camden will always honor our 9 values to ensure that we improve the lives of our teammates, our residents and our stakeholders, one experience at a time. Our finance, accounting, legal and real estate investment teams have had a busy year-end and beginning of 2024, closing over $1.2 billion in refinancing the sales transactions. We began 2024 with a strong balance sheet and are prepared for the growth opportunities as they may develop this year. Our operations and support teams finished the year strong and are positioned to outperform our local submarket competitors again in 2024. 2024 should be a transition year from peak new apartment deliveries to a more constructive market after supply is absorbed. 2025 starts are projected to plummet to a low in the $200,000 range due to difficult market conditions. 2024 apartment absorption is projected to be a little over 400,000 units nationwide with over 200,000 units absorbed in Camden's markets. 2024 apartment demand will be driven more by demographics and migration dynamics than traditional job growth. Apartments will take market share from the single-family market. Beginning in 2011 and through 2019, apartments had an average market share of 20% of house hold formations. Apartments are projected to double that market share to 40% between 2024 and 2026. This is because, first, home affordability is at 20-year low with rising home prices and current interest rates and no signs of the pressure easing anytime soon, even with rates continuing to fall, in migration to Camden markets continues to grow. More young adults are in the workforce with solid job growth and wage growth; 30% of the households choose to live alone which is at an all-time high. Camden's markets continue to lead the nation in job growth. We look forward to what looks to be a very interesting year. I know that our Camden team is equipped and ready to excel in 2024 by being great friends and great teammates. Thank you, Team Camden for all that you do for Camden and our residents. Keith Oden is up next.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. For 2023, same-property revenue grew by 5.1%, consistent with our original projections. Six of our markets achieved results within 50 basis points of their original budget and another 6 outperformed their budgets. Of the remaining 3, L.A., Orange County and Atlanta, both underperformed mainly for reasons related to bad debt, skips and evictions and fraud. In Phoenix, the underperformance resulted from market conditions moderating more quickly than we anticipated over the course of 2023. For 2024, we anticipate same property revenue to be in the range of 0.5% to 2.5%, with the majority of our markets falling within that range. The outliers on the positive side are expected to be Southern California markets along with Southeast Florida, while Orlando, Nashville and Austin, will likely underperform given outsized competition from new supply this year. Our top 6 markets should achieve 2024 revenue growth between 2% and 4% and includes San Diego Inland Empire, Southeast Florida, Washington, D.C. Metro, L.A., Orange County, Houston and Charlotte. Our next 5 markets are budgeted for revenue growth between 1% and 2% and include Denver, Tampa, Atlanta, Raleigh and Phoenix. Our remaining 4 markets of Dallas, Orlando, Nashville and Austin, are expected to have revenue growth of plus or minus 1%. As many of you know, we have a tradition of assigning letter grades to forecast conditions in our markets at the beginning of each year and ranking our markets generally in order of their expected performance during 2024. We currently grade our overall portfolio as a B with a moderating outlook as compared to an A- with a moderating outlook last year. Our full report card is included as part of our earnings call slide deck which is incorporated into this webcast and will be available on our website after today's call. While job growth is expected to moderate over the course of 2024, the overall economy remains healthy and we expect our Sunbelt-focused market footprint will allow us to outperform the U.S. outlook. We expect to see continued in-migration into Camden's markets and strong demand for apartments homes in 2024, given the relative unaffordability of buying a single-family home. We reviewed 2024 supply forecasts from several third-party data providers and their projections range from 230,000 to 330,000 completions across our 15 markets over the course of the year. After analyzing the submarket locations and price points for these new deliveries, we expect that roughly 20% of those deliveries are between 50,000 and 70,000 new units may be competitive to our existing portfolio. Our top 3 markets for 2024 were the same as our top 3 markets for revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 and they remain strong entering 2024. Their growth rates are expected to slow from the 5% to 8% range they achieved in 2023 and thus have moderating outlooks. Therefore, we've ranked San Diego Inland Empire as an A, Southeast Florida as an A- and Washington, D.C. Metro as a B+. L.A., Orange County, Houston and Charlotte round out the top 6 with L.A., Orange County receiving a B with an improving outlook and the other 2 ranking as a B with moderating outlooks. We anticipate the improvement in LA Orange County will come primarily from a reduction in bad debt as we repopulate many of our vacant units with residents who actually pay their rent. L.A. Orange County will also see a manageable level of supply this year which should also serve as a benefit. Our Houston portfolio had steady growth during 2023 and should continue to perform well in 2024. Supply remains in check and the number of competitive deliveries in our submarkets should decline over the course of the year. Charlotte ranks as our number 6 projected market this year versus number 5 in 2023, so it is still an above average performer but with revenue growth likely closer to 2% than the almost 7% we reported in 2023. The aggregate level of supply coming into the Charlotte MSA will be elevated this year and we expect our main competition will fall in the uptown South End submarket which is slated to receive 3,000 units this year. Similar to Houston and Charlotte, Denver and Tampa also earned B ratings with moderating outlooks. Denver's revenue growth has been above average in our portfolio for the past 3 years and to continue that trend in 2024. Deliveries will tick up slightly this year, primarily in 1 or 2 of our submarkets but should be met with solid demand. Tampa has been our number 1 market over the last 3 years, averaging over 11% annual revenue growth. The growth will slow to the low single-digit range this year. New supply looks to be manageable in most of our submarkets there but we are actively monitoring our 2 recently built high-rise assets in the St. Petersburg submarket for competition with the new product being delivered there. In Atlanta, our current assessment of market conditions rates of B- with an improving outlook. Similar to L.A., Orange County, we expect to see a reduction in bad debt during 2024 which should boost our revenue growth from the less than 1% achieved in 2023. On the new supply front, the Atlanta MSA will continue to add new units in 2024 and we anticipate the most competition from deliveries in our Midtown submarket. Next up are Raleigh and Phoenix, both receiving grades of B- but with stable outlooks. In the aggregate, these markets performed just under our portfolio average in 2023 for revenue growth and they should remain in that area for 2024 with 1% to 2% growth. And once again, while both of these markets face elevated levels of supply versus historical averages, we expect that only a handful of assets in each market will face head-to-head competition from 2024 deliveries. Dallas would also rate as a B- with a stable outlook but its revenue growth may fall just under the 1% mark this year. While Dallas still ranks as one of the nation's top metros for job growth and in migration, the outsized level of supply set to deliver this year will keep pricing power and rent growth muted there. Orlando delivered outsized levels of revenue growth for the past few years but it has dropped from above average to below average in recent quarters, thus earning a C+ grade with a moderating outlook. The economy in Orlando remain strong but above average completion slated for 2024, will likely result in minimal revenue growth for the market this year. Our last 2 markets, Nashville and Austin, consistently ranked as top markets for multifamily construction and scheduled delivery of new apartments in recent quarters, while they also rank as 2 of the top U.S. markets for job growth and migration quality of life, et cetera. The sheer amount of new supply coming in 2024 will likely result in flat to slightly negative revenue growth for both of those markets. And we believe 30% to 40% of the new supply in those markets may compete directly with Camden's assets. We have signed both markets a stable outlook for the remainder of 2024 and with ratings of C and C-, respectively, given current market conditions. Now a few more details on our 2023 operating results in January 2024 trends. Rental rates for the fourth quarter had signed new leases down 4.3% and renewals up 3.9% for a blended rate of negative 0.6%. Our preliminary January results indicate a slight improvement in signed new leases and moderation in renewals for a slightly better blended rate on our January signed leases to date. February and March renewal offers were sent out with an average increase of 4.1%. Occupancy averaged 94.9% during the fourth quarter '23. In January 2024 occupancy is trending in the same range. And as expected, move-outs to purchase homes remained very low at 10.4% for the fourth quarter of '23, 10.7% for the full year of '23. January move-outs will likely remain in the same range. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate and capital markets activity. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed construction on Camden NoDA, a 387-unit, $108 million community in Charlotte which is now approximately 90% leased. We began leasing at Camden Wood Mill Creek, a 189 unit, $75 million single-family rental community located in the Woodlands, Texas and we continued leasing at Camden Durham, a 420-unit, $145 million new development in Durham, North Carolina. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, we sold Camden Martinique, a 714 unit 38-year-old community in Costa Mesa, California, for $232 million. The community was sold at an approximate 5.5% yield after management fees and actual CapEx and generated a 10.6% unleveraged return over our almost 26-year hold period. Additionally, during the quarter, we issued $500 million of 3-year senior unsecured notes with a fixed coupon of 5.85%. We subsequently swapped the entire amount of the offering to floating rate at SOFR plus 112 basis points. After quarter end, we issued $400 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes with a fixed coupon of 4.9% and a yield of 4.94%. Also, after quarter end, we prepaid our $300 million floating rate term loan. And on January 16, we repaid at maturity a $250 million 4.4% senior unsecured note. In conjunction with the term loan prepayment, we will recognize a noncore charge of approximately $900,000 and associated with unamortized loan costs. As of today, approximately 85% of our debt is fixed rate. We have almost full availability under our $1.2 billion credit facility and we have less than $300 million of maturities over the next 24 months with only $138 million left to fund under our existing development pipeline. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 4x. Turning to financial results. Last night, we reported core funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $190.5 million or $1.73 per share, $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance. This outperformance resulted almost entirely from lower-than-anticipated levels of bad debt. As previously reported, in September, we experienced an unusual spike in bad debt which we forecasted to extend through the fourth quarter. Fortunately, September appears to have been an anomaly and bad debt for the fourth quarter averaged 1.1% as compared to our forecast of 1.5%. Additionally, we delivered same-store occupancy for the fourth quarter of 94.9%, 10 basis points ahead of our forecast. For 2023, we delivered same-store revenue growth of 5.1%, expense growth of 6.7% and NOI growth of 4.3%. You can refer to Page 24 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2024 financial outlook. We expect our 2024 core FFO per share to be in the range of $6.59 to $6.89 and with the midpoint of $6.74 representing an $0.08 per share decrease from our 2023 results. This decrease is anticipated to result primarily from an approximate $0.07 per share increase in core FFO related to the growth in operating income from our development, non-same-store and retail communities resulting primarily from the incremental contribution from our 7 development communities in lease-up during either 2023 and/or 2024. A $0.07 per share decrease in interest expense attributable to approximately $185 million of lower average anticipated debt balances outstanding in 2024 as compared to 2023, partially offset by lower levels of capitalized interest as we complete certain development communities. The lower debt balances result from the previously mentioned Camden Martinique disposition and an additional $115 million disposition of an Atlanta community scheduled for next week. For 2024, we are anticipating $41 million on average outstanding under our line of credit with an average rate of approximately 5.5% and at an average rate approximately [indiscernible] unsecured bond. We are not anticipating any additional unsecured bond offerings in 2024. A $0.035 per share increase in fee and asset management and interest and other income, resulting from increased third-party general contracting fees and interest earned on cash balances. We are assuming average cash balances of $60 million in 2024, earning approximately 4.6%. This $0.175 cumulative increase in anticipated core FFO per share is entirely offset by an approximate $0.155 per share decrease in core FFO from the $293 million of 2023 completed dispositions and an approximate $0.06 per share decrease from the disposition anticipated next week and an approximate $0.04 per share decrease, resulting primarily from the combination of higher general and administrative and property management expenses. At the midpoint, we are expecting flat same-store net operating income with revenue growth of 1.5% and expense growth of 4.5%. Each 1% increase in same-store NOI is approximately $0.085 per share in core FFO. Our 2024 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 1.5% is based upon an approximate 0.5% earning at the end of 2023 and at an effectively flat loss to lease. We also expect a 1.4% increase in market rental rates from December 31, 2023, to December 31, 2024, recognizing half of this annual market rental rate increase, combined with our embedded growth results in a budgeted 1.2% increase in 2024 net market rents. We are assuming that bad debt continues to moderate through the year, reaching 1% by the fourth quarter and averaging 1.1% for the full year, a 30 basis point improvement over 2023. When combining our 1.2% increase in net market rents, with our 30 basis point decline in bad debt, we are budgeting 2024 rental income growth of 1.5%. Rental income encompasses 89% of our total rental revenues. The remaining 11% of our property revenues is primarily comprised of utility rebilling and other fees and is anticipated to grow at a similar level to our rental income due to decreased pricing power and increased regulatory constraints. Our 2024 same-store expense growth midpoint of 4.5% results primarily from anticipated above-average insurance increases. Insurance represents 7.5% of our total operating expenses and is anticipated to increase by 18% as insurance providers continue to face large global losses and resulting financial pressures. Our remaining operating expenses are anticipated to grow at approximately 3.4% in the aggregate, including property taxes which represented approximately 36% of our total operating expenses and are projected to increase approximately 3% in 2024. Excluding our planned disposition next week, the midpoint of our guidance range assumes $250 million of acquisitions, offset by an additional $250 million of dispositions with no net accretion or dilution from these matching transactions. Page 24 of our supplemental package also details other assumptions for 2024, including the plan for up to $300 million of development starts in the second half of the year and approximately $175 million of total 2024 development spend. We expect core FFO per share for the first quarter of 2024 to be within the range of $1.65 to $1.69. The midpoint of $1.67 represents a $0.06 per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2023 which is primarily the result of an approximate $0.035 per share sequential decline in same-store NOI, driven by an approximate $0.04 per share increase in sequential same-store expenses resulting from the timing of quarterly tax refunds, the reset of our annual property tax accrual on January 1 of each year and other expense increases, primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends, including the timing of on-site salary increases. This is partially offset by a $0.005 per share increase in sequential same-store revenue, primarily from higher levels of fee and other income. We are anticipating occupancy will remain effectively flat quarter-to-quarter. An approximate $0.035 per share decrease attributable to our December 28, 2023, $232 million disposition of Camden Martinique, an approximate $0.01 per share decrease attributable to our planned $115 million disposition next week and an approximate $0.05 per share decrease resulting primarily from the timing of various other corporate accruals. This $0.085 per share cumulative decrease in quarterly sequential core FFO is partially offset by an approximate $0.015 per share decrease in interest expense resulting from the lower debt balances as a result of the disposition proceeds and an approximate $0.01 per share increase in core FFO, related to additional interest income earned on cash balances. Anticipated noncore adjustments for the first quarter include a combined $0.03 from freeze damage related to winter storm, Jerry, the previously mentioned charge associated with unamortized loan costs from our term loan and costs associated with litigation matters. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.
Michael Goldsmith: Can you just talk a little bit about the macro assumptions that you have built into your guidance today, we're seeing 353,000 jobs added. So how much elasticity is there in your guidance that could be influenced by the job market. And then along those lines also, are there continue -- can you provide an update a little bit on the migration trips to the Sunbelt as part of your response.
Ric Campo: Sure. So -- the job number today and the revision for December was definitely, I think, the market pre-treating it a blowout, right? And it certainly is; and our overall economic backdrop for what we think demand is going to be in our markets is definitely not based on blowout numbers. Clearly, job we thought and I think most of the market believe that job growth has slowed dramatically in 2024. So obviously, more job growth helps us. When you look at where the job growth is, it's in our markets. If you look at Texas and Florida have led the nation in job growth post COVID and we'll continue to do that. So it obviously is very good for us and it's not -- that kind of drop growth is definitely not baked into our numbers. When you think about what's really driving demand in 2024 and 2025, we don't think it was an increased job growth driving that demand. What's been happening is multifamily has been taking market share from single family as I said in my in the beginning of the call, we've gone from a historic average of 20% multifamily demand in total household formations to 40% and that's driven by everything we know, right, that single-family market is really hard for somebody to buy a house today. I mean we had, I think, a total of 10.7 of people moved out to buy houses at Camden in 2023. And so when you think about those dynamics and there's other broader dynamics, too which is 30% of Americans today are living alone and that benefits apartments. And that number is way up from the past time frame. So the blowout job numbers obviously help our numbers. And if we continue at this at this level, it will be pretty interesting. As far as in-migration, Alex, you can talk about in migration. When you look at the demand side, for example, we expect over 200,000 units of demand in 2024 and that's on a 220-unit supply, right, plus or minus, or completions. And so it's pretty balanced when you get down to it. But ultimately, when you look out, for example, their projection is showing 380,000 total demand for the U.S. from 400,000 in '24, 380 in '25. So demand is being driven by different drivers today, not just the old adage of 1 apartment for every 5 jobs. It just doesn't work anymore because of the in-migration. The other thing also is not just in-migration from other cities. It's actually a total immigration because immigration was way down during COVID and now it's back to more normal and those immigrants tend to tend to -- and this is legal immigration, I'm not a pining on board or anything like that but it's -- so that's helped us too. Alex, you might hit the end migration a bit.
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So we continue to have really strong in migration to our apartment. So if you look at those who have moved from non-Sunbelt to Sunbelt for us, in the fourth quarter, it was about 17.5% of our total move-ins. By the way, that's fairly consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. So that remains really strong. And 1 of the other things that we track is that we track Google searches from people in New York or people in California looking for apartments to rent in our markets. And just to give you a really -- this is interesting to me, New York searches for Texas apartments were up 72% in the fourth quarter of '23 as compared to the fourth quarter of '22. California searches for Texas apartments were up 52% in the fourth quarter of '23 to the -- as compared to the fourth quarter of '22. So still very strong demand for folks coming out of New York, out of California to our markets.
Operator: Next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: But I guess I had a question on what you're implicit blended new and renewal kind of leasing spreads were and maybe how that tied into your occupancy assumptions. I guess what I'm really asking is are you guys really solving more for occupancy here and will give up on the new rate side? Or are you willing to let occupancy drift lower and sort of keep pricing firmer?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So we're assuming that occupancy is going to be flat in 2024 as compared to 2023 and that number is 95.3%. And we are driving towards that number. When we look at new lease and renewals and the trade out for the full year. What we're anticipating is new leases to be down 0.6%, renewals up 3.6% for a blended increase of 1.2%. And that is going to sort of follow what you would think be typical seasonal patterns.
Operator: The next question will come from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: Can you just talk about how your assumptions for rent growth in '24 compared to how you would guide in a normal year without all these supply headwinds? I think you said 1.4% market rent growth. So where would you normally start the year? And I guess -- why is that the right differential to that given the supply backdrop?
Alex Jessett: Yes. We would typically -- I mean, obviously, every year is different and every year has its own unique parameters around supply and demand in our business, the typical year is 3%. And you can see that we're at 1.4% and that's obviously driven by the supply factors are there. As we've talked about on the prepared remarks, we think demand is still incredibly strong but we are cognitive of the supply issues and that's why you're coming up with a 1.4% for the full year.
Keith Oden: So Brad, just put it in context on the issue of demand and the job number that came out today, we used 2 primary data providers. They had very different views about employment growth for 2024 and we basically ended up taking the midpoint the 2 of them because they both had their own story that they could tell around it. But the midpoint of our 2 data providers forecast for total employment growth across Camden's markets for 2024 was about $300,000. And we just got that in the month of January. So it's -- I think we've tried to build in some realism around the numbers and the forecast. But clearly, our forecast did not anticipate anything like having the entire job growth projected for the year in the first month so.
Operator: The next question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: I was just wondering, I know you guys don't offer concessions across the stabilized portfolio but just wondering what kind of has changed just on concessions as far as what you're seeing across those markets that are most exposed to some of the new supply?
Ric Campo: It's very typical of what we've seen. The toughest markets like would be Austin, Texas and Nashville. And there -- the concessions are significant, anywhere from 2 to 3 months free. Generally, merchant builders don't go beyond 3 months free but you're seeing that in the most supply constraint or supply markets. When you get to more markets that aren't as pressured, then compared to those 2, you're anywhere from 1 month to 6 weeks to 2 months max. And that's kind of what we're seeing in some of the other markets.
Operator: The next question will come from Rich Anderson with Wedbush.
Rich Anderson: So I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the longer-term view. Your Avalon and EQR said, well, peak supply in '24 means peak revenue declines in 2025 or in theory, no one knows for sure. Do you feel like that is at least in the wheelhouse of a possibility in that what we're seeing today in terms of your outlook which I think most people think looks better than expectations going in, could actually sort of see a downdraft next year as the full lot of the supply is absorbed into your portfolio?
Ric Campo: Based on some of the providers we use, they show an uptick in '25 and our market is not a downtick. And if you think about the supply discussion that I had a minute ago, the supply project or the supply we know about the demand is the real issue, right? So when you look at the demand projections for this year, it's -- they're nationwide, over 400,000 units. And then the projection for the following year, even with a slow -- very low job growth mark, is something like 380,000 units of demand. So the demand drivers, interestingly enough, are just not usual demand drivers in multifamily. It's always been about job growth, right? And today, it's about taking market share from single families, single-family market because it's so upside down on a cost to rent perspective and lack of inventory in the resale market. And what's happened -- what's really interesting is that is that if you want to buy a new house in America today, you pretty much have to buy or if you want to buy a house, you pretty much have to buy a new house. And when you look at the usually, when interest rates go up this high, the single-family homebuilders all crash and lay people off of. They had about a 5- or 6-month hiatus and then went back to hard core building houses because there was no inventory to be for single-family buyers to buy and that's continuing. So I think that these demand drivers that are actually -- that are driving this really positive outlook for demand in 2024 are going to be in place in 2025 as well. And especially if you have a backdrop of job growth that looks like it's -- it's -- I'm not sure you can say January is going to be a print every month in this year. But clearly, the job market is a lot stronger than people thought it might be and that could help with the absorption and in 2025 as well. So I haven't seen very many projections that show 2025 where rents are going down. They bought them. Most of the numbers that we see from folks are bottoming in 2024 and then they start an uptick in 2025 because you've absorbed a lot -- so many units in 2024.
Operator: Next question will come from Eric Wolfe with Citi.
Eric Wolfe: So correct me if this is wrong but I assume that you had to gain the lease today. So I was just wondering based on your history, if there's a certain gain to lease level where you're no longer able to pass through like 3.5% to 4% type renewal increases. And then for that 4.1% renewals you sent out for February and March. I was wondering what the rate sort of achieve rate to think about would be on that?
Alex Jessett: So first of all, we're actually not at a gain to lease. We have -- we're basically a flat -- no loss lease or gain to lease. When you think about renewals, we're anticipating the fourth -- excuse me, the first quarter that we're going to get at right around 3.9%. So fairly close to what we're sending out and then the other question which I think is sort of really around the differential between new leases and renewals. When we look at our math, the differential for the full year actual percentage-wise between somebody with a signed a new lease for a renewal is really only about 1.5% differential. So it's not that significant and not something that we think is problematic.
Operator: The next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Good morning. Just hoping you could talk about development for a moment here. I see you have up to $300 million of new starts, including the guide. So curious when we could see those start, how they're penciling today from a yield or IRR perspective in which markets we can see those in?
Ric Campo: The developments that we have in that model or in the model are in Charlotte and their suburban 3-story walk-up type product. And we would start those depending on how the year unfolds in the back half of the year, so that we could deliver into '26 and '27. And the yields are anywhere from in the mid-5s to low 6s in terms of stabilized yields. And when you look at IRRs, it's really kind of complicated to figure an IRR today given what are you going to expect cap rates to be. But ultimately, we think there's going to be a pretty constructive market in '26 and '27 when these properties deliver. We have another -- a number of them in the pipeline as well in other markets. But these 2 because they're pretty simple and they come in at a price point that's very affordable relative to urban high-rise in the same market is pretty attractive.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And then maybe on the real estate tax guide. You also, I think you mentioned, Alex, 3.5%, I think it was embedded in your same-store expense guide there. A little bit lower than I think a lot of us were thinking and certainly given what we've seen recently I'm curious if we're kind of past the peak headwinds there for real estate taxes and selling into a new norm here or maybe you're perhaps benefiting from something else that's less obvious to us.
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So the property tax number that we have in our guidance is 3%. And if you think about it, it's really the same number that we experienced in 2023. And so it seems that we are reverting back to the long-term mean which is in that sort of 3% to 3.5% range. Really, the big driver that you have is Texas. And as we discussed in prior earnings calls, Texas is very favorable when it comes to property taxes, especially with a new bill that was passed last year. And so we're receiving the benefit of that for a second year in a row. And we actually think that our total property taxes in Texas are going to be up about 2.2% which is really a pretty low number and that makes up about 40% of all of our property taxes. So that's the primary driver there.
Operator: The next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Just want to go back. I think Ric or Keith, I think at the beginning of the call, you mentioned the expectation for nationally 400,000 unit absorption this year, 200,000 of which would be in the Camden markets. But I think they're like close to 700,000, 650,000 units expected to be delivered this year. So just wanted to better understand the comments around absorption. And then also as part of that, are you -- we all understand what's going on with the supply but -- are you suggesting that the share of housing going to apartments versus single-family will obviously continue to sustain. And therefore, versus historically where jobs would be more of the factor. It's really more the household formation that's really the factor now into next year.
Ric Campo: It sounds like you answered the question. Yes, that's what's going on. I mean we're -- without amazing job growth, we're still able to produce a lot of demand and it's all a function of different demand drivers and jobs, right? And today, if you look at the share that we're -- that apartments are taking from the household formations and you look at it historically, it's double what it has been for a long time. And so that's -- it's almost the same as what's happening in the single-family for sale market is their market share has doubled at least and maybe even tripled from the norm because of the lack of inventory of single-family homes to buy because of the lock-in effect. So you have an interesting situation here where we are continuing to benefit from the high cost of homeownership and continuing to benefit from in migration, both international immigration and migration from other cities. So yes, there's a lot of units under construction. We know that. But the demand, it seems to be if these demand numbers are close to being right, is going to create if you will, a soft landing for the supply. And that's kind of the -- that's the model that we put forth there.
Alexander Goldfarb: Are you adjusting that the 400 million versus the 770 million.
Ric Campo: No. Well, 670 is not what the absorption is going to be, Keith, you have those absorption numbers we discussed today.
Keith Oden: In Camden's markets, yes, the completions that we have that we're modeling are 230,000 apartments across Camden's platform in 2024. And that number drops to about 200 in 2025. So just to make sure we're talking apples and apples versus national numbers. It's 230 in Camden's markets.
Ric Campo: Yes. And that 600 coming in the pipeline doesn't all get delivered in 2024. A part of that is into 2025 as well.
Operator: Next question will come from [indiscernible] with Wells Fargo.
Unidentified Analyst: I just wanted to get your thoughts on timing of fundamentals. So just thinking about your guidance for new leases, slightly negative but they were much worse in January on both effective and signed. And then if you look at your current occupancy versus your projected occupancy, it seems like an uptick. So do you think that when you think about the first half versus the back half, do you think it gets better into the back half and that's where the pickup is? Or do you think that January was -- or January is kind of an anomaly and the numbers are just going to look better off the bat?
Alex Jessett: So the first thing I would tell you is if you look at our signed new leases in January -- excuse me, our signed blended leases in January are better than are effective which is a leading indicator of improvements. What we are anticipating that we're going to have blended trade outs in the first quarter of about 0.2%. So a slight uptick from where we are today but we are anticipating that occupancy is going to remain flat in the first quarter at 95%. And then the improvement comes throughout the year. As number one, we have better comps which are very helpful for us. And then we also sort of hit our seasonal strong periods as we move from the second quarter into the third quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: And then you think it stays strong in 4Q or you think [indiscernible]
Alex Jessett: Yes, we've got a 4Q blended trade out of 1.6% and occupancy of about 95.2. So I think that sort of follows the normal seasonal patterns that you would see.
Operator: The next question will come from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Kramer: I just wanted to ask about external growth and acquisitions specifically given where the balance sheet is at -- to EBITDA at 4x at quarter end, I mean what would kind of be needed to happen for them to be upside to the acquisition number? And you kind of step into that underlevered balance sheet?
Keith Oden: So the primary thing that would have to happen on acquisitions is we have to see better going in yields, even though there's been a lot of transaction volumes are way down. There's still a huge bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers. They're just -- we just don't see -- we don't see value right now in the acquisition market versus other uses of capital. Now that's not to say that at some point, that doesn't change. I mean, obviously, there is with all of this new supply that's been built and primarily by the merchant build community. At some point, they need to move past the current crop of their development pipeline and kind of recharge their organizations. They are in the business of building apartments. And so they're all -- I think they all have way too much -- way more than they would normally care to have in terms of their development pipeline and holdings. So at some point, there's going to be a rationalization not just in the rental supply market between supply demand. But in the transaction market between a product that needs to find a permanent home, not in the merchant build community and people that are willing to provide that and have the capital to do it. So we are in the latter group, we just don't think we're there yet. And we just think being patient right now is the right strategy for the acquisition market.
Ric Campo: Analog [ph] just completed this week and we had, of course, our huge team out there and this is kind of the start of the sort of acquisition disposition dance. And people were -- compared to last year -- last year, I would categorize as during the headlights. And this year is a little less during the headlights and more cautious optimism because rates have come down some. And that's keeping some of the pressure off of people having to sell. But there's still just a massive bid as spread between people who want to buy versus people who want to sell. And so the question will be how do the operating fundamentals look going forward? And what -- how do people feel about the world and what happens to rates. And I think people are more optimistic now that they can enter the acquisition market because -- last year was, I don't want to make a mistake what if the Fed does all these things now we're on a trajectory, it looks like to lower rates someday. And therefore, it's easier to sort of create a model that works financially today with a falling rate scenario in the next 2 or 3 years. But we're not there yet for sure in terms of that inflection point.
Operator: The next question will come from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: I wanted to ask about dispositions. I guess, this month, you're going to be selling Camden Vantage in Atlanta. Why this particular asset is not old. It's in one of your core Sunbelt markets. We calculated the cap rate north of 7%, so I didn't see like pricing was that great. But going forward, where else do you see this decision activity, will it be in California or focused on more of your older products?
Alex Jessett: So I'll take the cap rate question first and then I think maybe Keith can opine on the disposition choice. But for Camden Vantage, we are showing this at using actual CapEx and a management fee at a 5.75% cap rate. Tax adjusted 5.65% cap rate and an AFFO yield before management fees of 6.09%. So definitely a lower yield than you're calculating.
Keith Oden: Yes. And on the dispose side, I mean we keep a list of and have ongoing conversations with our operating groups about if there were to be a sale out of one of your markets or submarkets which assets would be in that conversation. And Vantage almost always came up as 1 that would be on the list of management's list of assets that they would rather someone else take care of. So I'll just leave it at that.
John Kim: Can I just follow up what was the CapEx consumption on the on Vantage?
Alex Jessett: Yes. The CapEx on that one, I think it's probably around $1,800 a door but I'll have to get back to you the exact.
Operator: Next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney.
Rob Stevenson: Just on the dispositions, given how low your leverage sizeable free cash flow and the minimal development spending remaining. How aggressive are you willing to be and sell more assets without corresponding acquisitions? Because it seems like given Keith's acquisition market commentary that acquisitions at best would be back half end loaded and may not come at all if the rest doesn't come.
Keith Oden: Yes. So our guidance assumes that we basically match dispositions and acquisitions. So we would look to be kind of net 0 on the year. And the answer on the acquisitions really dispositions kind of gets back to when we find value and we believe that there's a real opportunity on acquisitions, then we would those clearly would be assets that we wanted to -- newer assets that we want to add to the portfolio and we're always willing to improve the portfolio by selling a corresponding number of dollar amount of assets that to fund that. So our working assumption and what's reflected in the guidance is, is that we're willing to be pretty aggressive when we see value in acquisitions but not before then.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just a point of clarity. The mid-5 to low 6s that you guys talked about on development yields on a stabilized basis. Was that for the 2 Charlotte ones that you might start this year? Or was that to stabilize yields on the 4 properties in the current development pipeline?
Ric Campo: Actually, the numbers are the same. The current development pipeline, we have some in the sort of the low to mid-6s and some in the sort of low 5s. The new developments in Charlotte, we're still working on what the model looks like but we wouldn't start them if they were in that zone.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And are you seeing any real relief on materials or labor on the development side, given the sort of pull back in other areas of development? Or is it still competitively priced versus the last couple of years?
Ric Campo: Not yet. We haven't seen a big -- any big drops in cost. What's happened is the costs haven't been going up as much. I mean if you go back a couple of years, we were having like 1% to 1.5% inflation every single month. And so today, that's a little -- you don't have that part of the equation but there hasn't been a material shift in pricing. And that's 1 of the challenges you have every merchant builder and Camden has is that if costs aren't coming down but rents are flat and it's a very competitive market, you just -- it's really hard to justify new construction. That's why the starts are projected to fall to low 200,000s in 2025. It's just that a math doesn't really work well when rents are flat and construction costs haven't fallen.
Operator: The next question will come from Wes Golladay with Baird.
Wes Golladay: Question on the development delivery forecast. Do you think this year is going to be more at risk to delays versus prior years? And are you seeing any of the developers going bust yet?
Ric Campo: We haven't seen anybody going bust yet. And I think that banks are definitely, we hear a lot of anecdotal information about banks working very well with their borrowers today. The banks are much more -- they're well capitalized and the -- it's pretty common knowledge that in the next couple of years, the economic drop -- backdrop of operating fundamentals and lower interest rates are all going to help -- it's going to help get some of these deals through that system. So in terms of that perspective, I don't think that you're going to have any -- there's not going to be any major bankruptcies for major defaults with merchant builders they might be stressed to sell but that doesn't mean there -- I think there's still equity in their deals, most of them anyway. In terms of delays, it's still hard to get a project to be delivered when you expect it to because so many people left the labor for us. We don't have excess labor supply. And so there's still a fair amount of risk in deliveries and when the delivery is going to come. And so that could actually be beneficial to the backdrop of our supply and demand equation. If starts do plummet or I think they will but let's start when you actually start seeing more and more of that, if we delay some of the '24 supply into '25 and some of the '25 into '26, that could be a lot smoother softer landing for those markets given the demand side.
Operator: The next question will come from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone: Yes, thanks. So it sounds like the stress is in the system just isn't there to create a lot of opportunities right now. So wondering what it might take for you to use some capacity to buy back stock?
Keith Oden: Yes. We've -- it's something that we look at constantly in terms of the opportunity set for allocation of capital. And in the past, we haven't been bashful about buying back stock when it made sense to do so. It's always a little bit of a challenge because of the rules and the trappings around buying stock in size and doing it in the windows that are available. But yes, it's something we've talked about. We've discussed and that we would pursue when the -- when we think the opportunity makes sense.
Operator: The next question will come from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes. Just thoughts on bad debt expense. The forecast was $24 million, 1.1% of total revenues doesn't really change that much from where you were in 4Q. So just wondering why we're not seeing incremental improvement kind of post all the moratoriums and improvements on the fraud management side.
Alex Jessett: So I think we're sort of in unprecedented times right now where we're trying to figure out what is the new normal. And so at this point, what we're assuming is that the first and second quarter look a lot like the fourth quarter. And then we have some slight improvements as we go into the latter part of the year. Clearly, if we return to 50 basis points which is what our historic norm had been before all of this, then we got some potential upside sort of running through the math. But at this point, we're just being patient and seeing how it plays out.
Omotayo Okusanya: Fair enough.
Operator: The next question will come from Robin Lu with Green Street.
Robin Lu: Alex, just a question for you. There was a step up in CapEx budget for the year, particularly in nonrecurring CapEx. Can you provide more detail as to what's driving the high spend?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So we've got a couple of things that are running through the nonrecurring side. And they're mainly focused around a couple of communities we have that have some large exterior projects and foundational projects that we need to do. So that's what you've got going through the math.
Robin Lu: Do you expect that to extend to other properties in like '25 or '26 as well.
Alex Jessett: No, I don't think so. We go through and we look at all of our communities, really do a deep dive every year, as you would expect. And so these were a couple of communities that have been identified -- as I said, they did have the foundational and exterior challenges that we knew we needed to fix. And so our intention is to get it done in 2024 and I wouldn't expect to see a number like this in '25.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ric Campo for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
Ric Campo: Great. Well, thank you for being on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to go through what 2024 looks like to be an interesting year. So we'll see you in the conference circle in circuit here in the next month or two. So, take care and thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim, and good morning. Our on-hold music was in honor of and memory of Jimmy Buffett. One of Jimmy’s recurring things in his songs was how to navigate through life’s storms, including actual hurricanes. Ironically, this is the first year in memory that we did not have any hurricanes in any of our markets. On the other hand, the hurricane in the capital markets is blowing hard. As a result of the turmoil, we’re encouraging our teams to heed Jimmy’s advice from one of his songs that he wrote for New Orleans after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. This is from the song. If a hurricane doesn’t leave you dead, it’ll make you strong. Don’t try to explain it, just nod your head, breathe in, breathe out, move on, which is exactly what we plan to do. Our business is strong. We’ve been through many cycles. This cycle has been different in that we’re coming off the best year we ever had driven by the COVID reopening consumer high. 2023 has been a year of getting back to a more normal multi-family business. I say more normal because we’re still not back to normal customer behavior, where they actually pay their rent and if they don’t, they move out. We have high cancellations due to identity theft and fraud, elevated skips and lease breaks. Seasonality is back, but it started earlier this year and was stronger than pre-COVID levels. We had planned for a more normal fourth quarter, but that didn’t happen. As a result, we have revised our fourth quarter full year guidance to reflect weaker new lease growth, lower occupancy and higher bad debts than we expected even in the summer. In a normal growth year, however, we would cheer for revenue growth of 5%. Fundamentals for our business are good overall, taking the challenges and the opportunities together. On the demand side, job growth remains robust, U.S. consumer demographics continue to be supportive for apartment demand, the share of 25 to 34-year-olds is stable, the share of 34 to 48 year olds is growing and they have a high propensity to rent, given the record high cost of buying a home. The buy to rent premium today is at 30-year highs with home ownership out of reach for many people. This should increase apartment’s – the apartment business share of the housing market at least through 2026. The U.S. share of – or the share of U.S. households that are living alone continues to grow to nearly 30% over the next few years. The long-term trend of in-migration to our markets continues. On the supply side, starts have peaked and the capital markets hurricane has begun to reduce new starts. Annualized August starts fell 42%. Witten Advisors projects starts will fall to 250,000 units in 2024 and just above 200,000 units in 2025. Completions will be elevated through the end of 2024, but demand drivers should allow for an orderly lease absorption in our markets. I want to give a big thanks and shout-out to team Camden for improving the lives of our teammates, our customers, and our stakeholders one experience at a time. Keith Oden is up next.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Overall, our third quarter 2023 operating results were in line with expectations. Year-over-year same property revenue growth was positive for the quarter in 14 of our 15 markets and positive on both a sequential and year-to-date basis in all of our markets. Occupancy for the third quarter averaged 95.6% ending September at 95.3% as we shifted more to a defensive strategy entering our slower leasing season in the fourth and first quarters. October occupancy is currently trending at 94.9% and should continue to moderate slightly over the remainder of the year. Rents are also moderating given our focus on maintaining occupancy versus raising rental rates. During the third quarter, our effective growth rates were eight-tenths of a percent for new leases, 5.9% for renewals, and 3.4% for blended rate growth. Effective net – new lease growth for October is currently negative 2.5% and is expected to trend a bit further down a bit further between now and the end of the year. Effective renewal rate growth for October to date is 4.7% and should average around 4% for the full fourth quarter. Effective blended lease rates for October remain positive at 1.4%. Gross turnover rates for the third quarter were up 200 basis points compared to last year due to higher levels of skips and lease breaks, but our net turnover was down 200 basis points due to high levels of resident retention by our onsite teams. Move-outs to purchase homes accounted for just over 10% of our total move-outs during the quarter, which is near the lowest level we’ve seen in over the past 30 years. Supply will remain a factor in many of our markets for the next several quarters and as expected we are seeing elevated competition for our Camden communities, located in those submarkets where new deliveries exceed long-term historical averages. 16% of Camden’s communities are being impacted by new supply, but the vast majority are not. We are seeing some encouraging news regarding the future as the level of new starts has begun to fall, which bodes well for the supply environment in 2025 and 2026. I’ll now turn it over to Alex Jessett, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. For the third quarter, we reported core FFO of $1.73 per share in line with the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance. Although our net results met expectations, we experienced $0.015 of lower-than-anticipated revenue for the quarter, which was entirely offset by $0.015 of lower-than-anticipated expenses. The lower revenue resulted primarily from an unexpected rise in bad debt. Our lower-than-anticipated operating expenses resulted almost entirely from lower property taxes in Texas. As previously discussed, the Texas State legislature passed a tax reform bill, subject to voter approval in November. Upon approval, which we believe is likely Senate Bill 2 will reduce independent school district tax rates by $0.107 per $100 of assessed value. Average independent school district tax rates in our Texas markets are approximately 1% of assessed value, or 45% of the total Texas tax rate. Therefore, excluding valuation increases and other tax rate increases, this anticipated reduction equates to an approximate 4.8% reduction in Texas taxes. We had previously assumed these independent school district tax rate rollbacks in Texas would be partially offset by other Texas rate increases. However, these other increases have not occurred. We now expect total property taxes to increase by 2.9% as compared to our prior expectations of 4.5%, for a total savings of $0.025 per share from our prior guidance. $ 0.015 of this savings occurred in the third quarter, and the remaining $0.01 will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Turning back to revenue, we had expected same-store bad debt would be 100 basis points for the third quarter, 90 basis points for the fourth quarter and 120 basis points for the full year. Instead, bad debt was 40 basis points higher or 140 basis points in total for the third quarter, with the increase happening primarily in September. And we are now anticipating 150 basis points of bad debt for both the fourth quarter and full year 2023. This 40 basis point increase in bad debt for the third quarter equates to approximately $0.01 per share, and the 60 basis point increase in the fourth quarter equates to approximately $0.015 per share. In conjunction with the increase in bad debt on rental revenues, we also experienced higher bad debt on administrative and other fees of another $0.005 per share for the third quarter, and we are anticipating the same additional $0.005 for fees in the fourth quarter. We believe this higher bad debt is primarily consumer behavior driven and not tied to financial stress of our residents. Our prior guidance called for 95.6% same-store average occupancy in the third and fourth quarters with fairly consistent occupancy levels throughout the back half of the year. We actually had higher than anticipated occupancy in both July and August, entirely offset by lower occupancy of 95.3% in September. In combination with higher than anticipated skips and evictions, we believe that historic seasonality, which has been unpredictable since the pandemic has returned. We now anticipate occupancy will average 94.8% in the fourth quarter, and the impact of this 80 basis point adjustment from prior estimates is approximately $0.02 per share. As a result of the decline in occupancy, we lowered asking rents more than anticipated in September. We had expected a 1.5% average increase in new leases and a 5% average increase in renewals for a blend of approximately 3.25% in the back half of the year. Our effective blended rates were higher than this at 3.4% for the third quarter. However, lower occupancy caused a reduction in signed rates, which is flowing through our fourth quarter guidance. We are now anticipating fourth quarter new leases of negative 4.5% and a 4% average increase in renewals for a blend of approximately negative 0.7%, resulting in a decline of approximately $0.015 per share for the fourth quarter. The cumulative same-store impact of the greater than anticipated third and fourth quarter bad debt and lower fourth quarter occupancy and rents is approximately $0.07 per share, of which $0.055 per share is in the fourth quarter. As a result, we have decreased the midpoint of our full year same-store revenue guidance from 5.65% to 5%, effectively in line with our original revenue guidance midpoint at the beginning of this year. Turning to expenses, as previously mentioned, we had $0.015 of favorability, primarily in taxes, in the third quarter. We are also anticipating favorability in taxes of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter. This $0.025 of tax favorability is anticipated to be partially offset by $0.015 of higher fourth quarter repair and maintenance and marketing expenses associated with higher skips and evictions and lower occupancy. As a result, we have adjusted the midpoint of our full year same-store expense guidance from 6.85% to 6.5% or a net $0.01 per share. Our resulting full year same-store NOI midpoint has been reduced from 5% to 4.2%. Last night, we also lowered the midpoint of our full year 2023 core FFO guidance by $0.07 per share to a new midpoint of $6.81 per share. This $0.07 per share decline resulted primarily from the previously mentioned $0.035 per share increase in same-store bad debt, the $0.02 per share decrease in same-store occupancy and the $0.015 per share decline in same-store rents, partially offset by the $0.01 per share in lower property expenses resulting from lower taxes. In addition to this net $0.06 per share decline in same-store NOI, we are also anticipating an additional $0.01 in lower non-same-store NOI for similar reasons. We also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2023. We expect core FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of a $1.70 to $1.74. The midpoint of a $1.72 represents a $0.01 per share decline from the $1.73 recorded in the third quarter. This is primarily the result of approximately $0.01 in lower same-store NOI, resulting from $0.035 in decreased revenue, driven by 80 basis points of lower occupancy and 10 basis points of higher bad debt, partially offset by $0.025 in lower property expenses resulting from typical seasonal declines. Our balance sheet remains strong with net-debt-to-EBITDA at 4.1 times and at quarter end we had $181 million left to spend over the next two years under our existing development pipeline. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. How have concessions on the Merchantville products trended over the last two months? Are there any other notable drivers on the consumer side? And then alongside this, are you seeing supply impact properties that you previously thought would compete directly with new supply due to either submarket or price point? Thank you.
Ric Campo: Let me take the first part and I’ll let Keith do the last part. So from a merchant builder perspective, there is an old joke in the merchant builder world that you don’t want to be the last one on the street to get to three months free. So depending on the market you’re in like if you’re in a market like Nashville, for example, there is three months free in the market with merchant builder product. There is no question about that. In other markets, though, that don’t have the – Nashville and Austin, Texas are the number one supply markets in America right now with maybe 6% new supply coming in. And so you definitely are seeing kind of peak merchant builder concessions there. And then when you look at – but if you look at other markets like Charlotte, for example, there’s a month, maybe six weeks free or something like that. And most merchant builders are going to in any market are going to have discounts or free rent to incent people to come in. And so I think that part of the equation is happening pretty normally. And so the markets that are going to be more to have a higher concentration we’re going to have closer to the three-month free number. And then in terms of consumer behavior, the – when we think about our – the way we looked at the fourth quarter, consumer behavior is – it’s affected by the new supply for sure. But because of the nature of our portfolio that Keith will talk about in a minute, it’s not a huge issue and supply isn’t like changing consumer behavior. The thing that surprised us and maybe we just – maybe we were just too optimistic on this. Was that – what post-COVID consumer behavior would return to more normal behavior sooner rather than it has. And let me describe what I mean by that. So I’m talking about when somebody moves into an apartment and they aren’t paying the rent. Today, consumers know that if you’re in Atlanta, for example, that you can stay in your apartment for seven or eight months before you actually have to leave. And so that consumer behavior, they know that, and you can just go online and say, how do I live in an apartment for free as long as I can and they’ll give you what you need to do. And so that – if you look at Atlanta, for example, our bad debts they’re like 3%. And normally, Atlanta would be 80 basis points. So that part of the consumer behavior is definitely – they understand the system, and they have – we haven’t been able to convince them that they ought to pay and if they don’t pay, they should move. And so I think that will change because what’s happening is every market is getting tighter in terms of the ability to move people out. Governments are backlog and now they’re starting to get better and over the next six or eight months. I think you’ll go back to a more normal situation from that perspective. Keith, why don’t you address the issue on supplying our portfolio and...
Keith Oden: Yes. I think the question Michael asked was is the pool of impacted communities shifted. And the short answer to that is no, but I do want to give you a little bit more color and detail around how we look at the supply challenge and how we quantify it and then how we make sure that we’ve properly anticipated that so we stratify our portfolio because it’s really important to do so in times of elevated supply into those markets that are likely to be impacted by new lease-ups and those that are not. And so that’s filter one, and the second filter is if it is in a submarket where we have existing assets, then is the price point actually going to be affected by the new lease-ups. And our proxy for that is we use age as a proxy for that. And we make the cut at 15 years. It’s not completely scientific, but it’s been useful over the years to look at it that way. So when you stratify Camden’s portfolio that way, about 16% of Camden’s total apartment units are in markets that have a supply challenge. Now the interesting thing is, is that of all the things that we have to forecast at the beginning of the year, new supply – impact from new supply is probably one of the most reliable because it’s – the community is either under construction or not. You may miss the delivery time by a quarter or two. But the supply once it gets started, it’s going to be there and it’s going to be something you’re going to have to deal with. So if you think about it that way, in the second quarter of this year, for that 16% of our communities that we believe are being impacted directly by supply, the impacted communities had a lower new lease rate than the 84% non-impacted communities by 260 basis points. So it’s important and it’s meaningful, but it’s only 16% of our portfolio. But yes, supply matters, and it matters more directly to those communities where it’s happening. So if you roll that forward to the third quarter, I know there’s still a lot of elevated anxiety about supply and what’s coming and what the impact is going to be. And I think there’s probably just a view that supply is a bigger part of the challenge in our progression of results from the second and third quarter. If you roll those numbers forward to the third quarter, same 16% is impacted – so instead of 260 basis points differential between the impacted and non-impacted community, that number moved to 310 basis points. So it’s 50 basis points on 16% of our communities in its only new leases. So if you kind of roll that down – do the math and roll that to the bottom line, we think that the challenge of 2Q to 3Q that was directly attributable to increased supply was about 15 basis points. And if you compare that to what the stats that Alex gave you on the delinquency or bad debts, that number alone is 50 basis points of impact in the quarter. So yes, it matters, and it’s something that we pay a lot of attention to because our operations team has to take that into consideration when they’re making their pricing decisions. But it’s – I mean, in our portfolio, yes, it’s in the run rate. We’ve been dealing with supply for almost nine months now. It’s going to continue for at least through the end of 2024 for sure, and that’s just something we’re going to have to deal with.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much for the thorough answer. Good luck in the fourth quarter.
Ric Campo: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Hey, thanks, everybody. Do you think Camden being negatively impacted in this time of high supply because you have the policy of not offering concessions? And is there any chance that you might change that policy at least on a near-term basis?
Keith Oden: Yes. We’re not – we do offer concessions on our new lease-ups because that’s traditional and it’s kind of expected by the consumer. But we find that our consumers are much – just be transparent, telling what the rent is. And that’s the way the algorithm and YieldStar works. So I can’t see us – we have no intention of going back to "a month free rent" and then prorating that month over the balance of the lease term. It’s – to me, it’s confusing to consumers. And it’s also – it just makes it – it puts a little bit more pressure on managing the bad actor move in, pay your rent, the expectation that we’ve had forever in this business. So we’ll continue to do it on our new development lease-ups because that’s – it’s just part of what we baked into the cake when we think about our pro forma, but not on established communities.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then thinking about 2024, not asking for guidance or anything like that, but I’m curious how you guys are thinking about market rent growth at this point? Do you think there’s a chance that we won’t see it next year based on what we’ve seen recently? Or how have your thoughts on that evolved?
Alex Jessett: Well, when you look at we use Ron Witten and Witten Advisors information a lot, and it’s interesting because development falls off pretty dramatically, or at least starts to in 2024, and you start absorbing that real estate. You have countervailing factors like homeownership rate going down or in terms of people moving out to buy homes at down at 10%, and the prospect for people buying homes next year looks pretty dismal relative to the current environment. And so you have – you do have cross currents that where you don’t need as much job growth for demand – that to create demand for apartments, because you have fewer people moving out to buy homes, you have more people that are, I’ve quoted a number of the percentage of people of adults that live alone in the U.S. And when you get close to a third of the people that are living alone, they don’t go out and buy houses, they rent apartments. And so that older demographic becomes a higher propensity to rent apartments, and that stabilizes the system as well. So Ron thinks that you’re going to have occupancy levels that stay kind of where they are now and that you’re going to have some modest rent growth in markets and that’s why I think or the rent – we had a 5% rent growth in 2023. Are we going to have the same in 2024? The answer is probably no. But is it sort of a slower year? Yes, but is – I think that there is definitely a construct and a model that would argue that you should have reasonable occupancy and some rent growth in 2024.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, guys. Good morning. I was hoping to talk a bit more about the decision to let occupancy trend down in October. I would have expected occupancy to pick back up a bit here, certainly heading into seasonally slower demand, higher supply, and it sounds like you expect that now to continue into year-end, maybe even mid next year. So I’m curious if, in hindsight, that might have been a tactical misstep and perhaps where occupancy in the portfolio has fallen the most and when we might be able to get back to 95%. Thank you.
Alex Jessett: Well, remember, occupancy and rent are correlated, right? I mean, we could be at 95 – 97% occupancy if we wanted to go out and buy occupancy by lowering rents dramatically. And so we just think it’s a better fit. Our revenue team, we debate where we ought to have our settings on an ongoing basis, and we feel really comfortable with where we are. I would rather have higher rent and higher occupancy, but in this environment, with seasonality and with the consumer doing what they’re doing, we feel comfortable with where we are, and we think we’re going to set up for a reasonable start to 2024.
Ric Campo: So Haendel, just to follow-up on that, the idea that we let occupancy go to 94.9% is kind of implies that that was a conscious decision, and clearly that wasn’t because our occupancy guidance for the back half of the year was at 95.6% going into October. So if you want to kind of connect the dots a little bit, what Alex talked about on our delinquency, but also our continued elevated level of skips and lease breaks. We had planned at the beginning of the year that we felt – we really felt like that 2023 would do – go a long way towards getting back to normal metrics around delinquency and skips and lease breaks. And it would kind of happen radically over the course of the year. And we did make good progress in the first two quarters. And there was certainly an expectation, and we talked about the expectation of getting to 90 basis points of delinquency by the end of 2023. Well, guess what? We were on a glide path to get there and then all of a sudden instead of dropping again and at the end of the third quarter, that metric reversed and all of a sudden you’re at 140 basis points instead of a glide path to get to 90. So that was – I mean that was completely unexpected. But the way that flows through in our portfolio is skips and lease breaks are in the same category of short-term lease terminations and they’re really either hard to anticipate. You have no idea who’s going to skip or when or when they’re going to move out. Obviously, if they’re facing the termination of their lease then by judicial means, then yes, they probably eventually move out before that date, but there’s no way to anticipate it. And the challenge is when somebody moves out in the middle of the night, which these skips and lease breaks typically do. A, you don’t have a chance to do anything to pre-lease the apartment, and B, that people who move out in the middle of the night typically don’t take real good care of the asset. So not only do you not get noticed, it takes you longer to turn a unit because it’s been probably maybe a little bit more harshly used. And the – so the days to turn an apartment that is in that category of short-term lease break are just elongated and we thought we would be getting shorter and fewer of those and we didn’t. We got more. And so that’s the biggest reason why that it compounded our challenge of seasonality. Certainly wasn’t anything we thought, wouldn’t it be great to get into the 94%s on occupancy, but it just happens as a result of those factors?
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Certainly understand the complexity involved and appreciate the thinking, the thought process here. Maybe can you give us an update on where the portfolio lost lease is overall today and where it’s highest and lowest? And I think last quarter you mentioned the earn in for full year 2024 was around 1.8%. If you were to hit your budget for rest of you, obviously the numbers come in a bit, so perhaps you can give us an update on where you feel that that earn in for next year is. Thanks.
Keith Oden: Yeah, absolutely. So loss to lease for us is just under 1% and we’re actually showing our embedded growth. Assuming we make our reforecast for the fourth quarter, our embedded growth should be right around 0.9% for 2024.
Ric Campo: Yes. So on the challenge – where do you have the most challenge on maintaining occupancy? It’s in the markets where we knew that we were going to have a challenge in the fourth quarter with our supply impacted markets. So it’s Atlanta. It’s Austin. It’s Charlotte. Those would be the big three in terms of kind of a compounding of both supply that we did anticipate and then kind of continued elevated lease breaks, which we did not anticipate.
Haendel St. Juste: Great, guys. Thank you so much.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets . Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Good morning. Thank you. You guys referenced a couple of times that only 16% of the communities are being impacted by new supply, but clearly new lease rate growth has dropped dramatically, occupancy has fallen as well. I guess, is it your belief that 4Q is as bad as lease rate growth and occupancy could get and that we actually see both rate growth and occupancy reaccelerate into 2024? Just given some of the items you highlighted around the impact from seasonality skips and evics, et cetera, and I guess, what would change that view?
Ric Campo: I think the issue will be what happens in 2029 with the economy overall, right? I mean, if we continue to have robust job growth like we’ve had so far, and we know we had seasonality this year more than we’ve had since the pandemic. Then you would expect to have a similar pattern – similar seasonal pattern in the first quarter of 2024, which is very typical, where you have the slowdown start in September, October, you bottom in January, and then you start moving up in February, March, April. And I think that is very plausible and it really just depends on the strength of the economy and the consumer still has a fair amount of savings. And you look at consumer spending, it was very robust in the last number that came out and I think the PCE today came out pretty strong, where people are actually spending more than wages that are rising. And so the consumer continues to be pretty resilient. And assuming that you have a reasonable construct for 2024, you should have a pickup in leasing and occupancy levels like we have had every year before the pandemic.
Alex Jessett: So Austin, I would say that, of the three things that we’ve highlighted and talked about supply, bad debts and skips and evictions. On supply, there’s – we’re going to have the challenge in 2024 that’s similar to what we’ve had in 2023. The number of deliveries that are coming is going to be about the same in Camden’s market. But from our perspective, we have already lived in that environment now for almost a year or nine months or so. And it’s in our run rate. I mean, if you stratify our portfolio between impacted and non-impacted, the differential is in the second and third quarter was somewhere around 300 basis points between those two groupings of assets impacted and not impacted. The ones that are impacted now are probably going to continue to be impacted in 2024. So I think the good news is, from the standpoint of as an operator, that’s in our run rate probably going to stay there at least through 2024. In terms of bad debts and skips and evictions, I mean, we still have a very clear expectation that this is a process of kind of cleansing the COVID and the bad behavior that came as a result of all the regulatory construct during COVID. But there’s no reason to me that we would expect bad debts to continue to be as elevated as they are right now or expect to be in the fourth quarter. I mean, if you just go back to the 27 or 28 years of this portfolio prior to COVID, our bad debt averaged 50 basis points a year forever. And then all of a sudden in COVID, it peaks at 200 and then we start making progress. We think that we’re on a glide path to get to 90 basis points by the end of the year, and lo and behold, we’re not. But I still have every expectation that this is a process of unwinding a lot of bad behavior and a lot of bad actors. And I do think, we obviously thought a lot more of that would happen in 2023. But I think that’s a continuing process that probably gets wrapped up in 2024, the same on skips and evictions. Skips and evictions are double the level that they were in our portfolio prior to COVID. And again, we’re probably going to have some bad behavior. We’ve talked some renters, some really bad habits over the last two and a half years. Maybe it stays a little bit elevated from what it was, but I can’t see it being double what it was pre-COVID throughout 2024. So I think that those two will work their way out in 2024, but the supply challenge is going to be with us in 2024. But I think we’ve captured that already, most of that in our run rate.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Thanks for the thoughts. And that’s my one question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please go ahead.
Eric Wolfe: Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on that last answer. I guess, I’m trying to understand what you think would sort of change from a sort of process perspective to sort of get the bad debt down, whether it’s sort of external or internal, because it feels like we’re pretty removed with COVID at this point. And to your point, it’s super easy to just kind of look up ways to get out of leases now and it’s sort of embedded in people’s mentality. So is there anything like you think you can do on an internal perspective? Maybe there’s some warning signs for the recent skips and evictions, like a common factor or something that you found with them. Just trying to understand what would bring that down from the 150 basis points or 140 basis points that you’re running at as you’re thinking about guidance for next year, I guess. How would you come up with an estimate for bad debt, just given all this noise that you’re seeing now?
Ric Campo: Go ahead, Keith.
Keith Oden: There’s no question and it’ll be a challenge. We certainly faced that this year as well. And we were more optimistic that it looks like than we should have been in terms of bad debts. But what will solve it is two things. One, making sure that we do everything possible to accelerate and to move forward the process of getting folks who are in our apartments that are not paying rent out. Now the good news is that in virtually every one of our markets and submarkets, the regulatory prohibition on being able to move forward to get someone out of your apartment, from a judicial perspective that’s not paying rent, those have all lapsed. So what we’re left with is municipalities who are just – there’s a huge backlog, they’re overwhelmed, some cities have done a whole lot better job than others at kind of getting their act together and moving things through the process. But even the worst of the players have, for example, in Atlanta, in Montgomery County, up in the DC area, even those have improved. They just haven’t improved as much as most of the other cities. So part of it is just we got to get the bad actors out and there’s a pathway for that. It’s still taking longer than it did historically and in some places it’s still taking way too long for that to happen. And we’re doing everything possible, but it’s like pushing on a string when you’re trying to get municipalities to focus on something like this. So yes, I think that will work itself out and I think ultimately the skips and evictions, we have done some things internally. We’re – and we have – where we have the highest incidence of kind of people who are fraudsters and bad actors. We’ve instituted things like income verification, which we – back in the old days and the dark ages, we did on every lease. And then we went to a purely online system in the interest of making it frictionless for our customers. Well, we’re going to have to probably go back in some more of these submarkets and municipalities and introduce some more friction that will be a burden to the good actors, but will also deter and catch the bad actors. We’ve done that in Atlanta. We’re testing it in a bunch of other submarkets. But obviously, there’s a balancing act between putting impediments to do business with good people, which income verification and these other things are versus letting bad actors get into your community and then having to go through five months to six months process to get them to move on. So yes, it’s complex calculus, but our folks are really good at doing forecasting. I think one of the things that Rick said in his, that I personally think is quite remarkable is that when we started the year, based on our ops team’s original guidance that we shared with the Street, we said that we thought total revenues would be up 5.1% for the entire year. That was our original guidance. Then we increased the guidance in the first quarter because it looked like things were getting a little better and then again in the second quarter. But when it’s all said and done, if we make our fourth quarter numbers, which we fully expect to do, our ops team will have delivered 5% same-store NOI revenue growth. That’s 10 basis points off of our original guidance on a $1.6 billion number. And given all of the cross currents and forecasting and assumption making and the execution that goes with that, I think that’s pretty remarkable.
Eric Wolfe: Yes. No, that makes sense. And I agree. I guess what’s concerning for me sort of the shift maybe in tone and trying to understand what’s driving it at this moment, right? Because it did seem like things are pretty good up until maybe August or September, and then there’s some kind of shift that happened and people trying to figure out whether it’s supply or shifted the consumer. And so just trying to understand how that’s going to then impact in 2024. But then I guess along those lines, we got 16% of your properties that are directly impacted by supply. Just curious how that number will sort of look throughout next year as that goes down? And then if you sort of have a view when the impact of supply will peak next year?
Keith Oden: Yes. So my guess is that, that number will move some. It may tick up a little bit next year, but I would be very surprised if it went above 18% or so of impacted communities because, honestly, where the stuff is under construction right now. It’s just a matter of – merchant builders tend to be heard, animals and they build in the same places and – so a lot of the product that’s going to be coming in 2024 is in the same submarkets as 2023. So, I think it may tick up a little bit. But I think that the – again, based on the analysis that we’ve done internally and it’s pretty detailed at the property level, we think that we’re probably – is probably most of it is in our run rate for a year similar in 2024 to what we had this year.
Eric Wolfe: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes, hey guys. I just wanted to explore a comment, I thought I heard from you earlier about just like – I think it was like supply, you’ll have to deal with through the end of 2024. Was that implying that the softness we’re seeing in the new lease rate growth will continue through the end of 2024? Or is it just like a general comment on supply? Just trying to think through like kind of what we could be in 2024 [ph]?
Ric Campo : Yes. It’s a general comment on supply. But to Keith’s point on the 16% of our portfolio that is impacted by supply and through those numbers out there about the differential between those 16% and the balance of the portfolio. And so we’re going to have more supply through 2024. But again, it’s limited to that piece of the portfolio. Now there’s the discussion earlier about, well, what is it? Is it the sort of softness in the fourth quarter? Is it all supply? Is it all consumer behavior? Is it all – and what’s happening is it’s a combination of everything, right? Supply is on the one hand, is an issue for a part of the portfolio. Consumer behavior is probably the biggest part of the equation, because when you have more move-outs than you thought you’d have because people are skipping or breaking their leases, then you have to backfill those folks. And when you backfill them and if you – if you didn’t have that, you didn’t have to backfill them. And then when you have the bad debt side of the equation, it’s sort of a circular equation. So it’s really three different things that are happening and supply will be a headwind for that part of the portfolio in 2024. And hopefully, we won’t have as much of a headwind from skips and breaks and bad debts because we’re implementing things that are trying to keep the bad actors out and the municipalities are all getting better. And there are – as Keith mentioned, there are just not as many barriers to getting people out. There is a backlog, but that backlog is starting to improve. And if you look just in a few markets like, for example, every market in the country, except three are 1%, 1.5%, 1.8% kind of bad debts and the three that are having trouble are California and Atlanta. In California, bad debts are still 4.3%. And now the moratoriums are out or have been taken off, but the courts are backlogged. And so you – those backlogs will fix. And what will happen is that – and what’s happening now with certain folks is that they understand that they can stay longer and they do. And then when they get close to the edge, when they know that there’s no other sort of administrative way for them to stay in, then they skip in the middle of the night. I think 85% of our skips and lease breaks are people who owe us money, which on one hand, is a really good thing because we’re getting them out of the property because they haven’t been paying. On the other hand, it creates more vacancy and it creates more bad debt. So you have to look at that part of the equation and say, all right, because of seasonality, we needed to fill more apartments at a slower time, and that’s the circular effect of that – of those things. So, I think that next year, even with new supply, we’ll still have that as a headwind in some of our properties, but we should be getting more clarity on getting our real estate back faster and having bad debts go down.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Appreciate that color. And then I don’t think we touched on it yet, but just any plans for the floating rate debt exposure if you guys are just going to keep it as is or there’s something you guys want to do at this point with it?
Ric Campo: So when you think about floating rate debt, and if you think over a long period of time, floating rate debt has always been cheaper than long-term debt. Today, we’re in a very unusual situation with a flat yield curve. And so even though it’s steepening a little bit because of long-term rates going up. But at the end of the day, the bottom-line in our portfolio is we have very, very low debt. So when you look at it as a percentage of total debt, it looks high. But because we have low debt, it’s very manageable. And so it’s already in our run rate with our line of credit costs and our term loan at this point. And so it doesn’t make a lot of sense to me to worry too much about what floating rate debt is going to be over the next couple years because I think ultimately the yield curve will steepen and either short rates will come down. And I just don’t think we need to be betting on long-term bonds right now, given, the volatility in the bond market. So we’re comfortable with the level we have today. And I look at it as sort of gas in the tank to a certain extent because when rates start dropping, that’ll flow through to our FFO because we’ll start having lower interest costs. The worst thing in the world would be to fix long-term rates today at these current rates and then see the whole yield curve move down over the next couple years.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Thanks, Ric. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Yes, thanks. Just my one question. I know with capital deployment is probably not really high on the list right now. I think we’ve got the stock probably trading north of a 7.5% implied cap rate. So I guess, how are you thinking maybe about share repurchases and marrying that up if there is a disposition market? I know there’s a lot of institutional capital looking for high quality apartments. So sort of any thoughts on shrinking the company a bit and buying back stock?
Ric Campo: Well, we’ve been really consistent in how we’ve described our stock buyback sort of appetite in the past. And that has been that it had to have at least a 20%, 25% discount to, what we thought NAD [ph] was and needed to be persistent, and we needed to sell assets to fund it. And maybe this is the time where we have persistency. We’ve had times in the past where we had the opportunity, but we didn’t have the timing to be able to sell assets and buy. We have sold one asset this year, small one for $61 million. And when you think about capital deployment today pretty hard to get a – when you look at an implied cap rate of seven and a half and if you look at a long-term model of what apartments will do once we get through this uncertainty of and the supply cliff that everybody’s worried about. You should see reasonable returns for multifamily companies come back again. So it makes sense for us to do that. We do have – there is a disposition market, yes, dispositions or the acquisition market is slow. It’s down 60%, 70% from the prior year. But I think it’s really interesting when you think about that it sounds 60% to 70%, which the flip side of that means that there’s deals getting done. And so for us, we were aggressive buyers of the stock when the stock was down substantially for a long period of time. And if we have the opportunity to do it, we probably will.
Steve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That’s it for me.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. I just wanted to clarify two items mentioned on this call in my one question. Alex, I think you mentioned that you’re expecting new lease growth rates at minus 4.5%, but renewals at positive four. And I’m just wondering how sustainable that is, especially when you have lost lease at around 1%. And then for Ric and Keith in your response to Haendel’s question on occupancy, I just wanted to clarify that you are okay operating at or below 95% of the time being, there’s no immediate focus to get it above 95%.
Alex Jessett: So on the – yes, go ahead.
Keith Oden: Yes, I’ll do – I’ll take the occupancy first and then give it back to Alex. The – yes, and so in light of the fact that we our guidance for the fourth quarter included, occupancy of our prior guidance before we just issued revised guidance had an occupancy rate being flat at about 95.6%, 95.7%, that was our expectation. We’re at 94.9% as we closed out October. So no, we’re not good with operating at 94.9%. The target that we set was 95.6%, and we’d like to get back to that as quickly as possible, but we’re not. So we’re not going to make silly decisions on our either new leases or our renewal rates in order to achieve that. It just doesn’t make sense. But yes, within the limits of the levers that we can pull and still get back to 90 – mid-95s, that would be our preference.
Alex Jessett: And then to your question on whether or not we think that the new leases and renewals that we have in our guidance for the fourth quarter is sustainable. Obviously, we’re sitting here today almost to November, and keep in mind that if you’re doing a renewal, you’re typically signing that renewal a month to two months ahead of time. And new leases are typically call it 15 days to 20 days ahead of time. I think we feel very confident about these rates for the quarter.
John Kim: My question was more on the spread between the renewal and new lease 850 basis points.
Alex Jessett: Yes. 850 basis points is historically a little wide, but it’s not completely out of the realm of where we have operated at points in time. So I think we can – think we can maintain that.
John Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I wonder if all of this noise in the system could create an opportunity for you. I imagine you guys are managing the skip and evic [ph] process a lot better than your neighboring peers and you’re managing supply better. Ric, you said something about, well, maybe consumer behavior settles down within the next six months, not that there’s distress, but you’re obviously a premier operator in your markets, particularly relative to your private competition. Do you think that there could be an opportunity to step in where people are perhaps a little bit less prepared or ill prepared to handle these stresses and that, despite what Steve said about you’re probably not going to buy anything, maybe you start buying stuff in a little bit more aggressive fashion as we get into the latter part of next year?
Ric Campo: Well, it’s an interesting question, Rich, for sure. Welcome back, by the way. And bottom-line is – capital allocation is an interesting thing. And we look at what the most opportune – we try to figure out what the most opportune investment strategy is, and we’ll try to execute that. Right now there really is, even with the transactions that are going on today. Deals are still trading at five and a half or five and a quarter. And so there isn’t a lot of distress in the marketplace today. And so I think you have had a sort of a narrowing of the gap between the buy – the bid and the ask. And it’s definitely been coming from primarily the sellers and not the buyers. But there is a big wall of capital that continues to be out there waiting for that some more clarity on what is the long-term tenure going to look like? Is the Fed done? How’s supply impacting all these uncertainties that we have in the market today? And that wall of capital is just sitting there waiting. And so the question will be, will there be distress? And it’s hard to say, I mean, the deals that are blowing up today and there are plenty of deals blowing up today are really C-minus transactions that were over leveraged. All with floating rate that that were properties that I would never want to take you on a property tour to do, because I wouldn’t want you to be in that part of town and so – and I wouldn’t want to be there either. And so those are the deals that are blowing up and those are not our type of properties, okay. And so there is really no stress in the investment grade market today and we’ll see if there happens in the future, but right now there’s just no opportunity there.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And then the 16% supply impacted portfolio, how do you marry that with where you’re seeing this skip and evict situation? Is there any meaningful like shared markets or is the skip and evict issue sort of more of an overall portfolio phenomenon for the sort of located anywhere in particular?
Ric Campo: Yes. Skip and evict is highly concentrated in the markets that continue to have that had the worst COVID regulatory restrictions against pursuing...
Rich Anderson: [indiscernible]
Ric Campo: Yes, California, DC Proper, Montgomery County. Atlanta for a different reason, but that’s prime we’ve talked about on the last call, but that’s primarily kind of a localized fraud – infestation of fraudsters. But if you took those four, I think Rick gave the number in California alone, there are bad debts which is tied directly to the skip and evict question, it’s almost of our 140 basis points. California alone is almost 30 basis points of that. So it’s not – that’s not a generalized problem. The supply, I would say is generalized. It’s better in some places, worse than others, but we’re in markets that everybody that people want to move to, people want to do business in and people want to build apartments in. And while we’re while we’re sharing merchant builder maxims from the ages; the mantra of a merchant builder is anything worth doing is worth doing excess and so that’s kind of where we find ourselves today. And that’s true in every one of our markets. There’s a supply issue to one degree or another.
Alex Jessett: The interesting thing about the fraudsters is they tend to go to the highest end properties and they tend to go to new properties. For example, our downtown Houston building, which is a 22 story building in downtown has the most fraud of any building in Houston, also the highest rents of any building we have in Houston. And if you go to Atlanta Buckhead, I think we have 35 lease breaks there and they were all fraudulent people. And so it’s interesting because the fraud folks tend to be the higher end going to the higher end property, more sophisticated. And then to Keith’s point in California, our bad debts in LA County are 5.3%, and in San Diego they’re 3.2%. And the difference between those two numbers is that San Diego is just more open and less sort of militant, if you want to say that, than LA County. And so it’s definitely driven by the regulatory construct that has trained people to know that they don’t really have to pay. In the past you paid your phone bill first, then you paid your apartment rent. And now because of the government doing what they did during COVID apartment rent is down the list for more people than it should be. But we’re going to – we’re going to push it so that it goes to be right next to cell phone scan.
Rich Anderson: Awesome. Thanks very much, everyone.
Alex Jessett: Sure.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Connor Mitchell: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So I’ll just keep it to the one as we’re at the top of the hour. With the updated guidance and the updated outlook for the current environment, can you just talk about how this impacts and affects the investment appetite development timing, deliveries for you guys and then the underwriting process and some assumptions that are going into that?
Ric Campo: So our current development pipeline is doing really well. The lease ups that we’re doing are doing really well. We just finished Tempe and it was a really solid return that we’re making on those. So we’re doing well on the existing portfolio. In terms of new starts or acquisitions or other capital deployment, I mean, this is a very unusual time. Our cost of capital has gone up dramatically and we recognize that and we understand that it doesn’t make a lot of sense to underwrite transactions today in the current environment based on our cost of capital. And so we have pushed back development starts and we have been very quiet on the acquisition front, obviously. And so I think though that as we get more stability, because I think what the world hates, and we all hate the most is volatility and not having some sort of stability and knowing having a view of what things are going to be in the future, right, I think that’s what’s sort of causing all this consternation in the market. When you start thinking about capital in the future, though as we think what’s going to happen to development costs for example, when developments go from 550,000 units to 200,000 units, there’ll be lots of contractors that will work for food and that will squeeze margins that should with inflation overall coming down, with workers not having jobs as a result of construction costs or construction being shut down. We should be able to get a whole lot better pricing on properties in the future than we can today that has to play out during 2024. And so when that happens, then the question is, if you actually believe those start numbers, then in 2025 and 2026, it’s going to be a very constructive environment to deliver new properties. And if the capital markets are forcing merchant builders not to build, which is exactly what it’s doing, and we have the capital to build then maybe we – well if we get the right returns and balance our returns from a cost of capital and a spread perspective in the right zone, then perhaps we would start developing to be able to deliver into a really good market in 2026 and 2027. We’re playing the long game here and we will – if that’s a countercyclical move relative to our competitors, we’ll do that. And then same thing goes with acquisitions. We have been – if you look at our history, since starting really in probably maybe ten years ago, we sold over $3 billion of properties, bought a bunch of properties and we sold older properties with lower growth and higher CapEx and reinvested in newer, lower CapEx, higher growth properties. And we did that on a very, very turned out to be accretive basis. And so the opportunity next year with capital the way it is today could open the opportunity for us to do a lot of that portfolio management as well. So, yes I think the bottom line is that today it’s a really weird world and there’s it makes sense to sort of, stand path with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and kind of wait and see to see where capital could be deployed in the future and what the best returns that we could make on that would be.
Connor Mitchell: Thanks. I appreciate all the color. That’s it for me.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hi, everyone. Thanks for sticking around. I have a question on the delta for the new leases in your fraud markets, would that be worse than your supply markets? And for those tenants that are the can pay but won’t pay, what type of recovery can you get there?
Keith Oden: So the recovery on can pay but won’t pay? Obviously, we turn people over to collection agencies. We pursue them. My guess is that before those folks actually go face the eviction music, in some cases they will try to have a conversation about, if I pay this, would you not pursue me? Those conversations go on all the time with to varying degrees of success. The can pay, won’t pays are an interesting subgroup that won’t pay, can’t pay, the recovery is actually quite low, but we do pursue them. I’m sorry. I didn’t catch the first part of your question, Wes?
Wes Golladay: Yes, the delta on the new leases in the fraud market I get that supply will be here next year. So yes, I think that’s in the run rate. I’m trying to see what kind of potential lift you can have from just having a more normal lease market in the fraud market. So is it artificially low right now on the new leases in those markets you cited?
Alex Jessett: Absolutely it is. I mean, if you think about – to give you an idea, in Atlanta, our new lease effective trade out for October was down 7.1%. So that’s a pretty good indication of a market where we’ve got an ability, once we get that fraud sorted out, to get that back to a far more normal run rate. So absolutely.
Wes Golladay: Great. Thanks for taking the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, team. This is John on for Jamie. There was comments about this before, but just trying to think about revolver and what we need to fund right now for development and where interest rates are, How do you think about growth in this environment.
Ric Campo: I’m sorry. You kind of broke up. We have $180 million roughly left to spend on the development that we have in place now. And what was the other part of your question? Because you broke up.
Unidentified Analyst: I understand. Sorry, can you hear me now?
Ric Campo: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. Just trying to understand, given maturities in 2024 the size of your revolver right now, just how do you afford to, to grow in this environment?
Ric Campo: Alex, you want to take that?
Alex Jessett: Well, bottom line is, we have access to lots of capital markets, right? And bond markets open. The great thing about the multifamily business is that, so the capital markets are open. We could issue bonds to take out the maturities, and we obviously have access to that market, we also have and if the bond market isn’t open, we have access to Freddie and Fannie, and there’s still a robust lending environment out there for multifamily. So we’re not concerned at all about our capital issues. And that isn’t a constraint, I don’t think, given our low debt. And we built this balance sheet for times like this. And when you are sitting at a 4.1 [ph] debt-to-EBITDA with very low debt and having somewhere around $12 billion worth of real estate that has no mortgage on it, that’s a pretty safe position to sit in and to be able to fund maturities and fund capital for opportunities if they manifest themselves.
Ric Campo: Yes, I would just add to that that the revolver is not the constraint at all. And obviously, we’re not thrilled about a 10-year costing us 6%, but that is still a lot cheaper than what it would cost a private person to go out and borrow money. And so if the opportunities are really there and if we can do something accretively to the debt in 2024, that’s what we’ll absolutely do. And for once, we actually do have a cost of capital advantage over the private guys.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.
Alex Jessett: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robin Lu with Green Street. Please go ahead.
Robin Lu: Hi, good morning. Just one from me. I just want to touch on development. You did well in completing Tempe lease-up without much concessions or outside concessions. How are you thinking about the lease-up strategy for the new Raleigh in Houston properties? Now that those properties are entering the market at a time with more competition, do you expect to provide more incentives to increase occupancy quicker?
Ric Campo: Well, as I said before, it really just depends on the market conditions. Right now, we’re offering, I think, four to six weeks free and on those properties, and we’re getting traction on them and leasing them up. Our Camden NoDa, for example, is doing really well in Charlotte, and we don’t have the kind of concessions, I think that people are worried about the three months free or something like that. But at the end of the day, concessions are just part of the equation in the merchant builder world, and we will compete effectively with all the rest of the properties that are out there, and ultimately they will lease-up. If you look at the absorption rates that we’ve had, and I think Phoenix is a great example. I mean Phoenix is one of the markets with a lot of supply, yet at the same time, we leased up Tempe II, with a very, very fast pace with limited. We did give concessions, but not dramatically. So I think we’re going to be fine leasing up the properties that we’ve built in both Raleigh and Charlotte going forward.
Robin Lu: All right. Thank you. Appreciate your time.
Ric Campo: Absolutely.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Great. Well, I appreciate everybody on the call today and we will see you very soon at NAREIT in LA. So take care and thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-04 11:00:00) =====

As a reminder, Camden’s complete second quarter 2023 earnings release is available on the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. We would like to respect everyone’s time and complete our call within one hour. So please limit your initial question to one, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Good morning. Our on-hold music theme for today was happy birthday. Last week, Camden’s Board and Executive management team rang the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate Camden’s 30th birthday as a public company. We were joined by the rest of Camden’s 1,700 team members from coast to coast to commemorate this special day. It’s been a remarkable journey, and we want to share a few memorable moments with you. So here we go with 30 years in two minutes and 30 seconds. [Video Presentation] Our business was built to last. In 1993, we started with 6,000 apartments in three Texas markets with an enterprise value of $200 million. Today, we have 60,000 some built geographically and product diverse apartments with a value of $15.5 billion. Over the years, we have created a best-in-class operating and investment team platform that focuses on constant improvement. Camden exists to improve the lives of our team members, our customers and our stakeholders, one experience at a time. Our business continues to be strong. Market conditions continue to moderate from the post-COVID unprecedented housing boom that we all knew would happen. The transaction market is still quiet and with 70% decline from last year. New permits are starting to fall given the difficult financing environment and increased cost of capital. This should bode well for our markets as supply is absorbed over the next 18 months. Move-outs devising family homes to continue to trend lower than past years and quarters. And finally, I really want to give a big shout out to our Camden teams for their hard work and their commitment to providing living excellence to our residents. And next up is Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Now for some details on our second quarter 2023 operating results and July 2023 trends. Same-property revenue growth for the quarter was in line with our expectations at 6.1%, and we have maintained the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance as a result. Consistent with the past several quarters, we saw the highest growth rates in our three Florida markets: Tampa, Orlando and Southeast Florida with very strong results in both Charlotte and Nashville as well. Despite the understandable concerns about elevated levels of supply in Camden Sunbelt markets, demand for high quality apartments in our markets remain strong. Second quarter signed leases grew by a blended rate of 4.1% with new leases up 2.2% and renewals up 5.9%. Our preliminary July results show moderating rates of growth with blended rates in the mid-3% range. Renewal offers for August and September were sent out in the high 5% range. Occupancy averaged 95.4% during the second quarter of 2023 and trended slightly higher in July at 95.6%. Our portfolio is currently 95.8% occupied positioning us well for the normal seasonal slowing we typically see in the fourth quarter. Net turnover for the second quarter of 2023 was 44% and move-outs to purchase homes were 11.8% for the quarter and 11% year-to-date versus 15.1% in the second quarter of 2022 and 13.8% for the full year of 2022. I’ll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. During the quarter, our lease-ups remained stronger than usual as we completed construction and subsequent to quarter-end, stabilized well ahead of schedule, Camden Tempe II, a 397-unit, $107 million community in Phoenix with a yield north of 7%. In addition to stabilizing ahead of schedule, Camden Tempe II’s rents are approximately 10% ahead of pro forma. Also during the quarter, we continued leasing at Camden NoDa, a 387-unit, $108 million community in Charlotte which is now over 60% leased, averaging over 45 leases per month. At the end of June, we disposed of Camden Sea Palms, a 138-unit community in Costa Mesa, California for $61.1 million. We sold this 33-year-old community for a 5.7% FFO yield and a 4.25% tax-adjusted cap rate generating an approximate 13% unleveraged IRR over our 25-year hold period. On May 31, we utilized our unsecured line of credit to retire approximately $185.2 million of secured variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.1%. We recognize the charges in conjunction with this early retirement of debt of approximately $2.5 million. 91% of our debt is now unsecured. For the second quarter, we reported core FFO of $1.70 per share $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance. This outperformance was driven by $0.01 in higher non-same-store net operating income, primarily driven by the previously mentioned accelerated leasing activity at our development communities and $0.01 associated with the timing of certain corporate overhead expenses and fee income. Last night, we reaffirmed our same-store revenue, expense and NOI midpoints at 5.65%, 6.85% and 5%, respectively. Our revenue growth midpoint of 5.65% is based upon an anticipated 1.5% average increase in new leases and a 5% average increase in renewables for the remainder of the year for a blend of approximately 3.25%. We are anticipating that our occupancy for the remainder of the year will average 95.6%. We continue to experience a higher than typical level of move-outs by nonpaying residents. As a reminder, all of the municipalities in which we operate have now lifted the restrictions on our ability to enforce rental contracts. And as a result, we now have twice the amount of early move-outs of non-payers year-to-date as compared to the first half of last year. We reserve for effectively 100% of delinquent balances and therefore, there is no net negative revenue impact when nonpaying residents leave. Rather, we receive the benefit of having our real estate back, the opportunity to commence a lease with a resident who abides by their rental contract, and lower bad debt from having a new resident who pays. However, we have noticed higher-than-normal repair and maintenance costs, which I will discuss shortly, partially associated with the move-outs of these delinquent payers. Although, we have maintained the midpoint of our expense growth at 6.85%, we have updated some of the underlying assumptions. Recently, the Texas State legislature passed the tax reform bill subject to voter approval in November. Upon approval, which we believe is likely, Senate Bill 2 will reduce independent school district tax rates by $0.107 per $100 of assessed value. Average independent school district tax rates in our Texas markets are approximately 1% of assess value or 45% of the total Texas tax rate. Therefore, excluding valuation increases and other tax rate increases, this anticipated reduction equates to an approximate 4.8% reduction in Texas taxes. We have assumed some rate rollbacks in Texas in our prior guidance, so this reduction is not dollar for dollar to the bottom line. We have also had greater-than-anticipated success with our Houston valuations, both current year and prior year settlements. As a result of all of these tax adjustments, we now expect total property taxes to increase by 4.5%. Repair and maintenance make up 13% of our total expenses and are now anticipated to increase by 8.5%, a 350 basis point increase from our prior expectations, resulting from higher unit turnover costs and other miscellaneous repair items. The remaining offset to the property tax favorability is primarily from continued increased levels of insurance expenses resulting from smaller claims generally under $25,000 per occurrence which do not count towards our aggregate $3 million exposure. Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2023 core FFO guidance by $0.02 per share for a new midpoint of $6.88 per share. This $0.02 per share increase results primarily from the $0.01 per share second quarter outperformance of our development communities and $0.01 in lower interest expense associated with the second quarter prepayment of secure debt. We also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter 2023. We expect core FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of a $1.71 to $1.75. The mid-point of $1.73 represents $0.03 per share increase from the $1.70 recorded in the second quarter. This increases primarily the result of an approximate $0.015 sequential increase in same-store NOI resulting from higher expected revenues during our peak leasing periods, partially offset by the seasonality of utility expenses and leasing incentives, a three quarters of $0.01 sequential increase related to additional NOI from our non-same-store and development portfolio, $0.01 decline in net overhead expenses primarily associated with the timing of certain public company costs and a half cent decline in interest expense associated with the second quarter debt prepayment. This $0.03 and $0.0325 cumulative increase in core FFO is partially offset by $0.0325 of lost FFO from our Camden CPAM second quarter disposition. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt to EBITDA for the second quarter at 4.2 times and at quarter end, we had $212 million left to spend over the next two years under our existing development pipeline. At this time, we’ll open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Eric Wolfe with Citi. You may now go ahead.
Nick Kerr: Hi, good morning. It’s actually Nick Kerr on for Eric this morning. I just wanted to ask what you’re all seeing in terms of recent competitive starts, specifically, which markets are more or less insulated, and then when you all kind of expect that supply to abate given the current and process pipeline?
Ric Campo: Well, the good news is that we’ve definitely started seeing starts decline in all the markets. If you look at the RealPage headline that came out just recently, the headline was – starts finally started to decline – starts in May were down – May over June or June over May were down 13.5%. In June, from last year, they’re down 33%. So clearly, the tight financial markets and the difficulty of getting bank financing and equity financing, along with increased cost of capital is having its – the Fed’s desire result, which is it’s slowing everything down. In terms of absorption, when you look at how we’ve been absorbing in most of our markets, it’s been good. As Alex pointed out in our – in his opening remarks, all of our developments have actually done better than we anticipated from a net absorption perspective. So we think it’s going to be 12 months, 18 months kind of time frame to absorb all this new supply. And then when you think about what the market might look like in 20 – sort of toward end of 2024 and into 2025, it’s pretty constructive for the supply side of the equation. So – and as Alex pointed out, we haven’t seen this – the wall of supply that everybody is worried about. It’s just not really negatively impacted our portfolio. A lot of reasons for that, but one of which is a substantial portion of our properties are just not affected by it because they are lower price points and they’re not in the competitive sort of high end market. So our product diversity is really helping us from a supply perspective. There’s no question about that.
Nick Kerr: Thanks. I appreciate the color. And then I guess sort of a follow-up on that is with presumably less deliveries in I guess, 2025, 2026, what’s Camden’s appetite for ramping up your deliveries and you have the balance sheet to do so.
Ric Campo: Well, clearly, if things work out the way we think they might, there’ll be plenty of opportunity to acquire shovel-ready deals that can’t get financed. And we have – history has shown that we will be aggressive in that area for sure?
Nick Kerr: Thank you. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may now go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you. How do we reconcile the 95.6% average occupancy assumption for the back half of the year with the economic impact from backfilling non-paying residents versus just normal course turnover?
Ric Campo: Yes. The normal course turnover is happening as we would normally expected the big difference in our portfolio in the – over the last six months has been the incidents of sort of what we call short-term notices to vacate. And primarily those are people who have not been paying rent. They’ve been protected by a statutory moratoriums on getting our real estate back in all of our markets that we operate in those moratoriums have run their course.
. : And as Alex said, that’s not necessarily a bad thing because these are people who haven’t been paying rent, but they’ve been living in the apartment. So if you have people who move out because they skipped, as opposed to the ordinary course where we would get 30 or 60 days notice and have an opportunity to backfill that apartment, it just creates a much tougher dynamic for our onsite teams. And as I think Alex mentioned the number, we have roughly twice as many folks in that category, which is short-term notice to move out as we would normally have or we had pre-COVID. So you have the – it’s the double impact of the normal turnover cycle, but you – on top of that, you have this cohort of people who sort of move out in the middle of the night and it takes a different set of factors to react to that for our onsite teams. And that shows up in the occupancy or rate in the 95.6% that we’re projecting through the balance of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: But if you were to put a number of units or how much of the occupancy that represents those skips and/or vacant units related to long-term delinquent tenants, can you just put some numbers around that? And then could you also share what just bad debt is today?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So there’s a couple things. The first one is if you actually look at our total turnover, our total turnover is actually is down. And it’s because we have less folks moving out to purchase houses. So that’s the offset of that. And so based upon that, that’s why we actually think we’re going to see occupancy continue to pick up from this level. Keith said in his prepared remarks that we’re at 95.8%, we’re actually going to be about 96% by next week. And so that’s we continue to have strong occupancy because the turnover is maintaining is pretty low. If you look at our bad debt, we think our bad debt for the full year is going to average about 120 basis points. And that is – and we’re thinking that probably in the fourth quarter it should be around 90 basis points that’s compared to historical of about 50 in normal times.
Austin Wurschmidt: Very helpful. Thank you.
Ric Campo: Yes. And Austin, just to put a number on the Alex’s point about the move outs to purchase homes, we were about 11% for the last quarter, but as we roll that, that number forward into July, it actually dropped to single digits at 9.8%. We haven’t seen single-digit move outs to purchase homes since you’d have to go back to the great financial crisis. We had a couple of quarters in there where we were a single digits on that metric. And we hit that again in July. So that trend continues for sure.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. You may now go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I just was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the kind of monthly trends on the new lease rates and kind of on the signings, just to give us a sense for the trend, April, May, June and into July. And I guess with delivery set to ramp over the next four quarters, I’m just wondering, do you expect new leases at all to go negative in say, the next four quarters?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So if you look at the trend, obviously for the second half of the year, we told you new leases would be up 1.5%, renewals up 5%, for a blended 3.25%. At this point in time, we’re heading into our peak leasing periods, and so it’s going to follow some normal seasonalities over the next couple of months. And then obviously coming back down into the fourth quarter. In terms of rents going negative, if you’re just looking at sequential month-over-month, you do typically see some negative typically in November and December, and that’s what we are anticipating. So that being a decline going from October to November to December. And as I said, that’s just typical seasonal patterns.
Steve Sakwa: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. You may now go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey there, thanks for taking the question. A couple here. First, what’s the portfolio loss to lease overall and where is it highest and lowest amongst your core markets?
Ric Campo: Yes. So our overall loss to lease is in the sort of 2% to 3% range. The lowest loss to lease is Phoenix, which is teetering right on the edge of flat loss to lease to a slight gain to lease. And in our highest would actually be San Diego Inland Empire followed by Denver and Nashville.
Haendel St. Juste:
where does that lie:
Ric Campo: Yes. So Houston is right around a 1%. Atlanta is right around call it 0.5%. And then D.C. is actually pretty high, it’s right around sort of mid-4s.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thanks. And so when I think about the loss to lease, and then you mentioned the 3.25% blended plan expectations back half a year, ballpark, what does that imply for a 2024 earning?
Ric Campo: Yes, right around 1.8%. So if we hit our numbers for the rest of the year getting to December of 2023 that should be 1.8% RNN.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. You may now go ahead.
John Kim: Thanks, and happy birthday, everyone. A question on your same-store revenue guidance – on your same-store revenue guidance that you’ve maintained, it sounds like the bad debt is coming in better than expected with your guidance for the year 20 basis points lower than prior. But when you isolated leases signed in June, it looks like it decelerated from 4.8% in made about 3.4%, and I was wondering if that deceleration had come in steeper than you had thought?
Alex Jessett: No. I mean, right now we are progressing exactly as we had anticipated. Remember also that we did increase guidance in the first quarter. But so as compared to what we thought when we last increased guidance everything is progressing as we expected.
John Kim: Okay. And then, Alex, you mentioned that you already anticipated some of the Texas reduction in taxes, I think at nearly you discussed Texas and Florida as potential states, and just an update on Florida, if that was already factored into your guidance of the year.
Alex Jessett: Yes. So Florida for us, we are anticipating I’ll just sort of do it by market. Tampa is up 10%, Orlando is up 10%, and South Florida is up 7%. So obviously some of our higher growth markets in terms of taxes, but that compares to Texas, which we think our total tax number is going to be up 1.4%.
John Kim: So the reduction in millage rates are not anticipated in Florida?
Alex Jessett: No. We do have some reductions in millage rates. This is the total. So if I look at tax rates, we’re anticipating about 1% down in Tampa, 1.5% down in Orlando, and 1.5% down in South Florida on millage.
Ric Campo: It’s all driven by value. The values are continuing to be assessed higher in most markets.
John Kim: Right. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Ric Campo: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. You may now go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you. And yes, happy 30th, although, you guys don’t look a day over 20, so happy birthday.
Ric Campo: Very good.
Alexander Goldfarb: So two questions here. The first question is on the skips and evictions, I get that for markets like maybe LA or Atlanta, but your occupancies were down across the portfolio, which almost says that you guys were focusing more on driving rate this quarter. So maybe just broadly, if you can put a little bit more color on evictions, and skips if it’s beyond Atlanta and LA and then two, for all the talk that we hear about supply in the Sunbelt, you guys are pretty good at driving rents up 7% or so, or revenues up 7%. So maybe just a bit more color on what you’re seeing operationally so we can understand the difference between how much of the portfolio is impacted by the elevated skips and evictions versus supply versus just normal pricing policy that you guys use in the peak leasing season.
Ric Campo: Yes. Let’s start with a supply question first, and then we’ll come back to the skips and evictions. So one of the things that, that we’ve always done is we – when we think about our operating plan for the year, it’s a – it is very much a bottom up process, and we have to do that because the one big variable in our markets is typically are you going to be impacted by lease ups in your submarket? And so to the extent we have communities that are going to be impacted by competitors and new supply, they need to take that into consideration when they’re thinking about their game plan. So we do a bottom up analysis, and when you do that, and you start with sub – at the submarket level, and if you just we use our own kind of gathering of assets to define a submarket, but if you want to use RealPage, it’s a pretty good proxy for that. So if you’ve got lease ups that are going to be going on in a submarket that we have existing communities in, that’s the first level that that clearly is going to that community will be impacted. And then the second thing you look at is what’s the age of Camden’s asset relative to the new development and our – and we use a filter of 10-year old assets or older, we define them as that’s a different price point and they’re probably not going to be competing with brand new development. So when you take the supply that, that everybody is understandably focused on and concerned about, but if you run it through those two filters, is it in – is it – is a asset that’s being built in a sub-market that affects a Camden asset and is it – is a Camden asset less than or more than 10 years old. When you run all of the supply in all of Camden’s markets through those two filters, what comes out of that is about 15% of the total supply market by market is impact – is impacting a Camden community. So it’s the scary headline numbers of 400,000 apartments being delivered over Camden’s 16 markets in a six quarter period. When you go through the analysis from bottom up and look at is this really likely to impact the Camden community, it turns out that it’s about 15% of the supply is in that, that category. So that’s a big part of the reason why even though you see, sometimes you see these numbers that look kind of crazy in a market like Austin, where over the 2023, 2024 timeframe, you’ve got – in 2023 and 2024, roughly 40,000 apartments being delivered. That’s a scary hell I number for sure. But when you do the bottom up analysis, you discover that really only about 20% of that supply, that’s – it’s even impacting any of Camden’s community. So I think our – so far we’ve been able to handle whatever supply is impacting Camden communities and with the end migration and strong job growth in these markets. And I – we expect that that some version of that is likely to continue throughout 2023 and 2024.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then is it fair to say it’s just the evictions and skips are really just Atlanta and LA, right? Or is it other markets as well that are being impacted?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So clearly Atlanta and California are the outliers, but I will tell you that we are seeing upticks in some of our other markets. That by the way is a good thing. All of the courts have opened up, but all the courts are delayed. And so you’re starting to see some acceleration on the court side, which is really getting folks that have not been abiding by the rental contracts for quite some time, and you’re starting to get them out much quicker now, which is obviously, as I said is a good thing, and you should expect to see these numbers start tailing off pretty good as we move through the year, because once again, the systems are open and things are starting to flow a lot better.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Second question is Avalon, as you guys saw was released from the RealPage, I don’t know what you guys can add from your standpoint, but do you see that you guys may also be released from this class action litigation?
Ric Campo: We’re not going to comment on class action litigation on this call. Thanks.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.
Josh Dennerlein: Yes. Hey guys, thanks for the time. Just wanted to clarify, I think a comment after Austin’s question on new lease growth in the second half of year. I think you said month-over-month seasonality things might turn negative, but what about on a year-over-year basis for new lease growth in 4Q?
Ric Campo: No.
Josh Dennerlein: You still assuming positive? Okay.
Ric Campo: That is correct, yes.
Josh Dennerlein: Okay. All right. Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Ric Campo: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brad Heffern with RBC. You may now go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to dig into the occupancy commentary a little bit more. Have you had a shift in pricing strategy to more of an occupancy focus and that’s what’s driving the recent uptick to 96%? Or is there something else that’s driving it?
Ric Campo: So yes, we – when we had the situation that I described earlier, which is you have this elevated level of short notice move outs, we absolutely when we – it’s more than double what it should be historically. And we saw that beginning to impact our occupancy numbers in several of our markets in the sort of the May, June timeframe. And we adjusted marketing spend and then we also adjusted pricing to make sure that we maintained our occupancy through this period of time where it’s elevated. I think the good news is that we’re probably pretty far along with the exception of maybe as Alex said, maybe in California possibly a little bit in Atlanta. We’re probably pretty far along in the process of getting rid of that, that cohort of people who’ve been living with us, not paying rent, facing an eviction, and then just leaving of their own volition. There’s a finite number of them. I mean, they moved in, they’ve – many of them been there not paying rent for a couple of years. The gig is up, the time – the clock is running and eventually they will either be evicted or they’ll move out just prior to that. So there’s a finite group. It’s an elevated concern right now. It’s probably got another quarter or so of kind of grinding through that process at the end of which things should return to normal in terms of the cadence of getting note – proper notices being able to backfill pre-lease, et cetera. So I think we’re getting closer to the end of that. We’re just not there yet.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then on the development side, can you talk about where construction costs have trended and if the math on a new start today is pinpoint out better than it has over the past couple quarters?
Ric Campo: So construction cost has definitely flattened, but has not gone down. And so in terms of – and when you look at land costs, landholders are probably if you’re really motivated land costs are down 20%, 30% probably. But there’s not a lot of motivated land sellers and a 30% decline in land costs with a construction cost that is – that has stayed flat but not gone up still is very, very hard to pencil. When you think about rental rates and sort of occupancy rates system-wide are not going up as much as they were. So you still have a very, very difficult time penciling development yields today. Hence the significant drop in starts in the June number relative to the June number last year almost third. And we think that that fundamentally because of this dynamic, you’re – and it is not just the lack of availability of funds because if you – if we – if developers could show that they can make a seven plus cash on cash return on a new development I think lenders would probably fund it. But the problem is that if you’re dealing with the current environment, it’s especially with interest rate costs going up as much as they have, that’s a pretty big part of the construction overall project cost. It just doesn’t pencil. And so we have not seen any kind of relief in the construction costs. And I really don’t think you will. I mean, you have a – when you think about just the even though construction is going down in the multi-family space, you still have a lot of contractors that are building out what’s under construction. And that takes 12 months to 18 months. And those folks are really busy now. What will be really interesting to see is that if this continues the way you think, it may continue you should see some pretty interesting cost numbers in 2025, 2026. Because when contractors start looking out into the future and they don’t see a pipeline. They’re going to have to be more competitive and start tightening their margins and thinking about how they have to compete to get the next job in 2025, 2026. So we could see some cost reductions next year towards the end of the year. But right now, the pipeline’s full and contractors are still printing money.
Brad Heffern: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. You may now go ahead.
Jamie Feldman: All right. Great. Thank you. Maybe shifting gears a little bit to the balance sheet. Can you talk – I know you put some refinancings on the credit line during the quarter. Can you just talk about the impact that had on your guidance? And then just as you’re thinking about, I assume turning it out into some unsecured at some point, what could – what – how do you think about the variability to your numbers if you can’t get that done in a reasonable time or at a reasonable price? And then as you look ahead to your 2024 expirations, how do you factor that into potential unsecured needs?
Alex Jessett: Yes. Absolutely. So if you look at the debt that we prepaid, the rate on that debt was about 100 basis points north of our line of credit rates. So it was actually accretive to prepay that debt, and that is the $0.01. $0.01 of the $0.02 increase that we had in our guidance for our full year numbers is coming from lower than anticipated interest expense entirely associated with that early prepayment. I will tell you that in our full year numbers, we are not assuming any bond transactions. Today we could do a 10 year that would be probably at least 75 basis points inside of what we’re borrowing underneath our line of credit. And so if we do a bond transaction sometime this year, assuming that rates hold or improve, it’s going to be accretive to our numbers.
Ric Campo: Yes. The variable rate that we have today is embedded in our run rate and won’t change our numbers. In any kind of capital markets transaction the bond market would be accretive to our numbers this year and next year. The interesting thing when you think about floating rate debt today is that historically floating rate debt has been cheaper than long-term debt. Obviously, with the Fed doing what they’re doing and short-term debt is now actually more expensive than long-term debt. And we expect that to change in the future because over the long-term people [indiscernible] been always cheaper and you have the optionality without having to fixed rates, long-term and all that. But ultimately, with a 4.2x debt to EBITDA, we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. We will take an opportunity to put some of that accretion into our earnings when the market is right for that.
Jamie Feldman: Okay, great. That’s very helpful. And then, you make a great point on the leverage. I mean, how are you thinking about capital if you were to find some really interesting opportunities on the acquisition side? Would you just increase leverage or JVs or just what are your latest thoughts?
Ric Campo: Well, we definitely have room in our leverage. We’ve always talked that our leverage is going to remain between 4x and 5x. And so we have dry powder to be able to increase the leverage if we choose to with the right opportunities. Today there really isn’t a lot of great opportunities just given the bid ask spread between the buyers and sellers. And given the horizon on construction costs perhaps coming down in 2025 and 2025, 2026 being a lean year for development, it might – it seems to us that that might be something we’d lean into before acquisitions. The comment on joint ventures, no, we will not do joint ventures. We have the most pristine and simple balance sheet in REIT land with zero joint ventures and zero complicated things on our balance sheet. And we’re going to keep it that way. We would rather invest 100% of our shareholders’ dollars into fewer transactions rather than dilute our management’s focus on whose investment we are the stewards of and we just think it complicates our balance sheet and it complicates our world. And we just aren’t going to do that.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. That’s very helpful. If you don’t mind me just squeezing in one more, because one of your investors just emailed me this question. Can you talk about occupancy stabilization potential in Atlanta and Austin?
Ric Campo: What are you referring to?
Jamie Feldman: Just at what point do you think markets occupancy can stabilize there? It seems like those are two of the outliers versus the portfolio average.
Keith Oden: Yes. So both of those markets are in the mid-94s, which is down from where they were last year. For a long period of time, we considered sort of 95% to be the number in terms of where we wanted to operate our portfolio that’s gotten – that’s come up over time for a whole lot of reasons, primarily around the ability to turn units more quickly and some efficiencies and just getting the real estate prepared to release. So you got two separate issues. You have in Austin, you do have a ton of units that are coming to market. So market wide, my guess is that you’re still going to see pressure broadly in Austin as they kind of work our way through close to 40,000 apartments in 2023 and 2024, they’re being delivered. I mean, the point I would make and I made earlier is only about 20% of that supply we think is relevant to Camden’s world, but obviously the other 80% is relevant to somebody else’s world. And so my guess is we’re going to stay under pressure. The entire market will stay under pressure. But I don’t – I think Camden’s going to be okay in terms of being able to handle the supply that’s coming. So Atlanta is a little bit different case. They have much fewer units that are coming. They do have supply that’s coming in 2023 and 2024, obviously. But there’s – Atlanta’s been a little bit of a microcosm of fraud and just bad acts that have nothing to do with COVID, most of this came about post-COVID, but it was actually pretty widespread. And it’s one of those things that once it gets into the network of the fraudsters, until you react and put in countermeasures, which we have done and most of our competitors have done, once they get in the door it’s in the environment we’re in, it’s kind of hard to – it still takes six to seven months to go through the process, even though you can technically evict in for non-payment in Atlanta. The reality on the ground is, is that it’s a process. It’s crowded. There are a lot of people trying to get through the process, so it’s slow. So there was a – there’s an issue in Atlanta that’s separate and apart from any of the supply issues. It’s just we’ve got people that are – we’ve got folks in our apartments that we’re working through to get out. My guess is most of our competitors do as well. But again, that’ll run its course over the next four to six months. And I think Atlanta will be fine.
Ric Campo: I’ll give you a personal example of this issue. So last year I rented an apartment in Chicago. I opened a bank account at Bank of America that has thousands of dollars flowing through it, I opened a Bank of America credit card, which I immediately ran up to the limit and then defaulted on. And by the way, I’ve never lived in Chicago. I never released an apartment or opened a bank account or had a Bank of America credit card that I defaulted on. My credit score went to 510. And just recently I tried to rent an apartment at a competitor in Charlotte. And the competitor happened to be – happened to know my name because they’re – we’re pretty well known. And they sent the information to a regional Vice President and said, by the way, is Ric Campo really trying to lease an apartment in Charlotte? And the answer was, no, he isn’t. And so this fraud is really interesting, and it’s sort of a cottage industry on the internet where people go on the internet and say, how do you live in an apartment for free for six months or for three months or for nine months? And then they cipher through the system and figure out how to do it. Six months to get my credit score back to where it should be and get all the fraud off of my personal credit report. But having been personally where my identity was stolen and trying to rent apartments with our competitors has been a real eye-opener. And it’s something that unfortunately is happening in our industry.
Jamie Feldman: Yes, it’s crazy. All right. Well, thank you very much for the color and I appreciate you letting me squeeze in that last question.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. You may now go ahead.
Ami Probandt: Hi, this is Ami Probandt. I’m thinking about the long-term outlook for the portfolio and how supply impacts it. Do you think that you can avoid a large chunk of potential future supply by being selective in the sub-markets that you acquire or develop in? Or is supply just really not avoidable in the Sunbelt?
Ric Campo: Well, I think as Keith pointed out earlier our portfolio, we diversify our portfolio geographically and through product. And the way we do it product-wise is we buy in sub-markets, maybe buy properties that have different price points. And so new development oftentimes is it has to be because of the cost structure in building new properties, you have to be generally at the top of the market. When you think about housing in America and including rental housing, not just single-family for sale, we have a shortage of affordable apartments in America, a big shortage. And so the challenge with that shortage is that the numbers don’t work to build to that middle market. The numbers have to be – when you bring new development, and it has to be at the top end of the market and so – or to the middle top end of the market. And so when you have a portfolio like Camden’s that has a lot of middle market properties that where you think that where the rents are 30%, 40% less than what it costs to do a new development. People are not going to lower their rents unless they have to, which today they don’t have to, you don’t have any major oversupply anywhere, including the Sunbelt. You’re in a situation where those folks that are in those middle market properties are not going to move up into the A properties or the top of the market properties because they just can’t afford them. And so that’s – so our portfolio is built for the long haul. We have – we’re going to have some of our properties, as Keith pointed out, that do have competition from new development, which is the top end of our properties. But a lot of our properties are middle market and they’re not going to be negatively affected. And so – and the idea that Sunbelt supply is always a problem, well, we’ve operated in the Sunbelt for 30 years and we’ve continued to do well in up and down markets and oversupply and undersupply. The good news today is that the market is really efficient. And once a market overshoots supply, guess what? People stop building. And we’ve seen it in all of our markets. And you’re going to be seeing significant declines in starts and in over the next 18 months. And then we’re going to be in a situation where people are going to say, when do you think supply’s going to start in the Sunbelt again after we have really good rent growth towards the end of 2024 and 2025. So the reason the Sunbelt builds is because we need the supply, because that’s where the job growth is, that’s where the end migration is. That’s where the folks are moving and it’s not that you build just to build, you build to make a reasonable rate of return on your investment. And people in the Sunbelt have done a great job in making a return on their investment, but when they can’t, they stop. And so we’re going to see that stop coming very soon. And then we’ll go back to the cycle where we’ve overshoot on the building didn’t happen. So rents will rise and occupancies will rise faster than normal in 2025 and 2026 as a result of that cycle. And then they’ll catch up with supply in 2027, 2028 and rents will – in occupancies will go down probably some a little, but the bottom line is, is that’s just the normal cycle. And the good news is, is that cycle has happened over the last – multiple times over the last 30 years. And we continue to do really well long-term in this business.
Ami Probandt: Okay. And then just a quick one. If you were to start a development project today, what would be the yields that you would target?
Ric Campo: So we have a development pipeline today and the projects we’re starting all have roughly 6% sort of cash flows with an IRR that’s 7.75% to 8%, 8.5% something like that.
Ami Probandt: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: We appreciate you being on the call today and supporting Camden for now over 30 years. We’ll look forward to the start of the fall conference season and we’ll see you soon. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may not disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-28 11:00:00) =====
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning, and welcome to Camden Property Trust's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman and President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Today's event is being webcast through the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and a replay will be available this afternoon. We will have a slide presentation in conjunction with our prepared remarks, and those slides will also be available on our website later today or by e-mail upon request. [Operator Instructions] And please note, this event is being recorded. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2023 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. We would like to respect everyone’s time and complete our call within one hour. So please limit your initial question to one, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we would be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes.  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard Campo : Good morning. Culture matters. This year, we are celebrating Camden's 30th anniversary as a public company. And last week, we wrapped up a 12-city celebration tour that included all 1,600 Camden team members. The tour is an annual Camden event, but we usually split up our executive team to cover the events. This year, Alex and Laurie Baker joined Keith and me at all 12 stops to celebrate our team's 2022 accomplishments and Camden's 30th birthday. Each celebration featured our teams in vintage 1990s attire and demonstrating one of Camden's nine core values: to have fun. I'm going to share an inside baseball look at Camden's unique culture set to a 1990s classic, All Star. [Audio/Video Presentation] While we are on tour, we got word that for the 16th straight year, Camden was included on Fortune's list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. We claim this honor on behalf of our Camden team and the entire REIT world. It is a testament to just how much progress we have made over the last three decades, and that culture really does matter. Operating fundamentals continue to be good. We are on track to meet or exceed our 2023 plan. Multifamily transactions have slowed dramatically. Activity for the first quarter was down 74% from last year as buyers and sellers try to recalibrate the increase in their cost of capital and what the future market dynamics may look like. New starts continue to be elevated with only legacy projects with committed capital starting. We expect the lag in Federal Reserve policy will start to have its desired effect with a significant reduction in new starts beginning in the second quarter and throughout the next year or two. I'm betting the over, on a 60% reduction in starts once monetary policy and the banking crisis make their way through the system. I want to thank and congratulate Team Camden for their hard work and staying true to our commitment to improving the lives of our team members, our customers and our stakeholders, one experience at a time. Next up is Keith Oden.
Keith Oden : Thanks, Ric. Now some details on our first quarter 2023 operating results and April trends. Same-property revenue growth for the quarter was ahead of our expectations at 8%, and we've raised the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance as a result. Once again, we saw the highest growth rates in our three Florida markets: Tampa, Orlando and Southeast Florida, with Nashville also posting strong results. First quarter signed leases grew by a blended rate of 4% with new leases up 1.8% and renewals up 6.7%. Our preliminary April results are trending at a similar level for blended rate growth with slightly higher new lease rate growth and moderating renewal rate growth. Renewal offers from May and June were sent out in the mid-6% range. While these growth rates were down from the record levels seen in the first four months of 2022, our 2023 year-to-date performance is actually stronger than what we would historically expect to achieve during the first four months of the year. Occupancy averaged 95.3% during the first quarter of 2023 and is trending slightly better to date in April. Net turnover for the first quarter of 2023 was 36%, in line with the first quarter of 2022. And move-outs to purchase homes dropped to 10.1% for the first quarter, one of the lowest levels on record in our 30-year history. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Our new development lease-ups remain stronger than usual as we average approximately 45 leases per month at Camden Atlantic, a 269-unit, $101 million community in Plantation, Florida, which stabilized during the quarter; approximately 40 leases per month at Camden NoDa, a 387-unit, $108 million community in Charlotte, which began leasing during the quarter and is now over 35% leased; and approximately 30 units per month at Camden Tempe II, a 397-unit, $115 million community in Phoenix, which continued leasing during the quarter and is now over 70% leased. Turning to our financial results. Over the years, Camden has fully supported the NAREIT definition for funds from operations or FFO, and we will continue to report that metric going forward. However, in an effort to improve comparability and alignment with the current reporting practices of our peers in the multifamily REIT sector, we will now also report core FFO to adjust for items not considered to be part of our core business operations. We presented both metrics in our earnings release last night for our actual performance during the first quarter and have included both metrics in our guidance for the second quarter 2023 and full year 2023. Any property level adjustments we make to drive core FFO, which primarily are unusual or large casualty events, severance charges in 2022 related to changes to our on-site staffing model and the amortization, if any, of below or above market leases associated with acquisitions will also be adjusted from our same-store results. These property level adjustments will be located in the other section of our components of NOI in our supplement. For the first quarter, we reported both NAREIT FFO and core FFO of $1.66 per share, $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance, resulting primarily from better results from our same-store communities. These results represent a 12% per share core increase from the first quarter of 2022. Our first quarter outperformance was primarily driven by $0.02 per share and lower-than-anticipated levels of bad debt as we experienced a higher-than-anticipated level of move-outs by non-paying residents during the quarter. All the municipalities in which we operate have now lifted their restrictions and our ability to enforce rental contracts. And the resulting move-outs of non-paying residents happen earlier than we anticipated with twice the amount of move-outs in the first quarter of this year as compared to the first quarter of last year. Although these early move-outs of delinquent residents do put some pressure on physical occupancy, we reserve for effectively 100% of delinquent balances. And therefore, there is no net negative impact when non-paying residents leave. Rather, we receive the benefit of having our real estate back, the opportunity to commence a lease with a resident who abides by their rental contract and lower bad debt from having a new resident who actually pays. Our outperformance was also driven by $0.005 in slightly higher-than-anticipated net market rents and $0.01 in higher other property income primarily driven by elevated levels of utility rebilling, which was entirely offset by higher utility expenses. Our $0.035 per share of positive same-store revenue results was partially offset by $0.025 of higher same-store property expenses primarily driven by much higher-than-anticipated levels of property insurance claims resulting from an unusual spike in smaller claims, generally under $25,000 per occurrence, which did not count towards our aggregate $3 million exposure. To illustrate the spike, in the first quarter of this year, we experienced the same number of claims that we experienced cumulatively in the first quarter of the prior three years. At this time, we believe the volume of claims is an anomaly, but we have made a resulting partial increase to our insurance forecast for the rest of the year, which I'll discuss later. Our original 2023 same-store guidance called for revenue growth of 5.1%, expense growth of 5.5% and NOI growth of 5%. Included within our 2022 results which drove this original guidance was approximately $900,000 of first quarter 2022 revenue associated with the amortization of below-market leases from previously acquired communities and approximately $900,000 of first quarter 2022 severance costs associated with changes to our on-site staffing model. These offsetting amounts are now considered noncore and have been removed from our 2022 same-store for 2023 comparison purposes. Additionally, our full year 2022 results included a net $1 million of noncore casualty losses primarily in the back half of 2022, which will also be removed from our 2022 same-store results for 2023 comparison purposes. The effect solely from these adjustments would be to increase our original 2023 same-store revenue guidance from 5.1% to 5.2% and increase our original same-store expense guidance from 5.5% to 5.9%. Last night, we further increased the midpoint of our full year revenue growth to 5.65%. This additional increase is based upon our first quarter revenue outperformance, which primarily resulted from the previously mentioned acceleration in move-outs of non-paying residents and our slightly higher net market rents and other property income. Additionally, we further increased the midpoint of our same-store expense growth to 6.85%, almost entirely driven by actual and anticipated higher insurance costs. Insurance represents approximately 6% of our total operating expenses. And after taking into account the previously mentioned adjustments for 2022 noncore casualty events, was originally anticipated to increase by 18% in 2023. After taking into consideration the higher first quarter claims, we have increased our anticipated monthly losses in our forecast. We have also updated our May 1 anticipated premium increase from 15% to 20% as insurance providers continue to face large global losses. We now anticipate our total insurance expense will increase by approximately 35% in 2023. These insurance increases for the remainder of the year are partially offset by anticipated slightly lower salaries and property taxes. After taking into effect the increases in both revenue and expenses and the adjustments for noncore property level events in 2022, the midpoint of our 2023 same-store NOI guidance is 5%, and the midpoint of our full year 2023 core FFO is $6.86. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we are still assuming $250 million of acquisitions, offset by $250 million of dispositions with no net accretion or dilution and $250 million to $600 million of development starts spread throughout the year with approximately $290 million of annual development spend. We also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2023. We expect core FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.66 to $1.70, representing a $0.02 per share sequential increase at the midpoint primarily resulting from an approximate $0.03 sequential increase in same-store NOI resulting from higher expected revenues during our peak leasing periods, partially offset by the seasonality of certain repair and maintenance expenses and the timing of our annual merit increases and a $0.005 sequential increase related to additional NOI from our development and non-same-store communities. This $0.035 cumulative increase in core FFO is partially offset by a $0.005 decrease from higher second quarter G&A resulting from the timing of various public company fees and a $0.01 decrease from higher floating rate interest expense. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt to EBITDA for the first quarter at 4.3x. And at quarter end, we had $268 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo.
Jamie Feldman : Great. I guess I was hoping to focus on rent growth in April versus the first quarter. It looks like it moderated down to 3.9% from 4.5% on a blended basis. Can you just talk about if that seems to be a trend heading into spring leasing, if there's anything else to read into there? And then maybe across the different markets, what drove the decline?
Keith Oden : Yes. So we did see a slight decrease. But overall, we think this is -- April, the March to April transition to us looks a lot like previous years to COVID. They're just -- we do expect to see and have seasonality back in our leasing activity. It's certainly a different than what we had in the last two years of transition into the spring leasing season. So I don't see that -- I think we'll have a normal seasonality. I think that we're on track to beat our original plan. I think at the end of the first quarter in every single market with the exception of one of the 15, we're actually ahead on budgeted revenues. So from our perspective, it looks like: A, more normal; and B, on track and slightly better than what we originally anticipated going into the second quarter.
Alexander Jessett : And Jamie, I think I'd focus more on the signed leases rather than the effective because the signed is more an indication of the direction we're going. And signed leases went from 4% in the first quarter to 4.2% in April. So it actually increased.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein : Maybe just one follow-up on your comment there. You said one market is underperforming your budget. What market is that and on the flipside, what markets are performing the best?
Keith Oden : Yes. So Atlanta was actually below on revenues but below our original budget in the first quarter, and that is primarily due to skips and evictions are pretty elevated. We also had some challenges with an elevated level of fraud, which pops up from time to time in several of our markets. And it was just sort of Atlanta's turn for that to happen, and we did see a fair amount of that in the quarter. Across the board, other than Atlanta, everyone, every single market outperformed our original plan. We had continued strength in the Tampa, Orlando, South Florida markets. Nashville had a great quarter relative to plan. So I think overall, at the footprint, it really looks like it performed very well in the first quarter, and I think we're off to a really good start of the second quarter as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank.
Derek Johnston : You mentioned in your opening remarks a possible 60% drop in new development given the macro. But I'd ask, what are you seeing in input cost for development? And given it takes a couple of years to complete, does second half '23 become interesting to Camden given the balance sheet from a starts perspective and the land banks so that you really have new product as deliveries decline exiting the downturn?
Richard Campo : Absolutely. When you think about what's going on, the only deals that are getting done, are our legacy deals that either -- that have debt and equity already sort of committed to. Any new development or sort of second- and third-tier developers are not getting their deals done. And so there will be a significant decline in, we believe, in starts beginning in the second quarter and probably all the way through into the first part, maybe second half of 2024, which definitely sets up a pretty interesting environment in '25 and '26 because obviously, as you point out, that development takes a long time to bring to the market. So given our strength in our balance sheet and our pipeline, we definitely -- definitely we'll look at delivering -- starting new projects when other people can't and delivering into what could be a really good market in 2025, 2026. I think the input costs, the good news is, is that they are flat. We haven't started to see major decreases in cost. Lumber is at a very low level today. And that's good news. So rather than in our pro formas, we would usually put a 1% per month inflation, let's say, if we were doing it last year at this time, and now we're at least flat. And potentially, once the, I think, the subcontractors start working through the inventory they have today and they start looking out on the horizon, they're going to have to squeeze their margins to be able to get new business because there's going to be more competition, I think, for less projects getting built. Therefore, more competitive set with the subcontractors and which should constrain their margins and perhaps have costs down more from here. The big input that hasn't gone down yet are salaries. And at the end of the day, you just haven't had a lot of pressure on construction workers or folks that are in that side of the business. But that could happen depending upon -- we know starts are going to come down. The question is how fast will the merchants compress for the subcontractors, and that's where the largest part of the input cost on construction is.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb : So Ric and Keith, I have to ask you, you guys have been a standout in NAREIT discipline on FFO and pretty upfront in taking all of your lumps positive or negative over the years. Sort of curious why you guys chose to move when core FFO is not an official metric, there's no standardized definition. So everyone sort of dines a la carte. And I mean, we just did a study of it. And most of the items that people back out are actually recurring business: legal expense, storms, debt prepay. I mean, all these are normal parts of the business. So I'm just sort of curious why you guys chose to go down this route.
Richard Campo : Yes. We chose this because our competitors are doing it. And the challenge we have, we've been sort of coached by other investors and shareholders that they were getting confused about numbers. And I will give you exact example of that. When we produced our initial guidance for 2023, probably half or 2/3 of analysts missed the mark-to-market on rents from our acquisition of the Texas Teachers portfolio. And so we just wanted to codify it in a way where people could actually see it in specific financials and not have to look at -- look through footnotes and try to figure out, okay, yes, they have this item and that item. And so we're trying to just make it more simple for people to understand what's going on in those numbers. And I think having to have people scour through the financial statements and try to understand where the variations are is complicated, and we're trying to make it more simple for people. We still have NAREIT FFO definition obviously, and then we just give folks more information about adjustments to NAREIT so they don't -- it makes it easier for people, I think, to model future earnings.
Alexander Goldfarb : Yes. But I mean for 30 years, it worked. And it's our job as analysts to go through the financial statements, right? So I mean, that's -- it doesn't create comparability only because you guys may have certain items. You -- other companies have others. So it arguably makes it more confusing, not easier, but appreciate the feedback.
Richard Campo : Based on the conversations that we have with people after they missed this really big item in 2022 relative to 2023, now all you have to do is go in and look at the reconciliation between NAREIT and core. And you can see all the items there, and you don't have to go dig in through financial statements. And unfortunately, I know you guys are pretty -- analysts are pretty overworked, if you want to call it that, in terms of being able to find stuff. And it may be the job of a lot of folks, but we just want to make it easier for those who don't have the time to go through and read every footnote.
Keith Oden : And the good news, Alex, is that for the -- for people who want to use the original NAREIT definition, it's there for anybody to use. So it just -- I think more information is generally better. So thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste : I wanted to go back to the commentary on getting some of the long-term delinquents of the portfolio. I think we assume you're primarily referring to SoCal. I guess can you remind us what's in the full year '23 same-store revenue guide from a net bad debt impact perspective? And what's your updated expectation?
Alexander Jessett : Yes, absolutely. So originally, we anticipated about 140 basis points for the full year. And today, we've got about 120 basis points.
Richard Campo : So let me just give you a little color too on skips and evictions. So skips and evictions are basically double in the first quarter what they normally are. And 80% of those skips and evictions were people that owed us significant amounts of money. So the good news is, while our occupancy is not as high as it was and our skips and evictions have doubled, we're getting people out that aren't paying rent. So from an economic occupancy perspective, it's a really good thing to have that happen. And we're hoping that it accelerates in markets like Southern California. As soon as we can get our real estate back to -- with paying customers, the better for us.
Keith Oden : And just to put a -- just as a data point reminder, for 27-plus years, our bad debt ran roughly 50 basis points. And then in COVID, we went up to about 150 basis points. And it's -- clearly, it's -- we've peaked, and we're coming back down that curve. And whether -- is it a new world order where we don't ever get back to 50? I hope not, but I certainly don't have any reason to sit here and believe that we don't get back to 50 basis points of that debt once all of the bad actors that have been cycled through. And certainly, it's our hope and expectation that we will get a lot closer to 50 basis points of bad debt expense from where we are today at 120.
Haendel St. Juste : No, that's helpful. Question -- follow up if I could. I guess the plan to go after the 80% who skipped, what's your expectation or plan there? And then with the turnover picking up from these getting people, I'm assuming CapEx turnover, some of the OpEx costs are going up. Just curious if that's already embedded in your expectation as well.
Alexander Jessett : So the offset on the turnover is that we've had very low move-outs to purchase homes. So that's been the benefit on that side. So we're not really seeing a significant uptick on CapEx or repair and maintenance costs associated with turns. And then the folks who move out with balances, obviously, we're going to do what we can legally to try and make them pay what they owe us.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Wolfe of Citi.
Eric Wolfe: It sounds like a piece of the same-store revenue increase was due to higher rate growth in 1Q than expected. Could you just talk about sort of how much higher it came in than what you were thinking, which markets drove the improvement and whether you still expect overall market rent growth to be 3% this year?
Alexander Jessett : Yes. So we think overall market rent is going to be just a hair north of 3%. That's what we've got baked into our numbers. What I will tell you is that we did see slightly higher market rent really across the board in every one of our markets. So that's a good trend. And obviously, 1 quarter is -- makes us a little optimistic, but we'll see how it continues as we go through our peak leasing periods.
Operator: The next question comes from Ami Probandt of UBS.
Ami Probandt: I was just hoping to touch on Houston. It's been a bit of an underperforming market. I was wondering if you thought that, that was more due to a muted level of demand? Or if you're seeing good demand but supply is just making the conditions challenging? And what are your expectations for Houston going forward?
Richard Campo : Houston is going to be, I think, a really good long-term market. It definitely has supply challenges. And what's interesting is that you compare Houston to, say, Dallas or Austin, Houston was slower to add back jobs primarily because of energy. And the energy companies have not added back all the jobs that were cut during COVID. They've figured out how to be much more efficient. But when you start looking at other metrics like for example, the current census data that came out just recently for 2021 versus 2022 ending June 30, 2022, Houston had -- Houston was the fifth or the second largest growth in population of roughly 125,000 people moved to Houston during that one-year period. The only other city that was higher than that was Dallas at 170,000 units. And to give you kind of a sense of the -- this migration issue helps Houston, helps Dallas. But because of the oil energy or the energy jobs that weren't replaced and also supply, we haven't been able -- we haven't seen the same kind of top like we did in Dallas or Austin. So it's more of a steadiness in Houston than a big increase like we saw in a lot of other markets versus Houston. I think Houston continues to be steady growth. And with the supply side getting ready to shut down pretty dramatically over the next year or two, it should be positioned really well to grow. When you think about the population growth, the top 20 cities in America, 10 of which were in Camden's market. And our markets gained roughly 780 -- or 580,000 job or 80,000 people net, while if you look at the three other major markets that lost were New York, L.A. and San Francisco lost 300,000 in population at the same time that we gained in our markets almost 600,000 job -- population base. So while it's not white hot here, obviously, like it is in Tampa, Orlando, South Florida, it's still pretty respectable.
Ami Probandt : Okay. So would you say that then it's more of a supply impact?
Richard Campo : I would say that, yes, I think it's more of a supply impact than it is -- yes. I mean, because if you don't have the -- we didn't have the white hot job growth like Dallas and Austin did because of energy. And so it's been more of a goal line, get along. So it's a little less jobs and a little -- and supply combining that to take the sort of the sizzle out of the market, if you want to call it that.
Keith Oden : So just to put some numbers around -- just to kind of put some context around that in Houston in the first quarter, our actual -- the average monthly rental rate grew by 6.4%. So if our -- the overall portfolio, of course, grew at much higher than that. But if this were -- if you were comparing trends today in Houston versus looking backwards over the last 30 years, you'd say, oh my gosh, that was a really good quarter for run rate growth. And we had a little slip in occupancy that we think corrects itself in the second quarter. It's related again to some kind of one-off challenges around skips and evictions and a few cases of fraud that we have to -- it seemed to be more prevalent in today's world than they were at pre-COVID days, but we're working through that. So overall, I think Houston is going to be fine and is well ahead of plan from what we thought it would be at this time of the year. So I think we're going to be fine.
Operator: The next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.
Robin Haneland: Robin Haneland here filling in for John. One of your peers acquired a lease-up in Atlanta, a 6.6% cap rate, 5.7 tax adjusted. Do you think you'll see more deals in lease transact at these levels?
Richard Campo : I do. I think that as the market can use to evolve, cap rates have obviously moved up given the very low volume and acquisitions. I think there's just going to -- there will be a point in time merchant builders need to sell to be able to pay their debts off. And I think that there's going to be a fair amount of that going on. If we continue to keep rates, especially short rates as high as they are now, which I don't see any light at the end of that tunnel anytime soon given the Fed's position, then it's putting pressure on those merchant builders. And I think there's going to be likely more transactions once they get to the point where they -- where hope is maybe dashed a bit more for them. And then they'll -- pricing will come more towards buyer's pricing rather than seller's pricing, and there should be some opportunities there.
Robin Haneland: Got it. How opportunistic would you like to be there?
Richard Campo : Well, we're positioned really well with a strong balance sheet. And I guess the real question will be, when do we get to that sort of tipping point where cap rates really look attractive? And when you can buy a property for lower than replacement cost today at a cash-on-cash return in the mid-5s to 6, that's a pretty attractive opportunity depending on the market. I think you are going to have some softness going forward in certain markets, given the supply side of the equation. And that should position buyers, including Camden, to take advantage of that.
Operator: The next question comes from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs.
Chandni Luthra : Could you talk about how concessions are tracking across your market and perhaps where are the markets where the use of concessions has inched up a bit since fourth quarter?
Keith Oden : We don't use concessions. The only except in the case of where we're doing a new lease-up because it's always just sort of been the consumer's expectations. So where we have lease-ups going on, fortunately, the lease-up rates have been pretty phenomenal on our new lease-ups. So we're actually using much less concessions than we normally would. We are having at our Atlantic product in South Florida averaged almost 45 leases per month through the entire lease-up, which is kind of insane. And so we're -- and again, we're having great success at our other lease-ups as well. And our broad portfolio, our stabilized assets, we just -- we -- with revenue management, we use a net pricing model, and we don't really -- make it easier for the consumers so they don't have to do the math. And we don't really use concessions although I would tell you that in certain submarkets, our competitors, you see that it comes and goes. Primarily, they tend to be very reactionary. They see some softness, and then they offer concessions. And if it continues soft, then they double the concession. But we just -- that's just not part of our pricing discipline.
Chandni Luthra : Great. And in the past, you've talked about new supply in some markets being more pronounced than others. Perhaps you could just give us a refresher there. What are the markets where you're seeing more supply pressure, and what are you seeing on the ground from that standpoint?
Keith Oden: Sure. Without running through all 15 markets, I mean, just kind of give you some macro look, and we can go into the details after the call if you like market by market. But -- so if you go up to Camden's markets combined, the completions that we had across Camden's platform in 2022 were about 127,000 apartments. We expect that to -- and these are Ron Witten's numbers. We do expect that to jump this year to about 188,000, so about a 50% increase in completions across Camden’s markets in 2023. And again, based on Ron's Witten's numbers, that number jumps to about 228,000 in 2024, and that would be the peak at least using his numbers for this cycle. So we're going to have -- we are going to continue to have supply pressure at our portfolio over the next two years, for sure. But when you -- completions and new supply is very location-dependent. So just because you have X number of -- X thousand apartments being delivered in Houston or in Austin or city, there are large metropolitan areas. And you have to really drill down and say, okay, what of this supply that's being built and delivered is going to actually be competitive where Camden's portfolio is located. And if you go through that, across our portfolio, all 15 markets of the total supply that's coming in 2023 and 2024, there's only about 40% of that product that is locationally competitive with Camden's existing portfolio. And if you go one step further and say on a price point basis, if our assets in those submarkets are average 15 years old, and you're delivering new construction, there's just a different price point that's -- that makes some of this non-competitive as well. And if you screen it for both location and price point, there's only about 20% of the new assets that are being delivered across Camden's portfolio that we are probably going to experience direct competition with. And when you look at it in that regard, it becomes much less dawning. I would say that based on our first quarter results and kind of what we're looking at for the next -- for the balance of this year, even in light of the increased completions that we know are coming across our platform, if we were going to see a lot of impact, if a lot of the stuff was truly competitive with Camden's products, we'd be seeing it right now. But the reality is only about 20% of it turns out to be truly competitive. I think we're in pretty good shape at a macro level for Camden's markets.
Operator: The next question comes from Robyn Luu of Green Street.
Robyn Luu: Can you provide more color on the lower property tax expectations? Is this a result of more successful appeals? And how many more appeals do you expect to finalize in the coming quarters?
Alexander Jessett : Yes, absolutely. So originally, we thought we were going to be up 6.5%. Now we think we're going to be up 6.2%. The primary driver of that is that we've gotten some preliminary valuations that came in a little bit lower than we expected. Keep in mind that we can test basically everything. And so we anticipate that we will contest almost all of these valuations. We'll work through that as we go through the rest of the year. A lot of the values that we're going to test this year, we actually won't get the benefit of until 2024, but that certainly is our process. If you think about what we're anticipating in terms of refunds, we're actually anticipating a pretty significant amount of refunds in 2023. Most of those, once again, are driven by 2022 sort of actions. So that's where we are. Tax refunds in '23 are estimated to be $4.8 million. That's up $600,000 on a year-over-year basis. So really, the main ticket that's out there that we have to wait for is rates, and we'll get most of our rates in really starting in August of this year and running through October.
Operator: The next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt : Just curious, turnover had increased in the first quarter, but you've talked about how move-outs to purchase a home are down pretty significantly, which makes some sense given -- I'm just curious kind of where you think residents are going? Do you think people are trading down in price due to several years of outsized rent increases? Is it in the single-family rentals or people potentially bundling up? Just kind of curious what your take is on the move-out piece.
Alexander Jessett : So I'll address the first item, which is exactly right, is move-outs to purchase homes have come down pretty significantly, but we have doubled our early move-outs that are related with non-paying residents. So that's sort of the trade-off on that side. And then when we look at where -- or the reasons for move-out, we really haven't seen -- other than those two, we haven't seen any changes. The #1 reason why people typically move out is a relocation, and it's usually associated with where they're finding jobs. So it's moving within the market and moving outside of the market.
Keith Oden : Yes. It's skips and evictions. I mean, that's the bottom line is that we had almost double skips and evictions in the first quarter this year than we had in the last couple of years in the first quarter. So that -- the 10% is -- that's a -- we've got to get -- we're near an all-time low for move-outs to purchase homes in our portfolio. My guess is, is that probably trends back up in the second quarter. There's a little bit of seasonality to that number. But yes, the fact that we're flat year-over-year on turnover is almost exclusively increasing skips and evictions.
Austin Wurschmidt : Got it. And then just a clarification. You mentioned you're sending on renewals for May and June in the mid-6% range. And the renewals you signed in April were closer to that high 5% range. So just curious if that's the difference between the take rate versus asking or did something give you the confidence to kind of bump up renewals again a little bit higher as you get into the peak leasing season?
Keith Oden : No, you're correct. That's the difference between the take rate and the asking. And we're always -- there's always some flexibility around the renewal process. And if a community is off their target, then the way that we can make sure that we're maintaining our occupancy target is to make sure that we don't -- we keep the back door closed. So that's the difference.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb : Just circling back on the insurance, a two-parter. Alex, you mentioned 20% increase in your expectation for premiums, but you also mentioned 35% overall. So I'm guessing the latter includes your claims in addition to the premiums. The second part is, Ric and Keith, do you anticipate that potentially competitors like in a Florida or Texas would be unable to get insurance, and therefore, those properties would sort of have to close, and that would put more demand on your properties? I'm just sort of curious what happens with properties that can't fill their insurance book this year just given everything that's going on in Florida and Texas.
Alexander Jessett : Yes. So Alex, you're right on the first part. So that's exactly what it is. So we've got -- our premium is higher than we anticipated, and we're actually going to bind that on Monday. But the offset to that is just -- or excuse me, the addition to that is just a much higher amount of claims.
Richard Campo : Yes. And to the second question on people shutting down their properties because they can't get insurance, I don't think that's going to happen. I think what happens is, is it creates an opportunity for folks like us who broadly insure a very large portfolio. Our insurance cost is going to be lower than a standalone insurance policy that somebody can get in Florida. So I don't think it's -- I don't think you're going to see properties close down, but what I do think you're going to see is that we'll put more pressure on people to sell, and the pricing will be reflective of what the cost is from an insurance perspective.
Alexander Jessett : Yes. And we are hearing of further new developments in Florida that are not able to start in part because of very large insurance increases. So obviously, that's a net positive for us.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Eric Wolfe of Citi.
Eric Wolfe: Just wanted to follow up on your comment around expecting a 60% reduction in starts. Obviously, it's a bold prediction. I think you said that you expect to start seeing it in the second quarter, which is now. So I'm assuming -- maybe you could just help us sort of understand why we haven't seen a bigger drop off so far? And what's going to sort of happen over the next sort of 3 to 6 months to sort of result in that large drop that you're expecting?
Richard Campo : Sure. So first of all, the starts that are happening today are starts that are legacy starts or maybe in the first quarter were legacy starts, meaning that the deals were teed up. They are fully funded with equity. They have bank loan, and they're looking at the same thing we're looking at. If you deliver in '26, it probably is going to be a really, really constructive market given the current environment. I think the difference between the first -- so legacy deals are already funded. What's happening today, however, which is being exacerbated by the banking crisis is that banks are pulling loans. I mean we -- I'll give you an anecdotal example of, a developer in Florida called me and said that they had a fully funded deal with 35% equity or 40% equity, 6% debt. And the lender pulled the debt after the Silicon Valley Bank situation. And they walked their earnest money and lost a significant amount of money because they couldn't -- the bank pulled the debt. And when you -- when I talk to my friends at regional banks, I mean, they're not funding deals that they thought they would fund in the future. So I think not only has the higher interest rates and rental rates moderating with construction cost hasn't come down enough, and land prices haven't come down enough where the numbers just don't work. And I think that you're starting -- you will start to see that in the second quarter. We think starts might be at the level for the entire quarter what March was, which was around 49,000 units. So I just think that developers are crafty enough to keep their legacy deals in place, and that's why you haven't seen a dramatic falloff in starts. But it's starting to happen, especially since the banking crisis has created, in essence, almost another 25 basis point or 50 basis point rate increase as a result of those banks just pulling out of the market altogether.
Eric Wolfe: Got it. Yes. I mean, I guess that was going to be my follow-up is why to point that now versus, say, five, six months ago because we’ve just been in a very volatile capital markets environment for a while. Rates have been high for a while, moved up in north of 4 last year. So it's just interesting to see to point that now. It sounds like your thought is really that it's a response to what happened with Silicon Valley Bank and some of the regional banking issues that more recent has created the sort of tighter lending environment. And that's what's going to potentially drive some lower starts going forward.
Richard Campo : Yes, I think it's twofold, right? First of all, the banking crisis is, in fact, tightening lending. There's no question about that. And there's lots of anecdotal information out there on that. And then the other part of the equation is that developers are very optimistic group, and they'll project into 2026. But they also have a math problem. I mean, you have -- cost of capital has gone up by 30% for most people. And when you then try to figure out, okay, I have my input cost versus what I think the cash flow is going to be, and then you put higher interest rates and higher cost of capital on the equity, and the math just doesn't work. And so until -- unless there's a big shift in thinking where you start seeing major declines in starts, which you think is going to happen, you will -- and then people think, okay, I'm going to go ahead and bet on 2026. The challenge is you've got to bet on massive rent increases to cover your cost of capital increase and your debt increases, assuming that construction costs stay sort of flat. And I think it's just a pretty simple math problem. And while developers will always build if they have capital, right now, both the equity and the debt markets are saying, "Well, let's try to figure out what happens in the future." And because starts are -- I'll emphasize this again, developers build because they can. And when they can't, they don't. And that's what's going on right now.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo.
Jamie Feldman : Great. So along those same lines, you made the comment before about maybe ramping up start to deliver into a good market in '25 and '26. I mean, what's the magnitude that you would even consider? And when do you have to make a go or no-go decision on really throttling up the development pipeline? And then similarly, when you think about the markets, I mean, where is there the right balance of not too much supply and an opportunity to deliver something into what you know will be a pretty good market?
Richard Campo : Yes. So I think that we have a decent pipeline. We -- when you look at our -- I think our pipeline is now 1.3 billion or 1.4 billion that we're having, started. So we have a decent pipeline to start. We have generally been -- we're from 300 million to 500 million of annual starts. And again, the question will be how do we feel about the market and how do we feel about construction costs? And then how do the numbers work, right? And when you get down to -- those are the ultimate questions. In terms of markets, you look at our portfolio and we have some really nice sites in Nashville and nice sites in the Carolinas and in Florida. And so those are all really good viable markets. When you look at all the dynamics that go into those markets from a -- in migration, population growth, job growth, all that are all positive in those markets. So the negative would be in Nashville, for example, is either the top market under construction or the second top may be followed by Austin. And so that's -- those are the dynamics that we'll look at. And if we don't think that the numbers work, we won't build a project. We'll just wait and see what happens.
Jamie Feldman : Okay. And I guess in terms of the balance sheet, how much more than your typical average annual starts do you think you could do or would be willing to do?
Alexander Jessett : Yes. I mean, we've got tremendous capacity under our balance sheet. And it ultimately all comes down to if you think about acquisitions, we could basically put about $1 billion on our balance sheet and still keep our rates where they are. If you look at developments, obviously, they don't contribute EBITDA at the beginning, but our rating agencies would understand that they will over time. And so I think you could have -- if you really wanted to, you could have sort of a swell of starts with a corresponding increase in leverage that could then come back down. So we've got plenty of capacity.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard Campo : Great. Well, we appreciate you being on the call today and look forward to seeing you either in the next month or in NAREIT in June. So thank you very much. Take care.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-03 11:00:00) =====
Kim Callahan: Good morning. And welcome to Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I am Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman and President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s event is being webcast through the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and a replay will be available this afternoon. We will have a slide presentation in conjunction with our prepared remarks and those slides will also be available on our website later today or by e-mail upon request. [Operator Instructions] All participants will be in listen-only mode during the presentation with that opportunity to ask questions afterwards. And please note this event is being recorded. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today’s call represent management’s current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden’s complete fourth quarter 2022 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. We hope to complete our call within one hour and we ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we would be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I will turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Our theme for today’s on-hold music was waiting patiently, which is what we find ourselves doing these days. The bid ask spread for multifamily assets is as wide as I can ever recall. Sellers seem to be hoping for valuations to return to last year’s peak. Some sellers acknowledge a decline in valuations of 10% to 15%, but buyers point to a dramatically different macro backdrop now versus last year and reckon value should be lower. The result is the current standoff that won’t be resolved until buyers and sellers adjust their views on valuation and meet somewhere in the middle. Until then, we wait patiently, which is a lot easier for Keith to do than me. This brief video sums up the hours that Keith and I have spent in recent months debating the merits of waiting patiently versus making something happen now. [Video Presentation] By any measure, 2022 was the best operating environment Camden has had in our 30-year history. We exceeded the top end of our guidance and raised guidance every quarter. Operating conditions over the last two years have never been better, driven by being in the right markets with the best product and having the best teams. Apartment demand was driven by an acceleration of in-migration to our markets that open sooner after the pandemic and continue to be more business-friendly driving outsized job opportunities. And a massive release of rental demand from people who were previously at home with their parents or doubled up as government stimulus added to their savings and subsequent buying power, as a result, apartment supply could not keep up with increased demand. 2023 will be a return to a more normal housing demand market. Consumers still have excess savings and the job market remains strong. Despite rising rents, apartments remain more affordable than purchasing homes for many consumers in our markets given the rise in home prices and interest rates. Most of us don’t like slowing revenue or negative second derivatives, but I think we need to put things into perspective. Apartments are and will continue to be a great business. Consumers will always need a place to live and will choose high quality, well-managed properties to live in. We are projecting 5.1% revenue growth for 2023, absent coming off last year’s 11.2% record breaking growth, our 2023 projected revenue growth would be the sixth highest growth rate achieved over the last 20 years for Camden. At this point, I’d like to give a big shout out to our Camden teams across America for a job well done in 2022, and I want to thank them for improving their teammates lives, customer’s lives and stakeholder’s lives, one experience at a time. And I will let Keith take over the call now. Thank you.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. As many of you know, we have a tradition of assigning letter grades to forecast conditions in our markets at the beginning of each year and ranking our markets in order of their expected performance during 2023. We currently grade our overall portfolio as an A- with a moderating outlook as compared to an A with a stable outlook last year. Our full report card is included as part of our earnings slide call slide deck, which is now showing on the screen and will be posted on our website after today’s call. At this time last year, we anticipated 2022 same-property revenue growth of 0.83% [ph] at the midpoint of our guidance range. As we announced last night, Camden’s overall portfolio achieved same property revenue growth of 11.2% for 2022, well ahead of our original expectations and marking a record level of same-property revenue growth for our company. While conditions are expected to moderate during 2023, our outlook calls for same-property revenue growth of 5.1% at the midpoint of our guidance range, which would mark another year of above long-term average growth for our portfolio. We anticipate same-property revenue growth to be within the range of 4.1% to 6.1% this year for our portfolio, with most markets falling within that range. The outliers on the positive side should once again include our three Florida markets, Orlando, Southeast Florida and Tampa, with Houston and LA, Orange County falling likely below 4%. The macroeconomic environment today is uncertain and the magnitude of 2023 job growth or even job losses remains a wildcard, but we expect our Sunbelt focused market footprint will allow us to outperform the U.S. outlook. We expect to see continued demand for apartment homes in 2023, given high mortgage rates for single-family homes and a reluctance from would-be buyers to make the transition to homeownership amidst this uncertain economic environment. We reviewed several third-party forecasts for both supply and demand in our markets for 2023, and the outlook for recession scenarios and job growth or job losses varies dramatically. As such, I will spend my time today focusing more on the supply aspect and expected completions and deliveries in our 15 major markets this year. Those estimates also vary quite a bit, but our baseline projection assumes approximately 200,000 new completions across our markets during the course of 2023. Our three Florida markets, Orlando, Southeast Florida and Tampa once again earned A+ ratings but with moderating outlooks. These three markets had a weighted average revenue growth of 16.4% in 2022 and are budgeted to achieve between 6% to 8% this year. Overall, supply will likely increase in these markets and we expect completions of 12,000, 11,000 and 6,000 units, respectively. Charlotte, Raleigh and Nashville would rank next with an A rating and moderating outlooks for 2023 versus 2022. This will be our first year of reporting same-property statistics for Nashville, but we anticipate same property revenue growth of 5% to 6% for each of these three markets. New supply will continue to be a headwind this year, particularly in Nashville, but in-migration trends and overall levels of demand remain strong. Our estimates for new deliveries in these markets are 11,000, 9,000 and 10,000 units, respectively. Up next are Dallas and Phoenix, which received A- ratings with stable outlooks. Dallas should deliver around 20,000 units this year, but so far demand drivers remain strong and should allow for absorption of many new apartment homes. Phoenix is likely to see another 15,000 units completed this year, which will further temper revenue growth from double-digit levels to a more moderate rate of 5% or so. We expect Denver and Austin to fall around the middle of the pack for our portfolio with approximately 5% revenue growth and would rate them as an A- with moderating outlook, completions in Denver are projected to be around 15,000 apartments and in Austin is expected to see over 20,000 new apartments come online this year. Both of these markets have seen their fair share of supply in the past few years, but demand has been remarkably strong. Given recent announcements regarding layoffs in the technology sector, we will keep an eye on both of these markets for any future signs of slowing demand. Our next three markets, San Diego, Inland Empire, Washington, DC Metro and Atlanta earned a rating of B+ with a stable outlook. We expect completions of 10,000, 15,000 and 13,000 units, respectively, and revenue growth in the 4% to 4.5% range. San Diego Inland Empire should face less supply pressure than some of our other markets this year, but the overall regulatory environment in Southern California puts us in a wait and see mode for now. Operations in Washington, DC Metro and Atlanta seem to be more of the same and should continue at a steady, stable pace throughout 2023. Houston and LA, Orange County are two last markets with grades of B and B-, respectively, and revenue growth projections of 3% to 4% this year. Our outlook for these two markets are a bit different as we see an improving outlook in Houston versus a stable outlook in LA, Orange County. Both markets should see manageable new deliveries with 15,000 and 20,000 units, respectively, but economic conditions in Houston may be a bit more resilient with energy companies making profits and performing well. LA County was clearly -- has clearly had higher delinquencies and bad debt compared to our other markets, and we remain a bit cautious on when restrictions and regulatory issues around addictions and non-payment of rents will actually begin to improve. Now a few details of our fourth quarter 2022 operating results in January 2023 trends. Same-property revenue growth was 9.9% for the fourth quarter and 11.2% for full year 2022. Nine of our markets had revenue growth exceeding 10% for the quarter and our top three performers were our Florida markets of Tampa, Southeast Florida and Orlando. Rental rates for the fourth quarter had signed new leases up 4% and renewals up 8.4% for a blended rate of 6.1%. Our preliminary January results indicate a return to more normal seasonal trends with a blended growth of 4.2% on our signed leases to date. February and March renewal offers were sent out with an average increase of 8%. Occupancy averaged 95.8% during the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 96.6% last quarter and 97.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021. January 2023 occupancy has averaged 95.4%, compared to 97.1% in January 2022. Annual net turnover for 2022 was up slightly compared to 2021 at 43% versus 41%, and move-outs to purchase homes were 13% for the quarter and 13.8% for the full year of 2022, down from 16.4% for the full year of 2021. I will now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activity. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed construction on Camden Atlantic, a 269 unit, $100 million community in Plantation, Florida, which is now almost 90% leased, averaging over 50 leases per month, well ahead of expectations. Turning to financial results, last night we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $191.6 million or $1.74 per share, in line with the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance. These results represent a 15% per share increase in FFO from the fourth quarter of 2021. Included within our fourth quarter 2022 results is approximately $0.01 per share of additional insurance expense associated with the recent winter freeze. Excluding these non-recurring insurance charges, our results would have exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.01 per share resulting from the faster than expected leasing velocity at Camden Atlantic, combined with lower employee health insurance claims and lower property tax rates in Texas. For 2022, we delivered record same-store revenue growth of 11.2%, expense growth of 5.1%, which included the additional insurance expense from the winter freeze and record NOI growth of 14.6%. You can refer to page 24 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2023 financial outlook. We expect our 2023 FFO per share to be in the range of $6.70 to $7, with a midpoint of $6.85, representing a $0.26 per share increase from our 2022 results. This increase is anticipated to result primarily from an approximate $0.36 per share increase in FFO related to the performance of our same-store portfolio. At the midpoint, we are expecting same-store net operating income growth of 5%, driven by revenue growth of 5.1% and expense growth of 5.5%. Each 1% increase in same-store NOI is approximately $0.07 per share in FFO. An approximate $0.26 per share increase in FFO related to the additional NOI from our Fund acquisition we completed on April 1, 2022. This includes the additional three months of ownership in 2023 and an approximate 6% increase in NOI from the portfolio. And an approximate $0.16 per share increase in FFO related to the growth in operating income from our development, non-same-store and retail communities, resulting primarily from the incremental contribution from our nine development communities in lease-up during either 2022 and/or 2023. This $0.78 cumulative increase in anticipated FFO per share is partially offset by a $0.21 per share increase in interest expense, of which $0.08 per share is from the utilization of our unsecured credit facility to retire our $350 million, 3.2% unsecured bond that matured on December 15, 2022. We are anticipating an average 2023 interest rate on our credit facility of approximately 5.5% and $0.10 per share from the full year impact of the $515 million of secured debt we assumed as part of the Fund transaction, inclusive of the impact of higher interest rates on the $185 million of assumed variable rate debt. The remaining $0.03 per share in additional interest expense comes from additional borrowings in 2023 under our line of credit primarily to fund are anticipated development activities. Our forecast also assumes we will use our credit facility to repay our $250 million, 5.1% unsecured bond, which matures in June of 2023. An approximate $0.07 per share decrease in FFO related to our 2022 amortization of net below market leases related to our acquisition of the Fund Assets. As we discussed on prior earnings calls, purchase price accounting required us to identify either below or above market leases in place at the time of the acquisition and amortize the differential over the average remaining lease term, which was approximately seven months. Therefore, in 2022, we recognized $0.07 of FFO from the non-cash amortization of net below market leases assumed in the acquisition. An approximate $0.07 per share decrease in FFO related to equity and income of joint ventures and management fees as we now own 100% of the Fund Assets; an approximate $0.06 per share decrease in FFO resulting primarily from the combination of higher general and administrative and property management expenses caused by continued wage pressure and inflation, higher franchise and margin taxes and higher corporate depreciation and amortization; an approximate $0.06 per share decrease in FFO due to the additional shares outstanding for full year 2023, resulting primarily from our 2022 equity activity; an approximate $0.04 per share decrease in fee and asset management and interest and other income, primarily related to the earn-out received in 2022 from the sale of our Chirp investment and lower cash balances expected in 2023; and an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO from the disposition we completed in 2022. Our 2023 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 5.1% is based upon an approximate 4.5% earning at the end of 2022 and a current 1.5% loss to lease. We are assuming we capture a third of this loss lease in 2023 due to the timing of lease expirations and leasing strategies. We also expect a 3% increase in market rental rates from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. Recognizing half of this annual market rental rate increase, combined with our embedded growth and loss to lease capture results in a budgeted 6.5% increase in 2023 net market rents. As a result of increased supply, we are anticipating an 85-basis-point decline in physical occupancy, which results in 100-basis-point decline in economic occupancy after accounting for lower levels of rental assistance proceeds anticipated in 2023. When combining our 6.5% increase in net market rents with our 100-basis-point decline in economic occupancy, we are budgeting 2023 rental income growth of 5.5%. Rental income encompasses 89% of our total rental revenues. The remaining 11% of our property revenues is primarily comprised of utility rebilling and other fees closely correlated to occupancy and these items are expected to grow at approximately 1.5%. Our 2023 same-store expense growth midpoint of 5.5% is primarily driven by above average increases in property taxes and insurance. Property taxes represent approximately 37% of our total operating expenses and are projected to increase approximately 6.5% in 2023, primarily driven by larger valuation increases anticipated in Florida, Georgia and Colorado. Insurance represents 6% of our total operating expenses and is anticipated to increase by 12.5% as insurance providers continue to face large global losses. The remaining 57% of our operating expenses are anticipated to grow at approximately 4% as inflation and wage pressures combined with anticipated increases in marketing expenses as we face increased supply are partially offset by the positive impact of our 2022 on-site staff restructuring. We are expecting total salaries and benefits to increase at less than 2% in 2023. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we assume $250 million of acquisitions offset by $250 million of dispositions with no net accretion or dilution. Page 24 of our supplemental package also details other assumptions for 2023, including the plan for $250 million to $600 million of development starts spread throughout the year with approximately $290 million of annual development spend. We expect FFO per share for the first quarter of 2023 to be within the range of $1.63 to $1.67. The midpoint of $1.65 represents a $0.09 per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2022, which is primarily the result of an approximate $0.05 per share sequential increase in NOI from our development and stabilized non-same-store communities, entirely offset by an approximate $3.5 per share increase in sequential same-store expenses resulting from the reset of our annual property tax accrual on January 1st of each year and other expense increases, primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends, including the timing of on-site salary increases and the lower levels of employee health insurance claims in the fourth quarter of 2022, which are not expected to reoccur in the first quarter of 2023; an approximate $1.5 per share decrease in sequential same-store revenue primarily driven by lower levels of anticipated rental assistance proceeds and sequential declines in occupancy; an approximate $0.02 per share increase in interest expense, resulting from the utilization of our unsecured credit facility to repay the December 15, 2022 maturity of our 3.2%, $350 million unsecured bond; an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO, resulting primarily from the timing of our annual corporate salary increases and various other corporate accruals; an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO related to our fourth quarter 2022 amortization of net below market leases related to our acquisition of the Fund Assets; and an approximate $0.05 decline in fee income related to the timing of our third-party construction activity. Our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt to EBITDA for the fourth quarter at 4.1 times, and at quarter end, we had $304 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I don’t know if this is for Keith, Ric or Alex, but just as you think about kind of your blended spreads and kind of looking at the new versus renewal. Could you just provide a little bit more color on the 8% number that you talked about, and what sort of, I guess, concessions or discounts are you having to offer when you are sending a mandate, are people signing at that and then also the new 1% up looks kind of low, do you expect that to turn negative at all in the next, say, six months to nine months?
Keith Oden: Yeah. On -- Steve, on the renewals that are being sent out, we really don’t do concessions in our portfolio. The only time we ever use concessions is on new lease-up properties where kind of its expected and it’s just sort of written into the pro forma and underwritten that way. But we don’t really do concessions. We sign our leases within -- and typically sign them within 50 basis points to 75 basis points of what the renewals are sent out at. So there is some give, but it’s not a whole lot. Regarding new leases, at 1% up, we do expect that to increase slightly over the course of 2023. Seasonally it looks like we do have a return to actual seasonality and did in the certainly at the end of the fourth quarter and that will likely continue until we get closer to our peak leasing season. But, overall, we are looking for another strong year of 5.5% plus or minus rent growth, which as Ric pointed out, in standalone and without kind of juxtaposition to what we did in 2022 over 11%, that would be a really strong year for our portfolio historically. So we are looking forward to that.
Ric Campo: To your second question, Steve.
Steve Sakwa: Great. Thanks.
Ric Campo: To your second question, we don’t expect our new leases to go negative at all over the next six months to nine months. Now if we have -- depending upon what happens, what unfolds throughout the year, whether we -- our feel and the way we built our guidance was that we would have either a very -- reasonable soft landing or a mile recession and so we combine that and that’s why we took our occupancy numbers down and our vacancy numbers up. But as far as new leases going negative, generally, if you look at historical sort of timing of seasonality, they tended to go negative in the -- in sort of November, December, January and then start a positive rise after that. This year, we didn’t have them go negative during that period. Now we clearly had a significant negative second derivative on growth, but we never went negative. So assuming if you have a recession next year and we have more reasonable or more normal market seasonality, then they may go negative in December. That’s just new lease growth.
Steve Sakwa: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate you walking through all the different market outlooks. But if we kind of drill into Houston, LA and Orange County, three of the ones, I think, you are expecting to underperform a bit in the same markets that have underperformed at least for the past few years. So what do you need to see from those markets maybe structurally kind of going forward that would change the outlook and get them more towards the top end of the grade?
Ric Campo: Well, the challenge you have with…
Keith Oden: Well…
Ric Campo: … Southern California is that, if you look at projected popular -- projected migration from either immigration, legal immigration or domestic migration, Southern California over the next three years has almost $0.5 million -- 0.5 million people leaving. And on the other hand, if you look at Texas, including Houston, we have about -- the projections show around 350,000 of new migrations. So that’s one of the big things is you just have this drag on people moving out of those markets and moving into our markets. What could help Houston fundamentally is continued energy transition jobs that are happening here and continued strength in the oil and gas market. The oil and gas folks just to give you some numbers laid off about 80,000 people in the pandemic period and have only added back about 50. So what’s happened is as they become more efficient, even though they are printing money right now, if you look at their earnings, but they haven’t really stepped up to hire people and they become a whole lot more efficient. I think Southern California has some upside, because ultimately, when you get past the COVID measures. I mean, that’s been the biggest challenge there is you have a huge gap between economic occupancy and physical occupancy almost 1,300 basis points. And part of that -- and I think it’s all driven by the fact that in California, you don’t have to pay your rent, and so, ultimately, when that clears then which hopefully they extended it to the end of May or end of March in terms of restrictions. But, hopefully, once that ends, you will have a positive situation where you will be able to kind of run your business like a business. Today, we can’t get our real estate back and people smile as they live free and drive their BMWs and Teslas and feel pretty good about the world.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate that. And then just on your opening comments on the transaction market, you mentioned the wide bid ask spread and kind of having some patients. Where would you by today, I guess, from a cap rate or an unlevered IRR basis, what would you be comfortable underwriting and transact and if the seller was willing to do it there?
Ric Campo: Yeah. The cap rate side is kind of hard to peg, because the question will be whether -- what we think the upside of the property is, a lot of times in five properties they are pretty poorly managed using revenue management wrong in a long-headed way, and we can create a lot of value from that. So we find properties that are stressed, you may be buying by the pound, not the cap rate and then we will be able to drive the cap rate up. In terms of unlevered IRRs, we have increased our unlevered IRR hurdles by at least 100 basis points, so given our cost of capital rise. So we would be looking at for acquisitions in the $0.07 kind of plus range on levered IRR basis.
Nick Joseph: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Alex, I believe you referenced a $1.5 negative impact to fourth quarter FFO from lower rental assistance and I was wondering if you expect any additional impact going forward and just what you are assuming for net bad debt for this year in your guidance?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So net bad debt for us for 2023 should be right around 1.4%. When you think about rental assistance, so in 2022, on a same-store basis, we got about $11.5 million of rental assistance, and in 2023, we are assuming some but really negligible amounts. So the best way to sort of think about it is that, on a net basis, there’s not much of a change in terms of bad debt from 2022 to 2023. But if you sort of back out the positive benefits of rental assistance that we got in 2023 then we are showing, excuse me, in 2022, then we are showing some improvement in 2023.
Ric Campo: And ultimately, our bad debt is about 0.5%.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. That’s helpful.
Ric Campo: And that’s the challenge we have today, it’s very elevated and given the outlook for a potential recession, we are hoping that 1.4% will start going down throughout the year and then, ultimately, go back to 50 basis points number in 2024. So there’s some positive growth that can come from people actually starting to pay their rent.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yeah. Got it. Understood. And then it seemed like Houston had started to see some momentum last year sort of bucking maybe the trend of some of your other markets, given it didn’t have as difficult comps, but it is remaining at the lower end of your revenue growth expectations and market outlook. And I guess I am just curious what’s really holding back Houston from stacking up better versus other markets and is there a potential for a surprise to the upside as you move through the year?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So we have -- in our forecast, we have used 15,000 completions in Houston, which the normal year in Houston that would be seen as a positive to the overall market conditions given the size of the Houston market. Interestingly enough and Ron Witten’s number numbers, he actually has Houston job growth is basically flat or I mean zero and flat total employment over the year. And after -- it’s one of those things where we don’t necessarily agree with Ron on everything and I think it’s very possible that he’s got the -- that he has the job growth outlook he’s understated it in Houston. The Greater Houston partnership came out with numbers after Ron’s latest update that indicated Houston could be as high as 60,000 or 70,000 new jobs in 2023. That’s quite a range between zero and 70,000. So I think when we look at our modeling and he carries that over into his rental forecast, we probably tweaked Ron’s rental forecast in Houston to reflect a little bit more dynamic situation on job growth in Houston. So I think there is a chance if the energy business continues as it is right now, which is basically almost every energy company in the country in the fourth quarter reported record earnings. If that trend continues, I just can’t imagine that we are not going to see a more robust job growth situation in.
Ric Campo: Yeah. I think the other thing that could help Houston a lot is the, when you think about the federal government spending, even though we have lots of supply coming on the supply is getting shut off. We know that’s happening right now given the current financial environment. And we have a tremendous amount of -- in Houston of federal money that’s coming here, be it via hydrogen, carbon capture, expansion of the port and just a lot of big government projects that are going to create a lot of employment over the next 12 months to 36 months with the massive amounts of spending from the Infrastructure Bill and The Inflation Reduction Act and that Houston should benefit big time from both of those.
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s helpful. Thanks for all the detail.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Michael Goldsmith: Our turnover was down 100 basis points in January and blended lease growth increased to 2%. Is that indicative of an upturn in trend? Maybe asked another way, is there any indication that demand has bottomed and how did top of funnel demand and conversion in January compared to December or prior months?
Keith Oden: So the question of kind of where we see demand, I think that the decline that we saw between November and December was far -- it was outsized compared to normal history. We normally see a decline in occupancy and rental rates from November to December, at somewhere around the 20 basis points or 30 basis points and this year it was wide of that by 40 basis points or 50 basis points on both metrics. So there’s clearly -- there’s something changed in the total amount of people seeking apart -- seeking to lease apartments between November and December that was a little bit higher than what we would have normally expected. There’s no doubt about that. I mean we have sort of kind of made the comment internally that it felt like people a lot of our runners went home toward Christmas holidays and a fair number of them stayed at home. So but look our trends have gotten better in January. Our traffic is sufficient to backfill and to maintain the occupancy and over time increase it a little bit. We did decrease our overall occupancy for the year of 2023 from where it was last year, but last year, we at historically elevated levels and we have modeled 95.7% in occupancy for 2023, which, again, by historical standards is really still quite strong for us.
Ric Campo: One of the things that was -- I will just kind of hit it in a really broad way, because and these data points that I am going to give you right now are just really hot off the press over the last week or two. As Keith pointed out, we felt definitely a -- more a seasonal situation during the fourth quarter. But it was also, as he said, it’s sort of like people just went away in December. And when you look at the stimulus and post-pandemic demand, right? And think about this, these numbers are pretty amazing. In 2021, the industry absorbed 600,000 net new units in 2021 in multifamily and that’s when we had the massive stimulus, lots of people have money and they moved out. If you look at the average between 2014 and 2023 or 2021, the average, there are about 150,000 people on average that made between 25,000 a year and 75,000 a year. In 2021, that number grew to 450,000. And so the same thing can be said for the 75,000 to 100,000 cohort, went from 100,000 people to 150,000 people. And then over 75 went from those were fewer, but you went from 150,000 people on average to 2.25%. And what happened was the whole market moved up in terms of people that had money because of the stimulus and because if you think about -- even if you lost your job during this pandemic, if you lost your job in 2008, 2009, you have got a fraction of your pay unemployment -- maybe 60% of your pay through unemployment insurance. The way that stimulus worked and the way unemployment was tweaked during the pandemic is you have got 110% or 115% of your pay when you lost your job. So you have this massive saving. It moved up a lot of people into the world that wouldn’t otherwise have been able to afford an apartment and they all moved out to apartments. If you look at 2022, we had a net absorption of 50,000 units, right? So you had -- we had really anemic absorption. A couple of other numbers that I think are really fascinating would be, in the fourth quarter of 2008, which was a really bad time in the world, we had a negative, this is national negative absorption in multifamily of 115,000 units. In the fourth quarter of 2022, which obviously, is a lot better than the fourth quarter of 2008, we had 181,000 net loss of apartment. So 115 to 181. The 181 was so big relative to the history. I couldn’t find a time, at least Keith and I have been in this business where the number was that big. And what happened, obviously, is that those people that moved up income wise have spent their money and move back and they stayed home up for Christmas instead of coming back and renewing their leases and that’s why when you start thinking about next year. I think next year, it’s going to be a good year ex some real bad recession side of the equation. But that’s why you can’t continue to have 14%, 15% NOI growth with double-digit revenue growth when the market is going back to a more normal market. We are just getting off the sugar high of everybody has money and can go out and do whatever they want including lease apartments.
Michael Goldsmith: That’s a very helpful commentary. And then in your guidance, there’s a wide range for development starts. So maybe what macro conditions would you look for that would drive you to the top end of the range versus maybe the bottom end of the range? Thanks.
Ric Campo: There are a couple of key points. One is that, if you look at what’s going on, the biggest sort of change in the market from a product perspective has been banks have really shut down construction lending. And with the uncertainty with interest rates, rents now are not going up fast enough to be able to offset the construction cost increases that we have had in the past. So you have a lot of models that show merchant builders dropping construction somewhere in the 40% to 50% range. If you look at starts today, they are around 0.5 million and so the folks we look at show that those starts going to like 250,000 by the end of this year, almost a 50% cut. So if that trend continues, then the way we think about the world is it takes 24 months to 36 months to build a property, you have great legacy land that makes sense for us to build on and we could deliver at a time where you have very low supply in 2026 and 2027 given the outlook for the supply to be reduced. The other thing we are starting to see is because most folks are do believe that that starts will come down dramatically this year, then you are starting to see price pressure moderate. We -- last year, there was probably -- in the last three years, construction costs have gone up over 30% to almost 40% in terms of cost. Now we are seeing it flat and then actually go down. So there could be an opportunity over the next six months where you do see some significant cost reductions and if we can get our costs down, and we believe fundamentally that supply is going to be down and the market will be pretty good in 2025 and 2026, then we are going to lean into that and that’s where we would be hitting the top end of our development range. If sort of the interesting part is if you think about, if you have a recession, then those starts will really go down this year and costs should come down even more. So that could allow well-capitalized companies like Camden to buck the trend and develop when merchant builders can’t and be able to position higher returns on developments than you would expect today in 2025 and 2026. So that’s how we think about it.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck this year.
Ric Campo: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Good morning out there. My first question is going back to the same-store revenue guide. Can you clarify for us the building blocks and how the math works? I am looking at your current midpoint of 5%, 5.1%, but also considering the earning, which I think was around 5% and the market rent growth assumption that you have in your supplemental of 3%. So assuming half of that gets us into the, call it, mid-6%s. So can you spend a moment to kind of clarifying the buildup to our sensor revenue and what are the swing factors to get to the upper and lower end? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So, first of all, you are right, the earn-in and we will call it the earn-in plus sort of the loss to lease that we think we can capture is about 5% and then we have market rent growth from December 31 of 2022 to December 31 of 2023 of about 3%. So, obviously, you can only get half of that. So to the 5%, you add the 1.5% and that gets you to 6.5% and that’s what we call net market rent. Then the driver is sort of the dilutive impact to that is economic occupancy. So we are making the assumption that occupancy comes down about 100 basis points. So you take the 6.5% and you back off the 100 basis points and that gets you to a 5.5% rental income growth. Now remember that rental income is only about 89% of our total property revenues. So if you take that 5.5% rental income growth and you multiply it by 89%, you get to about 4.9% and then the other 11% of our rental revenues comes from other income and think about water rebilling, trash rebilling, admin fees, application fees, those type of items and they are so closely correlated to occupancy. And they are also -- some of them are statutorily mandated to the amount that you can actually charge and so we are expecting that 11% to grow at about 1.5%. So if you multiply those two out, you get 0.2, you add the 0.2 you are 4.9 and you get exactly to 5.1%.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. That’s helpful. Second question is on the $250 million of acquisitions and dispositions you outlined in your guide. I guess I am curious on how we should broadly be thinking about the timing in light of the sale transaction markets you outlined? Are you willing to wait for better cap rates or are you expecting better cap rates, getting calls from many -- getting more calls for merchant builders or sensing an opportunity there and then any markets that you are outlining that you are adding more to or calling from? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: So I will answer the timing and then let Ric and Keith answer the second part of it. But the timing of what we have in our model is we have got it towards the end of the year and we have got them offsetting one another. So there’s no net accretion or dilution from acquisitions or dispositions in our 2023 guidance.
Ric Campo: We just got back from NMHC and it was interesting, there were 8,500 registered people there are record for NMHC and that doesn’t include couple of thousand that don’t want to pay the fee, they just hang around the hoop, trying to have meetings with people trying to understand the market. And we sort of -- it was interesting because you had sort of three camps. You have the camp where the capital like -- people with capital like us and other portfolio managers and others and we were all kind of -- we are kind of waiting to see what’s going to happen. Then you had merchant builders who still are kidding themselves that they are going to start as many properties that they thought they are going to start this year. And there are some that are that are realistic, that are actually betting on a lower number than as projected. And then you have the brokers who are all very excited about getting back to work. When you look at some of the numbers that we heard January numbers, I heard one of the national brokerage group said they did about $1 billion of sales in January of 2022 and this year they have done $80 million. And so there is definitely a -- the market is frozen to a certain extent because you have this bid ask spread and I think as the market develops, capital, we will look to try to get reasonable rates of return. Like I said earlier, I think it might be where you are buying by the pound and knowing that, ultimately, you will be able to make a reasonable rate of return, but maybe not initially in terms of you might buy lease-ups and things like that, that don’t really have great return ship, you might buy at substantially below what we could replace it for today. So I do think that there is definitely a wait and see attitude and that, that will continue probably until there’s just more clarity. I mean, when you think about the Fed’s meeting this week, they -- I think most people believe like the 25% basis points, market like it. Interest rates came down and then all of a sudden [inaudible],you have 500,000 jobs a day and 10 years back to 350 and now we are back to talking about, well, what’s the Fed going to do now, right, a 50-year low on unemployment rate. And so there’s just so much uncertainty that it’s hard to get conviction and when I think the market gets conviction, then you will start seeing there’s plenty of dry powder out there and the question is who will blink first and I think it’s going to be the sellers that have to blink first. I am hoping that anyway.
Haendel St. Juste: I agree with that. Yeah. No. I agree too. I agree with your comments. I was at [inaudible] housing too and I did speak to a handful of people in the minority who thought that, well, maybe a better spring selling season and lower interest rates in the back half of the year could result in lower cap rates. Is that a scenario that you can envision, I mean, how do you think about potentially that outcome?
Ric Campo: Well, I guess, on the one hand, there’s a mountain of capital, right? And multifamily is a great business and people understand that. And so I guess if you have -- if the Fed can sort of thread the needle and doesn’t crash the economy and rates -- forward rates look like they are going to be in the 3% to 3.5% range, I think, you could argue that cap rates might either affirm dramatically or come down some. I think that when you look at the negative leverage that people have to put on their properties today. If you look at Freddie and Fannie spreads relative to the 10-year you are at about -- you are about 5%, 5.25% and if you are going to buy a 4% cap rate, you got 150 -- 100-basis-point to 150-basis-point negative spread there and you got to figure out how do you get that negative leverage dealt with. And if you want to fix a 6.5 to 7.5 unlevered IRR, you got to bet on some pretty strong growth or falling cap rates in the future to ever make those numbers work. So there is a scenario, for sure, but it’s -- right now I wouldn’t bet on that scenario.
Haendel St. Juste: Thanks for the time and your thoughts.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good morning down there.
Ric Campo: Good morning.
Alexander Goldfarb: So two questions -- good morning. Two questions. First off, on California, just especially in light of what LA recently did, do you -- has your view of that market changed, I mean, I have asked you the question over the years about California and there are a lot of good qualities about Southern California lifestyle, et cetera. But it seems like the conditions there for landlords get tougher, tougher every year, now uncertainty with the good cause and whether or not further rent infections whatever. Is that a market that you still believe in long-term or your view has changed in the past year where you are like, you know what, it’s not the market that we thought it would return to, you mentioned 500,000 people returning, I mean, sorry, leaving that -- eventually that’s something that we have to strategically assess?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So, Alex, we -- the last two years as -- and all the trials and tribulations that have come with restrictions and the eviction moratorium, et cetera. Those have been -- to me those have been a distraction from the bigger picture. California has had a challenge and has been a challenge to operate in for not just the last two years but for the last three decades or two and half decades anyway. And so there’s a -- you have to kind of get your mind around the fact that it’s a different regulatory regime. Everything is going to be trickier. Everything is going to be a little bit stickier in terms of moving forward on new initiatives, et cetera. But that’s something that we have lived with for 20 years. And we know how to do it. We are good at it. We have a very seasoned team in California that knows how to navigate their way through normal -- the normal regulatory morass in California. The last two years have been an exception to that for sure. But I do believe and we believe as a team that at the end of the -- at least the eviction moratorium and the ability to get control of our real estate is coming to an end. And they -- I know that they said, I swear to God, this is the last time we are going to extend it. But I do believe that the LA County extension for this last two months came with a very public announcement supported by virtually the entire council that said, we are going to do this and then really and truly no kidding, this is the last one. So whether it is or it isn’t and whether it goes on for another two months beyond that, and the big picture of having operated out there for almost 20 -- over 20 years, I don’t think you can -- in a business like ours, given the nature of our assets and the long-term commitments that we make. I don’t think you can kind of just get emotionally wound up about what craziness the last two years have been. I think if you look beyond that, California is actually a really good story in terms of being a landlord, because it’s just as difficult as it is to run properties, it’s 3x difficult to build properties in California. So it’s kind of like you -- the new supply challenge is not going to be what it is that we have to deal with in our other markets. So California will -- I guess I am a little more optimistic than most people that will reach a tipping point in some of these places where sanity has to prevail and maybe we don’t end up with the continued hemorrhage of out migration from California and things get more on a normal track. If that were to happen, you would get a great return in demand. You haven’t had any meaningful amount of replacement or new product built in the last four years in terms of new starts. I think it could end up being a really good operating environment once we get past this two and half years of crisis.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Second question is and Ric, you guys are always sort of the speaker on regulatory policy, obviously, we all know what the White House put out. In your view, does this make Fannie, Freddie debt less attractive if borrowers think that the government is going to use them to effect change? And second, the CFPB and FTC obviously have broader regulatory powers to go after all apartments do you fear that this is going to be some sort of overreach or your view is there are local regulations that already regulated apartments are already so tough that it’s really hard to really sort of up the ante, if you will?
Ric Campo: Yeah. So on the first question with Freddie and Fannie, I don’t think it’s going to affect it that much, because when you look at those guidelines it’s -- they are really targeting lower income and trying to help there. I mean one of the things that people don’t realize is when you think about the attacks that the multifamily business are getting, you have to think about who the largest entities or that evict people or public housing agencies, right, federal government and so not market rate companies like Camden. Just to give people a sense to, by the way, in a normal time, where we try to keep our residents as long as we can. We work with them to create value for them and we work on payment plans. In a normal time, out of 60,000 apartments, we may be evict 600 people a year. And a lot of those evictions are people not monetary defaults, but the persons like has a dog to bit somebody or is disruptive to their neighbors. So I feel pretty good about long-term that we are not going to be under siege. Clearly, for a politician, when rents go up 30%, they scream for rent control and they screen for, oh my god, there’s bad people doing thing. It’s almost like the -- when energy prices go up and gasoline is $4.50 a gallon, they think the energy companies are the villains, right? But it’s really supply and demand driver there. I think the -- we do have to be vigilant, though, because it is a politically expedient oftentimes to just say, well, we will put a cap on and we will do rent control, because that will help constituents. But ultimately, we all know that and there’s lots of economic analysis on this, both left and right think tanks all think that rent control stifle supply, which ultimately creates the problem for folks. Good news for Camden is we are in the markets we are in. We don’t have a lot of major regulatory targets on us and I think that a lot of the -- even like when you look at Florida, for example, where a couple of the markets have tried to put in rent control. I mean they are just getting massive push backs from both legally and from the state houses. So we do need to be vigilant, but I don’t think we are at risk of having some massive government making us do stuff.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Chandni Luthra: Hi. Thank you for taking my question.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Chandni Luthra: The first one is on TRS acquisition, so with the benefit of hindsight, as you think about the different moving pieces, especially around higher interest expense now versus at the time of the transaction. How would you qualitatively think about this deal now and the net accretion from it, especially when you consider the dynamic that has also increased your exposure to markets like Houston and DC that, as you mentioned, are your B-ish, B- kind of ratings in sort of the whole deck?
Ric Campo: Well, I think, the acquisition is still a great acquisition. At the time we financed it with equity, mostly equity, we had $600 million of cash and we executed a large equity transaction to pay for it. And so, ultimately, when I think about that portfolio, it was a very low risk acquisition for us, primarily because we either built them or bought them. We operated them, so there was really no transition risk or no, oh, gee, got you risk, because you didn’t know what was going on with those properties since we clearly knew everything that was going on with those properties and so from an accretion dilution perspective, it was accretive in 2022 and it’s accretive in 2023.  When you look at or the walk that Alex showed in went through in our press release, the broader interest rates going up were a drag on our FFO, not as a result of that transaction per se, it was bonds coming due, they were at three, did some change that we are having to finance, at five we have some change now. So I think it was a very good transaction for us. Ultimately, we would have had to unwind that portfolio, because we had a 2026 kind of timeframe where we would have to sell the assets and so to be able to acquire really high quality properties with very little transaction risk was really attractive to us. To the issue of longer term, we want to lower our exposure in DC and Houston and the Fund transaction actually increased our exposure to Houston is -- we were willing to sort of delay that a bit to be able to acquire those quality properties. But, ultimately, we are going to grow our way, either grow or out or dispositions and acquisitions in other markets to be able to lower those exposures. And really, it’s all about trying to become more geographically diverse so that we can have less volatility in our cash flow and that’s sort of one of the reasons why we wouldn’t exit California right now, because it’s a good ballast and also could be great upside over the next couple of years once we get out of the pandemic issues. So, yeah, we will continue to focus on being more diverse around the country and move assets around. If you think about from 2014 through 2020 -- roughly 2020, we sold over $3 billion of properties and moved the portfolio around pretty dramatically during that time and changed our geographic footprint and we will continue to do that. So, hopefully, in this in this environment when buyers and sellers get closer together, we will be able to execute some of those sales and acquisitions to move to continue to diversify our portfolio.
Chandni Luthra: Very helpful. Thank you for that. And as a follow-up, as we think about occupancy in 2023 and the dip that you guys talked about, how much of it is emanating from higher supply versus you guys perhaps prioritizing pricing over occupancy? And then as we think about California in this mix down the line, as you said, a couple of mixed months down the line, you would be perhaps thinking about looking to get back your real estate from tenants who are not paying currently, how would you put that in this mix of how occupancy might develop?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So we are modeling occupancy that’s 95.4% for plus or minus for 2023, which compared to our long-term average is about where we would like to operate the portfolio in any case. We have certainly been higher than that for the last couple of years. But as Ric described, the drivers of demand that sort of made that happen were very unusual and probably not likely to, hopefully don’t see that kind of demand driven for that reason at any time in the near future. So I think we will -- I think we use -- we are pretty strict revenue management shop and the levers that you can pull are the primary lever is pricing to try to adjust your occupancy to maintain in the in the mid-95% -- mid- to-upper 95% range. So we will continue to take those recommendations from YieldStar. We think the inputs to the model, both on the looking at the new supply, which we know is going to be a headwind. We think we have properly accounted for that in our forecast. But the -- ultimately, it’s -- it will come down to the conditions on the ground in each individual market as viewed by the YieldStar model in terms of where the pricing actually falls. So, in California [Audio Gap] is likely to happen. That doesn’t -- that in itself doesn’t solve the issue of getting real estate back, you still have to go through a legal process to affect an eviction. And unfortunately, in California and several of our other markets, even those where they have long since given up on the moratorium, they are still struggling to catch up with the process of going through a legal eviction. So we are prepared to do that. We are expect to be first in line to pursue evictions, but we just know that it’s going to be some lag between, okay, we have lifted the moratorium, now you can begin the process, which in some cases, can take 30 days to 90 days depending on the jurisdiction. So it will be -- I think even after March 31, it will be a little bit of a drag in terms of time to get our real estate back. The flip side of that is, is that we think that once the gig is up for the non -- for the rent strikers that they may choose to just move out voluntarily before we evict them, because they know there’s the end is in sight and that’s something that they haven’t had to contemplate for the last two years.
Chandni Luthra: Thank you for all that detail.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Hey. Good morning our there. Thanks for hanging with us.
Ric Campo: Hi, Rich.
Rich Anderson: So you are driving around the country, I am curious to know how is the market clearing that gets you to where you are at with revenue growth at 5.1% versus last year, obviously, we are all expecting deceleration. But is these landlords like yourself and others kind of sort of slow playing it, because of the uncertainty that lies ahead or are you seeing some sort of behavioral shifts with residents that’s causing the market to clear -- where it’s clearing and it kind of all comes down to market rental rate growth, what you are assuming for this year at 3%. Is there a chance that we do have this soft landing or no recession or whatever you want to call it, if that market rent growth number could be something much higher than 3%?
Ric Campo: Sure. That’s why we have a range, right? I think and what the upside in our guidance could clearly be occupancy. I mean if you have a very positive -- the job number today was eye-popping, obviously. And if you -- if the Fed can thread the needle and keep job growth going and have a soft landing, whether it’s a landing and you keep the consumer going then, yeah, I think, our -- you have two parts of upside in that guidance. One would be the rate, right, the 3%. The other would be we probably beat our occupancy numbers. And the occupancy number is probably the one that is the -- when you think about -- when I think about those numbers, the earning is the earn-in, the 3%, that’s what most market pundits are putting out there. And then the occupancies where we could be more -- could be too conservative given an outcome that you just -- that I just described and so there are two places where you could beat and those are really the two.
Rich Anderson: So I guess the question is, is this proactive from you or are you seeing behavioral shifts from your residents that are landing you where you are at now? MAA said they are not seeing any behavioral shifts with the residents that they are really more focused on the macro and that’s what’s driving where there is landing right now, is that a consistent theme for you guys?
Ric Campo: I would say that based on the numbers I said earlier, where you had a negative absorption in the fourth quarter of 181,000 units in America, that’s consumer behavior. Those are people staying home for Christmas. Those are people who got paid, all kinds of big stimulus money, had cash coming out of, because of forced savings and decided to go out and run apartment and then they spend that cash and now they are going, what am I going to do, maybe the economy is uncertain, and I am going to go back to a live with mom and dad or double up and try to save money again. And I think that consumer behavior is clear that, that has happened and we went from, like I said, 600,000 positive net absorption in 2021 and it was 50,000 in 2022 and the 50,000 when you think about it was all in the first half of the year. And if you look at the positive absorption was all in the first half and the second quarter you started having kind of flat, third quarter you had negative some and then in the fourth quarter you had a big negative. And so I would say that is a definite consumer behavior issue that’s out there and I don’t think you can ignore it. Our view -- and that’s why we came out with occupancy falling and rent being moderated and it’s just -- and it is based on also a less robust economy in 2023.
Keith Oden: And Rich on the consumer behavior…
Rich Anderson: Okay.
Keith Oden: … side, one of the stats that we gave in our prepared remarks was people moved out to purchase homes, which was about 13.8% for all of last year. Just to give you a refresh on that number in the month of January, that number dropped 10% -- just over 10% move outs to purchase homes. And my guess is it falls below -- falls into single digits by next quarter and we have only seen single digits on that staff for maybe two consecutive quarters during the middle of the great financial crisis. And so, I mean, we are getting to some pretty uncharted territory in terms of housing affordability and the willingness and ability of people to move out of apartments to buy homes and I don’t think that’s -- I think we are at the beginning of that cycle.
Ric Campo: It’s clearly a positive on side…
Rich Anderson: Okay.
Ric Campo: … obviously. Go ahead, Rich.
Rich Anderson: Yeah. I am sorry. I mean…
Ric Campo: Okay.
Rich Anderson: I anxious to get through the call here. One real quick question for Alex, if I am doing the numbers right, you are variable rate debt exposure went from 6% last quarter to 15%. I know that you had the deal, the $550 million of secured debt. Is that a number 15% that we should be expecting for the full year or do you expect something to maybe right-size your rate debt exposure in the coming months and quarters? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So in our guidance, we are not assuming any capital transactions. Obviously, we are watching the market closely. Rates have been coming down until this morning and spreads have been tightening. So we are watching that closely. If we have the opportunity, we will take out some of this floating rate debt with fixed rate debt. But at this point in time, we are sort of operating under the thesis that interest rates are going to come down as we go through the year and based upon that it probably makes sense to push out fixing rates really as long as we can. So that’s what’s baked into our model, as I said, we are going to be opportunistic though and if we see an option we will take it.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. Thanks, everyone.
Keith Oden: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the time. I just want to follow up on that last question, if I understand it correctly. So it looks like you can borrow today around 4.5% and have a 1% interest savings on that floating rate debt. Would you have a penalty to pay that off, and I guess, that would just be upside to guidance if you were to take it out today, but it sounds like you just want to be a little bit more, I guess, aggressive at this point, and I think, you get a little bit lower than the 4.5% I just cited?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. And I will tell you, I mean, spreads came in this week alone about 30 basis points, and so if you would have asked me on Monday, I would have told you number was 48, 45 this morning, and so obviously, that’s heading in the right direction. But we want to see -- we want to see where rates continue and whether or not we can get any better on that. On the floating rate debt that’s associated with the Fund transaction that we assume there is a 1% penalty. Obviously, 1% is really not that much, and certainly, that can go into the math pretty easily. When we look at what’s on our line and what’s on our term loan, there is no penalty. So that really does give us tremendous flexibility and if this -- if the unsecured market continues to improve, there is some potential upside there.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then going back to Houston, I think, you cited supply of 15,000. Is that -- a lot of that supply directly impacting your portfolio and then if you were to look out to next year, would you expect supply to be comparable for now?
Keith Oden: So actually most of the stuff that is being built in Houston right now is not directly comparable with our portfolio. Some of it is obviously the Downtown assets and Midtown assets, there’s been a reasonable amount of construction in both of those submarkets. But our portfolio in Houston suburban and there really just hasn’t been that much new supply built in the suburban markets in Houston. It just gotten started maybe a year and a half ago and now it’s slowed considerably in terms of new starts. So I think we are -- as with most of these markets, when you see a scary headline number, on completions. A good example would be Austin, there’s 20,000 apartments that are set to be completed in Austin this year and kind of headline number just it’s sort of you got to take a double take when you see at 20,000 starts in a market like Austin. But when you really go through the geography of where our portfolio is, such a big amount of that is in or around the Downtown area and we literally have one community that is impacted by all of that. So if -- and if our portfolio were heavily oriented to Downtown either in Houston or Austin, it would be a much greater concern than what -- than what I think it’s actually going to be. Obviously, all supply in the market matters, but it’s like throwing rocks in a pond at the margins, if it’s not near you, it raises the water level a little bit, but it’s not a huge issue unless it happens to be in the particular submarket where your assets are located.
Wes Golladay: Got it. And just to follow-up on that, was it going to be -- do you think it accelerates next year or is it comparable down…
Keith Oden: So…
Wes Golladay: … any early view on that?
Keith Oden: Yeah. On -- for Houston starts, or excuse me, completions next year, we have it at 19,000 apartments completions and that’s sound about…
Wes Golladay: Okay. Great.
Keith Oden: …right.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for the time everyone.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Thanks everyone. Just wanted to touch base on -- I appreciate the build from 2022 to 2023 FFO guidance at the midpoint. I just wanted to touch on that amortization of net below market leases from the Fund acquisition. Is that like something we have to factor into in 2023 or is it fully out now that we have kind of lapped 2022? Just trying to get a sense of how we should be modeling this going forward?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. It is fully out. There is absolutely nothing in 2023. So the variance that you are looking at is the $0.07 that we recognized in 2022 as compared to zero in 2023.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Okay. Appreciate that, Alex. And then maybe touching base on the markets, Phoenix seems like it’s kind of some of my screens, it looks like maybe it’s a market that’s weakening. It was interesting to see your occupancy went up sequentially. Could you kind of just provide more color around what you are seeing on the ground and how many of your portfolio is positioned versus maybe some new supply and kind of how...
Keith Oden: We have got -- we have completions in Phoenix for 2023 of 15,000 apartments, employment growth in Phoenix next year is about 26,000 jobs. So that’s a little bit out of equilibrium in terms of job growth to new deliveries. Although the new deliveries are actually -- have actually come down pretty substantially from where they were in the previous year. So I think Phoenix is -- we have it listed as an A- market and moderating. So I think that’s or excuse me, A- and stable, so that seems about right for the overall operating environment in Phoenix.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Appreciate the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. On your same-store revenue guidance this year, I appreciate the breakdown. But one component that seems to be missing is the renewal rate growth, especially since debt renewal versus new lease rate spread widened in the fourth quarter, and again, even more so in January. So I guess my question is what’s the good run rate for that renewal versus new lease spread and how is that factored into your guidance this year?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So, for the full year, we have got renewals up about 4.9% and new leases up 2%. When you blend that out, that gets you to about 3.5% and that 3.5% picks up the market rent plus the about one-third of the loss to lease that we said we would capture. So if you think about the sort of renewal component that you were addressing, that renewal component is what you are going to find and is captured in that loss to lease and so that’s what we are saying is that we are going to get we will get about a third of that based upon timing and then based upon leasing strategies.
John Kim: So when you say market rental growth of 3%, that’s not reflective of the 2% release growth rate? How do those two tie in together?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. So market rental rate is going to be the rental rate that we expect December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022, right? So you are going to pick up that component. And then the renewals, if renewals are coming up to market, that is effectively what you are picking up in the loss to lease and then the new leases if people leave and you are backfilling them, that’s also getting picked up in the last lease.
John Kim: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Alex Jessett: Absolutely.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robyn Luu with Green Street. Please go ahead.
Robyn Luu: Good morning. Alex, I noticed Texas and Florida market trended double-digit expense growth this quarter. Are you basically similar expense throughout 2023 for these markets?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. So when you see that, a lot of that is due to the timing of property tax refunds and sort of how that flows through the system and so, no, I would not expect that to be a sort of run rate type item.
Robyn Luu: I mean property taxes are expected to be fairly high. I know you pointed to about 2.5% for the portfolio this year. But Texas and Florida property seem a little bit higher. So if not double digits, do you see the states to print in the high single-digit range?
Alex Jessett: No. And if you think about the states that I specifically called out for having higher property taxes, you do have Florida, but Texas was not one of them. So you have got Florida, you have got Georgia and you have got Colorado. And those are the markets that we are anticipating having higher property tax expense and so that’s where, if we are averaging 5.5% and property taxes make up a third of our total expenses, those markets that are going to have the higher growth in property taxes are going to have the higher expense growth. So, yeah, I would expect that once again in Florida and then Georgia and Colorado.
Robyn Luu: That’s clear. And then I want to talk about the DC market, how is front door traffic in trending in DC relative to the portfolio average? And are you seeing any signs of people starting to migrate to the suburbs or even out of state?
Keith Oden: We certainly have seen some out migration from DC, particularly the DC proper as opposed to DC Metro. It’s not anything like we have seen from New York or California, but I would say at the margin, yeah, we do get -- in terms of folks that show up in Atlanta for relocation purposes, it’s certainly in the top three or four from destinations. So, I think, again, more DC proper than the suburban areas and a lot of that is just driven by employers and where you happen to be your office is located in DC proper, people have been very reluctant to return to their offices, because they have been allowed us to basically work from anywhere. And if you can work from anywhere in DC proper is probably not in your top 10 places to work from if you have complete flexibility. So, yeah, I think, it’s -- we have three assets in DC proper and we certainly have seen more of that from those two assets than what we had seen prior to COVID, for sure.
Ric Campo: But compared to LA, for example, Washington, DC has positive net in migration over the next three years compared to 350,000 out migration. So it’s not as -- you don’t have the back door open as big as you do in DC versus any of the other California markets.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Thanks. We appreciate you all being on the call today and if you have any other questions, we will be around. So just give us a call and we would be happy to give you more detail. Thanks.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-28 11:00:00) =====
Kim Callahan: Good morning and welcome to Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman and President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Today's event is being webcast through the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and a replay will be available this afternoon. We will have a slide presentation in conjunction with our prepared remarks and those slides will also be available on our website later today or by e-mail upon request. [Operator Instructions] And please note this event is being recorded. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete third quarter 2022 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. We hope to complete our call within one hour and we ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Good morning. The theme of our on-hold music today was Thank You. Earlier this year our Board of Trust managers wanted to send a message of thanks to Team Camden for their unwavering commitment to our customers, each other, and our shareholders throughout the pandemic and beyond. The idea resulted in this video that was shared with all Camden teammates during our annual 15 City Award Ceremony Tour. [Presentation]
Ric Campo : Operating fundamentals continue to be strong and above long-term trends. Rents are following their normal seasonal slowdown as customers prepare for the holidays. Even as seasonality comes into play, new and renewal rents are much higher than historical pre-pandemic levels setting this up for a strong start in 2023. Demand continues to outstrip supply. And given the rise in interest rates and home price appreciation apartment affordability is at an all-time high relative to home ownership in all of our markets. Our development pipeline continues to be a source of external growth. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we will not be selling or buying properties for the balance of the year. Apartment transactions remain quiet as participants cost of capital continues to rise and price discovery continues. Our balance sheet is one of the strongest in REIT land and positions us to take advantage of opportunities as they unfold. I would like to thank all of our Camden teammates for all they do to improve the lives of our teammates, our customers and our shareholders one experience at a time. Next up on the call is Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Now a few details on our third quarter 2022 operating results and October 2022 trends. Same-property revenue growth was 11.7% for the quarter and 11.6% year-to-date. Our performance was in line with our expectations, so we've maintained our outlook for 2022 full year revenue growth of 11.25% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Rental rates for the third quarter has had signed new leases up 11.8% and renewals up 11.5% for a blended rate of 11.6%. To-date leases signed during October are trending at 6.9% blended growth with new leases at 5.2% and renewals at 9.4%. For leases that became effective in October, the blended rate was approximately 10%. Occupancy averaged 96.6% during the third quarter, down slightly from 96.9% last quarter and 97.2% in the third quarter of 2021. October 2022 occupancy is currently trending at 96.1%. Net turnover for the third quarter was 51% versus 47% last year and move-outs to purchase homes dropped to 13.2% versus 15.1% last quarter. We would expect to see a continued decline in move-outs to purchase homes through the remainder of the year, given the recent increase in mortgage rates. Next up is Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer. 
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate and finance activities. During the third quarter of 2022, we stabilized both Camden Buckhead, a 366-unit, $164 million new development in Atlanta and Camden Hillcrest, a 132-unit, $92 million new development in San Diego. We began leasing at Camden Atlantic, a 269-unit, $100 million new development in Plantation Florida. And we began construction on Camden Woodmill Creek and Camden Long Meadow Farms to single-family rental communities both in the Houston metro area with a combined 377-units and the combined cost of $155 million. During the quarter, we increased our existing unsecured line of credit capacity from $900 million to $1.2 billion and extended the maturity to August 2026, with two further six month extension options. We also added a $300 million delayed draw term loan with an August 2024 maturity with a further one-year extension option. Currently, we have approximately $30 million drawn under our line of credit and no amount is outstanding under our term loan. We will likely use our term loan and line of credit to pay off our $350 million, 3.2% unsecured bond, which matures on December 15 of this year. Our Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization from $269 million to $500 million. We did not repurchase any shares during or after quarter end. Our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt to EBITDA for the third quarter at 4.2 times. And at quarter end, we had $348 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline. Last night we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of $187.6 million or $1.70 per share. Included in our results are approximately $1 million or $0.01 per share of property expenses associated with Hurricane Ian, which are excluded from our same-store results. Excluding the impact from Ian, our third quarter results would have been $0.01 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range. This $0.01 per share positive variance resulted primarily from the combination of slightly higher other property income and slightly lower corporate overhead expenses. During the quarter, we experienced higher-than-anticipated repair and maintenance and utility expenses resulted from inflationary pressures. However, these increased amounts were entirely offset by lower levels of employee health insurance expense due to lower claims amounts. Last night, we reconfirmed the midpoint of our previous full year same-store growth guidance at 11.25% for revenue, 5% for expenses and 14.75% for net operating income. Our 11.25% same-store revenue growth assumption is based upon occupancy averaging 95.8% for the remainder of the year, with the blend of new lease and renewals averaging approximately 8.5%. These expected increases compared to achieve blended increases of approximately 15.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2022 FFO guidance by $0.01 per share for a new midpoint of $6.59. This $0.01 per share increase results primarily from lower than previously anticipated corporate overhead costs. We also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.72 to $1.76. The midpoint of $1.74 represents a $0.04 per share increase from the $1.70 recorded in the third quarter. This increase is primarily the result of, the previously mentioned $0.01 per share third quarter impact from Hurricane Ian, an approximate $0.06 sequential increase in same-store NOI resulting from $0.03 in increased revenue, driven by higher net market rents, partially offset by lower occupancy and $0.03 in lower property expenses, resulting from our typical seasonal decrease in utility, repair and maintenance and unit turnover expenses, combined with the timing of property tax refunds and an approximate $0.03 sequential increase in NOI from our development communities in lease-up and our other nonsame-store communities. This $0.10 aggregate increase is partially offset by a $0.03 decrease in the amortization of net low market leases related to our second quarter acquisition of the fund assets. As we discussed on our first quarter earnings call, purchase price accounting required us to identify either below or above market leases in place at the time of the acquisition and amortize differential over the average remaining lease term, which is approximately seven months. Therefore, in 2022, we will recognize $0.07 of FFO from the noncash amortization of net below-market leases assumed in the acquisition. We recognized $0.035 of FFO in the third quarter of 2022 from this amortization and we will recognize the final $0.005 in the fourth quarter. If leases were above market, the amortization would have resulted in an FFO reduction over the remaining lease term. A $0.015 decrease in FFO related to higher interest expense, primarily attributable to higher variable interest rates and $0.015 in higher other corporate costs related to anticipated higher health insurance expenses and the timing of certain year-end accruals. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Great. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to Ric's comment on demand continues to outstrip supply. And I know there's a various supply forecast for next year -- different forecast I should say. How -- I guess Ric, is that common for now, or do you feel that that in 2023 that will continue. How are you guys thinking about supply in '23 in your markets?
Ric Campo: Sure, supply in '23 is definitely going to be out there. I think, we have a projected supply from Ron Witten's number about 180,000 new units coming into our markets. And with decent job growth and migration to our markets, we think that's going to continue. And so new supply should -- we should be able to continue to raise rents during that period barring some big economic issue obviously that could be out there on the horizon. But we feel pretty good about the number of units that we observed in 2022 and think that 2023 should be a decent year even with the supply coming in.
Jeff Spector: Thank you. And then, my second is on the development pipeline. How are you thinking about that as we head into '23? I mean, there does seem to be some clear signposts of the consumer pulling back weakening? How are you thinking about that as we head into '23?
Ric Campo: Clearly, development we're looking at each one of our developments and making decisions on when we start or if we start in these deals in 2023. And I think good news is we -- there's a fair number of them that are middle of the year towards the end of the year. And so, we'll just have to see how the market works out from that perspective. I think one of the things that we are starting to feel is that, construction pricing is flattening out which is good. And so, maybe it makes sense to wait to see few more cards on cost and also how the market -- how the economy does next year.
Jeff Spector: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Thank you. Recognize you've been mostly out of the transaction market, but hoping you can provide some color on where cap rates have trended more recently across your market also recognize that probably not a lot is traded, but any kind of recent data points or thoughts around that would be appreciated.
Ric Campo: Sure. I think that's exactly right that the market is very quiet from a deal perspective. And we have a little technical problem going here. So Keith's going to join me on this -- on my side here. But, yes, so if you think about the market's today people -- if you don't have a reason to get into price discovery, then you're probably not going to do it in this market. And so I think that's the -- the key point is that there's just a just no reason to transact in this uncertain environment. Cost of capital has gone up for everyone. The buyers that were using debt, especially floating rate debt, are having to rethink their models. And I think ultimately as we get -- this is the high-tech version of when you fix computer keys. So, yes, I think it's -- people are sort of waiting for the first quarter to see what happens. The good news is cap rates definitely have risen substantially and the property value. So it depends on who you talk to you're down anywhere from 10% to 20%. And the good news is you saw our numbers and all our competitors' numbers. We're still driving NOI in a way, way, way above what we normally get. And so that's kind of helping offset some of the cap rate rise. And so I think ultimately there will be transactions done. There's still a wall of capital out there that wants to invest in multifamily. And 2023 is going to be a really good year. I think, even in a slowing market we're still going to have decent rent growth. And I think we have a great embedded start for the year that -- so when you start thinking about cash flow growth in 2023, it's going to be better than it is on average, but probably a lot slower than 2022, but that should have some benefit in terms of keeping values from falling dramatically more than they have already.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. That was very helpful. And then, as you think about kind of uses of capital, obviously, we've touched on development a bit. You mentioned the share repurchase program. How do you think about executing there your stocks in the mid to high 5% implied cap rate today? At what point does that become a more attractive use of capital?
Ric Campo: Well, as you saw in our release that we increased our buyback program authorized by the Board of $500 million. Historically, we've been a big buyer of the stock, not recently, but the stock buybacks are interesting on the one hand, because clearly our -- it's hard to tell what values are today, but it's -- the stock is -- when you think about FFO yield and its implied cap rate, it's a pretty attractive price. The issue you have in REIT land is that, it's hard to buy a lot of stock back. And we definitely want to keep our balance sheet strong. So we're not going to go out and borrow money to buy stock. But as we've done in the past, when you can sell assets in the private market at 100 cents on the dollar and buy your stock at 75 cents on the dollar that's a pretty good investment. We'll do it through sales and not through debt. And we'll take our time. And we've always said, the stock price has to be 25%-ish of -- at a discount and has to be persistent, so we can get in the market on a moderate basis and we'll -- that continues to be our philosophy.
Nicholas Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please, go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, team. It’s [indiscernible] from Evercore. I just have a follow-up question about development front. So how much more conservative are you being on underwriting? And how much have you changed your development hurdles on your deals, given the change in cost of capital? Thank you.
Ric Campo: Well, the development deals that we had under contract that we didn't have hard earnest money on. We definitely have changed our hurdles. Our cost of capital has gone up substantially obviously, like everyone else's. And when you get down to it, we're not going to do a development that isn't a positive spread of at least 100 to 150 basis points wide of our weighted average cost of capital. And our weighted average cost of capital has gone from five and some change to seven and some change. And so, we definitely have implemented that new hurdle into future development pipelines. And then, each one of our existing developments that we haven't started today, we're putting that new hurdle on it. The good news is that, rental rates have gone up substantially, as you've seen in our numbers. So we've been able to do better than we had anticipated, in a lot of -- in terms of rents. We also think that usually, we were putting a 1% construction cost increased per month, so call it 12% a year. And we think that number is going to slow or go negative when we start seeing starts fall, because most merchant builders are telling me today, that their starts are going to be down substantially in 2023 and 2024 given cost of capital and the lack of bank financing. So yes, in fact, we have increased our hurdles and we are reviewing all of our projects that fit into the new hurdle rate. 
Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's really, helpful. My second question there with $0.07 contraction from the previous top end of guidance. So kind of indicating, a more conservative outlook, could you provide some color on the operating trends you've seen so far? And what may be limiting the upside? 
Keith Oden: Yes, there's a $0.07 decline in the top end, but there was a $0.07 rise in the bottom end and really just reflects the fact, that we're a month into the last quarter of the year. And there's a lot better visibility in our world, when you're looking at 60 days, than when you are 120 days or a full year. So it's really more just narrowing the guidance, because we think there is likely to be less variability. The amount of the width of the guidance that we took into the third quarter was primarily around just the uncertainty on collections. I mean and ERAP payments. And so it's just it's very hard to model those two items, because they're in this environment particularly, in California and Washington DC, they're not things that we have direct control over. So our guidance was reflected that in the third quarter, and we've got a little bit better visibility. We kept the midpoint the same. Actually, raised the guidance $0.01 for the full year. But yes, it's just -- it's really just less time, over the forecast period and trying to give investors a little bit more clarity around where we think, we're likely to end up at the midpoint. 
Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. That’s it for me.
Operator: The next question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks and good morning, guys. First, you guys still expect to commence the Camden Nations deal this year? And then secondly, going back to development. Last quarter, I think you had discussed yields on future starts ranging from the low 5s to low 6s. And Ric you just mentioned rents have gone up some, which has helped but how much the costs need to go down from here for you to achieve that new 7% hurdle rate? 
Ric Campo: To answer the first part, we're not going to start Nations this year. It will be in next year's start depending upon, how the cards fall in the first and second quarter. But in terms of, construction costs going down, we don't think they're going to go down substantially very soon. Usually, it takes a really big economic situation -- to a bad situation to drive cost down. We have that in the financial crisis, in a big way but we're not really anticipating that next year, at this point unless you assume financial crises style problem. But what will happen though, is as the pipelines do moderate, there will be fewer developments being done and then costs will just at least stay flat, maybe down a little. But we've already seen some commodity prices like lumber. We're at pre-pandemic prices for lumber and tripled during the pandemic. So I think there will be some less pressure on cost, which is -- and I also think that we'll be able to shorten our development time frame, which will take cost out of it -- out of the system with fewer developments getting done rather, than having to add time to the scheduling might be able to take some time out of the schedule, and compress that to save money as well. So ultimately, it will be about where rental levels are. And the good news is, is that rents given where we are today are likely to be strong in 2023 and that should help those yields as well. 
Austin Wurschmidt: So looking at the backlog of future starts that you have today, based on some of those assumptions maybe today's rents and sort of current cost, how many projects? And what sort of volume would that represent that meet the 7% hurdle?
Ric Campo: Well, right now we haven't really spent a bunch of time looking at each development in the pipeline and wondering what it's going to be at this point because we're not at that point yet. But we have around 3,000 units or 3,300 units in our pipeline. And each one is going to be evaluated on an independent basis with the new hurdle rate lens that we're going to put on it. Now, the good news too is that when you think about the capital markets that we have today debt prices, you really don't want to go into the net market, if you don't have to you really don't want to go into the equity market obviously. And so -- what we will likely do is use dispositions to fund development in the future. And that -- when you start looking at that -- then you start thinking about trading right? You're trading in existing asset with a certain growth rate at a certain price with -- for a new development that has a different profile. So, we will look at what the incremental sort of accretion dilution is from that model and then -- I think that rather than just saying okay I have to have a certain hurdle rate on the development, if we can sell assets and create a limited dilution scenario by selling and funding development and buying other properties and we'll do that. And so that will change the dynamic a little bit on the hurdle rate for new developments for next year. And the bottom-line is we'll have to figure out -- or the market will have to show us whether there's an ability to fund development and other activities with stock buybacks and what have you through dispositions. And we'll just have to see how that all plays out next year.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood. Thanks for the comment.
Operator: The next question will come from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Thanks everyone. Good morning. First question, it seems like you've been raising guidance every quarter. Obviously, Sunbelt very strong. That's great. But then the maintaining it looked like it had to do with potentially D.C., L.A. either elevated vacancies from long-term delinquent move-outs or some sort of bad debt issue as the California are running out of reimbursement funds. I noticed that occupancy in October dipped 50 basis points to like 96.1%. And previously I think Alex mentioned you guys were assumed to average 96.6% in the back half of this year. So, it seems like you took that down by 80 basis points. So, maybe can you just talk about what you're seeing and what's leading to that the drop and all the things I just mentioned. 
Ric Campo: Alex do you want to take that? 
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So, the first thing I would touch on is occupancy. So, occupancy is certainly a little bit lower than we had expected, but by the same token, our asking rents or our net market rents are higher than we thought. So, it was really sort of a trade between occupancy and rental rates. The second thing I will point out and you are correct, especially in California, we did have less ERAP proceeds from the second quarter to the third quarter and that was primarily the driver of what you saw in the growth differential on a sequential basis for San Diego and L.A. So, to give you an idea San Diego had about $225,000 less ERAP received in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. If you normalize both of those that our sequential revenue in San Diego would have been up 2.5%. If you look at L.A. and in particular the Camden in Hollywood, we had about $220,000 less in ERAP in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. So, obviously, that would have a significant impact. And then in Phoenix we also had higher bad debt and less re-letting income in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. If you would normalize that, that would have been up 2.7%. So, that really is sort of the drivers of what you saw.
Neil Malkin: Okay. And so nothing -- just to be clear, nothing about the potentially elevated move-outs for long-term delinquents, particularly in your California portfolio contributing to any of that? It's more of -- it's really potentially all will be laid out there. 
Ric Campo: Well, if you have -- we have more skips and evictions than normal and -- than we did in the second -- or third quarter -- second quarter. We had more in the third quarter than the second quarter. And some of that is clearly driven by people who are moving out. One of the things that's really interesting when you look at the numbers is that in the second quarter, we had a higher collection rate. I think the answer is like 97% and change. And then the third quarter was 94% and some change. And that was primarily driven by California and you had a situation where most residents thought they would have to pay their rent. And then California extended the eviction moratorium until January 2023. And so people -- when you give people runway and say, Gee, you don't -- you're not going to be able to be evicted and you don't have to pay your rent they take an opportunity about -- to do that. And so, hopefully starting in January we have no eviction moratoriums or things driving bad consumer behavior. And that will hopefully improve in 2023.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Thanks. Other one for me is maybe in-migration you talk about that a little bit. It seems like that continues to be very strong. Certainly, commentary we've heard from brokers across the Sunbelt seems like job, growth and attraction from employers continues to ramp. But there's been some conversation of potential reversal of that as some companies implement return to office. So I was hoping you could maybe give us some data points or bigger picture thoughts on, in-migration your confidence in that? And then, any anecdotal or early signs that there may be some sort of reversion of the in-migration or to be very strong in one way?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So, Ron Witten's numbers for migration -- net migration into Camden's markets for 2022 are at $153,000 net to Camden. He's got -- based on the same numbers for 2023 he has net in-migration of $179,000. So not only is it not reversing but in his -- the work that he's done indicates that net in-migration will actually increase in 2023. And it stays elevated in 2024. And obviously the forecast numbers and they're subject to a lot of variability. But I think directionally, in-migration is going to continue to be a pretty significant positive to Camden's overall geography.
Alex Jessett: And then, I'd add to that, in our particular market, so 21.5% of our move-ins in the third quarter came from non-Sunbelt markets and that's actually up 100 basis points sequentially. And if you compare that to the third quarter of 2020, it's up 400 basis points. So we continue to see sequential increases in migration to our markets.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Thank you everyone.
Operator: The next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I want to add a sort of a big picture question. And kind of looking back at history to see, if we could have some clues about what might happen from all this, because the changes that we're seeing some of it are normal seasonal patterns as you described Ric, but then we have a recession potentially coming. And I'm wondering if this is Chapter one of a pretty meaningful deceleration beyond what would be called normal seasonal patterns. And if you look back at last time multifamily -- last several times multifamily fell into a negative same-store growth scenario. What is it about the current fundamental setup today that you think protects against an outcome like that? Is there -- maybe that could happen in your mind and you leave that option or that scenario open to potentially happening. But I'm just curious, what confidence you have the firm and the industry will avoid something really draconian call it a year from now?
Ric Campo: Yeah. So I think first of all if you have a financial crisis right, like we had in 2008 and '09 is sort of a different world.
Rich Anderson: Yeah.
Ric Campo: A normal recession or a hard landing recession or soft landing whatever you want to call it the multifamily business is going to do well. So -- and the reason is number one you're starting out from high numbers, right? Occupancy is at a high level across the country. That's number one. Number two the consumer -- our consumers are doing really well. Our average income is $117,000, $118,000 for our new people. They're paying less than 20% of the rent in percentage of their income in rent. They have a lot of cash in the bank still. They're well employed. So it's -- our consumers are doing great. And when you have this in-migration coming in, yes, we have supply coming. But we've had supply coming to these markets for the last 30 years as we've been a public company and supply has never killed the golden goose. It might slow growth a little bit but in some cases, but because of the diversified portfolio we have it really doesn't impact the business that much. So when you think about the single-family home move-outs, we were at 15% in the summer we were at 13% now. And I think the trending numbers through October are down -- are to 12% and we think that number is going to go to single-digits when you start thinking about interest rates being tripled for single-family home folks and the pricing. The pricing model today for multi-family is as good as it's ever been in our history relative to people moving out to buy houses. I serve on the Board of the largest privately held homebuilder in America. And our sales are down 50% from June forward and they're not going up. And it's -- so I think with all that all those backdrops this should be a – multi-family should be a really good place to be in any economic slowdown.
Keith Oden : So Rich I would just add to that that if you start the year and I think we've given guidance to 2023 with sort of embedded rent growth, and we start the year at 4.5% to 5% up on rents -- rental revenue, it would take -- as long as this is sort of a normal type recession -- even if the land is a little bit on the hard side. As long as it doesn't persist into far into 2024, I think multifamily is a really -- is going to be a really protected place. As Ric mentioned earlier, our residents are in really good shape, and as long as our residents don't lose their job, now it's a different -- obviously, different scenario as great financial prices. As long as they still have their job they're going to live where they live. They're going to continue to live out their lease term and it implies that we'll be up 5% on rental growth. So I think there's just a lot of mitigating factors to where we sit today. It doesn't mean that the margins, of course, it affects things if we lose two million or three million jobs in the economy, but it's just not a direct impact to our portfolio over the near term call it end of 2023. 
Rich Anderson : Just a quick side to that you mentioned rent to income of 20%. What -- how bad has it gotten in history for you guys? And how does 20% compare to when it was at its worst at its highest?
Ric Campo: As -- we actually have stayed in that zone. We've never had -- and I think it just has to do with our markets. We're in high-growth low-cost markets right? So the rents aren't noticeably rents anywhere in our markets. So I think we've probably been at 22% maybe over the years and driven by West Coast and East Coast. If you look at California it's probably higher than that. It's in the 24%, 25%. But bottom line is that one of the reasons that the Sunbelt has done so well is because it's affordable. And people -- and that's why I think you don't have a lot of the move back. Once you move to Charlotte and see you can get a really cool apartment for half the price in New York City apartment people like it and they stay. And so I think that the market -- we've never had pressure on our residents' income to rent ratios really in the last -- for the last 30 years really.
Rich Anderson : Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: The next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning down there.
Ric Campo: Hi.
Alexander Goldfarb: So, two questions, hey. Two questions. Just going back to the analysts who asked about Southern Cal and D.C. And obviously, right now, it's not the time to be doing any large transactions just given the capital markets. But if you look at your portfolio and especially comparing it to your peer in America, it would seem like having D.C. and having Southern Cal are not helping the overall portfolio mix. I mean, especially, D.C. is an outsized weighting. So when the markets return, it would seem like these are markets to down weight and exit or severely sell down and fund elsewhere. Just sort of curious, because the Sunbelt has definitely proven a lot more resilient in its economic diversification and ability to push through supply whereas D.C. seems to be on a decade-plus supply issue in Southern Cal, while better than the other parts of Northern Cal right now still has the California cost of living and taxes et cetera. So just curious your thoughts as you look at your portfolio over the next two to three years? 
Keith Oden: Yeah. So the way I look at it Alex is that our California portfolio and big chunks of our D.C. Metro portfolio have still not experienced the rental rate reset that all of our other markets have. And I just think that the economics are pervasive. Ultimately, the water will seek the proper level. I think ultimately rents are going up in California. Probably at some point, we'll exceed the average of our portfolio in the same in D.C. Metro. So your underlying question of long-term is D.C. at 17% the right number? I mean, we've said consistently that we'd like to shrink that over time. California at 12%? Maybe. But the reality is that until -- there's two things going on right now you have a really a huge disconnect in valuations to kind of what you think the underlying asset ought to trade at. And then more importantly long-term, you've got this opportunity to get the rental reset in those three markets, which by the way just between those two markets that all of California and D.C. Metro is almost 30% of our portfolio. So I'm more interested in let's get through this period of kind of turmoil and uncertainty in pricing. And then let's reap the -- what we know what I believe to be the underperformance and level setting that needs to happen in those two markets and then we'll look at it at that point. It doesn't mean that around the edges we still won't do something as Ric talked about opportunistically to support our development program or even possibly a share buyback program if the math works. 
Ric Campo: If you think about what we've done in trading assets in the last like 10 years, we sold $3 billion and developed and/or bought $3 billion and ultimately we have moved the market concentration around pretty substantially in the last 10 years. And so over a long period of time you'll see us do some of that.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then second question is just going back to supply. Again, Sunbelt traditionally has actually done pretty well with managing supply apart from like Houston. But -- as you look at your markets over the next 12 months, are there any markets or any submarkets where you're saying, hey maybe next year you guys could be citing this submarket or that submarket that could have a supply issue, or as you look at all of your properties across all the portfolio your view is that there's not any area where supply is an outside concentration or risk?
Keith Oden: So Alex I would tell you that the answer to that puzzle rests and tell me what the job growth is in these cities. Because if I look at 2022 completions in a market like Austin where we had almost 17,000 apartments and yet Austin has continued to outperform our overall portfolio, it just tells me that there continues to be real strength in two places and the employment growth, but also in migration. Same thing in Charlotte. Well, if you roll that forward to 2023, the supply market actually increases in almost all of Camden's markets. I think Witten's got completions at about 130,000 this year moving to about 180,000 completions next year across Camden's portfolio. So that's meaningful, but it's not necessarily concerning to us in light of what's happened on job growth and in-migration. So I think the good news in all of Witten's data for -- that we look at is if you roll forward into 2023 his data indicate that starts across Camden in the markets go from 210,000 down to less than 150,000 and then they fall further to about 115,000 in 2024. Now that -- that's probably a lot of good news for the multifamily world in 2025 and 2026 and now we're way out on the horizon. But the reality is starts are coming way down, completions are going to have to slug through for the next year-and-a-half or so because they're going to continue to be elevated by historical norms. But it's our view that we'll continue to have -- be able to backfill that in our -- with our geography between new job growth and in-migration.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Chandni Luthra: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So I wanted to talk about Hurricane Ian. Are you guys seeing any increase in short-term leases or any impact on rates in the aftermath of the hurricane? 
Alex Jessett: No, we're not. 
Keith Oden: Fortunately for us we had very little damage. We had no quite residents, nor did we have any seriously impact. So – we got lucky a different path of that storm maybe where it was originally forecast over the top of Tampa Bay, would be having a different conversation with you. But no it's – we had been very little disruption. We had minimal amount of damage. The estimate that we gave was a little less than $1 million, which given the size and magnitude of that storm and the fact that it went right over the top of Orlando as a Category, one storm is we were very pleased with how it turned out. We have not – we've either seen benefit from people moving from the really badly affected areas into our market. Those are not – that wouldn't be a normal place where that those people would kind of see short-term shelter while they try to rebuild their homes on the at the gulf coast of Florida. So overall, it's been not a big issue for us either physically on our assets or…
Chandni Luthra: Got it. And as a follow-up, any preliminary thoughts on expenses next year? How should we think about real estate taxes, insurance, all the other line items that go into that bucket? Thank you so much.
Alex Jessett: Yes absolutely. So real estate taxes I'll address that one first. Obviously, that's our largest expense line item. And 2023 is going to be an interesting year because if you think about what assessors look at, they typically look at the preceding years sort of NOI growth and obviously 2022 has been a fantastic growth year. But then they're also supposed to look at real values and clearly real values have come down. And so I think we're going to have a lot of protests and probably a lot of lawsuits working through this process in 2023. But I think if I was – obviously, we're still working through our budgets. But at this point in time I would believe that our property tax expenses are probably going to be towards the high end of our typical range. If you think about the rest of the expense categories, Clearly R&M and utilities are going to be driven by the inflationary pressure. So it depends upon what inflation is doing at that point in time. On the salary side, as I talked about in our last earnings call we rolled out this year our work reimagine program, which is a benefit to us on site in 2022 by about $1 million but it should be a benefit to us on site in 2023 about $4 million to $5 million. So obviously, that's a positive that should offset a lot of these expense pressures that are potentially out there. And then on the insurance side, although we did have a large storm in Florida, this has been a pretty light year in terms of sort of global – global events. So my hope is that insurance starts to normalize.
Chandni Luthra: Thank you for the detail.
Alex Jessett: Absolutely.
Operator: The next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. What's the current expected stabilized yield on the $758 million development pipeline? And what's the current market that you're seeing for land? Is pricing come off there? And are you seeing transactions, or is that on hold just like actual property transactions? 
Ric Campo: Yes. The yield is in the – we have properties that are 5.5% to 6.5%. So it's – we call it right at 6-ish. The in terms of land we have seen some landowners that we were negotiating with lower their price, but the challenge you have today is it's really hard to kind of peg what the price ought to be. So there is definitely some sort of movement on land sellers in terms of what should the price be in the future. I think again, it's hard to underwrite today. And even with land prices going down some we haven't executed. What we have been doing though our land positions that we already have, that are under contract in hard earnest money we are having pushing those out. And so people are agreeing to push them out understanding that if we had to make a decision today that we likely would either ask for a haircut or not clothes. And so I think that's -- the land tends to be stickier during the early part of a repricing scenario. But once they start seeing contracts drop because I know most of my merchant builder friends, if they're not hard on a contract and have significant investments they've dropped their contracts and they know those land sellers are all getting dropped across the country and it will be interesting to see what happens in the first quarter. 
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then the second question given the strong rent growth what's the earn-in today heading into 2023? 
Alex Jessett: Yes absolutely. So the earn-in for us right now is about 5%. 
Rob Stevenson: All right. thanks guys. Appreciate the time, have a good weekend.
Alex Jessett: Good day.
Operator: The next question will come from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead. 
Wes Golladay: I have a question on the supply. If we look out to midyear last year, we were tracking for about 165,000 forecast for 2022 supply and now it's looking at about 130,000. Do you think the same thing will play out next year with 180,000 forecast now? 
Keith Oden: Yes. I think the difference is just the slippage in time frames for the deliveries on the completions and we've seen it on all of our construction projects. And I assume that everyone else is experiencing either that or worse because there's lots of folks that don't have near the reach and the experience and relationships that we do to get these things brought to the finish line and it's still a battle. So I know that the Witten and RealPage both have tried to capture some of the delay and -- because we had this persistent issue of saying, we think completions will be x for three straight years it's turned out that they were 80% of x.  So, I know they've tried to adjust their forecasting. My guess is, they still haven't captured it in the 2023 numbers. It wouldn't surprise me to see some of that 180,000 shift into 2024. I don't really -- I think the right way to look at the completions number is over maybe a 2 to 3-year period just add them all up because if it started it's going to complete. And the question is sort of not -- it's a rounding there if it completes in 2023 or first quarter of 2024.  So I would -- I think it would be more useful for most folks to look at it and say, give me three years' worth of numbers and over that period of time, I'll give you my employment forecast and we'll see how that matches up versus trying to handicap any individual year. But my guess is they probably still haven't captured all and it's likely to be less than the 180,000. 
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then I'd like to talk about Houston. I believe the plan was to reduce exposure. But then you bought a JV -- your JV that have high use exposure and then you have two starts with Houston. So I'm detecting a little bit more bullish to you and then -- maybe zooming out maybe a few years in the past you had mentioned that Houston was more than an energy city and at some point side of the chemical industry and medical. But right now, we have a big energy differential between the US and everyone else around the world has seen. And I'm just wondering in your industry context have indicated that they may have plans for bigger expansions in the area, if this differential would persist?
Ric Campo: Sure. So we had a unique opportunity with the acquisition of the fund with Texas Teachers to acquire properties that have zero execution risk right? And so, we knew we had to do something with the fund over the next two or three years because of the finite life of it. So, it just made sense for us to do that. Yes, it kind of went against [indiscernible] we want to reduce our exposure in Houston over time.  The -- and the other part of it is we started two development deals which were single-family rental for rent properties and so on that side that's an opportunity for us to really understand the market and learn the market because I think it's very compatible business with the regular multifamily business.  Long term, if you think about where Houston is right now Houston has not had the same reset of rents that Dallas, Austin or Florida or other major markets and the reason being was because energy in 2020 got hammered right, when the oil prices were negative and Wall Street has taken the energy companies to -- would shed multiple times and it has required more dividends and stock buybacks and so rather than drill, baby, drill they're not doing that. What they're doing is they're being very methodical in their capital allocation and making sure they have dividends to pay their shareholders. So that is new the job growth in Houston compared to these other markets. For example, Austin and Dallas recruit their pre-pandemic employment and went substantially higher than pre-pandemic employment about eight or nine months before Houston did. Now we hit our pre-pandemic employment this summer. Now, we're still doing well in Houston, but on a relative basis it's not as robust as the other markets. And so I think Houston, I've said in a couple of calls that Houston has gas in the tank and it really does, because when you think about energy cycles, they tend to be anywhere from five to 10-year cycles. And most folks think we're in a super cycle right now because of the lack of drilling, because of the -- domestically because of the government doesn't really want a lot of domestic oil and gas drilling. There's a lot of pushback from the Biden Administration. You have a savage cutting production two million barrels. You got the Russia and Ukraine situation. And so we know we have to have energy and the world has to have energy and it's not going to renewables as fast as people think. So I think Houston is really well-positioned over the next few years. And then when you add in the energy transition, which is ultimately we know we have to transition, but Houston is going to be likely the energy transition capital of the world as well, and primarily because when you think about the Inflation Reduction Act there's about $100 billion of capital that we think is going to come to Houston be it carbon capture that we -- and if you look at what Exxon and some of these other big companies have done, they've gone out in the Gulf and started leasing shallow water wells that are spent, so that they can store a carbon in those fields that are all depleted. And so when you think about the fact that Houston is the number one exporter of energy in the country and it’s been in the categories in the world, and there's a lot of production with chemicals and we start thinking about decarbonizing industrial complex, the carbon capture, the green hydrogen and ammonia and all those things that are going to propel us forward into -- energy transition is happening here and the headquarter companies are here. So I think it's going to be -- Houston is going to be a great market over the long-term and it's going to -- it'll have more gas in its tank than the rest of the markets in a recession because of that. Now, ultimately we fundamentally want to lower our exposure in markets we're really concentrated in because it may be great over the next two or three years, but the way that our portfolio has been -- has really been constructed is to be diversified geographically. And when you have DC, Houston and California being our three largest markets, we want to diversify ultimately. So we will do some trading in this environment. Like I said before we've been over $3 billion of moving assets around in the markets. And we'll continue to do that. And hopefully we can do it -- in the last year or two, we've been able to do it on a non-dilutive basis and hopefully that will continue. Whatever the prices are when they reset, I don't think there's going to be a massive differential between cap rates in Houston or in DC, or California versus the rest of the Sunbelt. And if we can sell assets and fund development or buy newer higher growth assets in the other markets where we're underweighted, we will lean into that.
Wes Golladay: Great. Thanks for that answer and happy weekend, everyone.
Ric Campo: Sure. You too.
Keith Oden: You too.
Operator: The next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Hey, thanks for keeping the call going. Alex, you mentioned bad debt in Phoenix is ticking up. What is bad debt as a percent of revenues in that market? And are there any other markets seeing upward pressure right now outside of just timing impacts in regulated markets?
Alex Jessett: Yeah, absolutely. So if you look at collections, so our collections right now for the quarter were right around 98.6% and that compares to the last quarter when it was right around 99.2%. So if you look at Phoenix, our collections there we're 99.2%. But to a point that Ric made earlier, if you look at California our collections in the second quarter in California were 97.3% that dropped off to 94.2% in the third quarter of 2022. That's the real collection story.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And then Keith, are your local team, seeing a slowdown in traffic in any markets outside of the normal seasonality right now?
Keith Oden: No. I mean traffic, we still continue to have -- by a lot of the technology that we put in place, in particular funnel, the complaint that I hear most commonly is that we have more traffic than we can reasonably handle given the -- or that we can effectively handle because of the very low vacancies across the entire portfolio. But -- we're generating plenty of traffic. There's still tons of people that want to live in Camden apartments across all 15 cities. And these are -- even though our occupancy rate did fall from the second quarter, you're still north of 96% in the fourth quarter and those are crazy good numbers from a historical perspective for Camden.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Just one follow-up there. Again, I don't want to be pedantic, but I thought it would assume that occupancy would slip into the high 95% over the balance of this year, but you're still seeing occupancy above 96% today?
Keith Oden: So we're going to -- go ahead, Alex.
Alex Jessett: Yes. So we will average 95.8% for the full year that is where our average is. And obviously that assumes that occupancy will follow a seasonal pattern as we get towards the end of the year.
John Pawlowski: All right. Thanks. Happy weekend, guys.
Keith Oden: You too.
Alex Jessett: You too.
Operator: The next question will come from Barry Luo with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Barry Luo: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to quickly ask if you guys disclosed the loss to lease.
Alex Jessett: Yes. So loss to lease to us is about 5.5%.
Barry Luo: Okay. And is there any chance you see that loss lease go negative during this year?
Ric Campo: No.
Barry Luo: Okay. Thank you. And for -- just secondly on expenses, do you think any -- can you talk any about like tax efficiencies in terms of mitigating labor pressures?
Alex Jessett: I'm sorry what's the question?
Barry Luo: Just any tax efficiencies on mitigating like labor pressures for next year and tech initiatives?
Alex Jessett: Tech initiatives. Yes. So, absolutely. So if you recall we talked about our work reimagine program which is -- could not happen without our tech initiatives that we have in place mainly chirping and funnel. And so because of those factors, we should be able to pick up about a net $4 million to $5 million benefit on the salary side in 2023. So, absolutely.
Barry Luo: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Thank you. Just to start, I wanted to clarify the occupancy comment. I thought in the prepared remarks you said 95.8% for the rest of the year meaning the fourth quarter for guidance? And I think just a minute ago you said 95.8% in a different way. So can you just clarify that first?
Alex Jessett: 95.8% in the fourth quarter.
Dennis McGill: Okay. That's what I thought. And then just generally, as we think about that number and that 80 basis points deceleration from the third quarter recognizing their healthy levels, that's a pretty stark change relative to what you've seen in the past seasonally. And at the same time, you're talking to still good traffic income growth and strong income metrics. You talked about in-migration being favorable. You've got for-sale affordability is going against the consumer. So the narrative is they're staying in apartments longer. I guess all of that collectively would suggest that you wouldn't have to make the trade-off of occupancy and rate right now. So what are some of the offsets you think that are filtering through that's causing that sequential deceleration?
Alex Jessett: Well, I think you've got a couple of factors. Number one, we are pushing rents. And as we follow normal seasonal patterns, if you push rent, you should see occupancy come down. Number two, as we've talked about our turnover has picked up a little bit and that is driven by people, finally that have been long-term non-payers starting to move out. And as we have the ability to enforce contracts, we should expect to see that number tick up a little bit. That by the way is a good thing because those are folks who are not paying, and if we can move them out although our physical occupancy will come down it doesn't actually have any net impacts on our financial occupancy. So those are a couple of factors that are driving that. 
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then when you think about that, I guess, is now that that's come down a bit the 95.8% a valid point between physical and economic, but do you start to think about pricing power getting back to pre-pandemic levels here then pretty soon since that's a bit below occupancy where you were in the fourth quarter 2019. So is that the transition that we're seeing as you move into the first part of next year? 
Alex Jessett: We continue to have a lot of very strong things going in our favor in terms of migratory patterns and we've talked about job creation in our markets. I think the -- I think, what we have to see is what is the long-term job creation in 2023. But, I think, we are going to remain in a pretty good strong position in terms of our ability to push rents. And then once we keep pushing rents we should be able to push some occupancy a little bit further. But as I said it depends upon what do we see in the economy in 2023. 
Ric Campo: We could have 96% occupancy all the time if we wanted to. Remember we have a dynamic revenue pricing system and we've made a choice. And that choice is based on keeping our -- keeping rental rates going up. And if you think about Alex mentioned that our average rental rate was eight and some change our average revenue growth is going to be eight and some change in the leases through the end of the year. And that's a really good number. If you look at historically go back to pre-pandemic levels I mean we're usually negative to zero in the last two months of the year on revenue in terms of new leases -- renewals and new leases. And so we're going to be 600 basis point or 800 basis points above pre-pandemic levels going into 2023. And we just think it's the right fit. And to Alex's point earlier we want people to move out that are paying us. And so and we're trying to help them understand that. We've had discussions about paying people to move out, right? I mean, because it's just -- and it's primarily a D.C. in California, but if we so I don't look at the 80 basis points as a flaw in the system. I look at it as keeping pressure on the rent and making sure you're starting 2023 at a really good place with an earn-in and a loss to lease that is pretty substantial. 
Dennis McGill: All right. I appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.
Ric Campo: Thanks.
End of Q&A:
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ric Campo for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. 
Ric Campo: Great. Well we appreciate your time today on the call and we will see some of you at Nareit in San Francisco. So we'll have a lot of new stuff to talk about then probably since it will be about a week-and-a-half. So take care and have a great weekend and go Astros. Take care. Bye. 
Keith Oden: Bye.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-29 11:00:00) =====
Kim Callahan: Good morning, and welcome to Camden Property Trust Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I am Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman and President, and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s event is being webcast through the Investor section of our website at camdenliving.com and a replay will be available this afternoon. We will have a slide presentation in conjunction with our prepared remarks and those slides will also be available on our website later today or by email upon request. [Operator Instructions] All participants will be in listen-only mode during the presentation with an opportunity to ask questions afterward and please note this event is being recorded. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today’s call represent management’s current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden’s complete second quarter 2022 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. We hope to complete our call within one hour and we ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we would be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I will turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: The theme for today’s on-hold music was Together, which will resonate with team Camden. After two years of virtual meetings, this year Camden was able to be together for most of our important cultural events. In May, we held our Annual Leadership Conference, which brings together 400-plus Camden leaders for three days of learning, reconnecting and fun. A lot has changed in the world since May, which serves as a good reminder that real estate and financial markets will rise and fall, but companies with a great culture will thrive in all conditions. The following highlight reel from our leadership conference is an inside baseball view of a culture that has earned a place in Fortunes 100 Best Companies list for 15 consecutive years. [Video Presentation] Thanks to team Camden and the great culture that you have created and continue to build. Camden will always thrive. For last year-and-a-half, has been the best NOI growth and FFO growth that we have had in our almost 30-year history, with NOI growing 19.6% and FFO growing a whopping 47%. These gains are built into our run rate and are likely to remain in place, driven by strong consumer demand for housing in our markets. Consumer strength is driven by strong employment growth, large wage increases and high savings levels. Our apartments are affordable, despite the double-digit rental increases. Our residents spend roughly 20% of their incomes over their rent. Domestic migration has led to more than 700,000 Americans moving to our markets in the last year, they are not moving back. Apartment supply is not cut up with demand. We expect growth to moderate over the next couple of years, but believe that we will exceed our long-term growth rate. With a strong balance sheet, a great team with an amazing culture, we are ready for more successes. Up next is Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Now for a few details on our second quarter 2022 operating results and July 2022 trends. Same property revenue growth was 12.1% for the quarter, once again exceeding our expectations with 12 of our 14 markets posting double-digit revenue growth. Given this outperformance and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year, we have increased our 2022 full year revenue growth projection of 10.25% to 11.25% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Rental rates for the second quarter had signed new leases up 16.3%, renewals up 14.4% for a blended rate of 15.3%. Our preliminary July results are trending at 13.1% for blended growth, with new leases at 13.5% and renewals at 12.7%. Occupancy averaged 96.9% during the second quarter, which matched our performance during the second quarter 2021 and compared to 97.1% last quarter. July 2022 occupancy is currently trending at 96.7%. Net turnover for the second quarter 2022 was 46% versus 45% last year and move-outs to purchase homes were 15.1% for the quarter versus 17.7% during the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decline in move-outs to purchase homes is not surprising. Since last year, home mortgage rates have nearly doubled and the median existing home sales price is now above $400,000. So despite the recent increases in rental rates, many would be homebuyers will likely remain renters. Next up is Alex Jessett, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate and finance activities. During the second quarter of 2022, we completed construction on Camden Buckhead, a 366-unit, $162 million new development in Atlanta. We began leasing at Camden Tempe II, a 397 unit, $115 million new development in Tempe, Arizona. We began construction on Camden Village District, a 369 unit, $138 million new development in Raleigh. And we acquired for future development 43 acres of land comprised of two undeveloped parcels in Charlotte and 4 acres of undeveloped land in Nashville. As previously reported, at the beginning of the second quarter, we purchased the remaining 68.7% ownership interest in our two joint venture funds for approximately $1.5 billion inclusive of the assumption of debt. The assets involved in this fund transaction included 22 multifamily communities with 7,247 apartment homes, with an average age of 12 years, primarily located in the Sunbelt markets across Camden’s portfolio. In conjunction with this acquisition, we recognize a non-cash non-FFO gain of $474 million, which represented a step-up to fair value on our previously held 31.3% equity interest in the funds. Also as previously reported, early in the quarter, we issued 2.9 million common shares and received $490.3 million of net proceeds. As of today, we have approximately $80 million outstanding under our $900 million line of credit. At quarter-end, we had 248 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline. Our balance sheet remain strong with net debt to EBITDA for the second quarter at 4.4 times. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the second quarter of $179.9 million or $1.64 per share, $0.02 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $1.60 to $1.64. This $0.02 per share variance resulted primarily from approximately $0.03 in lower bad debt and higher rental rates and occupancy for our same-store and non-same-store portfolio, partially offset by $0.01 in higher property tax expense, resulting from higher initial valuations in Atlanta and higher than expected final valuations after appeals in Austin and Houston. Last night, based upon our year-to-date operating performance, our July 22 new lease and renewal rates and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we have increased the midpoint of our full year revenue growth from 10.25% to 11.25%. Our revised revenue growth midpoint of 11.25% is based upon an anticipated 12.5% average increase in new leases and an 8.5% average increase in renewals for the remainder of the year. We are anticipating that our occupancy for the remainder of the year will average 96.6%. Additionally, we have increased the midpoint of our same-store expense growth from 4.2% to 5%. This increase results from inflationary pressures on repair and maintenance costs and the previously mentioned higher than anticipated tax valuations in Houston, Austin and Atlanta, partially offset by lower-than-anticipated insurance expense tied to our successful May policy renewal. Property taxes make up approximately 35% of our total expenses and are now anticipated to increase by 5.6% year-over-year, an approximate 200 basis point increase from our prior estimates. Repair and maintenance makes up approximately 13% of our total expenses and is now anticipated to increase by 7% year-over-year and insurance makes up approximately 5% of our total expenses and is now anticipated to increase 13% year-over-year. As a result of our revenue and expense adjustments, the midpoint of our 2022 same-store NOI guidance has been increased from 13.75% to 14.75%. Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2022 FFO guidance by $0.07 per share for a new midpoint of $6.58 per share. This $0.07 per share increase resulted primarily from an approximate $0.06 increase from our revised same-store NOI guidance and $0.01 increase from additional NOI from our non-same-store and development portfolio. We also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2022. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.68 to $1.72. The midpoint of $1.70 represents a $0.06 per share increase from the $64 recorded in the second quarter. This increase is primarily the result of an approximate $0.06 sequential increase in same-store NOI, resulting from higher expected revenues during our peak leasing periods, partially offset by the seasonality of utility expenses and lease incentives, and $0.01 sequential increase related to additional NOI from our non-same-store and development portfolio. These increases are partially offset by a combined $0.01 decrease in FFO related to higher variable rate interest expense and the incremental impact of the additional shares outstanding from our early second quarter equity offering. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey. Good morning, everybody. I was curious if you could give us an update on the disposition that you had previously planned half the year and just some general color on what you are seeing in the transaction market?
Ric Campo: Well, the transaction market has slowed down substantially, obviously, with an increase in the tenure and just the sort of dislocation that the markets have experienced, given everything that’s going on with the Fed. And so what we have decided to do with our dispositions rather than being the early price discovery folks, we’ve basically taken them off the table and are just sort of waiting for more market clarity. When you think about, excuse me, when you think about what’s happened here, the cost of capital has gone up for pretty much everyone and the leverage buyers have -- that were using 60% to 80% leverage have -- that the game has changed and their return on equities have gone down. And so we think that values have probably gone down anywhere from 10% to 15%. It really depends on the market and also the product type, probably the most impacted properties are the value-add space that 10-year-old to 20-year-old that really needs a lot of work kind of thing. And so with that said, we will continue to monitor the market and where we for a long time have been selling -- buying and selling at the margins to be able to improve the quality of our portfolio and improve the geographic diversity of that portfolio and we will continue to do that, but right now we are sort of on a pause to see -- to kind of figure out where the market is. We think that that after Labor Day, there will be a lot more clarity. When you think about the wall of capital that still exist, it is there, and ultimately, I think, buyers and sellers were come -- will come together probably starting after Labor Day and through the end of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then, second question, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect growth to slow and supply to catch up in sort of the years ahead, but growth should still exceed sort of that long-term historical average. So, I guess, first, could you kind of give us a sense of what that average is presumably 3% to 4%, but you could put a point on that? And then, I guess, just what gives you the confidence that you can continue to exceed that long-term average given the level of projects that are on production today?
Ric Campo: Keith, you want to take that?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So if you look at the deliveries that are planned for 2023 relative to this year, Ron Witten has got completions going up from about 130,000 across Camden’s markets to about 190,000. So it’s meaningful. But if you look at it as a percentage of the stock, it’s not really out of line with where we have been for the last couple of years and then in years beyond that, the start stay fairly flat. So if you roll forward, I mean, the easy part at this point is kind of thinking about 2023 and where we start out as we come out of this really, really strong 2022, where we continue to get really strong renewals, as well as new leases. I mean, will start somewhere in the 5% range on embedded growth in 2023 and long-term average on NOI growth across Camden portfolio over the last 30 years is in the 3.1% range. So, you kind of sort of a layup to think about 2023 being higher than normal. And I think as long as we continue to have the affordability issues that consumers are dealing with right now in terms of their alternative to renting is which is buying home, I think you are going to see it -- I think we are likely to see a pretty dramatic decline in the number of single-family home starts. So you are just going to continue to have a shortage in housing of virtually all types and I think that it will continue to benefit the multifamily space.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for that.
Operator: The next question will come from Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. Maybe following up on that, but more focusing on the demand side, obviously, the July numbers remain strong, but a more challenging comp there. Are you seeing any signs of consumer demand changing, as you look out 30 days or 60 days or any kind of push back on pricing?
Keith Oden: No. We are really not. I mean we continue to be almost 97% -- nearly 97% occupied, we are 96%, 97%, currently. And as you look out on our pre-lease numbers, we are still on really good shape, 60 days to 90 days out so. So turnover continues to be low, renewal rates and new lease rates are definitely going to come down and we have been obviously trying to or been talking about that for the last couple of quarters. But in our case, it’s just because we are running into a period of time where last year we were rolling out 18%, 20% renewal and new lease increases across our most of our portfolio. And so as you run into those comps, you are just not -- it’s just not sustainable to stay at the levels that we have been out for the last couple of quarters. So we know, it’s going to come down, but it’s still going to be if we maintain the kind of occupancy that we have, the model will continue to push rents up to the level of kind of the market clearing price. Everybody in our markets, in our submarkets, people are continuing to see great strength and continuing to increase rents as long as that happens, I think, we will be fine. But the reality is that that those numbers are going to come down in the fourth quarter, for sure.
Ric Campo: One of the things I think…
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then…
Ric Campo: … is important to think about our consumer and that is that our consumers are doing really well. They all have jobs. When you look at year-over-year increase in income for Camden residents, it’s gone up almost 10%. So we worry, I guess, on Wall Street and the financial folks worry about interest rates and inflation and all the stuff and that’s important. And I think the consumers are worried about that, too, but they also are doing pretty darn good when it comes down to income growth and savings rates. And I think that folks that are probably going to be most impacted are at the lower end and our customers on average make six figures. And so they are not the low end of six figures and those are ones that are not as pressured on the inflation side and especially when you think about 20% of their income going to rent. It’s the folks that are paying 30% to 50% of their income for rent and they are getting sort of really pressured. So our residents are doing well. They are stressed, but and we can feel that in the marketplace. But they are not financially stressed, they are more worried about what’s going to happen in the future than they are about making ends meet with their incomes.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. That’s helpful. And then you touched on the broad strength really across all the markets, but the two that lag on a relative basis, I guess, are DC and Houston. How are you thinking about those markets back half of this year and probably more importantly into 2023?
Keith Oden: So I think that and just to put into perspective on a -- you said on a relative basis and that’s, I think, it’s important to think about that and Houston and Washington, DC, in the second quarter were roughly 7% up on revenues and if it weren’t for the fact that the rest of our portfolio was up 13%, 14% that you would be turning back flips about those numbers in Houston and DC, but obviously on a relative basis that has lagged the other 13 markets in our portfolio. I think one of the things that one of the implications for that is that, as we continue -- as we roll into these periods and into the renewal stack for the previous year, where we have -- in these markets where we had 20% increases last year, obviously, that gets much, much more difficult to push rents to anything close to those levels on this renewal and yet, the comparable numbers for DC and Houston would probably be in the 2% to 3% at a year-over-year comp. So I think we have -- probably going to have more opportunity to raise, be a little bit more aggressive in raising rents in DC and Houston, just because of what the -- what we have -- what happened to our consumers in those two markets last year and they didn’t get outsized rental increases and there’s probably one coming in the -- in 2023 in the renewal period. So I think those two markets have pretty decent upside on a relative basis in 2023, and obviously, we will be able to give you a lot clearer picture that hopefully by this -- at the end of the next call. But, I think, there is really pretty good upside in those two markets just because of the comp set.
Ric Campo: Also that when you think about the economy, so DC has -- DC -- and DC proper was probably more like California in terms of COVID opening and being able to evict people who were just sort of not paying, because they didn’t want to. And then in Houston, you have a whole different animal, you had -- Houston’s didn’t add the jobs back as fast as Dallas and Austin, but when Exxon and Chevron make combined $30 billion like they just reported in the last week, the job picture looks better in Houston, because of that and it’s interesting, because the energy complex, people were complaining about high gas prices and yet the companies are not expanding big time, because of the -- just the nature ESG issues and investors are wanting dividends from them rather than putting those dollars back into exploration. And if -- the ultimately if energy continues to do what it is doing now, they need to add jobs. They are running very thin. And last month they added, I think, 2,000 jobs in the Houston region and for energy related folks. And so there is a tailwind, I think on the Houston market because of that. So they are very different markets in DC and Houston. But I kind of look at them as no pun intended maybe or maybe intended with gas in the tank for 2023.
Nicholas Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everyone. Can you provide an update on your portfolio loss to lease and thus the opportunities for further rent growth next year?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So loss to lease for us right now is about 8.5%.
Derek Johnston: Excellent. Thank you. And then on new development, supply seems benign in some of your markets and where rent growth has actually really been strong, seemingly outpacing cost increases. So how would you view development starts given this backdrop beyond a construction company and what really you need to see to ramp new progress? Thanks.
Ric Campo: Well, if you saw in our earnings release, we added land positions and we are continuing this quarter and we are continuing to work on development. The -- so you have good news, bad news, right? The good news is that development revenues were up and the bad news is costs are up. But we think costs are starting to moderate. We think that -- I don’t think costs are going to go down, but I think that the increase in costs is starting to slow. So ultimately development has been a great business for us and we will continue to do that, continue to build. I think right now, we are focusing on sort of the existing portfolio that has legacy land cost, and we will be ramping that up next year and I think that get -- once the market settles down in terms of, so what is the cost of capital long term and not just as sort of up and down scenario that we have had for the last couple of months. I think that we will still be able to make reasonable spreads on our weighted average long-term cost of capital in the development business, and we will probably sort of wait and see between now and sort of the middle of the fourth quarter to kind of where things settle out. But I think, it’s still a really good business. If you look at our pipeline, I mean we have average yields with big cost contingencies in those construction numbers that are anywhere from low 5s to sort of low 6s and that’s still pretty good business even in this environment.
Derek Johnston: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Hi, everyone. Good morning. I guess maybe just following on the development side. You talked about maybe, well, I wanted to see if, you are seeing delays, it seems like you guys probably won’t make the development numbers you initially forecasted. We are hoping you could talk about that and if it’s a function of costs or is it a function of regulatory delays, et cetera? Can you maybe just talk about like where you see the starts kind of shaping up over the next several quarters and that would be great?
Ric Campo: Sure. I would say that definitely regulatory issues are big issue. I mean the challenge you have is sort of interesting, you can think about this, people worried about recession and job losses yet cities and municipalities that issue permits and issue and inspect buildings and things like that are absolutely under staff beyond belief. And even markets that used to be very friendly to permits and building like Houston, I mean, everyone is talking about how it just takes forever to get this stuff done and so we are experiencing that just like everybody else is. So a lot of the starts that we had or several of the starts this year are going to fold into next year. Next year should be a pretty buoyant start year, Alex, you might want to go through those numbers.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So, Neil, what I’d tell you is that we still think that we are going to make the low end of our total start number. We are anticipating…
Neil Malkin: Okay. What…
Alex Jessett: So $400 million to $600 million was our range and we are anticipating starting with Mill Creek, Long Meadow Farms and Camden Nations, which is on page 18. We always put that in order of our starts. So we will anticipate starting those three this year. And keep in mind that we just started Village District last quarter. So we should make the low end of our range.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Great. Other question is on your Houston, I know that several quarters ago, you talked about Houston and DC Metro being the two markets that you would focus on trimming exposure, just given the elevated contribution to your portfolio. It’s actually gone up, obviously, with the JV take down and the two SFR that you are doing right now. Question is, there is this speculation that the Biden administration in its recent sort of climate executive order and the -- his administration’s analyst assault on energy, fossil fuel, what is the likelihood of these sorts of things having an impact or is it already having an impact on Houston, because the idea that somehow like these unknown green jobs are going to replace even close to the numbers of jobs that would be lost, I mean, there could be a loss, it’s laughable. So maybe if you can, you guys are like the Kings of Houston. So if you could kind of give your 30-foot view on that, that would be helpful.
Ric Campo: Sure. So I think you hit the nail on the head, which is that people talk about green and kind of replacing fossil fuels. But there’s just no way that happens any time soon, right? I mean, sure. We need to move in that direction and ESG is important and climate change, I think, is critical for us to focus on and think about it. But the challenge is it’s not so much the energy companies that are being forced to do things, it’s really the federal government and their issues, because if you think about what has to happen in an energy transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. You have to have major infrastructure investments made in the grid and in the system of how we provide energy to the world and just take electric cars as an example. So in our ESG Committee, we had a robust debate a couple of weeks ago about how many charging stations do we have in our car -- in our apartments, none in our new developments, we are wiring and making sure that we are positioned to have EVs in our garages and what have you. But the challenge is it if I wanted to -- I will give you just a small example. If we wanted to have an EV station for every one of our -- every car that we think might be in our garages in the future, we can’t put that infrastructure in today. We can’t get the power companies to agree to give us more power to utilize those. So there is so many issues that have to be developed and to really get us to climate change and get us to transition. So, Houston, the interesting part of Houston, and you have seen, I think you have seen a negative effect in Houston and it’s really the job growth that we didn’t have that we should have had. And that was -- and that’s been driven by really investors, the ESG push on energy companies but also investors that say, we are not giving the industry capital unless you give us cash flow back over the last 10 years or 15 years, there been a lot of investments in energy and the energy industry hasn’t giving back capital. And so the market is pushing energy companies to be more -- to be less -- to invest less in infrastructure and less in exploration, which has driven up the cost of oil and limited supply. So I think, long-term, Houston is going to be the clean energy capital of the world. Ultimately, you have a bunch of big projects, there is $100 billion project for example that Exxon is doing in Houston and it is going to be subsidized by the federal government and it is a carbon capture in Houston Ship Channel. And so, I think, the energy companies know, ultimately, they have to transition. I don’t think, it’s going to happen in one year, two year or five years, maybe like 10 years to 20 years. And I think, they are smart enough to know that they have to be in a position where they are not dinosaurs and they don’t become and Houston doesn’t become a Detroit. And I don’t think that -- I think that there is a long-enough transition period, where that pivot is being made and will be made and so Houston will do long -- do well long-term, but it’s a -- definitely a complicated issue, for sure.
Neil Malkin: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from John Kim with BMO. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. I am wondering if you could provide an update on your yields on the development pipeline overall and on the projects you started this quarter in Raleigh?
Ric Campo: Sure. So the pipeline that is under construction or in lease-up is low 5s to we have some in Phoenix that are actually up almost a 7.5 cash on cash and those are classic development deals underwritten at very low -- at lot lower rates and you have 30% increase in rents there. So our yields are better. And by and large, our existing under construction and lease-up yields are better than we originally underwrote because of the rental increases. And then the pipeline behind that that hasn’t started is anywhere from low 5s to 6 -- to low 6.
John Kim: Okay. Great. And then you talked about on your answers, a 5% earn-in for next year, 8.5% loss to lease. I just wanted to confirm that these are separate items there you are starting up with the 5% same-store revenue for next year and then 8.5% which can move based on market rents, but that’s all additive to the 5%?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. So the way to think about it and the way we calculate earn-in is we look at what we anticipate the rent roll is going to look like at the end of 2022 and if you just froze everything right then. And so, I mean, froze everything right then for 2023 and that’s how you get to the 5% number. Obviously, there is a component of that that is associated with loss to lease, right? Because you have some of those leases that are in place that you are freezing that are below market.
John Kim: And so the loss to lease is what the effective rent growth you could achieve as next year assuming the market rent numbers?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Assuming you could take everybody up to market and as you know, we don’t necessarily take our renewals up to market. But if you took everybody up to market, you would have an 8% increase right there, 8.5%.
John Kim: Yeah. Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Let me turn off my on-hold music here. So…
Ric Campo: We have on
Rich Anderson: Okay.
Ric Campo: Go ahead.
Rich Anderson: So, no, I can’t do that. So when you talk about the earn-in and looking at the July signed versus July effective, which is a difference of about 200 basis points. Is it fair to assume that when you think of this roll forward situation and to your point, Alex, freezing at the end of 2022, that the inflection point is assumed to be now start of August, July -- end of July or is it possible that your leasing season could still extend and hence the earn-in would get bigger as we go?
Alex Jessett: Well, so the earn-in will get bigger. Well, no, so what we are assuming is that the earn-in of 5% plus is based upon at the end of 2022. So that takes into consideration everything that we expect from now till then.
Rich Anderson: Okay.
Alex Jessett: If you are looking at inflection points, and I think the real important thing to look at is if you go back to last year in Q2 our blended lease growth was 4.7%, in Q3 it was 12.3% and in Q4 it was 15.7%. So we really are starting to have some really tough comps in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year as compared to what we saw last year.
Rich Anderson: Fair enough. And so then the second related question is, how much of those tough comps, this is a weird year, because you have these strange year-over-year comps that, because of the how things moved last year, normally not the case. But when you think about absolute rents, so I get it that you are going to have lower percentage increases in the back half of the year. But what happens to the actual rent from, let’s say, today and I asked this question on someone else’s call. Say to today’s rent to make it easier $1,000. Is the rent something below $1,000 in the end of the year or is it -- is the rent just growing at a slower pace, but maybe at or above the $1000 by the end of the year?
Alex Jessett: No. It’s going to be above the $1,000. I mean, so when we look at our math, we continue to have asking rents that are going to be increasing throughout the rest of the year. It’s just the comp that you are looking at. You are looking at a much tougher comp period in the fourth quarter of this year, because rents escalated so quickly in the latter part of 2021.
Ric Campo: You still have a positive rent growth but a negative second derivative, right?\.
Rich Anderson: Got it. Yeah. So that’s interesting because you are saying positive rent growth, but your peers and gateway markets are saying the opposite that rent growth is actually -- in absolute terms negative, would you hazard a guess why that would be paid…
Ric Campo: Well, we are not paying it.
Rich Anderson: …why different.
Alex Jessett: You are right.
Rich Anderson: Why you are not.
Alex Jessett: Yeah.
Rich Anderson: All right. Thank you very much.
Ric Campo: I don’t want to understand given that strength of this market right now though, I don’t understand how anywhere in America, you could have absolute rents be less at the end of the year than they are today.
Rich Anderson: That’s what I understood. But maybe I have to revisit that.
Ric Campo: I can’t -- I don’t want to -- that math doesn’t work in my head even in New York or San Francisco.
Alex Jessett: That’s -- I’d be shocked if that were true. But, I mean, that’s hard to imagine of set of conditions right now that would have absolute ramps falling, but those markets have a different cadence to them as well.
Rich Anderson: Okay. I will check my notes on that. Thanks very much.
Alex Jessett: You bet.
Ric Campo: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good morning down there. Two questions for me, the first is, you guys obviously talked about the slowdown in the mortgage market, transaction market. It sounds like your developments here -- you are going to start fewer, you are not signing as many acquisitions, dispositions for based on what’s happening. Is there anything that’s on the merchant development side, like are you guys seeing any merchant deals that got started that suddenly are in a pickle and maybe that’s an opportunity for you guys to acquire on that front, just curious?
Ric Campo: I would say that there is not a lot of -- there definitely not a lot of stress in the market today. I mean merchant builders were making 3x on their equity and now with price adjustments today maybe it’s 2x or 1.5x, which is still really good but there really is no distress. No, I will say there are, we have seen opportunities. I think the example would be our Nashville Nations project. It was a property that was zoned and ready to go. But the developer couldn’t figure the cost out and they had a little bit more complicated building design and what happened was there -- the land value was almost equal to or their profit in the land is -- was enough to incent them to not to build it and to sell it to us. And so I think there are definitely opportunities like that, where the merchant builder, their cost of capital is gone up or their equity partner is little nervous or and they have province in their land, so they are willing to sell the shovel ready deal at a profit to them and at a sort of market value to us. I think that’s the kind of transaction that’s out there for sure. I do think that there is probably a fair amount of mezzanine type of business that’s out there that’s probably -- that people are working on. That’s not a space that we trade in. But I have had number of calls with people who want us to kind of help recap and then stuff like that, but that’s not what we are leaving that to some of our competitors.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, on obviously the Sunbelt has been garnering headline past few years for the influx of folks coming from Coast or other areas moving down South. As you guys look in your portfolio, how much of a benefit have, I will say, out of region, or if you will, into Camden versus to the market overall. And ask the same question on Mid-American’s call, they have been, they went from 9% outside of Sunbelt to now 15% out of Sunbelt, but they opined that was more people coming into the market buying homes, et cetera. Given you are a bit higher income, a little bit more upscale, curious if you are seeing similar dynamics or if you seeing much bigger impact from add away people coming down South?
Ric Campo: Well, it’s interesting Alex, because when you think about it, the migration from sort of in the North or Coast to South or whatever -- however you want to call it, it’s been going on for a long time. I mean, it’s not new. What happened during the pandemic was the nuance of being able to work from anywhere and the difficulty that people have living in the -- on the Coast given COVID and the restrictions, you had -- you accelerated what’s been going on for a long time and that acceleration has definitely helped us some. Alex has some numbers on that. Go ahead Alex.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So if you look at the second quarter, 20.3% of all of our move-ins to our Sunbelt markets came from non-Sunbelt markets. That’s 100-basis-point sequential increase and if you compare this to the second quarter of 2020, it’s up 440 basis points. So we are absolutely the net beneficiary folks moving out of New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, et cetera down to our markets.
Keith Oden: And Alex, just take that number…
Alexander Goldfarb: Thanks.
Keith Oden: Some aggregate numbers around that.
Alexander Goldfarb: Yeah.
Keith Oden: Witten data had -- has total domestic in-migration net to Camden’s markets of about 140,000 this year and that number goes to 130,000 in 2023. So it’s -- to Ric’s point, we got this turbocharged effect as a result of all the complications from COVID. But this little trend has been in place for a long time and it looks like it’s -- you got to continue at a very elevated level in 2023 as well.
Alexander Goldfarb: Which then sounds like it plays into Rich’s -- Rich Anderson’s point on why you guys are looking at positive rent growth in the back half of this year versus perhaps slowdown elsewhere, you are getting the continue inward migration?
Keith Oden: Yeah. I think that’s clearly part of the story.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hi, everyone. Could you maybe talk about the differences across markets on the July rate growth front, kind of where you are seeing the strongest and then maybe just lease growth. I think you kind of alluded to DC and Houston Area, so just maybe into the other markets would be pretty interesting overall?
Keith Oden: So just looking at our same property second quarter comparisons over the prior year, you had -- we have already discussed DC Metro and Houston. Those are basically in the 7% range. And then beyond that, you have got Phoenix that still at almost 18%. You have got Southeast Florida at 16.5%. You got Orlando at 16%. Tampa at 18%. I mean these are with 14 -- 12 of our 14 markets are in double-digits. So those are pretty -- for this business those are pretty crazy numbers.
Joshua Dennerlein: And one more for me, on the tax side, you felt that the expenses part of that was, I think, driven by the same-store property taxes going up. Are there any specific markets where you are seeing kind of the higher than expected tax assessments or is it across the Board and then it is driven by just valuation or municipalities increasing rate?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. In sort of the three markets that I called out, the first one is Atlanta. Atlanta in the aggregate is actually not that much of an increase, but we originally had actually expected for Atlanta taxes to be down in 2022 based upon some excess -- some successful protest that we had in 2021 and so we got some initial values there that were different than we had expected and will go and can test those. The other two markets, I pointed out, were Houston and Austin, and we are looking at Austin having close to a 20% increase in property taxes. We got initial valuations in that were in that vicinity. We challenge almost every valuation, we are usually incredibly successful and we had absolutely no success in Austin this year on valuation. So that sort of got us to this 20% number. And then we had sort of and Houston was a similar story not quite to the same level, but we had expected Houston to be sort of in the 2% to 3% range and ended up being in the 5% range once we got through all of our final protests. So that’s sort of where we are seeing it. I will tell you also add to that that Southeast Florida, Orlando and Tampa just in general continue to give us some pressure sort of in the 8% to 9% ranges.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Barry Wo [ph] with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. I am Barry. I am on the line for Haendel St. Juste. I was wondering if you could discuss the expense pressures you are facing in more detail. Maybe first off, if you could discuss the drivers and key pieces on the 80% or 80 bps upward revision in your expense guidance? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. And so that the major driver that you are really seeing there once again is property taxes, so if you think about it, we are up to 5.6% of what we are anticipating for property taxes and that’s about a 200 basis point movement and property taxes represent 35% of our total expenses. So 200 basis points on 35% gets you 70 basis points, which is almost the entire delta between the 4.2 that we originally had for total expenses and the 5% we have now. So it’s almost entirely driven by property taxes. Now we do have a couple of other ins and outs. We are seeing some inflationary pressures on R&M and that’s causing us to have some increases on the earn over what we originally had anticipated to the tune of about 300 basis points. But the offset to that is we actually had a really good insurance renewal, and we originally thought that our total insurance for the year was going to be up about 22% and now it looks like it’s up 3%. So we have got a 900 basis point positive there. That sort of offsets the R&M inflationary issues and so that leads you really just the property taxes to be in the main driver.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. So it sounds like it was mostly non-controllable. So what about on the, looking at your supplemental, the 33% G&A increase, can you talk little bit about that?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So as I talked about last year, excuse me, last quarter, we rolled out our work reimagined initiative and if you recall, this is where we took a look at all of our on-site positions and we effectively came up with Nest, where up to three communities are managed together. As part of that, we took our existing Assistant Manager position and we centralize that into a shared service. So the shared service is now part of property G&A and then you have the offset in fact more than an offset in lower salaries as we remove the system manager position.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Robyn Luu with Green Street. Please go ahead.
Robyn Luu: Good morning all. Let me start off with a question on with, Keith, so have you seen any notable pickup in concession from developers in heavier supply markets?
Keith Oden: So, yeah, absolutely, in markets where we have seen the kind of strength that we have for the last year, concessions have been less and we always include roughly one month of free rent to our concession for lease-ups. We don’t do concessions in any of our stabilized portfolio, but that’s the game with that’s played in among developers is -- has always include some provision for concessions. But in our world, they have been for the most part less than what we would have expected them to be. There just don’t -- the same strength for demand in new construction across our markets is typical that and just like we have in our stabilized portfolio. So probably less overall in last year in terms of concessions, but it’s still a part of the overall pricing structure for all new developments.
Robyn Luu: So this is, I guess, my question was around what you see your peers or competitors doing not just your own book?
Keith Oden: Yeah. They have less concession as well. So in an environment where market rents are going up 16%, 17%, from whatever their pro forma was they are all far exceeding what they scheduled rents were. So there would be no real incentive to push rents -- continue to push topline rents and then concess back down to where they -- to the point where their pro forma was. So, yeah, they are all up. My guess is they are all doing better on total rent or total scheduled rents, and they would -- but that doesn’t mean that they would have eliminated concessions. It just means they probably are sticking to the one month free rent that was in their pro forma. And then adjusting market rents to whatever the clearing price is for non-concessed rent structure.
Robyn Luu: Got it. And so my second question is, sorry, if I look at the DC market. Obviously, you have done really well second quarter and July still holding pretty -- staying what 7%. Can you expect any supply pressure impacting your pricing power for the second half of the year?
Keith Oden: This -- the supply pressure in DC has really not been a huge issue for us. We have our -- most of our assets are in DC Metro Area and the total delivered units this year are in the 13,000 range, which is not a huge number for that entire metropolitan area. If you roll forward to 2023, Witten has total scheduled deliveries in the DC Metro Area of about 12,000 apartments. So I don’t expect it to change much next year. The difference is Ric pointed out, a lot of our challenges have been were in markets where there were governmental restrictions on what you could do with either just flat out rent controlled or the inability to collect or to main -- to get your real estate back to the eviction process. And those were, it’s still not completely over in the district, but in DC Metro almost all of those restrictions have been lifted. So I think 2023 is probably going to look more normal and just with regard to how we manage and the ability to push through market clearing rents, which we really couldn’t and in a lot of DC last year.
Robyn Luu: Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ric Campo for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Ric Campo: Great. Thanks. Thanks for being with us today and we will see you at beginning of the conference season after Labor Day. So take care and have a great summer. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-29 11:00:00) =====
Kim Callahan: Good morning and welcome to Camden Property Trust First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman and President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Today's event is being webcast through the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and a replay will be available this afternoon. We will have a slide presentation in conjunction with our prepared remarks and those slides will also be available on our website later today or by e-mail upon request. [Operator Instructions] And please note this event is being recorded. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2022 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. We hope to complete our call within one hour. [Operator Instructions] At this time I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks Kim. The theme for our music today was fools as in April Fools. Since our IPO 29 years ago, April 1st, 2022 was one of the most consequential days in Camden's history. The day began with Kim Callahan telling us that Camden was being included in the S&P 500. At first, we just assumed Kim was attempting one of the lamest April Fools jokes in history, but Kim has never been a big jokester. Later that same day, we closed on our largest acquisition since the Summit merger in 2005 with the purchase of Texas Teachers partnership interest in 22 Camden communities with a gross valuation of $2.1 billion. And finally, April 1st was the day that Camden completed the implementation of our Work Reimagined initiative, a comprehensive restructuring of how we staff, manage, and support our Camden communities. Alex will provide more details on this initiative in his comments. Any one of these events would have been a big deal for Camden. The fact that all three happen on April Fool's day was extraordinary and that's no joke. I want to give a big shout out to our teams in the field. We're continuing to outperform our competitors, while improving the lives of our team members and our customers one experience at a time. I'd also like to give a big shout out to our real estate investments, finance, legal, and asset management groups along with our accounting group for their amazing work in completion of the acquisition and the permanent financing for the Texas Teachers' transaction truly a team effort. Keith is up next. Thanks.
Keith Oden: Thanks Ric. Now, a few details on our first quarter 2022 operating results and April trends. Same-property revenue growth exceeded our expectations at 11.1%, the best quarterly growth in our company's history. 12 of our 14 markets posted double-digit revenue growth in the quarter with Tampa, Phoenix and Southeast Florida showing the strongest results. Given this outperformance and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our 2022 full year revenue growth projection from 8.75% to 10.25% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Rental rates for the first quarter had signed new leases up 15.8% renewals up 13.2% for a blended rate of 14.4%. Our preliminary April results are also trending at 14.4% for blended growth with new leases at 14.7% and renewals at 14.1%. Renewal offers for May and June were sent out at an average increase of 14.4%. Occupancy averaged 97.1% during the first quarter of 2022 which matched our performance last quarter and compared to 95.9% in the first quarter of 2021. April 2022 occupancy is trending at 96.9% to-date. Net turnover for the first quarter of 2022 was 36% versus 35% last year and move-outs to purchase homes dropped to 14.1% for the quarter versus 15.8% last quarter in line with normal seasonal patterns we typically see from 4Q to 1Q of each year. Move-outs to purchase homes remain well below normal for our portfolio. Finally I want to acknowledge all of team Camden for recently being named to Fortune's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. This year marks our 15th consecutive year on this prestigious list. Camden is one of only five companies included in the S&P 500 and also named to Fortune's list for the last 15 years rarified air indeed. Next up is Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith and certainly rarefied air. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance a brief update on our recent real estate and finance activities. During the first quarter of 2022, we stabilized Camden Lake Eola a 360-unit $125 million new development in Orlando. We disposed of a 245-unit community in Largo Maryland for $72 million and we acquired a 16-acre land parcel in Richmond Texas for future development purposes. Subsequent to quarter end we acquired for future development 43 acres of land comprised of two undeveloped parcels in Charlotte and we purchased the remaining 68.7% ownership interest in our two joint venture funds for approximately $1.5 billion inclusive of the assumption of debt. The assets involved in this fund transaction include 22 multifamily communities with 7,247 apartment homes with an average age of 12 years primarily located in the Sunbelt markets across Camden's portfolio. We expect this acquisition will provide an initial FFO yield of approximately 4.4%. As a result of this transaction as detailed on page 10 of the supplemental package, the expected net operating income contribution from markets including Houston, Austin, Dallas and Tampa will increase slightly while the remainder of Camden's markets will reflect flat-to-slightly lower concentrations. This transaction allowed us to fully acquire a very attractive portfolio of assets with no execution or integration risks. We initially funded this transaction with cash on hand which included $500 million drawn on our unsecured $900 million line of credit. We are also now consolidating approximately $514 million of existing secured mortgage debt of the funds. Subsequent to quarter end, we issued 2.9 million common shares and received $490.3 million of net proceeds, which we used to pay down our line of credit. As of today, we have approximately $70 million outstanding under our line. At quarter end, we had $182 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline, and we have no scheduled debt maturities until September 30 of this year. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt to EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022 anticipated to be at 4.4 times. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2022 of $160.5 million or $1.50 per share, $0.03 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $1.45 to $1.49. The $0.03 per share variance to the midpoint of our prior quarterly FFO guidance resulted primarily from approximately $0.025 from higher occupancy, lower bad debt and higher rental rates for our same-store and non-same-store portfolio, and $0.01 from an unbudgeted earn-out received from the sale of our Chirp investment completed in 2021. This $0.035 cumulative outperformance was partially offset by $0.005 in higher property insurance expense resulting from higher-than-expected levels of the self-insured losses. Last night, based upon our year-to-date operating performance our April 2022 new lease and renewal rates and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we have increased the midpoint of our full year revenue growth from 8.75% to 10.25%. Our revised revenue growth midpoint of 10.25% is based upon an anticipated 12% average increase in new leases and an 8% average increase in renewals. We are also anticipating that our occupancy for the remainder of the year will average 96.6%, up 20 basis points from our original budget for the same period. Additionally, we have increased the midpoint of our same-store expense growth from 3% to 4.2%. This increase results from the expectations of higher-than-anticipated insurance costs, property tax expenses resulting from higher initial valuations in Dallas and Austin, and bonus accruals related to our increased full year revenue guidance. As a result, the midpoint of our 2022 same-store NOI guidance has been adjusted from 12% to 13.75%. At the end of the first quarter, we implemented our work re-imagine initiative, which redesigned the way we conduct business in our property operations. The primary objective of this initiative is to deliver exceptional customer service, focus on leasing apartments, leverage the strengths of our teams, and create operational efficiencies. To do this, we shifted our operations model to expand from one community serving our prospects and residents to two or more communities being joined or nested together with shared leadership to support our customers. Additionally, we identified processes that could be automated or centralized and created a shared service division to streamline the execution of tasks, such as invoicing, delinquency management, and renewal initiation to name a few. This allows Camden team members at each community to better support the leasing process, as well as the focus on the customer experience. We anticipate that, this program which was previously budgeted for will save us approximately $1 million in 2022 on a net basis, after accounting for severance payments which were budgeted for and made in the first quarter. On a full year stabilized basis, our savings should approximate $4 million to $5 million. Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2022 FFO guidance by $0.27 per share for a new midpoint of $6.51 per share. This $0.27 per share increase resulted primarily from an approximate $0.18 increase related to our acquisition of the fund assets comprised of the following components: a $0.67 increase from consolidating the NOI from the two fund portfolios, a $0.07 increase from the non-cash amortization of net below-market leases assumed in the acquisition. Purchase price accounting requires us to identify either below or above market leases in place at the time of the acquisition and amortize the differential over the average remaining lease term, which is approximately seven months. If the leases were above market, the amortization would have resulted in an FFO reduction over the remaining lease term. A $0.21 decrease in equity and income of joint ventures and property and asset management fees. A $0.14 decrease due to the assumption of approximately $514 million in existing secured debt, which has a current average interest rate of 3.3%. 36% of this debt floats at LIBOR plus 185 basis points and the remaining 64% is fixed at 3.9%. A $0.14 decrease related to additional shares issued to fund the transaction, and a $0.07 decrease from the removal of any future acquisitions from our 2022 guidance. Although, our revised guidance does not include additional acquisitions this year, we will continue to look for opportunities to make accretive investments. Our revised guidance still includes another $200 million of dispositions by year-end. In addition to the $0.18 anticipated increase in FFO related to the fund acquisitions, we are also anticipating an approximate $0.11 increase from our revised same-store NOI guidance and a $0.01 increase from the first quarter unbudgeted earnout received from the sale of our Chirp investment. This $0.30 cumulative increase in FFO per share is partially offset by $0.02 of higher overhead expenses related to our anticipated outperformance versus our original budget and $0.01 of additional interest expense due to higher projected interest rates on our variable rate debt. We also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2022. We expect FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.60 to $1.64. The midpoint of $1.62 represents a $0.12 per share increase from the $1.50 recorded in the first quarter. This increase is primarily the result of an approximate $0.09 increase related to our acquisition of the fund assets comprised of a $0.22 increase from consolidating the NOI from the two fund portfolios, a $0.03 increase from the non-cash amortization of net below-market leases assumed in the acquisition, a $0.07 decrease in equity and income of joint ventures and property and asset management fees, a $0.04 decrease due to the assumption of approximately $514 million in existing secured debt, and a $0.05 decrease related to additional shares issued to fund the transaction. We are also now anticipating an approximate $0.04 sequential increase in same-store NOI resulting from higher expected revenues during our peak leasing periods, partially offset by the seasonality of certain repair and maintenance expenses, expected increases from our May insurance renewal and a sequential increase in property tax expense due to higher refunds received in the first quarter. A $0.01 sequential increase related to additional NOI from development communities and lease-up, a $0.01 decrease from unbudgeted earnout received from the sale of our Chirp investment in the first quarter, a $0.005 decrease from the sale of Camden Largo at the end of the first quarter and a $0.005 decrease from higher second quarter G&A as a result of the timing of various public company fees. At this time, we will open the call up to questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi. You may now go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thank you. Can you walk through the conversations with your JV partner of how the deal came about? And then also how valuation was calculated? 
Ric Campo: Sure. We have ongoing conversations with our JV partner. And we're talking about valuations and ultimate disposition of the pool of assets. The actual sort of finalized date in the pool was to sell assets by 2026. So, we had a 4-year kind of window. And it made sense we thought -- we think to go ahead and buy that portfolio. We had a meeting of the minds. They wanted to exit over the next four years. We figured that it'd be a pretty interesting way to create value for us long-term by doing that immediately.  The valuation metric was we had just completed an appraisal of the portfolio in December. And then we -- what we did is we took sort of values that were pretty evident in the market kind of average them together and then negotiated a fair price for both parties. So it was a very positive transaction for them. The fact that they put $300 million in and took out $1.5 billion worth of cash through the holding period and had an IRR way above 20% on their capital was a pretty positive transaction for the Teachers of Texas.  And from our perspective, it allows us to be more efficient in our portfolio by acquiring those assets. The other part of the equation, I think is really interesting about those assets is that they're primarily suburban and so it helps us with our suburban portfolio. Suburban continues to outperform urban generally. And we're just seeing this great transaction for both parties. 
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then maybe just what are you seeing in the transaction markets today, just given the rise in interest rates? 
Ric Campo: Transaction market is still very, very buoyant. Clearly the tenure going up 100-plus basis points in three or four weeks has definitely got people kind of head scratch and thinking about what pricing ought to be. I would say that the acquisition market for leveraged buyers has definitely taken a pause. The value-add space which we don't really play in, but that has definitely taken a pause.  But when you think about sort of core assets or core plus assets in the multifamily space that are being acquired by long-term holders for cash. That part of the market hasn't changed at all and there's definitely very aggressive bids continuing for that. So we'll see when you think about sort of any asset value it's driven by four things in this order. Liquidity in the marketplace which there's massive liquidity; supply and demand fundamentals which you could -- you can't argue about that in the multifamily space today; and then inflation expectations which we all know are going up; and then ultimately interest rates. So I think at the margin some leverage buyers are definitely having to rethink their underwriting. But most institutional buyers like us are just kind of looking at it as a -- it hasn't really changed the pricing from that perspective.
Q – Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. You may now go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Good morning and thank you. Yes let's just stick on that in this rigid cap rate environment. And I think you mentioned the tight versus historical levels on the cap rate spread to the 10-year treasury. So what's keeping you from accelerating dispose and perhaps D.C. or some other markets?
Ric Campo: Well, nothing really. I mean we have a budget this year of a couple of hundred million dollars of sales. We usually do those at the end of the year primarily because we like to keep the cash flow as long as we can in the current year. But we have a methodical disposition and acquisition program and we're going to continue to execute that. If you think about the last 10 years, we have sold $3.4 billion of assets with an average age of 23 years and we have acquired $3.5 billion with an average age of four years maybe with the exception of the fund, which was actually 12 years. So we're going to continue to be involved in the market and it makes sense. If you think about all our dispositions we've done I mean all the low hanging fruit from a disposition perspective from Camden has been done and we love our markets. We like where they're operating. And at the margins, we'll sell some assets and reallocate capital as we talked about in the past we will be continuing to lower our exposure in D.C. and Houston primarily through organic growth, but also through some pruning of those -- of the portfolio in those markets as well.
Derek Johnston: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then you guys have I think $390 million in unsecured debt maturities this year. Clearly, you have one of the best balance sheets amidst all REITs. But when it comes to refinancing, can you kind of speak to -- when you talk to your bankers how the rate environment looks and what that might look like versus previous rates? 
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So we've got about $350 million of debt that comes due December 15 and that debt is at 3.15%. The way in our model that we plan on paying for it is the a couple of hundred million dollars of dispositions at the end of the year that Ric mentioned. But if you think about overall rates for us the indicatives that we have right now are right around call it 4.1%. And to give you an idea, probably about six seven weeks ago that number was sub-3%. So pretty aggressive acceleration on rates. 
Derek Johnston: Thanks. That’s very helpful. That’s it from me.
Operator: Our next question will come from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. You may now go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Thanks, guys. Another great quarter. First, one you touched on it I think Alex about the way that you're staffing and serving the communities. Can you just give some more color on that. It kind of seems like everyone or just your peers are shifting to like the next generation of sort of operations. Again, just if you could give some examples or sort of it sounds like you're potting your sort of clusters of assets to reduce your OpEx load. If you can just give some elaborate on that kind of how you see that going forward over the next 24 months that would be great. Thanks.
Keith Oden: Yes. Sure. I just give you a little bit of detail about the – we call it nesting humming birds, right? So some people call it coding. But the geography of our portfolio is pretty unique in that respect. And our approach probably it's very unique to Camden because of our geography. So within our 170 plus or minus communities, after this reformation of reporting responsibilities and duties into Nest, we end up with about 46 communities that are still standalone single community manager staff. And then we end up with about 76 that are nested in a payer of two and we have 39 communities that are in groups of three. So and that's really just based on geography and being able to staff those communities in a way that the on-site step becomes interchangeable with regard to where the need is for whether it's maintenance personnel or leasing personnel. So that's kind of the geography of it again, driven a lot by the way our portfolio lays out and the ability to be close enough to a sister community to make that work. When we started out and there were going to be all different permutations of this. Everybody is going to end up with an approach that works kind of for their grouping of assets in their geography. But when we started out, we didn't have a stacking in mind. What we were trying to accomplish is really two things regarding our on-site teams. One is one of the biggest challenges that historically of the single asset community manager, assistant manager, leasing and outside staff is that you just don't have the ability to have the promotion ability and the growth opportunity for those folks because they're sort of in the single line stack That's one challenge. We're providing additional growth opportunities by having new positions, the sales leader position and then the operations analyst position that people can migrate to over time as their experience increases. So that was a driving influence for us is to come up with a better mousetrap to provide for growth opportunities. But the second thing was that you always have – you have a single community in this linear community manager, assistant manager, outside staff, inside staff, you just – you end up with a situation where your skill sets are not properly aligned in many cases. You end up with people who are naturally inclined to sales as a leasing consultant. The next logical and really only move in most cases for them to advances to become an assistant manager. And assistant manager has in some cases they have some sales duties and in a lot of cases it's very much an administrative support role. And honestly, our best salespeople are generally not our best administrative tasking people. And so that was just an inherent shortcoming of not being able to leverage people's strengths because of the structure that we were bound to by having the single community linear approach. So that was the second really driving influence for us is to get people matched up to where their natural strengths are and then provide more opportunities for growth within that hierarchy. So I hope that explains a little bit about our philosophy. 
Neil Malkin: Yes. No, that's great. Thank you. Other one for me is related to, I guess, renewals. I think renewals are I think across the board I think stronger compared to what management teams and what we thought would kind of look like. Obviously, the turnover is historically low. And because you don't push as hard on those versus new leases you have quite a bit of loss to lease built up. And so I'm just wondering I would like you to discuss how you think about renewals through 2022 and even into 2023 just given the sort of low turnover environment people willing to take these prices. How do you think that stacks up for pricing power over the next several quarters? Thanks.
Keith Oden: Yes. So I think that the -- when you think about renewals and new leases I mean we manage our rent roll. Our revenue management team is doing this daily and we're looking at situations where it might be appropriate to put caps in place if you're trying to manage to a turnover or an occupancy amount and we've done that in some cases. I think the reality for our portfolio is that we started seeing really significant both new lease and renewal increases in the sort of May-June time frame last year. And obviously we're lapping up on that. And so we're coming into a period where we were already aggressively pushing both new leases and renewals and most of the rest of the market had not started to do that and certainly a lot of our public company peers have not gotten to the point where they had that kind of pricing power. So we're going to run into that first. You got to think about the move in rental rates both new leases and renewals in these markets is just a complete reset of the market clearing price for multifamily. And we are going to reach that first because we started down the trail first in terms of a market clearing price for these assets. It's -p there's a lot of conversation a lot of questions around the 16%, 17%, 20% headline increases. And that's true. We have seen that. But I think you for context you almost have to think of it over a three-year period because our residents who are yet they're getting these big kind of eye-popping increases right now. But for the two previous years you go back two years ago we were actually decreasing rents since beginning of the pandemic. And then the second year we had some very modest increases. So for the most part our residents are the reset of the rents if it's 15% over a three-year period it would be more like 5% per year for three years. But it's since it's all in one year it's kind of the headline. But we will definitely reach that reset first in our portfolio. I think the two markets where we are not going to reach the reset probably not even by the end of this year are Houston and D.C. proper and maybe L.A. County. And that's more in D.C. proper Loudoun County in the D.C. Metro area in LA County. That's a regulatory constraint. And then in Houston we think that we don't have any regulatory constraints anymore. And our growth rates have picked up pretty significantly. But those three of our markets probably will be the three that have not completely reset by the end of the year. 
Ric Campo: I'll just add to that. If you take our signed and renewal leases and you take out the two biggest markets Houston and D.C., we had a 14% blended increase with all the markets included. Take Houston and D.C. out, it's 16.6%. So to Keith's point the markets that have not reset to the level with the rest of the country have the ability to do that over the next couple of years. And Houston's issue is that energy has been -- has not added back all the jobs they lost during the pandemic. And Houston overall as an economy has still not added back all the jobs that we lost during the pandemic. And so there's gas in the tank if you will for Camden going forward on renewals and new leases. One of our two largest markets start over the next couple of years. We're able to do that big reset on them. And don't get us wrong. I mean, at least we're getting 8% to 9% increases in new leases but it's nothing like Tampa or Phoenix or some of these other really white hot markets.
Neil Malkin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney. You may now go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning guys. Keith or Alex what's the expected stabilized yield on the current five projects under development? And what are you expecting on projects that you'll start over the remainder of the year? And I guess the other related question here is what are you seeing on pricing availability for materials and labor for new starts?
Alex Jessett: Yeah, absolutely. So if you look at our current pipeline, we're anticipating right around a 6% stabilized yield. If you look at the assets that we haven't started yet that number is right around 5.25% to 5.5%. If you think about construction costs, probably the easiest way to think about it is to bifurcate it between high rises and for high rises we're seeing escalation right around 0.5% a month. For wood frame construction that number is right around 1% a month. I will tell you though we're starting to get some good news. Lumber is down to I think it's about $1000 per board foot, which is off of the $1,400 that we saw about three months ago but it's certainly well-above the $400 that we were seeing in normal time. So we're still seeing some escalation. It's still fairly significant, but there are some signs that it might be slowing down a little bit.
Ric Campo: The other part of that equation is general condition costs are up because it's taking longer to build. So pretty much every one of our development has definitely been enhanced by higher rent growth and better yields than we originally anticipated and that the pipeline that we're starting right now we start out with a fairly low expectation of rental growth over the next couple of years and then flat-line at 3%. So there's definitely upside in the ones that we're starting this year in terms of our yields. But the thing that you get into this issue of how fast supply can get into the marketplace. And we're adding 60 to 120 days of additional time frame on our construction projects anything we start this year. And that's in addition to the 60 to 90 days that we added three years ago. So it's really, the supply chain issue is going to be a problem through 2023, 2024. So that's sort of good news and bad news. It takes you longer to build. But on the -- so that's bad news. The good news is, is that all this new supply that is starting in response to the demand push that's happened in this industry is going to take a lot longer than most people think to come to the market. So that should make us feel pretty good about 2022 through the end of the year and through 2023 and not having major supply pressure on the demand side.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And how are you guys thinking about the trade-off in terms of redevelopment these days, given how you're able to get 15% rental rate increases versus taking the unit out for some period of time and spending money? And is there a bunch of units in the JV portfolio you just acquired that you expect to redevelop, or has that already been going on inside the JV over the last few years?
Keith Oden: Yeah. We just approved another grouping of -- for our redevelopment program in total of about $125 million. So we still as the vintage works and the new construction pricing around our existing assets that are anywhere from 10 to 15 years old, as those rental rates continue to escalate, it makes the REIT positions look much more attractive. Obviously, the yield on that book of business has come down over time, but it's still the best play on the board for Camden with regard to capital allocation between either new development acquisitions or reposition. So we'll continue to do that as we can. There are a couple of assets that we acquired in the fund that are already under repositioned. There are a couple more that will likely be added to the pool next year. But honestly, we had already done some repositions with our JV partner as they made sense. They were always extremely supportive. They understood the play and the return on invested capital was the best play on the Board for the joint venture. So we operated the fund as if they were Camden assets, obviously with the consent of our partner. But there's not -- it's not like we were waiting or didn't have approval or didn't have capital or didn't have the buy-in to do repositions as they were appropriate within the fund. But there will be some assets that will be added just on -- based on conditions on the ground and what's happening to interrupt rental rates in the submarket.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. Have a good weekend.
Keith Oden: You bet.
- Ric Campo: You too.
Alex Jessett: You too.
Operator: Our next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. You may now go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Hey. Thanks, team. Good morning. So I'm sure your bankers have done the count for you about the net new demand you'll get from the inclusion. But I'm wondering if the equity offering post inclusion to what degree it was influenced by that? Was it made larger because of perhaps new indexers needing to own your stock. Any influence at all?
- Ric Campo: No. It was -- the equity offering was strictly to pay for the joint venture acquisition. I mean we bought it for $1.5 billion. You take off the debt side we needed $1.1 billion in cash and we had $600 million on our balance sheet. So we drew down on the line $500 million and it looked to us that given what has happened to interest rates with -- in the bond market that the equity offering made a lot of sense that sort of reload the balance sheet and get our debt-to-EBITDA back down to the 4.4 area. So no it was all driven by the acquisition.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Fair enough. Second question to what degree you hear management teams your peers say well we're heading into the heavy leasing season even M&A you said that in the Sunbelt. I'm curious to what degree seasonality really plays a major role for you guys I would think even like in a market like Phoenix, it's 150 degrees in July maybe better time to at least in November. And there's a lot of markets like that. So do you have kind of a muted seasonality factor when you talk about the second and third quarter, or do you feel like it's just as prevalent for you guys as it might be for an EQR or somebody like that up north?
Keith Oden: You're always going to have some degree of seasonality Rich. As you mentioned, Phoenix is the reverse -- has a reverse seasonality to our entire -- the rest of our portfolio for the reason that you mentioned. But the -- from these levels of occupancy and the level -- the low level of turnover that we've seen and continue to see, you just -- the leasing season, the volumes are just not going to be there as they have been in the past. We got incredibly low turnover and we're starting from a very high occupancy. So -- but more people -- but it's just a fact. I mean people in our markets tend to move around more in the summer. There's an impetus to get something done before kids go back to school, or they -- for whatever reason they're relocating. It just -- it's conducive to doing so. And always has been. So I don't think seasonality will be there. I just don't think you're going to see it in the leasing numbers if you're comparing -- start comparing year-over-year how many leases that we executed in the next six months, call it, between now and go back to pre-pandemic. I just don't think you're going to see anything like that, but it's not because seasonality is not out there, it's just a different set of facts.
Rich Anderson: Yes. Fair enough. That’s all I got. Thanks.
Keith Oden: Okay.
Operator: Our next question will come from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hi, everyone. Hope everybody’s doing well. Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys discuss your earn-in for 2023, given everything that's already in place?
Ric Campo: We did not. And it's probably a -- it's a number that we talk about, but it's such a speculative number that we're really not going to talk about that. It's just -- it's hard to predict ultimately. Maybe second or third quarter is a better time to ask it.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. I'll keep it in my question bank for 2Q.
Ric Campo: Very good.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes. And then, one of your peers announced a new structured investment program this quarter and I know some other REITs have it as well. Is that something you've looked at, like whether, you would set up a similar program, where you could provide mezz or preferred equity to third-party developers in your markets?
Ric Campo: We've actually done that before. And it was -- usually the margin make decent money on those types of transactions and I know our competitors do it. But we would rather keep our balance sheet clean and focus 100% of our attention on our existing portfolio. And at this point, we have no joint ventures on our portfolio. We have the most simple and cleanest balance sheet in the sector and we're going to keep it that way.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. You may now go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you, operator. That’s actually very good pronunciation. Hey, guys. I want to talk about SFR development here. It looks like you started two projects in Houston. I guess, I'm curious, you've alluded to in the past perhaps you're looking at this. But I guess, I'm curious, why now the approach you're taking here the type of product, looked like you're partnering with a local builder. Maybe talk about the returns you're targeting and your appetite for maybe doing more. Thanks.
Ric Campo: Sure. So you're talking about the two properties that we have acquired in Houston and those are both purpose-built single-family for-rent properties. And the way we look at them is, they're just horizontal apartments, right? And the fact that they're all in one subdivision, and they're -- and both projects are a decent scale 180-plus units. We just think it's an interesting thing to the single-family rental market to sort of dip our toe into. If you look at our history, we got involved in student housing we got involved in senior housing and those two areas for us were too kind of far-flung for our taste. The single-family rental market is a different animal. And if you can have a subdivision and have some scale within that subdivision then you sort of run it just like an apartment and maybe with less staff and what have you. But I think it's just an interesting and potentially expansion ability for us in the markets we're already in. So we're -- like I said, put our toe in the water. And the yields are pretty much the same on those properties as they are in the multifamily space. The challenge with purpose-built single-family rentals is that the size of the project is not ideal. Most of our new developments today are over $100 million and most are like $150 million. So, it's a little inefficient for our senior development people to work on smaller deals like that. But it's I think an area for us and also the municipalities oftentimes don't understand single-family rental. So it takes longer sometimes to entitle and -- but ultimately, I think it's an interesting area for us to look at and to ultimately maybe get some benefits from how they're operated and have that translate into more efficient operations in our final projects.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. That's interesting. Certainly sounds like there is perhaps a mindset to do more, but you're using now these two projects that may be a case study?
Ric Campo: Yes.
Haendel St. Juste: Second question maybe for Alex. Maybe a bit more color on the expense guidance, the 120 basis point increase, not a small amount given that you gave out guidance 60 days ago. I guess I'm curious you could talk a bit about more about what's happened in the last 60 days? You touched on some of the pressures maybe in the insurance and property taxes. But I guess I'm curious maybe you can get into some of the detail on each of those pieces? And do you think that the new guide kind of captures what you're seeing out there or the risk of further increase in the same-store guide over the course of the year? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So, the first thing I'll talk about is taxes. So you have to remember that taxes, is about 35% of our total expenses. And initially we thought taxes were going to be up 3.3%. We now think they're going to be up 3.8%. The big driver there is Austin and Dallas. We got our initial valuations in. They were in the 30% up range. Obviously, we will contest those as we typically do. And we obviously anticipate that there's going to be some rollback in rates to account for the increase in valuations but that's one component of it. The second component of it is insurance. Originally, we thought that insurance was going to be up, call it, around 11%. We now have it up around 22%. 70% of our insurance cost is associated with rates. We think our rates are going to be up right around 30%, which is continues to be a really tough insurance market. We are actually in the market right now trying to do our renewal. We're going to know a little bit more obviously, probably in the next three or four weeks, but we feel that what we have here is a pretty good number. And then the other side of it is salaries. And as we typically have done whenever we have outperformance on the revenue side, we do increase our bonus accruals. As you know we do reward our on-site teams for their efforts. And so you've got a component that's directly tied to what we're anticipating for outperformance on the revenue side for the rest of the year.
Haendel St. Juste: That’s great color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. You may now go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Can you give any updated stats on move-ins from outside the Sunbelt or move-outs to areas outside?
Alex Jessett: Yes absolutely. So, if you think about in the first quarter of this year, about 19.3% of our move-ins came from non-Sunbelt markets. If you look at that on a year-over-year basis, that's up 160 basis points from the first quarter of 2021. And if you compare it to the first quarter of 2020, right before COVID got started, that number is actually up about 330 basis points. So, continue to see really, really robust demand from folks moving from outside the Sunbelt into our Sunbelt markets and continuing to see acceleration on that front.
Brad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then any update on where rent income stands currently?
Ric Campo: Sure. Right now rent to income is around 20%. If you look at our new leases our average household income is about $116,000 and our lease to the rent-to-income ratio is slightly less than 20%, but overall it's a little -- right at 20%. And the challenge with that number is we don't ask our residents to update their income number. So, what's been happening is, is when we renew somebody the rent goes up, but their income stays the same because we don't we ask them to update their income. And so I think those numbers at 20% and a little less than 20% are probably overstated. It's probably in the teens if you upgraded everybody's income.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. You may now go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning. I guess first question just on bad debt. Maybe I missed it. Could you just maybe talk about the bad debt trends that you saw in 1Q, kind of, what you're budgeting within the revenue growth for the full year?
Alex Jessett: Yes absolutely. So, collections for us in the first quarter were right around 98.8%. If you think about bad debt and you sort of go back to the trend. So, pre-COVID for us bad debt was right around 50 basis points. In 2020, that number was around 120 basis points and that stayed that way through all of 2021 as well. What we're anticipating in 2022 is a slight improvement in that number and we're thinking that will get down to right around maybe call it about 100 basis points. Yes go ahead. 
Steve Sakwa: Sorry. If you just think about 2023, do you think that reverts down towards the 50 basis points next year?
Alex Jessett: We certainly anticipate that as we move through 2022, we're going to get back to a more normal trend. I mean really if you ignore California in our portfolio, our delinquency is right around 50 basis points, which is right in line with historical averages. So, as long as we get to the point in California where we can enforce contracts, which we certainly hope by the time we get to 2023, we're going to be in that scenario then we should assume that 23% is going to be a more typical year. And by the way the 50 basis points that I told you in 2019 that's what we experienced since we went public. So, that's very much a normal year. 
Steve Sakwa: Got it. Thanks. And then just second question, I guess maybe for Ric or Keith. Just big picture, we're seeing more discussion about rent control outside of the New York and California markets, and some of the Florida markets just given how much rents have gone up. I'm just curious kind of what your thoughts are – what kind of discussions you're maybe having with folks in Washington and in some of the states about that?
Ric Campo: We're definitely on it no question. There's – when you think about the states like Florida and Texas, they may talk a good game in the cities at the local level, but at the state level it seems very counterintuitive to think that deep red states with Republican governors are going to go anywhere near repealing sort of statewide bands on local municipalities doing rent control. And so I think, we're in good shape in most of our markets, we're not really too concerned about rent control. National Multi Housing Council, we're very involved in that and Laurie Baker serves on their leadership group, and we're talking on an ongoing basis to lawmakers about rent control. Nationally, it really won't be a national thing. It's really a state-by-state thing. We just had a conference call last week for example – this week with the California Apartment Association, and the industries expects to have another fight in California coming up on repealing, the statewide rent control scenarios. But generally speaking, in our markets, I think we're pretty good with the exception of California rent control issues.
Steve Sakwa: Great. That's it for me. Thanks.
Ric Campo: Okay.
Operator: Our next question will come from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. You may now go ahead.
Connor Mitchell: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So I just have couple items to circle back to first regarding the single-family rentals. Can you just remind us, if these are stand-alone products, or would it be more of attached townhomes?
Ric Campo: These are standalone products, with two car garages at front yard and the backyard. We probably, when you think about whether they're townhouses or not, I think that, we're starting out with detached. And I think ultimately townhouses make sense too. We developed townhouses as part of our development program in certain places for example in Atlanta at our Camden Buckhead property. We have townhouses and they're three bedroom townhouses, and they get the highest average rent, and they're absolutely full all the time. So I think – I don't think, it's negative that townhouses are negative. The two that we're building right now just having to be detached.
Connor Mitchell: Great. Thank you. And then the second question was, can you just remind us again of the – if there's been any acceleration of move-outs to home purchases given the rising mortgage rates or a decline?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So we actually declined from last year. We were in the high 15s. So far this year we're back down to 14%. Long-term average for our portfolio over the 20-plus years is about 18% to 19%. So we're still well below what the long-term average is. And with the recent spike in the tenure and the corresponding move in mortgage rates, I just -- I can't -- it's hard to see that number getting much traction on the upside anytime soon. I suppose, it's possible that you could sort of have the panic, buy like I have to buy now before it gets worse effect in this quarter, but mortgage rates above 5% versus where they were even six or seven months ago in the 3s is a game changer for most people. And I think that lenders are probably putting place in a lot more scrutiny around borrower requirements just because the -- it's better to underwrite them. And so I think, it's pretty likely that we'll stay much 300 or 400 basis points below our long-term average on move-outs to buy homes. It just gets tougher-and-tougher. So not only do you have in many of our markets single-family home prices have doubled in the last five years and now you have a 5% mortgage rate. And the combination of those two things is just a killer for affordability for most first-time homebuyers.
Ric Campo: When you look at our numbers from 2021, it was interesting to watch -- to see in March of 2021 or move-out to buy houses was around 16% in April, through the end of the month. So far it was 17% in March and April of 2021. And if you go back to this March, we were at 16%, which is pretty much the same as it was in the prior March. And then -- but April fell to as Keith pointed out, 14%. So we had a 300 basis point decline from April 2021 to 2022 and a 200 basis point decline from March to April. And April is sort of thought as the spring home buying season. People rush into the market before the summer. And so having those numbers decline year-over-year and month-over-month tells me that single-family home move-out to buy homes is not going to be a problem for us. And there is some tension and stress in the market where people can't afford the high price or the high interest rate at this point.
Connor Mitchell: Great. Thank you for the color on that. Thanks. That's it for me.
Ric Campo: Okay.
Operator: Our next question will come from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead.
Chandni Luthra: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I believe it hasn't come up and if it has, apologize. Could you remind us where last year, lease stands in your portfolio right now? And how much of it do you expect to capture in 2022?
Alex Jessett: Sure. So loss to lease for us is right around 11%. And obviously, as we -- as we work through 2022, we should capture a large percentage of that. Now obviously, you have to remember that for renewals we're not generally bringing renewals, all the way up -- all the way up to market for a variety of reasons. So you'll never really capture that full amount, but we should get quite a bit of it for the rest of the year.
Chandni Luthra: Great. And before the end of the hour, if you could give us an update on your thoughts around, how you're thinking about supply in 2023, in your markets? I mean, obviously, it's no surprise to anybody it's not news that permitting activity, construction activity has kind of been really up there. But then, at the same time, we continue to see compounding supply chain issues as well, so and higher interest costs and kind of construction costs. So how are you thinking about supply in your backyard next year?
Ric Campo: Go ahead. 
Keith Oden: Yes, Ron Witten has got completions in our – across Camden's portfolio at about 160000 apartments this year. And then in 2023 based on his estimates that goes to 212000. So about 50000 increase across our entire – all of our 15 markets. And I do believe that this is Ron has updated his completions numbers to try to capture the impact that Ric talked about earlier which is it just takes longer to get these jobs built. So everybody that's been doing completions work for years and years and they've been using the same kind of estimates and metrics around start date how long to first unit turned and how long to deliver completed product. They've all been badly wrong in the last two years and I think they're finally made some progress on understanding just what the effects of this elongated construction period that everyone is dealing with. So I think he believes his numbers have captured, the slippage that is happening above historical rates and he thinks we're going to be up 50,000 completions across Camden's markets next year which if you look at it market by market there's not none of them look terribly troubling at this point as long as we continue to get decent job growth.
Ric Campo: It also shows above average or above long-term trend revenue growth in 2023 in spite of the new supply coming in. 
Operator: Our next question will come from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. You may now go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Alex in your prepared remarks you mentioned that your same-store revenue guidance includes the assumption of 8% on renewals. And I just wanted to clarify is that 8% for the remainder of the year, or is that the full year including 14% in the first quarter? 
Alex Jessett: Yes. I think the best way to probably look at that is we're getting towards a blended 10% and so the blended 10% includes the full year. 
John Kim: Okay. So not to focus too much on renewals but you did mention it's lower than your new lease growth rate. I'm just wondering why that's the case. The new lease growth rate at 12%. 
Alex Jessett: Yes. Obviously, we've had over the past call it 1.5 years we've had a situation where new leases have been higher than renewals. Now at some point in time that will converge right? And that's what you typically see. But for our assumptions right now we are assuming that they are not converging just yet. And if you think about why renewals are less than new leases it's what I sort of mentioned earlier, obviously when you've got a resident in place there are certain – there are frictional costs associated with that resident leaving. And that's typically why at least in the past 1.5 years we've had lower rates on renewals. 
John Kim: Okay. My second question is on your 11% loss to lease. Is there any way to break down what that loss to leases on your leases that were signed in the second and third quarter of last year? I'm assuming that what you just had in the first quarter is a minimal loss to lease that would be higher than 11% on your older ventured leases? 
Alex Jessett: Yes. I mean so when we talk about an 11% loss to lease what we're doing is we're looking at the signed leases that occurred -- that occurred in March as compared to the in-place leases. You are right that if you have an upward trajectory of rate increases in 2021, then you start to build off of either lower or higher numbers depending upon how you flow throughout the year. And theoretically, I mean that's why the loss to lease starts to -- starts to minimize as you move forward.
John Kim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. You may now go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks everybody. I just wanted to go back to the new lease rate trends a bit, which recognize they've moderated a bit here from the peak. And just wondering, how much you think is really seasonality related versus the tougher comps and just normalizing steadily normalizing operating conditions because up until this point to what you just said really turnovers remain very low and occupancy really held up quite well in 1Q. So I guess what's holding you back from trying to drive new leases even higher to the extent that you're still getting traffic and sort of keeping occupancy fairly elevated relative to historic levels.
Keith Oden: I think you have to start with the places where we are constrained from getting market rate increases and that would be D.C. proper, still certain parts of California. And those are meaningful numbers. And Washington D.C. which includes the D.C. proper assets Loudoun County where we are -- we still are not able to push through what the market rate increases are. Our total rents in Washington D.C. for the quarter were 5.3% against a portfolio-wide average of something north of 11%. So -- it's 17% plus or minus of our NOI. So it's -- that's a big part of the story is that, as other places kind of moderate from 20% to 16%, you still have Washington and in parts of California where we're getting no rental increases or CPI-type rental increases. So it's -- I mean I think that's the biggest part of the story. In terms of -- we certainly believe that if we were unconstrained in Washington D.C. and we know just mathematically if you -- we haven't had anything close to a reset of rental rates in D.C. proper and Loudoun County because we haven't been able to raise rent. So I think it will happen and I think it's likely to happen. I mean I hope that we get out of the constraints of regulatory regimes that don't allow rental increases just by sort of fiat or a local order by the end of this year and we certainly expect to. And I do believe that just the way things are trending right now, that we will be coming out of the constraints even though when you come out of the constraints, there's still going to be a period of time where we have to work through the process of actually getting control of our real estate on the folks that are still not paying or choose not to pay. So -- but I think it's -- I think we feel like we're in a really good position, given the uncapped rental increases that we're going to get to at some point. And I just -- I certainly hope it's by the end of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. No I appreciate that perspective. And so how much of the loss to lease bucket is from markets where you're constrained? And then I'm also curious how much across the portfolio market rents have increased year-to-date?
Alex Jessett : Yes. So if you think about market rents and sort of increasing on a year-to-date basis, on a full year for 2022, we think it's going to be up right around 4%. And so you can probably sort of extrapolate that back to what we're seeing in the first quarter. On loss to lease, I think the way that, Keith sort of laid it out is probably the best way to think about it, which is you've got D.C. and California, which make up 23% plus or minus of our total portfolio. And that amount is going to have a much larger loss lease calculation. And you can probably take that loss to lease. It's almost sort of hard to understand exactly what it is right? Because you don't understand what the true market rate is because there's so much to discover. So I think as we sort of move through the legislative challenges that we have and then we're able to establish what real market is we're going to have a much better idea of what the true loss to lease is. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Right. Right. So presumably market wages have moved much more than probably market rents over that three-year period that you were talking about earlier in the call.
Alex Jessett : Absolutely. 
Austin Wurschmidt: So, Alex, yes, with respect to guidance and more specifically the assumptions underlying same-store revenue growth. Are you guys targeting lower occupancy in the revenue management systems to get you back to that back at/or below the 96.6%, I think, you're assuming for the full year? And then I'm also curious what you're implying for lease rates in the back half of the year?
Alex Jessett : Yes. So we set our settings. I mean, it's really interesting, because the higher you set your occupancy settings, the higher rate drives the rental rates, right? And you're trying to get to that sort of sweet point where the occupancy setting is high enough that you ultimately max out on your rental rates. And what we've seen is that no matter how high we set, we continue to have just really tremendous demand. And that's why you're seeing that type of new lease and renewal increases that you're having. So it's not a matter that we're sitting here and saying, we want to be at 96.6%. We do believe that and we do have perhaps some conservatism built into our numbers that the occupancy levels that we've experienced over the past really four or five quarters can't continue. And so that's what you've got baked in. And then if you sort of think about what are we assuming in terms of blended rental rates on a go-forward basis, as I told you, we're assuming that we're averaging at 10% for the full year. So if you look at the first quarter that's right around 15%. If you look at the second quarter we're at call it 14.5% already so that would imply that we're assuming that we get down to sort of a 7% number for the third quarter and maybe a 4% number for the fourth quarter.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. I missed that 10% number so thank you for that. And then what is the -- is the 30- to 60-day availability when you look out is that elevated versus prior periods or tracking similarly? Kind of known move-outs plus current vacancy.
Alex Jessett : Yes. We continue to have very low turnover. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street. You may now go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks for keeping the call going. Ric just one question on the Texas Teachers trade. You mentioned the valuation was done at the end of the year in December. Was there any impact or any repricing of the portfolio due to higher interest rates?
Ric Campo: Well we did -- we did have the appraisal -- formal appraisal where we mark-to-market at the end of the year. But then at the first quarter, we also then adjusted that for what we thought the current market was. And that's -- at that point we -- is where we sort of came to struck the price. So there was an adjustment from the appraised number in December and we ended up with having -- not having a big discussion about what those prices were since we had sort of two sort of basis that we used in December 1 and then another valuation kind of metric in probably at the end of February early March.
Keith Oden: There was no adjustment to purchase price for...
Ric Campo: No there's adjustments on interest rates now.
Keith Oden: No it was stuck before the meaningful move in interest rates.
John Pawlowski: Okay. I guess the cap rate...
Ric Campo: I don't think -- go ahead. Sorry.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Yeah. No, I'm sorry I cut you off there. I guess the cap rate above 4% kind of surprised us on the high side. Could you just talk about how many other bidders were in the tent and how broadly this is marketed?
Ric Campo: You're talking about the Texas Teachers transaction?
John Pawlowski: Yes. 
Ric Campo: There are no other bidders in the tent. It was a direct negotiation between the partners of the JV which was Camden and Texas Teachers. And so when you look at the cap rates on it, at the end of the day I think it just became evident to Texas Teachers at least from their perspective that they wanted to trade based on valuations and the value that we -- the value calculation that we did after the original appraisal values in December were substantially higher than the price values in December. So I think they just thought it was when they looked at everything overall the efficiency of the transaction from their perspective and our perspective was really, really good because had we gone out and bid it into the market, clearly we wouldn't have been able to do the transaction. From start to finish it was a four week transaction. And if you try to bid a 7,200 unit portfolio 22 properties in multiple markets that's a 120-day gig. And so I think Teachers was very interested in getting the deal done as soon as possible as we were. And it was sort of -- we both looked at it as a moment in time and we got to what we thought was fair value even though you never know what values will be clearly when you bid and we were happy about not having to bid it.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you for the color.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to CEO Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Great. Well, thanks for being with us today. And we'll see you guys in NAREIT in a couple of -- in few weeks, right? That's the first in-person NAREIT in June. So thanks a lot and take care. Bye.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-04 11:00:00) =====
Kim Callahan: Good morning, and welcome to Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman and President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. If you haven't logged in yet, you can do so now through the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com. [Operator Instructions] And please note, this event is being recorded. Today's webcast will be available for replay this afternoon, and we are happy to share copies of our slides upon request. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2021 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. We hope to complete our call within one hour. [Operator Instructions].  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Good morning. The opening ceremony for the 2022 Winter Olympics are today. And as you could tell from our on-hold music and slide show, team Camden has embraced the Olympic Spirit. The Olympic theme set me down memory lane and into Camden's archive for the video I'm going to show you today. During the 2012 Summer Olympics, the U.S. women's swim team made a video using a very popular song titled Call Me Maybe. At Camden, we are proud to be a friendly and welcoming workplace. One unique way we showed this is by greeting teammates with a hug instead of a handshake. Camden employees probably give and receive more hugs per day than any other workplace in America. So if you combine our hugging culture with the Olympic spirit, a Call Me Maybe video becomes a Hug Me Maybe video. And following the 2012 Olympics this happened at our corporate office. [Audio-Visual Presentation] One of the many adjustments in Camden's world caused by social distancing during the pandemic was replacing actual hugs with virtual hubs. Since Camden is a fully vaccinated workplace, we have recently seen an uptick in breakthrough cases of actual hugging in our workplace. We all look forward to the day when all virtual hubs at Camden will become actual hubs. 2021 turned out to be a remarkable year, and we clearly exceeded our original guidance that we provided at this time last year.  Our 2021 budget call for FFO of $5 per share, with same property revenues up slightly and net operating income down approximately 1%. As reported last night, we closed 2021 with FFO of $5. 39 per share and same-property growth of 4.3% and 4.8% for revenues and net operating income, respectively. We expect 2022 to be our best year on record for earnings and same-property growth. The midpoint of our 2022 guidance calls for FFO per share of $6.24. With same-property revenue growth of $8.75 and net operating income growth of 12%. Our geographically and product diverse portfolio in the Sunbelt markets continue to outperform. I want to thank each of our Camden team members for their hard work and commitment to our values and for improving the lives of our team members and our customers' one experience at a time. 2021 was a great year, but the best is yet to come. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. We have a tradition of assigning letter grades to forecast conditions in our markets at the beginning of every year. I'll start with a review of the supply and demand conditions we expect to encounter in Camden's markets during 2022 and ranked the markets in the order of best to worst. For the first time in 10 years, Camden's overall portfolio earned an A with a stable outlook and no market received a grade below A minus. In addition, we are now providing this report card to you as part of our earnings call slide deck which is showing now and will be posted on our website after today's call. We anticipate overall same-property revenue growth this year in the range of 7.75% to 9.75% for our entire portfolio, with most of our markets falling within that range. The outliers on the positive side would be Phoenix and our Florida markets, which should produce double-digit revenue growth, then Houston and D.C., which will likely lag the overall portfolio average but still show significant improvement versus 2021.  Our outlook for supply and demand in 2022 is based on multiple third-party economic forecasts that generally reflects strong job growth in Camden's markets, coupled with a steady amount of new supply. Estimates range from 1 million to 1.2 million new jobs created in our 15 major markets in 2022, along with 150,000 to 200,000 new completions. So our outlook reflects somewhere around the midpoint of both projections. It is likely no surprise that for 2022, our top ranking once again goes to Phoenix, which has averaged 7% revenue growth over the past three years and has an expected revenue growth well above 10% this year. We give this market an A+ rating with a stable outlook. Supply and demand metrics for 2022 look well balanced with estimates calling for 80,000 new jobs in Phoenix and 18,000 new units coming online this year. Up next are our three Florida markets: Southeast Florida, Tampa and Orlando. Each also earned A+ ratings with stable outlooks. These three markets should achieve revenue growth of over 10% in 2022 and are projected to have strong job growth to offset new supply coming online. Current estimates for job growth were approximately 50,000 in both Southeast Florida and Tampa and 60, 000 in Orlando. Completions are expected to be 10,000, 6,000 and 9,000 units, respectively.  Our next eight markets all earned an A rating with a stable outlook and should produce revenue growth generally within our guidance range of 3.75% to 9.75% in 2022. Atlanta, Austin and Raleigh should achieve revenue growth toward the high end of our guidance range in 2022. In Atlanta, job growth is expected to be 90,000 with around 10,000 new apartment completions.  In Austin, projections call for 50,000 additional jobs with completions of roughly 18,000 units. And in Raleigh, the jobs to completions ratio should be 5x with 35,000 new jobs versus 7,000 new apartment completions San Diego, Inland Empire and Charlotte are next falling around the middle of the pack in Camden's portfolio. For the San Diego Inland Empire market, we expect to see over 100,000 new jobs in 2022 with new supply around 8,000 units. Charlotte should also deliver 8,000 units with 40,000 new jobs created, providing a good balance of supply and demand in that market. Nashville is Camden's newest market as we acquired two communities there last summer. While Nashville will not be included in our 2022 same-property pool, we would rate the city as an A with a stable outlook. There has been a significant amount of construction in Nashville, and that will continue in 2022, with approximately 10,000 new units expected to deliver this year. However, demand for apartment homes has remained strong in Nashville with positive end migration trends and projections for over 40,000 new jobs. Dallas and Denver are both solid markets, and we expect market conditions to be favorable again in 2022. Supply-demand ratios in Dallas and Denver remained steady with 95,000 and 55,000 new jobs anticipated, respectively, during 2022, with supply at 15,000 and 10,000 new units, respectively, scheduled for delivery this year. L.A., Orange County in Houston are the last two markets earning an A rating, but both have improving outlooks.  Our portfolio in LA County saw higher delinquencies and bad debt in 2021 than our other markets, but we are hopeful that conditions will improve in 2022 as COVID restrictions begin to ease and regulatory issues around evictions are reduced. L.A., Orange County faces healthy operating conditions with favorable supply and demand metrics. Job growth should be around 150,000 with completions of 16,000 expected in 2022. In Houston, conditions began to improve in 2021 after the market has struggled with many new lease-ups giving high levels of concessions. New supply is expected to ease in 2022 to around 17,000 units and job growth should remain strong with around 75,000 new jobs expected. Our final market is D.C. Metro, which we gave an A minus but with an improving outlook. Supply remains steady with over 13,000 new units coming on this year, but job growth should be healthy as well with 80,000 new jobs expected. Similar to L.A., Orange County, Washington, D.C. has been a challenging market given the COVID environment and the many restrictions that were put in place as a result of the pandemic. While we are optimistic that 2022 will reflect an improved operating environment there, we have budgeted low to mid-single-digit revenue growth for D.C. Metro this year. Now a few details on our fourth quarter '21 operating results in January 2022 trends. Same-property revenue growth was 8.5% for the fourth quarter and 4.3% for full year 2021. Our top performers for the fourth quarter all had over 10% revenue growth and included Tampa, Phoenix, Southern California, Raleigh and Southeast Florida. Rental rates for the fourth quarter had signed new leases up 16.7%, renewals up 14.1% for a blended rate of 15.5%. Our preliminary January results indicate similar trends with blended growth of over 15% on signed leases. February and March renewal offers were sent out with an average increase in the mid-14% range. Occupancy averaged 97.1% during the fourth quarter and compared to 97.3% last quarter and 95. 5% in the fourth quarter of '20. January 2022 occupancy has averaged 97.2% compared to 95.7% in January of last year, and is slightly up from our fourth quarter '21 levels. Annual net turnover for 2021 was in line with 2020 at 41%. And move-outs to home purchases were 15.8% for the quarter and 16.4% for the full year of 2021, relatively in line with our reported 15.8% for full year 2020. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett : Thank, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we purchased Camden Greenville, a recently constructed 558-unit mid-rise community in Dallas. And we purchased five acres of land in Denver and two acres of land in Nashville for future development purposes.  For the full year of 2021, we have completed acquisitions of four communities with 1,684 apartment homes for a total cost of approximately $633 million, ahead of our original 2021 acquisition guidance of $450 million and we acquired four undeveloped land parcels for a total cost of approximately $72 million. Additionally, during the quarter, we disposed of two operating communities in Houston, and one operating community in Laurel, Maryland for total proceeds of approximately $260 million. These three dispositions were on average 21 years old, with average monthly rents of $1,350 per door and annual CapEx of approximately $2,300 per door. Using actual CapEx, these dispositions were completed at a 3.9% AFFO yield, generating a 10.5% unleveraged IRR over a 20-year hold period. Based on a broker cap rate, which assumes $350 per door in CapEx and a 3% management fee on trailing 12-month NOI, the cap rate would have been 4.3%.  And finally, during the quarter, we stabilized ahead of schedule Camden North End 2, a 343 unit, $79 million new development in Phoenix, generating an approximate 8.75% yield. And we completed construction on Camden Hillcrest, an $89 million new development in San Diego. On the financing side, during the quarter, we issued approximately $180 million of shares under our existing ATM program.  Moving on to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $160.2 million or $1.51 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.02 per share. This outperformance resulted primarily from higher levels of occupancy and rental rates at our non-same-store acquisition and development communities and lower taxes and utilities at our same-store communities. For 2021, we delivered full year same-store revenue growth of 4.3%, expense growth of 3.5% and NOI growth of 4. 8% as compared to our original 2021 same-store guidance of 0.75% for revenue, 3.5% for expenses and negative 0.85% for NOI. You can refer to Page 27 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2022 financial outlook. We expect our 2022 FFO per share to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.39 and with a midpoint of $6.24, representing a $0.85 per share increase from our 2021 results. This increase is anticipated to result primarily from an approximate $0.79 per share increase in FFO related to the performance of our same-store portfolio.  At the midpoint, we are expecting same-store net operating income growth of 12%, driven by revenue growth of 8.75% and expense growth of 3%. Each 1% increase in same-store NOI is approximately $0.065 per share in FFO. An approximate $0.35 per share increase in FFO related to the growth in operating income from our non-same-store joint venture and retail communities, resulting primarily from higher rental rates, lower bad debt and the incremental contribution of our 4 acquisitions completed in 2021 and our 9 development communities in lease-up during either 2021 and/or 2022. And an approximate $0.07 per share increase in FFO due to an assumed $600 million of pro forma acquisitions spread throughout the year at an initial yield of 3. 5%. This $1.21 cumulative increase in anticipated FFO per share is partially offset by an approximate $0.11 per share decrease in FFO from our completed 2021 dispositions, an approximate $0.04 per share decrease in FFO from an assumed $250 million of pro forma dispositions anticipated to primarily occur late 2022, an approximate $0.03 per share decrease in FFO, resulting primarily from the combination of lower interest income from lower cash balances higher franchise and margin taxes and higher corporate depreciation and amortization.  Our combined general and administrative, property management and fee and asset management expenses are anticipated to be effectively flat year-over-year and an approximate $0.18 per share decrease in FFO due to the additional shares outstanding for full year 2022, following our 2021 ATM activity. Our revenue growth midpoint of 8.75% is based upon an anticipated 11% average increase in new leases and a 7% average increase in renewals. We are also anticipating that occupancy will moderate slightly to 96.5%. Page 27 of our supplemental package also details other assumptions for 2022, including the plan for $400 million to $600 million of on-balance sheet development starts spread throughout the year with approximately $315 million of annual development spend. We expect FFO per share for the first quarter of 2022 to be within the range of $1.45 to $1.49. The midpoint of $1.47 represents a $0.04 per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021, which is primarily the result of an approximate $0.02 per share decrease in FFO, resulting from our fourth quarter 2021 dispositions; an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in sequential same-store net operating income, resulting primarily from the reset of our annual property tax accrual on January 1 of each year and other expense increases, primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends, including the timing of on-site salary increases. And an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO due to the additional shares outstanding from our fourth quarter 2021 ATM activity.  Our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.8x and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 6.4x. As of today, we have approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $500 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding under our $900 million unsecured credit facility. At quarter end, we had $199 million left to spend over the next two years under our existing development pipeline, and we have no scheduled debt maturities until late 2022. Our current excess cash is invested with various banks, earning approximately 15 basis points.  At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. 
Haendel Juste: Hey, good morning. Appreciate all the market color and all the detail. I had a question more so on the -- I guess we're starting to see a bit of a divergence here in the new lease rates and renewals. The new lease rates continue to accelerate renewals slowing a bit. How do we think about that relationship near term?  I expect new lease rates to come under more pressure as we face tougher comps, but I guess I'm curious also which markets are you seeing the best and weakest pricing power on renewals? What's causing the drag? Thanks.
Ric Campo: Yes. So Haendel the gap between new leases and renewal rates is something that moves around quite a bit, primarily because of what we do on renewal rates. From time to time, depending on what's going on in our market or a submarket, we might put in place renewal caps. And which is not something we would ever do on new lease rates, not in this environment. So it's going to move around a little bit depending on kind of what -- it's literally our pricing team, looking at the trends day to day and making recommendations.  I think in the first quarter, we had a couple of markets that we had renewal caps in place. But I mean, you're talking about renewal caps on what might have done as much as a 20-plus percent renewal rates being capped at 18%, and that would have been in some place like Tampa, St. Petersburg. But it's not unusual for that to move around.  I would expect to see that over the course of the year, you probably will see a narrowing in that. But I think our guidance, as Alex pointed out, has new leases at 11% over the course of the year and renewals at 7%. So not too far off of where we are right now. But it's clearly, it's absolutely part of the art and science of revenue management and -- it's just our revenue team looking at current trends and making recommendations.
Haendel Juste: Got it. So no particular market of note on the renewal side that you're seeing a more meaningful difference in a form?
Ric Campo: No. And I would say when we talk about less strength, I mean, I think that's the overriding message of this entire of all the data sets that we sent out last night. I mean, you're talking about pretty uncertain levels of both new lease and renewal rates across all of our markets. And we had 12 of our 14 markets with double digit NOI growth in the fourth quarter. And that trend is continued over in the first quarter.  So, somebody always has to be at the bottom. And right now Washington DC is at the bottom. And some of that is just the drag from the DC Metro properties where we are really precluded from finding a market clearing rate for the communities that when the apartments that we have there, but overall these are I think the lowest grade that we gave was an A minus and that was Washington DC. And so it's this is the first time we've ever had that happen in our portfolio. Obviously a lot of strength out there. 
Haendel Juste: Yes, yes, very well noted. Actually, your comments lead me to my second question, which is, I guess your longer term views on your Houston and DC portfolio exposures here, both markets haven't exactly been the response although they're improving at least the outlook for this year. I guess I'm curious on your exposures here, your two largest markets, you're increasing exposure to other smaller Sunbelt markets. You sold a few assets in Houston this past quarter.  So I guess how do we think about your exposure over the next few years and you must become close to the fund for your expansion into some of these other smaller, higher-growth Sunbelt markets? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Well, Haendel, that's exactly what our strategy has been. We talked about it on the call last time, which was we were going to use this environment to sell down Houston and D.C. and then expand our portfolio and to increase the exposure in some of the markets that we're underweighted in. Ultimately, that's our strategy. It's going to take us a few years to get there, but it makes a lot of sense.  I mean clearly, geographic diversification and primarily being in the Sunbelt has definitely helped us a lot. And I think, ultimately, as we do that sort of portfolio redistribution over the next couple of years, it will help us do more geographically diverge. If you look at the last cycle in terms of how much we bought and sold, I mean, we really transformed the portfolio from 2010 through about the fourth -- to the pandemic. And we sold on average, 26-year-old assets and redistributed that cash flow sold out in Las Vegas.  So we did a lot of portfolio management then when the numbers that was really if you look at how many sales we did relative to our total asset base in 2010, we redistributed 44% of our NOI around the country as a result of those transactions, where we sold assets, nearly $3 billion that bought properties and then we also developed properties.  And so we'll continue that. I think this environment gives us the opportunity to do it on a very, very low spread basis where we're not giving up a lot of cash flow given the amazing market that people want to buy. Those are properties they sort of -- that's kind of the hottest spot in the market right now, even though all it's very cost for sure.
Haendel Juste: Got it. That's helpful. Is there any pricing difference or noticing any significant demand difference in selling, say, Houston assets versus D.C. given some of the challenges you noted earlier?
Alex Jessett: Early on, there was sort of a pricing differential in Houston relative to other markets and D.C. a bit, but that is vanished because from wallet capital -- when you look at what's happened, I mean, in 2021, there was roughly 300 -- almost $350 billion in multifamily transactions. And just to put it in perspective, the gateway markets, the sales were up 8% from the prior year. And in non-gateway markets, they were up 96%.  So all the non-gateway markets is where the capital went. So for us, when we started talking, I think last year, when we talked about the selling down and redistributing these assets talked about perhaps having the 100 to 125 basis point negative spread on the cap rate, and that's narrowed to under 50%.  The massive bid for those properties. And there is no discount today in Houston or in D.C. And I think the other part of that equation is when you think about Houston, Houston added 154,000 jobs this year. It's going to add 75,000 jobs next year. 2022 is the year where energy companies are actually hiring, and that has to do with $90 oil.  Some people are thinking that oil is going to go to over 100. But -- so the bottom line is that while Houston has not added all of its jobs back from the pre-pandemic level and all of the other cities in Texas have Houston has gas in its tank. And it is our lower -- the Houston and D.C., while there's a lower growth cities today, they still have the ability to -- they have gas in their tank because they haven't been able to we haven't pushed them as far as other cities.  And then D.C., as Keith mentioned, in our district -- in the district, we have some really significant assets we cannot raise renewal rates. So you just have to renew it at the original number. And we have a lit the market there, and that's what's driving sort of DC to be at the bottom of our growth.  But even when you look at Houston number, we're -- in a normal year, I'm ensuring Houston, but the problem is you've got the markets like Tampa and Phoenix are just out of control good. And so the slowness of Houston makes you feel like it's dragging on because I mean it is on a fundamental basis, but it's still really good, well above trend for Houston. And I think we have the benefit of more growth there when other markets perhaps start slowing in the future.
Haendel Juste: Great. That’s fantastic color. Appreciate the time. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Thank you. Can you touch on the 2022 expense environment kind of baked into guidance really in regards to taxes and payroll pressures, it generally seems to be a favorable setup but any additional color on possible tax rate increases or expectations given that the expenses seem to remain largely in check?
Ric Campo: No, absolutely. So we are anticipating that property taxes are going to be up about 3.3% in 2022. A large component of that is some significant property tax refunds that we've already settled the cases and so it's just a matter of receiving the check. To give you an idea, our total property tax refunds in 2021 was about $2.2 million, and we're expecting about $3.1 million of refunds in 2022. So that's one of the primary drivers of the property tax number being relatively mild at 3.3%.  The other thing I'll point out is that rates in Texas, so both Houston, Austin and Dallas, rates came in much lower than we had originally expected for 2021, and I think that bodes very, very well for 2022.  If you think about the -- sort of the rest of our expense categories. We continue to do a really good job of controlling and being more efficient with our marketing spend. A lot of that is driven by the technological advancements that I've talked about in prior quarters. And we're seeing the same thing on the salary side. If you think about the technological advancements that we've talked about, including installation of smart access for all entrance ways, which not only improves the customer experience, it also provides efficiencies for our maintenance teams and then most importantly, facilitate self-guided tours.  And then we're also improving our sales process through our funnel implementation which is our sophisticated customer relationship management tool and then also marketing and automation platform. When you put all of that in place and then we're also working on AI that all helps to sort of counter some of the inflationary expense controls in 2022 and beyond. So that's really the primary driver, and that's why we feel pretty good about the 3% number.
Derek Johnston: No, that's very helpful. So yes, in this quarter and last year, the land acquisitions certainly show a commitment to develop even a mid-rise n construction material labor costs. So, are rising rents encouraging enough to further ramp development now? I mean, what yields would you expect on any new starts? Or what yields would you need to make a project to go especially when you look at apartment cap rates for acquisitions, especially the new stuff you like, are so tight down in the mid- to high 3s. What development yield kind of makes a project to go? And what's the minimum or what's the tipping point?
Kim Callahan: Ric, you are on mute.
Ric Campo: Development deals are -- what we look at is our unlevered IRR over a 7-year period. And when you look at -- so you can talk about it from that perspective. And clearly, the good news is that rental rates have risen faster than construction costs, at least in the cycle, which is pretty amazing.  Just to give you some data points, the 600-plus -- if you take the $600 million we have under construction plus the $200 million that we've already finalized, we have cap rates. Our initial yields on stabilization have actually gone up because of the rising interest rates or the rise in rental rates to roughly 6% sort of going to yield.  When you look at our pipeline that we have, which is roughly another $1 billion, $1.5 billion, something like that. Most of the sort of average that we're looking at those are going to be in the 5s, low 5s probably. And we haven't really updated the numbers on both cost or the rents in those pro formas. So when you look at cap rates in the low 3s and existing yields in the 5, clearly, a development is a preferred option when you think about risk reward and the returns that we're making.  We have pressed our development of people to try to expand the pipeline. And if you look this year, we're in a -- our midpoint of $0.5 billion to starts, which will take our pipeline back up to a little over $1 billion or at least our construction progress up to $1 billion. It's a really good business right now. And one of the challenges, obviously, is the forward-looking start numbers and those are also peaking. So we're long-term holders, obviously.  So we can work through those cycles. And I think it’s hard -- if you ask me, could we double our pipeline and go from $1 billion to $2 billion, really hard to do. And just to give you -- I mean and just what it takes to get a development done. But we're we usually do $300 million a year, and we'll do $500 million this year and hopefully, maybe something like that next year. So at the margins, we're comfortable in that $1 billion, $2 billion range.
Derek Johnston: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. What's the current loss to lease for the portfolio? And then for the 11% increase assumed on new leases. How does that look in the first half of the year versus your expectations in the back half of the year?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So if you look at current loss to lease and there's -- as we've talked about in the past, because of dynamic pricing, there's lots of different ways you can sort of slice this number. If you look at all of the new leases that we signed in December and you compare those to the effective leases in place, that would put loss to lease sort of in the 10% to 11% range right now. So that's sort of where we are.  If you think about the way we are anticipating 2022 to sort of roll out, we're anticipating continued very strong numbers and obviously in the first quarter and then second quarter and third quarter, we get into sort of our peak periods. But we are expecting seasonality to start kicking in towards the latter part of the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So you'd start to see start to see a lot of that coming back down.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on rental assistance, I think you had $5.3 million in the third quarter. What was that number in the fourth quarter? And then what is assumed in 2022 guidance?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So the $5.3 million in the third quarter, that was a total. On a same-store basis, for the third quarter, it was $4.2 million. That did increase to $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of '21. So that gave us, for a same-store basis, about $12.5 million for 2021. And what we've got in our assumptions today is that we're going to recognize about half of that amount in 2022.
Nick Joseph: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Hey everyone. Alex, just as a follow-on to that last question about new lease growth. You have the 15% plus number in January, and it seems like you can probably sustain double digits through the second quarter before the comps get really tough. But just to hit the averages that you talk about, it seems like it will be some sort of low mid-single-digit number in the second half of the year to hit the averages. So is that the right way to think about it? And is that kind of what we should think about as your expectation for market rent growth from where we are right now?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. I think that's probably a pretty good way of thinking about it. If you sort of look at December of 2021 to December 2022 and what do we think market rent growth is going to be over that period, we think it's sort of in the call it, the 4% to 5% range. And then you've obviously got the loss to lease that we're going to be able to recognize partially throughout the rest of the year.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then on the balance sheet, obviously, this quarter, you ticked below the bottom end of your typical 4 to 5x range. I'm curious for funding needs beyond the dispositions in '22. Should we expect that those will come from debt? Or do you have a desire to keep the balance sheet maybe cleaner than it would normally be just given the place in the cycle?
Ric Campo: Well, we've always have a stated view that we should have our debt-to-EBITDA in the 4% to 5% range. We're obviously below that as a result of the equity issuance, but we also have a net acquisitions or net-net investment when we take acquisitions minus dispositions plus development spend. So we'll be execute all that, and we'll get that debt to EBITDA back into the middle part of the equation.  But today, it's an interesting time when you look at the ability to put permanent capital on the books with -- and then deploy that capital into what's very frothy acquisition market, but I've never seen our AFFO yield under 3% on our stock price generally in my business career. So I think we have a green light to use every source of capital, and we will continue to be in that band. And when it's opportunistic for us to issue equity, we will, when it's opportunistic to issue debt we will, but we'll stay in that band generally.
Brad Heffern: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Thanks. Good morning everyone. First question, a little bit bigger picture. So you guys have a unique insight into sort of the divergence between Sunbelt and Coastal to some extent, you have the DC and then obviously Southern California. And I'm wondering, I've heard kind of mixed things between people have elevated coastal exposure kind of being incrementally positive and seeing people return to the office or whenever that happens, maybe in 2025 expecting solid growth and sort of almost like a return to normal in a California market kind of like a pre-co-type of thing.  But at the same time, you're seeing amazing historic levels of in-migration to your Sunbelt markets and just very strong growth as evidenced by where you are relative to pre COVID rent levels. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of give your view on over the next, call it, 3 years, what you see in terms of job growth, population growth migration, in the Sunbelt versus kind of what you're seeing in California? And if you just think California may be a little bit impaired just given this significant outflow of businesses and people. Thanks.
Alex Jessett : Yes. So we do have a little bit of a unique perspective because we've operated in [indiscernible] in the Sunbelt markets for many years now. And I think -- I mean, our general plan that the patterns of migration from coastal markets, in particular, California, the Northeast, into the Sunbelt markets that was already in place pre-COVID, thoroughly accelerated during COVID.  And -- but our view is that when COVID when it all settles back down to a more normal pattern, you're still going to be left with the normal with the pre-COVID trends of migration to the Sunbelt for reasons that really don't have anything to do with COVID inexperience, although that clearly was an accelerator.  But interestingly enough, in California for 2022 based on our game plan, California is really not going to be a drag on the portfolio in 2022. So the job growth that's happening in L.A. County versus the number of new starts there, puts that particular market in a really good place. Clearly, the difference in -- and you still have -- we still have some kind of fighting the regulatory construct in California. But we do anticipate that, that will improve in 2022. So I think we are going to get some relief.  In D.C., our issue in D.C. relative to the balance of the portfolio, as Ric mentioned, is more a DC proper experience for us. The metro -- there are a couple of outliers in the D.C. metro suburban markets where there's still some regulatory constructs in place, but they're minor in the overall scheme of things.  So I think that both of those markets post-COVID, post regulatory constructs are still going to be going through the reset in rents that the rest of America has already -- a lot of America is already in the midst of. I don't think they're going to get passed over in the sense of that we're going to come out of this and look back two years from now, and there was a reset that didn't include the last 10% up in both California and D.C. in the D.C. metro market. It's just going to come in a different timing.  And as Ric mentioned, mean it kind of bodes well for us as we roll through 2022 to have 2 of our larger markets. And then I throw Houston in that basket as well because we clearly haven't gotten -- we're not going to get the reset all at the same time as we got in our other markets in Houston. So 3 of our largest markets that are kind of going through the reset in a different phase than the others. But in our view fundamentally hasn't changed about the investment thesis for why we're in California and why we're where we are in California, which is primarily Southern, which is exclusively Southern California and the D.C. metro market, I think, is due for a nice recovery post-COVID.
Neil Malkin: I appreciate the color. And then maybe just again on just thinking about the acquisition side. I mean, obviously, putting a lot of capital to work. And that's great. I'm just curious to see if your underwriting standards have changed, your unlevered IRR targets have changed. I understand that your cost of capital is at historic levels. But it's just buying at a 3 cap and you're kind of uncertain about what the terminal or exit cap rate would be. And -- so just when you're having those internal discussions, I mean, has anything changed?  Or have you gotten more bullish on your like sort of year 1 through three rent growth assumptions that make you comfortable going in at a low to mid-3 cap. And Yes. So if you could just maybe expand upon that. And if you'd use debt more so to get an even higher positive leverage this year? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Well, I think the -- clearly, our cost of capital has gone down, and we do adjust our current rates based on our cost of capital. And it's just a simple model, right? It's equity, your equity cost plus your debt cost and the weighted average cost of capital and you compare that to your unlevered IRR. So a couple of points, one being the exit cap rate, and that's always a very tricky number, right, which is what do you use and that can be all of the math. We generally try to move that up from our initial acquisition number by 25 to 50 number like that. But that's obviously a crapshoot.  What our cap rates and price is going to be in 7 years, right? So -- which is our model period. In terms of going in yields, though, when we -- underwriting today, I mean if you go in and we buy a property today in Phoenix, for example, or only using an example where we actually bought 1 like in Nashville. So in our original national underwriting in the 2 properties we bought last year, we had moderate growth, and we bought those in May.  So we didn't have this big wave that sort of happened, and we know it's good markets. And we knew that rents were starting to move up, but we didn't think we didn't realize they're going to move up as part fast as they did. So all of our acquisitions last year are outperforming by a substantial margin of what we thought that we may be doing.  We put in moderate growth through 2021 and forward. And today, our underwriting is a little different because it just depends on where the rent role is, but we definitely are increasing rents at a faster pace in the first 12 months of the acquisition today. And then we start backing off of that in 2023.  As we saw the product we have better-than-average growth in 2022 for obvious reasons, better average growth in 2023. And then we start moderating it to long-term historical numbers. And we use somewhere around 3%, 3.5%, depending on where it is. And after that, the numbers were -- the numbers generally still work pretty well even when you're going at these low numbers because a low cap rate is because of the outsized growth in to get in 2022 and 2023. So we're comfortable that we're making good spreads over our long-term weighted average cost of capital and not underwriting so much that we have to have prices go up or cash flows go up dramatically to make those numbers work.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. Thank you guys and nice quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning down there. So a few questions here. First, looking at this year and the rent growth, how much of the rent growth are you getting this year from the burn off of free rent from last year? I'm guessing probably very few of your markets really had material free rent, but maybe D.C. or Southern Cal. Just sort of curious how much of this year's rent growth is coming from just the exploration of free rent in last year's numbers?
Ric Campo: So we don't offer concessions. And so that's not a factor for us.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Okay. So then I think it was to handheld's question or Nick's question. The 4% to 5% market rent growth that you're expecting, that's on top of the mark-to-market. So basically, it's all face value on face value rent?
Ric Campo: Correct.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Cool. Second question is on markets. You guys just entered Nashville but 2 other markets that would seem to jump out and be naturals would be Salt Lake and San Antonio. So as you guys look on recycling capital from Houston and from D.C., how -- what's the appetite for entering additional new markets?
Ric Campo: Well, we clearly like the markets we're in. Otherwise, we'd be there. I think today, entering a new market, when we entered Nashville, we did in a pretty big way and we did it early on a relative basis the big run-up in pricing a run-up in rents and that was good. Those markets are interesting markets long term. San Antonio has always been kind of an unusual market. We were close to it in Texas we see it and we generally have kind of not done to San Antonio because of the depth of the employment market there.  AT&T moved there at headquarters. They have a couple of really good things going on. But we just kind of stayed out of San Antonio because we didn't like the patient the job market there on an ongoing basis. Salt Lake, we've looked out, we looked at other markets, such smaller markets like Voice and Charleston. And we just think that our markets today are -- we've got enough to say grace over, and we have enough under-representative markets where we don't really need to get into other markets.  That being said, we did enter Nashville and there's clearly -- we follow these markets and try to decide whether we're going to allocate capital there. But we have enough places to allocate capital without going to new markets right now.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Good morning. I wanted to follow up on your update of loss to lease, which Alex mentioned is 10% to 11% now versus 16% just a few months ago. But it's only 20% to 25% of your leases rolled in the fourth quarter, and all of those went directly to market, which I think those are pretty aggressive assumptions. Shouldn't that figure be at least 12%, maybe as high as 12.8% versus the 10 to 11?
Alex Jessett: Yes. And that's why I was trying to make a differentiation between if you think about the dynamic pricing, right? So our pricing is changing every single day. And if you take a sort of a snapshot at the end of the quarter, right? And you say, this is our asking price as compared to our effective rents and you're going to come up with a different number. What I was telling you is that if you actually look at the leases that we signed during the month of December and you compare those to the effective rents. That's where you're going to come up with sort of this 10% to 11% level.  So it's 2 different ways of looking at it. If you just look at it based upon the pure asking rents, yes, there's going to be about a 13% number, right? But as we know with dynamic pricing, that there is a typical or there is a tendency, whereas pricing is sort of ticking along and then it will drop and then we sign a good amount of our leases at that little drop and then it'll go back up and so really two different ways to look at loss to lease, I think that the sort of 10% to 11% is probably a better way to look at it in an environment like this.  In a typical environment where you're sort of talking about a 3% to 4% loss of lease is not as dramatic. But clearly, when we're here with unprecedented new lease and renewal increases, I think it's important that you look at it both ways.
John Kim: Okay. I get that. But at the same time, the market rents for your markets probably didn't see that much seasonality, I'm guessing. So I would have thought that would have been a further support from that number being higher?
Alex Jessett: We certainly did see some seasonality, and you can see that if you look at the effective versus the sign. So we did see some seasonality, particularly in the month of December. But yes, so that's the math, and that's how our numbers are working out.
Ric Campo: The seasonality we had this year was interesting because usually, you're dropping rents pretty dramatically from the third -- second quarter, third quarter or what happened here is we had a slight decrease in the slight negative second derivative, but still a very robust number that you -- if you go back probably 10 years, you wouldn't see the number they -- the amount of rental increases that we're getting in that fourth quarter and just wouldn't see it like that. Because the seasonality this year was where it was like a really slow and not dramatic at all in any major market, which is usually not the case.  What's happened is you just had more people coming into the market and more demand in the market, which kept occupancy is high and where we didn't have to drop rents or lower renewals during this period dramatically to keep market share and keep occupancy up. And that's just the equation where you just have a whole lot more demand for multifamily than you have supply, and it just -- it created a very, very, very light seasonality, but generally not like we normally have.
John Kim: Right. Okay. And Ric, you mentioned what development expectations are in IRRs on development starts. You had 1 development at 8.75% stabilized yields coming in this period. What should we be modeling for the existing pipeline, just given how much rents have come up in the last 12 months?
Ric Campo: Well, the existing pipeline without remodeling it was sort of in the mid-5s, but it's probably going to be better than that. It's just one of those things where we haven't really remodeled all of our pipeline development deals at this point with new rents, but also we haven't remodeled them with new cost either.  So we'll do -- I think the development yields will be higher than we would have all projected, but it's hard to tell right now. And especially when you're talking about initial occupancies and we're looking at a pipeline report right now and our initial occupancies on our pipeline are in the second quarter -- first quarter through the third quarter of 2024.  So for us to kind of try to model that today, and we're just not going to do that yet. So the bottom line is that the -- it looks like this development pipeline will be a pretty robust and good pipeline.
Alex Jessett: And that’s the pipeline of communities that we haven't started. If you think about the ones that we have started, we're looking at yields north of 6% there on average.
John Kim: So that 8 quarters that was truly a one-off? Or could there be others north of 7%?
Ric Campo: We have another that hit over 7% in Phoenix. But most of them are in the 6s, mid-6s to high 5s some of the ones, for example, that were -- when you think about real urban properties or California properties, those were in the -- those generally tend to be in the -- when we underwrote them originally in the low 5s, 5-ish. And definitely, we're going to be better than that on those. But getting the outliers like the 8s and the 7, hard to do that in this environment.  But given where cap rates are if you think about you're producing at 6% or 6.5% and you have a 3.25 cap rate, I mean, you talked about some creation of value there, it's pretty amazing. The development margins are probably at the highest level I've ever seen him. And I said that probably in 2010 and '11, but these are higher today is cap rate is compressed so much.
John Kim: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey guys, thank you for the time here. Just curious what the rates are on your renewal leases that are going out into February and March?
Alex Jessett: Mid-14s.
Austin Wurschmidt: Mid 14s. Great. Thank you and then when you talked about some of the technological advancements and the savings that you're getting in your operating expenses. Can you give us a sense what the total amount or breakdown of that is that you have left to capture over the next few years?
Alex Jessett: Yes. I would tell you that we're really on the forefront of this. And ultimately, we expect the efficiencies to continue through 2022 and really take hold in 2023 and beyond. It's -- obviously, the trend that we're all moving towards is self-guided tours. And as I said, when we rolled out our Smart Access solution, which is what you must have in order to effectively do self-guided tours. I think I think that's going to be a big driver as we go forward, especially if we can start adding wayfinding, which is going to be the sort of the next thing that we're all working towards.  And then I think our virtual leasing agent, which we're in the process of building out right now, I think, is going to create some real significant efficiencies as we go forward. So really excited about where we are today, but even more excited about where we're going to be, as I said, the latter part of 2022 into 2023 and beyond.
Austin Wurschmidt: Could you quantify how big that savings potential is or NOI creation, however you guys are looking at it to give us a sense of how that could play out in the years to come.
Alex Jessett: Stay tuned, and we will continue to, as we flesh this out, give you guys better information around the actual dollar amount. But I will tell you, I think we're all very well aware that we are operating in a very inflationary time frame right now, and we're coming out with expense growth of 3%. So you can start to see that we're already capturing quite a bit.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks Alex.
Ric Campo: We'll give more clarity on that in the next quarter call.
Operator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: I guess -- I mean, could you walk us through the assumptions that get us to the low end of your guidance? I guess I was particularly focused on kind of the rate assumptions you're assuming to get there?
Alex Jessett: Yes. Here's what I would tell you is probably a little bit different. If I think about the factors that could cause us to be below the midpoint. One of the big ones is bad debt and is wrap, right? We talked about that we had $12 million or $12.5 million in 2021 and then we're anticipating about half of that in 2022. Obviously, that's a very variable item, right? And that's something that we're very focused on.  The other thing I'll tell you is that we took our occupancy down to 96.5% from 96.9% in 2021. And so we'll watch that very closely. And then really, the third factor is how does the third and fourth quarter shake out? I mean there are certainly -- obviously, we feel very, very, very good about our business. But there are things out there that we're all watching, which are more on the macro side, and we'll have to see how that affects the third and fourth quarters.
Ric Campo: I would add one thing that, which is we still do have these regulatory impediments in California and then D.C. proper and a little bit in suburban D.C. markets where we've made some real -- a reasonable estimate of when things return to normal. And by that, that means can you evict people who haven't paid rent for 2.5 years. Can you -- are there rental controls in place or renewal caps in place. And we do believe that we're heading towards improvements and some of these things that are going to be taken off the table as far as impediments to running our business.  But it doesn't take -- what does it take in today's environment for policymakers who have been kind of behind the curve on adapting to the pandemic is an endemic versus you get the first hint of the new variant. And it just seems like all bets are off and they retreat to the lowest common denominator of start talking about lockdowns again. So I would just add that to Alex's list of kind of what's out there that could be different and create headwinds for where we are in our portfolio.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. One follow-up to that on the occupancy, that moderation you're factoring in, what's driving that, that just conservatism and what you kind of normally see when occupancy is this high? Or is there something more specific that you're seeing?
Ric Campo: Well, we don't normally see occupancy this eye. So I'll point that out in the first we're on record levels of occupancy. And obviously, that's 1 of the things that we're watching closely, and we are looking at our yield management software to make sure that that as occupancy gets to these type of levels that we are pushing rents and the natural effect of that is that you would expect to see occupancy sort of curtail a little bit.
Alex Jessett: We've been doing this for -- and 96. 5% doesn't feel conservative to me.
Ric Campo: Take the question, where all these people come from. 
Alex Jessett: It's interesting thing because when you think about the demand. It has come -- people came out of the woodwork, right? And I think what they did is when you think about this is that pandemic, there were like 1 million millennials that we're missing from the market. A lot of those folks are still living at home or there are room make scenarios and form households. But then if you think about what happened then with pandemics, so everybody caught it up you have more people that were potted up during the pandemic. And then once it started releasing those folks had jobs, number one.  Number two, they probably have got razors because of the issues with that are facing employers today. And they got checks from the government matches stimulus checks. So when you think about it, you had -- by the end of last year, I think there were $2.7 trillion of excess savings, now we have about $2 trillion of excess savings.  So if you were potted up and you have weariness from COVID and being around the people that've been around for so long. You go out and form a household and run an apartment because you've got plenty of money in your pocket, you've got a job and life is good. And all of a sudden, this massive demand came out as a result of opening up and especially in our markets now you didn't have that happen in California or New York as fast as it did in Texas and Florida. But I think it just had a lot of people who didn't have funds pre COVID but have them now because of the late tightness of the labor force and the massive government stimulus.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Keith, can you give me a few details on how the team sets the boundaries of the bands for the letter grades and the outlook? Because there's pretty big disparities between job and completion ratio. If you take a look at Atlanta, 9 jobs per unit deliver. You take a look at Austin sub-3 through the same grade and the same outlook. So any additional commentary would be great.
Keith Oden: Yes. The primary driver, John, is, first of all, we're only looking at 1 year out. We're looking for the forecast year. And if I were given 3-year letter grades, they would probably move around somewhat. But the primary driver is just looking at revenue growth that's in our forecast model. And so if you have to grade on a curve, which don't do, and I didn't do it as a 22-year-old graduate assistant teaching cost accounting at the University of Texas.  So I'm not going to change now. I don't grab the curve. And when the lowest revenue growth in your entire portfolio for the year forecast is DC for a change, which in any year, in any given year, you would say that's clearly an A because it's B plus at worse, but A minus certainly.  And then you go up from there to Houston at 6.5%. And while it sort of tails in comparison to our portfolio-wide average, again, 6.5% for Houston. That's a solid A in my book and always will be. So it's not -- you're right, the disparity on the -- there's quite a bit of disparity on the ratio for the year.  But honestly, that tends to not -- that ratio tends to not swing things around in the forecast period because all that stuff gets delivered over 12-months and there's submarket, where is it being built and all those things. And our bottom-up budget process assumes that we know exactly what's going to be delivered in our submarkets. We take that into consideration as we do our revenue growth forecast. So I still look at them and say every student in this class is an A student this year.
John Pawlowski: Okay. That helps. One final one for me. Do you see around 4% revenue growth? Could you give us a sense of what it would have been had regulation curves being gone on January 1? I'm just trying to understand the kind of structural earnings power of D.C. right now?
Ric Campo: So the -- if you look at -- I'm going to use the forward-looking construct as a model kind of what the past year was -- and in the past year, we think in D.C., our overall -- it affected our overall results portfolio-wide of about 40 basis points. I mean it's not a huge thing. And going forward, we do expect that we will see some relief in 2022 in D.C. proper and probably in the suburban markets as well. We've kind of got that our thinking process is maybe somewhere around midyear, you get the beginnings of a return to normal.  But that's -- again, like I said, that's crystal balling to a certain extent, and there's always the possibility that you get some new stealth variant that people get freaked out about and retreat to the old habits. But yes, it's not a huge deal in our portfolio. It wasn't last year and wouldn't be in a reasonable scenario in 2022.
John Pawlowski: Okay, thank you for the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.
Chandni Luthra: Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for keeping this call going. So most of my questions have been answered. But your peer yesterday talked about seeing or expecting to see more opportunities for acquiring stabilized properties potentially later in this year. What are your thoughts around that? Are you seeing similar situations developing? And how will you approach? Will you be aggressive if the opportunity presents? Just trying to gauge how would you approach that?
Ric Campo: Sure. Well, I don't think that based on what we're seeing through the -- at least year progresses the way we think it will, I don't think there'll be -- I think you're going to have a competitive acquisition market. I don't think that's going to change. I guess it sort of depends on what the Fed does, right?  If Fed gets ahead of itself and all of a sudden, people are starting to forecast an economic slowdown because they are moving too fast. And people worry about recession and rates go up really fast and you start worrying about that underlying economic activity. Maybe you'll have some softness in acquisitions.  But right now, if they if they moderate interest rates and interest rates start going up, I don't -- there's still a wall of capital and there's still great supply and demand dynamics and when you think about pricing of real estate or any sort about it, it's really about liquidity and there's massive liquidity still in the market, and the Fed is not just rode the liquidity day one.  And then the second biggest issue is supply and demand when you think about pricing. And so liquidity is not going away and supply and demand is great. And so then you start thinking about inflation issues and then ultimately interest rates. And so I think I don't see an opportunity for rising cap rates or better pricing for multifamily assets this year. We will get our fair share. And there's a $300 billion of transactions. We can recap a few in our little corner of the world. So I think that we'll still be able to buy properties, but I think it's going to be a blood test for sure.
Chandni Luthra: Understood. And migration has sort of been a tremendous tailwind for the Sunbelt, obviously, through 2020 and then 2021 was perhaps just as robust. As we think about 2022, do you see any signs of reversal yet? I mean I understand that 2 years is a long time in line and habit and things become permanent from temporary. But any signs that as we are in the endemic stages of this virus, perhaps those who moved from the coastal regions are now maybe thinking about moving back?
Ric Campo: It's interesting. If you look at from 2017 to 2020, Florida -- the two largest markets that had in-migration domestically were Florida and Texas. And on the Florida had 100,000 more people go to Florida versus the average for '17 through '20. Same thing in Texas. We had a little less 75,000 people came in from domestic migration and the two states lost the most were in New York and California. So this out migration of those high-cost, highly regulated markets has been going on for Keith mentioned earlier.  And what happened during the pandemic is people moved because the other markets were open, I mean, you could go to a restaurant in Texas or in Florida and. And so that when you think about that part of the equation, I don't think you're going to have -- most economists don't think you're going to have, okay, we're going to run back to California or New York because we move because they're down buying houses and reach and apartments, and they don't really need to be in a specific place to their job yet because of the office situation.  So I think we probably don't have the big peak or the big spike if we are [Tech Difficulty] will continue in its normal pattern, which is people want to be in a place with less regulation and lower housing prices and good weather, and that's what's been driving the Sunbelt for the last 20 years. And clearly, the -- I agree with Keith when he made the comment that California and New York are not going away. I mean there's still big large economies and people love to live there, and they'll still live there.  But at the margins, you're going to have -- the cost forces people out the businesses move. And so that's going to -- I think that's going to keep happening, but that doesn't mean that they're not going to do well long term because they have plenty of other in migration from immigrants and from immigrants and just natural birth that actually losing population generally.
Keith Oden: In our portfolio, in the fourth quarter of '21, 20.4% of all of our new leases in our Sunbelt were from people outside of the Sunbelt, and that is a 430 basis point increase year-over-year. So to Rick's point, we're clearly seeing it in our portfolio, and we're seeing it continuing to accelerate?
Chandni Luthra: That’s remarkable. Thank you for that color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good afternoon. A question on, I guess, housing affordability in your markets. How do you see the rise in rates impacting the rent versus buying, I guess, calculation in your markets? And we're seeing a lot of capital flow into rent to own, I guess, start-ups and schemes in a lot of your markets, how do you expect that development to maybe impact that decision over the long run?
Ric Campo: Affordability still remains really good in our portfolio. They're just -- even with rents going up as much as they are, you have to look at it on a relative basis if you average it over a 3-year period since we didn't raise rents and rental went up 4%-ish in 2021 for the whole year. You're talking about a 4.5%, 5% rental increase over a 3-year period with these big rent increases, right? So it's not like people are going up from -- that is just higher and higher and higher and they're having problems paying plus wages have gone up.  So our markets still are very affordable. -- when you look at actual rents relative to incomes. The other piece is the piece of the equation on single-family rentals. So single-family rentals are I think it's a really interesting market. And clearly, the public companies have proven that, that single-family rental is a real thing, and they figured out how to run it, which is really good. You think about if somebody goes -- when someone moves to a single-family rental, the average square footage is 2,000 square feet compared to a 950 square foot average apartment that Camden has.  They tend to be more suburban rather than urban. They tend to be -- so most people, when you think about buying a house or leasing a house, they're doing it for not capital -- money reasons, they're doing it for social reasons. They need more space they have kids or they have -- they just need more space.  And so with that said, we've never had a -- when you say [Technical difficulty] in the Houston suburb than it is in the urban core, which it is. I mean if you are leasing in downtown Houston or Midtown, you can go out 30 miles out of downtown and buy a house and have an occupancy cost that's lower than your rent substantially.  And -- but people don't do that because they want to be in the urban core, and they're not married. They have average don't have kids. And so you have -- it's really not -- because I can go rent a house or buy a house that’s not the -- and the money side of it, whether it's affordable or not is really not a drive for people to go do that. What drives in social position, they're older than kids they need more space, that kind of thing. So that really has occurred our market, obviously, because we're -- we still have more demand than we have supply and our occupancies 90% in Houston here 96 and to change yet. You can go out and buy a house in the suburb for a lot less than you can pay for rent merger.
Anthony Powell: Got it. So it sounds like you're not looking to get into the adjacent space SFR yourself over the time, you're pretty content with focus on multifamily. Is that fair?
Ric Campo: Well, I think it's an interesting space, and we've looked at it a lot. And it is to me, there's -- it's just another niche. And the question of whether we would get into a big, we tested things like, for example, we tested independent living. And we decided, once we did a couple of independent living deals that the cycle in the market was very different than our normal than just a market rate apartment project. So we decided that we wouldn't expand that. And we're going to dabble in single-family Hilton and see how we like it. We think it's an interesting model because it's really just another segment is as long as it -- we can operate efficiently; the way we operate our apartments than it might be a nice growth area over some period of time. 
Anthony Powell: Got it. Great. Thank you.
Ric Campo: I think we don’t have any other questions in the queue? I think we are -- that was the last one. Great, well we appreciate your time and we'll see some of you in South Florida, and so take care, and we'll talk to you next time. Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Thank you. Bye-bye.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-29 11:00:00) =====

If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes.  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks Kim. The theme for our pre call music today was Camden Cares. For many years, our Camden Cares initiatives have provided assistance to people in need among Camden's family or Camden residents, as well as the communities where we live and work. Our music today included a song by the late great Bill Withers with this great wisdom. Lean on me when you're not strong. I'll be your friend. I'll help you carry on for it won't be long till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on. These words capture the spirit of all that our Camden associates do for others in need, under our Camden Cares banner. Camden's why, our purpose is to improve the lives of our teammates, customers and our shareholders one experience at a time. At the outset of the pandemic, it was clear that disruption from COVID-19 was going to be massive, and lead millions needing someone to lean on. We encourage our teams to view the widespread chaos as an opportunity to go big on our pledge to improve people's lives one experience at a time. And not surprisingly, Team Camden responded and truly extraordinary ways that we captured in this brief video. [Video played] Camden's carrying culture was recognized by People magazine this year on their 100 companies that care list, ranking Camden at number 7. I want to thank all of our Camden team members for all they do to make our communities better every single day. We are pleased to report another very strong quarter of results and another raise to our 2021 earnings guidance. We're seeing high levels of rent growth along with sustained occupancy levels over 97% for our portfolio, which bodes well for the remainder of the year. Camden is always focused on operating in markets with high employment and population growth and strong migration patterns. And this strategy is clearly paying off, as evidenced by the ULI PwC report that was issued for 2021 real estate transcend at the ULI Fall Conference in Chicago last week, Camden's markets, eight of Camden's markets ranked in the Top 10 for 2022 investor demand. We were very fortunate today to be in really strong apartment market and in the right markets. At this point, I will go ahead and turn over the call to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks Ric. Now for a few details on our third quarter operating results. Same property revenue growth exceeded expectations yet again at 5.1% for the quarter, and was positive in all markets both year-over-year and sequentially. We posted double digit growth in Phoenix in South Florida both at 10.1% followed by Tampa at 9.5%. Year-to-date, same property revenue growth is 2.9%. And we expect strong performance in the fourth quarter across our portfolio, resulting in our revised 2021 guidance range of 4% to 4.5% for full year revenue growth. New lease and renewal gains are still strong with double digit growth posted in both categories. For thre3Q, '21, signed new leases were 19.8% and renewals were 12.1% for a blended rate of 16% flat. For leases, which were signed earlier and became effective during the third quarter, new lease growth was 16.6% with renewals at 8.5% for a blended rate of 12.2%. October 2021 remain strong, with sign new leases trending at 18.3%, renewals at 13.8% and a blended rate of 16.5%. Renewal offers for November and December were sign out with an average increase of 15% to 16%. Occupancy has also been very strong it was 97.3% for the third quarter of '21 and is still holding at 97.3% for October today. Net turnover remains low at 47% for the third quarter of '21 versus 49% in the third quarter of last year. And move out to home purchases moderated from 17.7% in the second quarter of '21 to 15% in the third quarter of '21, trending below our long term average of about 18%. It's worth noting that these strong results have continued into what has historically been a seasonally weaker period for our portfolio. We want to acknowledge team Camden for continuing to produce outstanding and better than forecast results. This marks our third straight quarter in which we increased our same property NOI and FFO per share guidance. Our team is focused on finishing the year strong, which will position us for another solid year in 2022. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the third quarter of 2021, we purchased Camden Central, a recently constructed 368 unit 15 story community in St. Petersburg, Florida and subsequent to quarter end, we purchased Camden Greenville, a recently constructed a 558 unit mid rise community in Dallas. The combined purchase price for these two acquisitions is approximately $342 million and both assets were purchased at just under a 4% yield. Also, during the quarter, we stabilized Camden Downtown, a 271 unit $132 million new development in Houston. And subsequent to quarter end, we stabilized ahead of schedule Camden North End II, a 343 unit, $79 million new development in Phoenix. Additionally, during the quarter, we completed construction on Camden Lake Eola, a $125 million new development in Orlando. Subsequent to quarter end, we purchased five acres of land in Denver for future development purposes. On the financing side, during the quarter we issued approximately $220 million of shares under our existing ATM program. We use the proceeds of the issuance to fund in part the previously discussed acquisitions. Turning to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2021 of $142.2 million, or $1.36 per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.03 per share, which resulted primarily from approximately $0.01 in higher same store NOI resulting from $0.02 higher revenue driven by higher rental rates, higher occupancy and lower bad debt, partially offset by $0.01 of higher operating expenses entirely driven by higher than anticipated amounts of self insured expenses. Approximately $0.015 and better than anticipated results from a non same store, development and acquisition communities. And approximately $0.01 from the timing effort for third quarter acquisition. This $0.035 aggregate outperformance was partially offset by a $0.005 impact from our higher share count resulting from our recent ATM activity. Last night based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we also updated and revised our 2021 full year same store guidance. Taking into consideration our continued significant improvement in new leases, renewals and occupancy and our resulting expectations for the remainder of the year, we have increased the midpoint of our full year same store revenue guidance from 3.75% to 4.25%. And we have increased the midpoint of our full year same store NOI guidance from 3.75% to 4.50%. We are maintaining the midpoint of our same store expense guidance at 3.75% as the higher than expected third quarter insurance expenses are anticipated to be entirely offset by lower than expected property tax expenses in the fourth quarter. We're now anticipating that our full year property tax growth rate will be approximately 1.6% which includes $1.8 million of property tax refunds anticipated in the fourth quarter. Our 4.25% same store revenue growth assumption is based upon occupancy averaging approximately 97% for the remainder of the year with the blend of new lease and renewals averaging approximately 16%. Last night we also increase the midpoint of our full year 2021 FFO guidance by $0.10 per share. Our new 2021 FFO guidance is $5.34 to $5.40 with the midpoint of $5.37 per share, this $0.10 per share increase results from our anticipated 75 basis point, or approximately $0.05 increase in 2021 same store operating results. $0.01 of this increase already occurred in the third quarter, an approximate $0.05 increase from a non same store development and acquisition communities, of which $0.025 already occurred in the third quarter, and an approximate $0.02 increase in FFO from later and lower than anticipated fourth quarter disposition activities. We now anticipate approximately $110 million of dispositions in early November, and approximately $220 million of dispositions in early December, as compared to our previous expectations of $450 million to dispositions, all occurring in early November. This $0.12 aggregate increase in FFO is partially offset by an approximate $0.02 impact for our third quarter ATM activity. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.46 to $1.52. The midpoint of $1.49 represents a $0.13 per share improvement from the third quarter, which is anticipated to result from an $0.11 per share or approximate 7.5% expected sequential increase in same store NOI driven by both a 2.5% or $0.055 per share sequential increase in same store revenue, resulting primarily from higher rental rates, and a $0.065 decrease in sequential same store expenses, driven primarily by $0.025t fourth quarter decrease in property taxes. Combined with a fourth quarter, $0.015 decrease in property insurance expenses, and a $0.015 third to fourth quarter a seasonal decrease in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover and personnel expenses. A $0.03 per share increase in NOI from our development communities and lease up and our non same store communities and a $0.02 per share increase in FFO resulting from the full quarter contribution of our recent acquisitions. This aggregate $0.16 increase is partially offset by $0.015 decrease in NOI from our plan fourth quarter disposition activities, and a $0.015 per share incremental impact from our third quarter ATM activity. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt to EBITDA at 4.4x and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.8x. As of today, we have approximately $1.1 billion of liquidity comprised of approximately $200 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amount outstanding under a $900 million unsecured credit facility. At quarter end, we had $242 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline. Our current excess cash is invested with various banks earning approximately 20 basis points. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.
NeilMalkin: Good morning, everyone. Great quarter. First question maybe higher level in terms of just secular tailwinds. What is in your opinion driving historically strong rent growth? I mean is it -- are you continuing to see accelerating in migration, corporate relocation? Is it a wage growth thing? Because supply is pretty consistent give or take over the last couple years and expect it to be next year maybe a little bit higher but if you can just talk about what you think the main drivers there because you're 97%, and you're pushing double digit. So any thought would be great.
RicCampo: Sure. So when we think about what's going on it really, when you think about our customer base, right, our customer base average income is little over $100,000 a year. And if you think about what's been going on in the economy, the unemployment rate is very low. But we think about the jobs that haven't been, or the people that aren't employed today, 75% of those folks are making under 50 grand a year. So our customer base is really, really in good shape. Number one, they're employed. Number two, they have massive savings as a result of the pandemic. And a lot of them that doubled up with their parents homes or doubled up in apartments during the pandemic. That's all expanding. So you really have almost three years of demand hitting the market in 2021, in a very buoyant job market for our customers. And then also, you just have the financing scenario, or you think about wages going up pretty dramatically plus savings rates going up pretty dramatically all the government support that these -- our customers got, and probably they didn't spend it.  So what's that has done is it that's allowed a lot of folks that maybe financially had to double up prior to the pandemic, who are in doubling. So you now have just normal economic growth. Plus, the unbundling of people that were either living at home or bundled up in when roommate scenarios because we know that people generally are have roommates, not because they want them but because they have to have them because of financial issues. And so we just have a very, our customers are really in good financial shape today. And I think that's what's sort of driven the demand not just for apartments, but for single family homes. Anything that's home today is full. And so we've been under building for a long, long time. And I think it's just that we have this unusual situation where everybody has money in their pocket and are willing to go out and lease apartments.
KeithOden: Yes, I'd just add, as I've mentioned in migration and the continuation there, across Camden's platform on using Ron Whitman's numbers for 2021. He still estimates over 440,000 net migrations across Camden's 15 markets. So it is a minute's an important part of the story as well as the people that are have been sort of liberated to live where they choose to live and not where they have to live, making choices and big numbers to continue the migration patterns that started a decade and a half ago. So that is an important part of this 440,000 folks are going to show up in Camden's markets this year just from immigration.
AlexJessett: And Neil I'd add to that if you look at move-ins from in our markets, we saw a 600 basis point improvement in people moving from non Sun Belt markets to move into our communities in the Sun Belt. So that's the manifestation of keys immigration numbers.
NeilMalkin: Okay, yes, thank you all for the color. Just interesting is some of your peers are making talking about people coming back into the coastal market. So it's like, I'm not really sure where the people are coming from, but I think your absolute market rent speak for themselves. The other one for me is can you just talk about capital allocation priorities how you're going to get pretty aggressive on the developments, that you only started one this year so far. Can you just talk about how your cost of equity, current market fundamentals, and potential supply chain issues, weigh into your factors of focusing on ramping the development pipeline, versus focusing more on acquisition? Thanks.
RicCampo: Well, a lot of questions, kind of in that question. But fundamentally we think that development is a very good spot to be in today with the constructive rent growth that we're seeing, in spite of supply chain issues, I would say just to, so next year, we'll probably start anywhere between $375 million and $450 million of developments, developments take a long time to put in place, so you can't just move on a dime to increase development pipeline. So that's where we'll be development wise, in terms of supply chain and how that relates to development, supply chain disruptions, and I have a little bit of insight knowledge into this because part of my Camden Care is my personal Camden Care is part of my equation is, I'm the Chairman of the Port of Houston. And so it's an unpaid political job. But so I'm spending a fair amount of time understanding the supply chain issues and they're real.  And it's not because the supply chain is broken, it's just the supply chain is jammed. And we have high end, very, very increased high demand for every kind of product because of the pandemic, there's just too many products coming into the beginning of the supply chain. And they're getting stuck at every level. And that's causing big problems. So what that means for us is our projects are taking 30 to 60 days longer to build. When you look at price inflation, because of supply chain issues, we're looking at 10% to 12% increases in labor and in construction costs. The good news is, is that rental rates have gone up so much over the last six or eight months that we're able to offset that with higher rental costs, higher rental rates, obviously, just to give you a little tidbit on this too. So in California, we are releasing up our Hillcrest project and also needing replacement refrigerators, we had to go out. And we bought a couple 100 refrigerators from Best Buy in a week. So we went to Best Buy after Best Buy after Best Buy loading up on a refrigerator. So it's not going to change anytime soon. And that pressure is going to be there for a long time. As far as capital allocation to acquisitions, we obviously have bought a lot of acquisitions here with $633 million so far, and we had a budget of about $400 million. When you look at cost of capital, our cost of capital has gone down as a result of just the overall interest rate environment and stock price. And so that allows us to make a really good spread on both acquisitions and development. And that's why we're ramping up the acquisition side of the equation. And we will continue to do that given the construct of the market, and so it just makes a lot of sense for us to grow in this environment, even with low cap rates on a relative basis.
Operator: The next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
JohnKim: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering what markets were leading and lagging on the 18% release growth? Is it similar to the market performance and same store revenue? Or there are some markets with stronger momentum than the same store revenue results?
KeithOden: I think the best guy would just be looking at the same store revenue results, John. I mean, look at the -- if you look at the sequential numbers on revenues, the big ups were San Diego, it's over 7%, you got Orange County at close to 7%, Phoenix at 4% Charlotte, South Florida both at 4% so I mean, there's a lot of strength in sequential numbers like that. But it's cross our entire platform and the only the markets that it kind of it's hard to even talk about underperformance when they're -- when the numbers are at the levels that they are but we still have some regulatory headwinds in Washington DC and so the Maryland and DC proper, we're still have some constraints on the ability to push rents same in California, most of the California, most of them except for Hollywood have lapsed. But that doesn't mean that we're back in a position of the ability to make changes to our resident base immediately, there's a process you have to go through. So that stuff that will get better over time because the market fundamentals are better than the regulatory environment has allowed us to take advantage of in those in two markets, but the rest of the platform business as usual. And you can see what the kind of unregulated and unconstrained market clearing rents are and that's what we're getting our new lease renewals.
JohnKim: I was going to ask you about DC because that seems like the one market that's underperformed your financial outlook for the year. And I know there are some regulatory concerns in DC itself, maybe not too much in suburban, Maryland and Virginia. But I was wondering, do you think there's going to be a catch up next year? And or are you thinking about decreasing your exposure to DC given it's by far your biggest market?
RicCampo: So I'll take that. It's interesting because the beginning of the year, we talked about how we were going to sell $450 million of assets and buy $450 million plus or minus and we're going to sell those properties in Houston and DC to lower our exposure in our two largest markets, and then reallocate that capital into Nashville, and some of the other markets like Tampa, that have better constructs from growth perspective, sort of longer term. And we're doing that, I mean, we will close the Houston transactions, the DC transactions in the next month. That when you look at a DC, and I'll sort of throw Houston in this bucket too, because to your question of slower growth, okay, we have slower growth in Houston and in DC, DC is definitely related to the fact that we can't raise rents on renewals, because of regulatory constructs there. And so there's definitely pent-up, occupancies are high if we didn't have the government control on not being able to raise rents through the end of the year, we would be pushing it pretty hard, just like the rest of the country. So fundamentals underlying are great in DC, but it's just this government construct in the district in Maryland, where you can't raise rents. Houston, on the other hand, is probably our slowest growing market, even though we're getting really good rent increases on a relative basis, they're substantially lower than the rest of the country. And the reason there is, if you look at the sort of the four, three or four cities in America that haven't added back their jobs, from the pandemic, Houston would be one of those, Houston, LA, New York, and that's primarily driven by oil, and we lost 80,000 or 60,000 jobs in the oil business. And we've added back about 23,000 of those jobs. And so there's only we're pushing up towards 70% recovery of the jobs. But if you look at Dallas, Austin, Charlotte, Raleigh, they're all over 100% recovered from their -- the Phoenix, they're 100%, recovered from their job losses in the pandemic.  So, the good news is that even with the kind of drag we're getting from that, we're still putting really good numbers up and I kind of look at it like this, that we have a geographically diverse portfolio, geographically diverse, and that product diverse, and the whole idea is you never know, which markets going to give you the best growth in any one year just depends on their local economies and how the supply and demand dynamics work. And so I look at DC and Houston as sort of gas in the tank for next year because those markets are improving. And once we get the regulatory construct out of DC, which should happen by the end of the year, maybe early second, the first quarter, then we'll be able to experience the same kind of growth that the rest of the country is doing today. And then Houston continues to improve and, oils at $85 a barrel and there's a lot of after the winter when people pay 30% more for their energy, I think you're going to get back to more investments in the fossil fuel area and Houston will do fine, too.
Operator: The next question comes from Nich Joseph with Citi.
NicholasJoseph: Thanks. What's the loss to lease for the portfolio overall? And then I recognize that someone at the moving target and you've touched on some regulatory issues, but how long do you think it will take to capture and regain that loss to lease over the next few months, or over the next year?
KeithOden: So you're right, it certainly is a moving target. Loss to lease today is right around 16%. But now, you'll have to remember that the way our pricing works, obviously, is dynamic pricing. And so this loss to lease has some variability to it. And if you're trying to sort of think about the impact, and how long will it take for us to recoup all of that, you have to remember that we're generally not bringing our renewals up fully to market. And we're doing that in order to make sure that we can keep up our resident retention. So I wouldn't expect for us to make up that full 16% in 2022, I think it's probably a longer lead time probably getting you into 2023.
NicholasJoseph: Thanks. That's helpful. And then just given where the occupancy is today versus history, how are you thinking about seasonality and kind of the push and pull of rent versus occupancy over the next few months?
KeithOden: Yes, so our -- we do have seasonality and historically have in our portfolio and if you go back and look at it throw out the two COVID years and look at the prior phase. On average, our occupancy between third and fourth quarter drops about 40 basis points. So that's sort of typical well in this year, between second and third, we actually went up 40 basis points. And as we sit here today, we're still at 97.3%. So my guess is there will be some seasonality from the 97.3% but maybe not the full 40 basis points that we've seen in the past. And then if you look at from a rental perspective it's, there's also seasonality on our new leases. I mean, we typically see 2% to 3% decline from third to fourth quarter. And, yes, as we sit here today, we've actually increased that number. So throughout the month of October, so I think we will see some seasonality maybe not to the extent that we have in the past, but you're talking about seasonal adjustments from historically high numbers, both on occupancy and rents.
Operator: The next question comes from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird.
AmandaSweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. If you look at it 2022, can you just talk about how you're thinking about the expense outlook today? Is there a level of expense growth that is already known to either kind of in place insurance or tax increases? And then how you thinking about controllable expense growth? 
AlexJessett: Yes, so obviously, we are in the midst of our budget process. And so it's a little bit early to give some really detailed information around expenses, what I will tell you is that, obviously, we've had a very, or anticipate having a very good year in 2021 when it comes to property taxes, which is the largest component of our expenses. Based upon what we're hearing from our consultants, we think that there will be a slight uptick, but still within a normal range in property taxes. And if you think about the second largest line item, which is salaries and benefits we're certainly getting some very real efficiencies that hopefully, we'll get, we'll start to see some incremental benefit from in 2022. But hang tight, and we'll get you some better information next quarter.
AmandaSweitzer: That's helpful. And I appreciate your caution until you give access. And then just want to follow up on your comments about it'd be an attractive time to grow more aggressively externally, can you talk about how your stack ranking your sources of capital, as you look out to 2022 and are you planning to further lighten your exposure in any markets beyond the planned sale, we've talked about this year.
RicCampo: Well, in terms of lighting exposure, we will continue to -- the good news is when you grow in smaller markets, that lightens your exposure on a percentage basis and in your over weighted market. So we'll continue to trade out assets. We, I think about lowering exposure in DC and Houston, we can do it the two ways one is to grow outside of there. And the other is to move assets out of those markets and trade them for other assets. And we'll do some of that as well. In the end, it's really more of a, like a two or three year program. If you think about what we did in '20, starting in sort of 2013 kind of timeframe, we made a lot of moves we sold out a Vegas and increase exposure in a lot of other markets. And so we'll continue to do that. When I think about our capital stack, it's pretty simple.  We've talked about for a long time how we're going to keep our debt to EBITDA in the 4% to 5%, 4x to 5x range. And when you look at weighted average cost of capital, our weighted average cost of capital has gone down as a result of everything that's going on in the market with the 10 year being where it is and with equity prices where they are. And we -- so we're sitting right at 4.4x debt to EBITDA today. Had we not issued equity under our ATM program and just bought assets and funded them with debt, we'd be at 5.2x debt to EBITDA today instead of 4.4x. So the way I think about this, the kind of times we're in now is that we have very low cost of capital. And so we know that our equity cost is the highest cost of capital that we have. And so we're going to continue to balance the capital stack to make sure that we're driving this growth in a very positive way. Today, I haven't seen a time in my business career where we've had AFFO yields lower than our acquisition if you think about our AFFO yield on our stock relative to what we're buying. We have a accretive transactions when we're issuing stock and putting that debt piece on it as well and then buy an asset so that's a-- that's me a greenlight to grow. But it's always about keeping that debt to EBITDA in that 4x to 5x range. So today what we're really doing when we have times like this, we're in that debt to EBITDA down to the 4x. And that -- what that does is gives us tremendous capacity to lever up, if, in fact, the market changes in the future. And there are more attractive opportunities when the world sort of changes. And the question will be how long does it last? And I don't think any of us know. But I do know that good times don't last forever, and that rents don't go up always. And that at some point, our strength in our balance sheet will pay us big dividends in the future. And that's the way we think about our capital stack and sort of the growth opportunities that we have today.
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC.
RichAnderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning, all. So the stock is up about 65%, 70% this year. And I don't think the value of your portfolio is up that much back of the envelope, if I were to cut my cap rate by 100 basis points maybe you could say 30%, 35%, 40% up in terms of property value. So there's a fair amount of enthusiasm driving the stock today, enthusiasm toward something that is arguably unsustainable. You mentioned 3x, the demand in one year. So I guess the question is, and maybe sort of answered in the last question, but how do you keep people from running from the stock next year, in the year after, because then they suddenly realize that 20% blended, or new lease rates is just not something that's going to happen probably next year, either. So I'm just wondering what the bull case for Camden is in year '22 and beyond.
AlexJessett: Well, first of all, we don't manage to the stock price, obviously. And its stocks can go up and down. And that's just what they do, right? You guys are the ones who figure out what they're going to do. But if -- but to your point, if you just take the base, right, in January of this year, and we start out at $95 a share, and now we're up to $162, or something like that $95, a share was incredibly cheap, it was definitely a significant discount to NAV there. So I would argue that from January to now we've had at least a 30% or 40% increase in the real estate value. But we were undervalued to start with, right. And so to me, the -- it's not about 65% growth in the stock price versus 30% or 40% growth in the asset value, we started out at a low number. And so you had to get back to an NAV number. And when you look at our NAVs relative to the streets, I mean, it's not that far off of where the stock price is today, some people have it higher, some people have it lower. In terms of why would somebody, why -- what's the big bull case for Camden next year? I think it's pretty simple. And you're coming off a really big year this year, but you have embedded growth next year that we've never seen in our business history. When you look at next year, we have embedded revenue growth of 5%, just if we do nothing next year, and we just maintain our occupancy and our leases, you have 5% top line revenue growth. And then if you think that the loss to lease is some of that loss of lease is going to get captured, you're going to have a probably one of the best years that multifamily has seen in a very long time for top line growth. And so the question will be how long it does last? And I know people get very stressed out about negative second derivatives on revenue. But you have an unusual situation today where there's just more demand than supply. And for all the reasons that we talked about before, and then as long as the economy continues to chug along the way it's chugging along today, then 2022 looks pretty darn good. And then 2023 could be another interesting year or two. So when you think about how high rents can go keep in mind that these 20% increases today are on top of pretty much zero increase in 2021 limited increases and 2020, we had maybe a 3% growth in 2019. And so you have a fair amount of pent-up growth that would just catch up growth or not like new growth, and then the new growth is going to come in 2022 with the economy doing what it's doing. So I would make the argument that's the bull case for Camden.
RichAnderson: Okay, good stuff, and then second question is, you have a rock solid plan from a succession standpoint, I hate to bring this up, because I'd hate to see both any of you guys go. But obviously, it's important for you to do that, do you expect you'll be here many, many years to come or just any kind of comment on succession because obviously, you two guys and Alex and everyone are very important.
RicCampo: So let me take a quick shot at it. So yes, we have a long-term succession plan. And it's a good one because you really have two CEOs here, right, Keith and me; we were co-founders of the company. And so if one of us decides to leave tomorrow, or gets hit by a truck or whatever, or maybe by foul ball, the Astros game on game seven, then you have the other one. And we have a very deep bench when it comes to our other team members. And when you think about Alex, I mean, Alex, you started here when you're in your 30s. Now you're still pretty young dude, even though you may [Indiscernible] in the last 20 years, but so we have a great plan, we are all good from that perspective. Keith, you want to add to that?
KeithOden: I was going to say that it's entirely internal. 
RichAnderson: Yes, absolutely. 
KeithOden: Completely confident that our succession plan is internal. 
Operator: The next question comes from Daniel Santos with Piper Sandler.
DanielSantos: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. As we look at sort of sub market mix, how do you rank for infill versus suburbs versus outer ring from a pricing power perspective in the sort of near to medium term?
AlexJessett: So what I would tell you is that Class B and suburban communities continue to outperform. And that is primarily driven by where the supply is. And so I think you would expect to see that at least in the near term, continue that way.
DanielSantos: Got it. Thank you. And then, apologies if you covered this already. But can you give us an update on the delinquent rent in Southern California? And what's your view on when you might be able to start evicting tenants? Or is your view that internally that the eviction moratorium will be sort of extended kind of indefinitely?
AlexJessett: Yes, so if you think about delinquency, for us, it was 120 basis points for the quarter. By the way, California was 410 basis points of that or was 410 basis points. So if you exclude California, we would have actually had a delinquency number of about 80 bps. We do not believe that we're going to see any extensions. And obviously, right now, we are looking at how we are going to handle the consumer debt. But we are certainly anticipating that 2022 is going to be a more normal year in terms of California and people being required to be current on current rent, obviously, the past rent, as you know turns to consumer debt, and then we'll have to look at our various avenues to collect those amounts.
Operator: The next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney.
RobStevenson: Good morning, guys. How much redevelopment are you doing these days? And how are you thinking about that business over the next several quarters, given the downtime for units and the strong demand for those units in the [Indiscernible] high occupancy?
AlexJessett: Yes, so we expect in 2021, that we're going to have about 2,200 units that we will reposition that works out to be about $53 million worth. We think it's a fantastic business, we're going to keep doing it, as long as we have the opportunities, the downtime, we've gotten really, really efficient about it. And obviously, we go back and we sort of backtrack, all this and back check and what we're finding is reposition units are outperforming those units that have not been repositioned even in this environment. So I think it's a great book of business, we're getting very strong return on invested capital and it's something that we'll keep doing.
RobStevenson: Okay. And then obviously, pricing continues to increase but what is five acre land in Denver. Was there, is there something else on that? Is that a title for multifamily development, and how we sort of characterize the pool of entitled multifamily development land in the markets and sub markets that you want to develop in today?
RicCampo: The general property does have some warehouses on it right now and is multifamily. And we've had it under contract for quite a while. And we went through the zoning process to make sure that it was developable as multifamily. So the closing was required, once we got our right entitlements so we wanted, and then we will now start our construction drawings and knock the buildings down. And hopefully, we'll be under construction late this year, early next year on that project. In terms of land availability, land availability is still out there, people talk about oh, gee, and they're not making any more land. But what's happening is, there's been a lot of product types that are just underutilized lands that you're -- that are out there, that so I think that the land availability is still fine, you're still able to buy it, the big issue is land prices have accelerated, along with rents and other costs. So it just makes it more difficult to make numbers work on projects. And that's the challenge we have, we want to make a certain rate of return IRR, and going in yield and that's the challenge in this environment now, the good news is rents are helping us make those numbers obviously, with the significant increases that people are having today or rent increases that is.
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore.
RichHightower: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for all the color so far. So I want to go back, I think it's been asked a few times, but I'm going to put a twist on it this sort of 3x demand normal demand. Figure that, Rick, I think you mentioned in the answer to one of the question. So as I think about that, I mean, you're not so much pulling forward, future demand, you're sort of calling it back from an air pocket that existed during the depths of COVID. And so we might consider that the industry is sort of over earning currently on demand, and therefore, rents at the moment. And so as I think about what next year and beyond are going to look like, I mean, would you say that, we are going to have a more sort of trend like, demand figure in 2022 and beyond? And what does that do to a pricing algorithm? If you're comparing sort of year-over-year, and you do see what looks like an air pocket as measured against what's happened in 2021. How do we figure out where the puck is going in that regard?
RicCampo: Yes, so I think if we think about it that way, I don't disagree with that we'd have more demand, because people were doubled up in the past. And there's just more household formation, and people are choosing more apartments, part of it is that people are choosing to rent rather than to buy or live in a single family home too and when you look at single family market, it's full from a rental perspective. But it's also full from a sales perspective, and you can't build houses fast enough today. And so I think that the clawback, if you want to call it is going to stay in place, right. So that means that occupancy levels assuming that you have normal economic activity, right, meaning that we don't go into recession, or there's some black swan event that happens, a Fed makes a mistake and shuts down the economy or COVID, or whatever, then if you have -- you start out with pretty amazingly strong occupancy, and those people stay in place that came out of the market, then what you have is normal demand in a very tight rental market.  And so if you have normal demand, that is just household formation and population growth and job growth, through 2022 and 2023, that you shouldn't have an air pocket. An air pocket, the only certain way that would happen is if there was some economic dislocation, right? And then that demand that was there goes away, or the new demand that normally happens during the normal year doesn't happen. And so you can always come up with scenarios that we don't know about today, or I could just said that I make some mistake or something like that and you have an air pocket. And then what happens is, if you do is to demand then at least our occupancies are higher. And so maybe the rental growth slows some and with our dynamic pricing model you would have, you would definitely see a slowdown in the rate of growth of new leases. But that is you need to have a real economic shock to make that air pocket happen, I think.
KeithOden: So, Rich, just to add to that on Whitman's numbers for 2022 in Camden's markets, he's got employment growth at $1.2 million. And he's got completions across Camden's markets at 160,000 flat -- with 2021. So I mean that that math tells me that we're going to have excess demand in 2022, and probably in 2023, as well, because the he's got completions ticking up a little bit in 2023, but not much. There's not the fact that you see this excess demand right now, you say, well, what's the response to that? Well, the response to it as people will build more, but it's a two to three year process. To me, it's not like going to the grocery store and getting cornflakes. These projects are long lead time, they're complex, expensive, and so it's just -- it's the supply response will happen. But it just -- it's not going to happen until 2020. Whatever's if it's not under construction already, it's not going to be a factor until the end of 2023. So I think it's just by the numbers, it still looks like that we did pull -- that we had some pent-up demand that got in the 3x. But going forward, I think you're going to get back to more of a normal situation. But a normal situation demand is going to continue to outstrip supply.
RichHightower: Right, my kids can confirm it's hard to get cornflakes too at the moment. Would you say that implies that if I think about occupancy, I mean 98 becomes the new 97, is 97 has become the new 96? I mean, is that possible next year?
AlexJessett: Is that also about flakes? People still move in and move out. And that move in move out is going to limit the ability to get like occupancy in the 98, 99 kind of range, Rich, you might see a tick up a bit but it's really hard to maintain that because , people are still moving around. You'll get our -- even though we had a drop in our turnover rate, we are still 47%, right?
Operator: The next question comes from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.
ChandniLuthra: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Most of the questions have been answered. So I'll just ask one on cap rates. So what direction do you see CapEx go from here? I mean, obviously, there has been a lot of compression already. But how do you see this continue into 2022? Or do you think that we are finally at a point wherein the second derivative here slows? Just trying to understand that dynamic? If you could throw some light on that?
AlexJessett: Yes, I've bet against cap rates, compressing sort of every quarter for the last 10 years. So I think that the challenge, you haven't predicting what cap rates are going to do is, it's really driven clearly by the massive amount of capital out there that's trying to find a yield. And I sort of hurt my head when cap rates had a three on it, and a high three, now hurts my head that cap rates have a low three, but then when you put a 20% growth in an embedded rent over a 12 month period, I get that, right. So until we start alternative investments that produce the kind of cash flow growth that multifamily does. And it also has an inflation and inflation hedge, then I think cap rates are going to stay low, and maybe go lower until that dynamic changes. So if you have a significant negative second derivative, and there's other and rates rise or were there other alternatives for investors to get cash flow returns that they need, then that's probably when cap rates rise, but when you think about what -- how to assets price, the number one reason an asset is going up in value or cap rates are going down, it's liquidity in the market. And we have the most amazing liquidity that we've had ever in my business career. And then the second reason they go up and down is because of supply and demand dynamics, and we have great supply and demand dynamics, right. And then the third thing is interest rates. And then the fourth thing is inflation, I'm sorry its inflation expectations then interest rates. So until the dynamics of those four things change, cap rates are going to continue to be really low and maybe go lower until that change.
ChandniLuthra: Makes sense and then my second question, so you just on the last one gave some color on supply and talked about how people are building, but that's a two to three year process. So it's not going to be a factor until the end of 2022. But as we think about sort of all the capital that is finding its way into the Sun Belt markets, is there a risk of crowding out? I mean just overcrowding at some point. And then near term looking into 2022, how do you think about these two opposing forces that on the one hand all that sort of air pocket that got created in construction last year, perhaps, finally gets to be finished? But on the other hand we've had construction delays, and you I think yourself talk about 30 to 60 days, delays there. So how do you sort of square those two often, where do you think 2022 will ultimately shake out to be from a supply standpoint?
RicCampo: I mean the supplies pretty much baked in for 2022 now, and those construct -- those delays are real. And so that will probably supply we think is going to come into 2022 is probably not coming until 2023 because of those issues. As far as overcrowding or crowding out, I guess, I'm not sure I understand that part of the equation, your question? Are you saying there's not enough room to build or there's one -- 
ChandniLuthra: Well, I guess just oversupply.
RicCampo: Oh, yes. So I think the issues on oversupply, markets go up and down demand perspective, right now, we have an excess demand versus supply, and the supply is taking longer to put into the market. So I think an oversupply condition in 2022 is very unlikely. And then you have to start looking out to 2023. And when in 2023, do you have that happen, so I think it's really hard to go, okay, I think there's going to be a supply problem in 2024. But each market is dynamic and unique in its own way. And you will have some markets that have excess supply and less demand, and that's why we have a geographically diverse portfolio. Right now, Houston, even though we're getting 8% to 10% red trade out, if we're not getting 30, like we're in -- like we're getting in Tampa because of supply -- supply but related to the demand with job growth. And so I think we're pretty clear on imbalance of excess supply through 2022 and in the middle of 2023. And after that, it's tell me what the economy does, do we get 1.02 million jobs each year for the next two or three years in our markets? If we do, you're probably good for another two or three year. But that's the uncertainty. We know, supply is coming. I know it's taking longer, but we just don't know what the demand is in middle of 2023 to 2024 or 2025. That's the crapshoot, I think.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Kalmus with Zelman and Associates.
AlexKalmus: Hi, thank you for taking the question. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in St. Petersburg? There have been a lot of high profile office relocations. And Camden obviously been doing well, has it - can you just talk about the dynamics there and the reason for the acquisition?
KeithOden: Yes, St. Petersburg has some of the best market fundamentals of anything across our entire portfolio. And a lot of it has to do with just the re-envisioning and reimagining of what St. Petersburg is and there have been tremendous growth in terms of commercial assets, retail support, and of course that's brought with it some very high end apartment development and but our rent trade out right now in St. Petersburg is among the highest in our entire portfolio. Even on the brand new acquisition we have there. The rent trade out is crazy. So we love St. Petersburg, we love the market dynamics, we love where that -- where it's headed and ultimately we'd like to have some additional exposure there. But it's not a real big market. There's not a lot of stuff to trade. As a sub market for us is just on fire right now for sure.
AlexKalmus: Great, thank you. And is there any data behind move out to single family rentals in the portfolio? Appreciate the color on move out supply there.
KeithOden: Yes, I mean, we track that separately. And it's trended up from 1%, five years ago to about 2% today; it's still just not a meaningful number in our portfolio that my guess is that probably will tick up over time. But just because there are more purpose built single family, kind of four rental communities there that are being built in there that ultimately is probably a better solution for someone that's an apartment renter that doesn't want to have -- just doesn't want to own a home but needs more space in the suburbs. So that asset class purpose built single family rental only developments over time probably at the margins will make that number tick up, but it's -- I don't ever see it being a huge number of big competitor to our portfolio, I think it's our resident base is just more suited to their next move being purchasing a home. And while I guess our numbers right now for the last quarter were about 15%, which is still way below our long term trend of about 18 for that category.
Operator: The next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.
AustinWurschmidt: Great, thank you. Sorry, if I missed this, but I was curious. Did you guys collect any rental assistance in the third quarter, most notably from California? And can you provide what your outstanding receivable balance is today?
AlexJessett: Yes, absolutely. So outstanding receivable balance today is about $12.5 million, of which we have reserved about $12 million. So we're almost fully reserved on that front. If you think about in the third quarter, for same store, we collected about $4.2 million total portfolio was about $5.3 million. And so that gets us to a year-to-date number, same store of about $7.5 million in total about $9.4 million.
AustinWurschmidt: And are you assuming any collections into the fourth quarter in the guidance?
AlexJessett: Yes, we are assuming some additional collections going into the fourth quarter.
AustinWurschmidt: And then separately, second question, curious if you could provide an update on how deep the acquisition pipeline is today. And maybe how that compares versus six months ago or so?
KeithOden: Well, there's a lot acquisition pipeline, you mean the properties available for it to acquire is pretty deep -- 
AustinWurschmidt: Just property you guys are underwriting, yes, underwriting that kind of meet your acquisition criteria, and just how that scaled up given your higher propensity to be acquirers.
RicCampo: Sure, it's scaled up quite a bit. I mean, we, there's a lot of property out there on the market. But what we're looking for there's, might said tons of properties, but what we're looking for is a real specific product type one where we can add value, one where we can move the rents pretty hard because of either management or some issues that the properties have. And those are harder to find than just sort of run of the mill merchant builder deal in the suburbs, or in urban core. So there is a buoyant aqua market. There are a lot of people that are trying to create value and sell today and there. It was sort of interesting, because there's a lot of year end madness kind of going on, right? Where people are trying to lock in capital gains rates with all the tax changes that have been bantered about and all that. And I think that 2022 is going to be another banner year, we're at record sales for multifamily at this point. And we have had a number of transactions that we really wanted to acquire that we didn't get to the finish line on because we are disciplined on price. And we just didn't see the value proposition to go to the next level on those bids, but we'll get our fair share. It's just, but it's a very competitive environment no question.
Operator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.
JoshuaDennerlein: Yes. Hey, everyone. Hope you're all doing well. The operating stat update for October was great. I just wanted to see if there was any color or thoughts on or maybe how we should think about the new lease rate from the date sign just coming off peak levels in 3Q, everything else seemed to be moving out. So just trying to get a sense of where it might be heading in the month ahead.
KeithOden: Yes, so in my earlier I think I mentioned that are -- early on the lease rates, some third, fourth quarter. And this is over a long period of time is 2% to 3%, down from third, four. So there is seasonality and historically has been in our portfolio. So the fact that you saw the wiggle like -- it's just really a wiggle down in new lease rates at the end of October is not of any concern. And it just -- it's less seasonality than what we would normally see. And all the other metrics that we look at, in particular turnover rate at 97.3% occupancy, it leads me to believe that we're more strength and probably less seasonality than what we would typically see. So I think it's still it's pretty strong. 
JoshuaDennerlein: Okay, all right. Do these renewals follow that typical leg down as well? Or do you think that can kind of keep rising from here?
KeithOden: Yes. My guess is that I didn't look at it that way. But because new lease is really the market clearing price because a lot of times we don't take renewals all the way up to the market clearing price for a lot of different reasons. But my guess is that it would be similar. Maybe less seasonality slightly on the renewals and new leases.
Operator: Unfortunately, we are out of time for questions. So this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Well, thank you. I appreciate your time on the call today and we will, I'm sure be talking to a lot of you and NAREIT coming up so look forward to doing that. So take care and thank you. Go Astros.
Keith Oden: Go Astros. Take care.
Ric Campo: I think if Braves win, if the Braves win we're happy about that too, because they we do have more. We do have a lot of properties in Atlanta and we love our Atlanta teams as well. So thanks. Take care.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-30 11:00:00) =====
Kim Callahan: Good morning. And welcome to Camden Property Trust's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I am Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. If you haven't logged in yet, you can do so now through the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. And please note, this event is being recorded. Today's webcast will be available for replay this afternoon and we are happy to share copies of our slides upon request. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete second quarter 2021 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on the call. We hope to complete our call within one hour as we know that today is another very busy day for earnings calls and other multifamily companies are holding their calls right after us. We ask that you limit your questions to two and rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Good morning. The same for on hold music today was coping with the chaos. Last year when the pandemic began, we held the company wide conference call to share some of the lessons learned from the great financial crisis. I started to call with the first line of the famous Rudyard Kipling poem if there's like this, if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. We went on to lay out a list of suggestions to help cope with the chaos that we knew was headed our way. Among other ideas, a few suggestions were included in our on-hold music today. We knew that Queen and David Bowie and our teams are going to find themselves under pressure. And we knew when that happened, we told them just to take the advice from the eagles and take it easy. We encourage them to embrace innovation, fail fast, and as Boston reminded us don't look back. We said we would rely on Camden's values and culture and do things our way because like Bon Jovi we weren't born to follow. And finally we encourage them to get on board, the OREO feed wagon and roll with the changes. At the end of the call, we showed a video that was produced by our Dallas Texas Operations Group during the great financial crisis. But seemed just as appropriate for what we faced at the beginning of the pandemic. We thought you might find that interesting today. So go ahead and roll the video. [Audio-Video Presentation] When we held our first quarter earnings call, we're beginning to see an acceleration in both occupancy and pricing power across our markets. The actual rate of acceleration that occurred since the call has far exceeded our estimates and resulted in improved earnings guidance we released last night. Across the board, we are seeing very strong performance and continued improvements in our operating fundamentals. And in almost all cases, where current rental rates exceed their pandemic levels. The outlook from our third-party economists and data providers or providers is also quite positive, and they expect the apartment business will continue to thrive as we move into the second half of 2021 and into 2022. Despite the ongoing levels of high supply in many markets, demand has been greater than anticipated, allowing positive absorption of newly delivered apartment homes. Our occupancy is currently 97%, leasing activity is strong and turnover remains low. So overall, I would say our outlook for Camden in the multifamily industry is very good. We are excited to enter the national market with the acquisition of two high-quality apartment properties. Our acquisition and development teams continue to work hard and smart to find opportunities in a very competitive environment. I want to give a shout out to our amazing Camden team members for doing a great job and taking advantage of this strong market. Great customer service and sales acumen is very important in the market like this. We must deliver great customer service and support the Camden value proposition when asking for and getting double-digit rental increases from our customers. Thank you, team Camden for everything you do every day to improve the lives of our teammates, our customers and our stakeholders one experience at a time. Next up is our Co-Founder Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. Now for a few details on our second quarter operating results. Same property revenue growth was 4.1% for the quarter, and was positive in all markets both year-over-year and sequentially. We have remarkable growth in Phoenix and Tampa both at 9.1%, Southeast Florida at 8.6%, Atlanta at 5.7 and Raleigh at 4.6. We thought the April new lease and renewal numbers we reported on last quarter's call were pretty good at nearly 5% but as Ric mentioned pricing power continues to accelerate. For the second quarter of '21, signed new leases were 9.3% and renewals were 6.7% for a blended rate of 8%. For leases which were signed earlier and became effective during the second quarter. New lease growth was 5.4% with renewals at 4% for a blended rate of 4.7%. July 2021 looks to be one of the best months we've ever had with new signed new leases trending at 18.7% renewal that 10.5% and a blended rate of 14.6%. Renewal offers for August and September was sent out with an average increase of around 11%. Occupancy has also continued to improve going from 96% in the first quarter of this year to 96.9% in the second quarter, and is currently at 97.1% for July. Net turnover ticked up slightly in the second quarter to 45% versus 41% last year due to the aggressive pricing increases we instituted, but it remains well below long-term historical levels. Move outs to home purchases, also ticked up slightly from 16.9% in the first quarter of this year to 17.7% in the second quarter, which reflects normal seasonal patterns in our markets. So despite the constant headlines regarding increased number of single-family home sales, it really has not had an effect on our portfolio performance as the move outs to purchase homes are still slightly below our long-term average of about 18%. Ric mentioned Camden's why in his opening remarks. It's something we discuss internally often. Our purpose or why is to improve the lives of our teammates, customers and shareholders one experience at a time. In our company wide meeting at the beginning of the pandemic, we shared the Star Wars video and we emphasized that the chaotic months ahead will provide an extraordinary number of opportunities to improve lives one experience at a time. We focused our efforts on improving our teammates' lives, who likewise focus their attention on improving our residents' lives. The results have been truly amazing, and we could not be more proud of how team Camden has performed throughout the COVID months. Improving the lives of our team and customers has in turn improve the lives of shareholders, including the approximately 500 Camden employees who participated in the employee share purchase plan this year. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the second quarter of 2021, as previously mentioned, we entered the Nashville market with $186 million purchase of Camden Music Row, a recently constructed 430-unit 18-storey community and the $105 million purchase of Camden Franklin Park, a recently constructed 328-unit, five-storey community. Both assets were purchased at just under a 4% yield. Also, during the quarter we stabilized both Camden RiNo, a 233-unit $79 million new development in Denver, generating an approximate 6% yield, and Camden Cypress Creek II, a 234-unit joint venture in Houston, Texas, generating an approximate 7.75% yield. Clearly, our development program continues to create significant value for our shareholders. Additionally, during the quarter, we began leasing at Camden Hillcrest a 132-unit $95 million new development in San Diego On the financing side, during the quarter we issued approximately $360 million of shares under our existing ATM program. We used the proceeds of the issuance to fund our entrance into Nashville. Our existing ATM program is now fully utilized and in line with best corporate practices, we will file a new ATM program next week. In the quarter we collected 98.7% of our scheduled rents with only 1.3% delinquent. Turning to bad debt. In accordance with GAAP certain uncollected revenue is recognized by us as income in the current month. We then evaluate this uncollected revenue and establish what we believe to be an appropriate reserve, which serves as a corresponding offset to property revenues in the same period. When a resident moves out owing us money, we typically have previously reserved all pass through amounts, and there'll be no future impact to the income statement. We reevaluate our reserves monthly for collectability. For multi-family residents, we have currently reserved $11 million as uncollectible revenue against a receivable of $12 million. Turning to financial results, what a difference a year or quarter can make? Last night we reported funds from operations for the second quarter of 2021 of $131.2 million, or $1.28 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.03 per share. This $0.03 per share outperformance for the second quarter resulted primarily from approximately $0.03 and higher same-store NOI, resulting from $0.025 of higher revenue, driven by higher rental rates, higher occupancy and lower bad debt and a $0.005 of lower operating expenses driven by a combination of lower water expense and lower salaries due to open positions on-site, and approximately $0.02 in better than anticipated results from our non-same store and development communities. This $0.05 aggregate outperformance was partially offset by $0.01 of higher overhead costs primarily associated with our employee stock purchase plan, combined with a $0.01 impact from our higher share account resulting from our recent ATM activity. Last night, based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we also updated and revised our 2021 full year same-store guidance. Taking into consideration the previously mentioned significant improvements in new leases, renewals and occupancy and our resulting expectations for the remainder of the year, we have increased the midpoint of our full year revenue growth from 1.6% to 3.75%. Additionally, as a result of are slightly better than expected the second quarter, same-store expense performance and our anticipation of the trend continuing throughout the year, we decreased the midpoint of our full year expense growth from 3.9% to 3.75%. The result of both of these changes is a 350-basis point increase to the midpoint of our 2021 same-store NOI guidance from 0.25% to 3.75%. Our 3.75% same-store revenue growth assumptions are based upon occupancy averaging approximately 97% for the remainder of the year, with the blend of new lease and renewals averaging approximately 11%. Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2021 FFO guidance by $0.18 per share. Our new 2021 FFO guidance is $5.17 to $5.37 with a midpoint of $5.27 per share. This $0.18 per share increase results from our anticipated 350-basis point or $0.21 increase in 2021 same-store operating results. $0.03 of this increase occurred in second quarter, with the remainder anticipated over the third and fourth quarters. And an approximate $0.06 increase from our non-same store and development communities. This $0.27 aggregate increase in FFO is partially offset by an approximate $0.09 impact from our second quarter ATM activity. We have made no changes to our full year guidance of $450 million of acquisitions and $450 million of dispositions. Last night we also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2021. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.30 to $1.36. The midpoint of $1.33 represents a $0.05 per share improvements from the second quarter, which is anticipated to result from a $0.04 per share or approximate 2.5% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI driven primarily by higher rental rates, partially offset by our normal second to third quarter seasonal increase in utility, repair maintenance, unit turnover and personnel expenses. A $0.015 per share increase in NOI from our development communities and lease up, our other non-same store communities and incremental contributions from our joint venture communities, and a $0.002 per share increase in FFO resulting from the full quarter contributions of our recent acquisitions. This aggregate $0.075 increase is partially offset by $0.025 incremental impact from our second quarter ATM activity. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt to EBITDA at 4.6 times and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.4 times. As of today, we have approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity comprised of approximately $300 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding under a $900 million unsecured facility. At quarter-end, we had $302 million left to spend over the next three years and our existing development pipeline. And we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022. Our current excess cash is invested with various banks earning approximately 25-basis points. At this time, we'll open the columns to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Thank you, Ric and Keith. I know you mentioned that July is on track to be one of the best months you've ever seen. And I thought it would have been clearly the best. But I'm wondering what period the most comparable to this is to? And what may concern you, whether it's affordability, rents, income ratios, or suppliers or something else?
Ric Campo: I would say that we've never seen this kind of demand released into the market in our business careers. I mean, you can go to the financial crisis, you can go to the big bust in the '80s and we've never seen this kind of snapback in demand in the history of our business, I think. So it really is unprecedented. I guess what could sort of slow it all down or stop it or whatever is what's going on with the pandemic today, that uncertainty in the market today about how the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus is going to happen. Again, I'm going to unwind over time is probably the biggest thing that concerns me. Supply has always been the issue, people worry about and supply - the demand is so high today than supply, we're not building enough apartments today, if you can imagine that saying that that to take up this demand. So it's definitely unprecedented. We're going to enjoy it. Well, it's here. And hopefully, it looks like 2021 is going to be a really, really strong year. And when you sort of look at the backdrop, it looks like next year is going to be the same. Keith, you might want to add a little bit of there.
Keith Oden: Yeah. So just the last question that John asked was the concerns and mentioned affordability. And in our portfolio, we're still running about 19% of household income that goes to rent payments. So it's been in the 18% for the last couple of years, so maybe ticked up a little bit. But the reality is that our residents had the ones that have are not impacted by directly from a job standpoint, COVID. Their wages are increasing as everyone else's are. So yeah, the rents are going to go up, but my guess is that that we're going to see some pretty significant increases in household income as well. And we start from a place of great affordability.
John Kim: Okay, my second question is on developments. You quoted the yields are trending higher and some of the projects completed. But I was wondering where the development yield stands today on your current $907 million pipeline? And how much bigger you'd envision developments going forward as far as overall pipeline?
Keith Oden: Sure in the $900 million pipeline, our yields ranging from five to six and three quarters. And so it's pushing up on an average of roughly five, three quarters to six in total. And that's initial yields. All the IRR is are in the 7.5% to 8.5% range. And that's really instructive when you think about what's been going on in the capital markets are our weighted average cost of capital, given everything that's going on, it's been driven down to the mid-fours. And we're delivering development yields in the mid-eight. So we're creating the spread between our weighted average cost of capital and our development today, it's been the widest that I've ever seen it. And maybe after the financial crisis, we did some transactions right after the financial crisis, we're making 10. And today, - and our weighted average cost of capital is obviously much higher in 2011 and '12. We have roughly $720 million in our pipeline today. And those yields - we're not protecting mid-sixes or high-sixes like we have now. But you never know, given the current revenue line that we have going up high into the right. So the other challenge to those yields will be just cost and getting the right workers. We do have worker shortage instruction and supply chain disruptions that are still a big issue out there. So most of our developments in that $720 million pipeline are in the middle five to five and a half, with IRRs that are there in the seven half to eight range. In terms of - we also are adding to the pipeline. We would like to - development as a great business right now. Obviously, margins have been widened dramatically by the low interest rates and low cost of capital. So we are trying to add to that pipeline as we speak as well.
John Kim: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.
Neil Malkin: Hey everyone. Good morning, and congratulations on the $150 share price. Unbelievable. First question, can you talk about really - I think the thing that's driving some of this is in migration trends. Clearly people are voting with their feet. Can you just discuss if you've seen any changes acceleration in terms of the percentage of new leases that are from odd date or from higher cost dates, et cetera. We heard that this earnings season that you're seeing an uptick from already elevated levels to sort of new highs in terms of incremental demand from out of state. So any color will be great.
Ric Campo: So if you look at a year ago, about 15.6% of our new leases came from folks moving to the Sunbelt from other areas. Today, that number is about 19%. So that's a 350-basis point increase and folks moving from non-Sunbelt markets to the Sunbelt markets and renting with Camden. So really fairly dramatic increase on that side.
Keith Oden: Now thing I would add to is, when you look at - I'll take Houston as an example. Houston was our slowest market and our most difficult market because during the pandemic, and after the pandemic, because of the oil and gas influence of Houston. When you look at the number of jobs that have been added back in Houston relative to Austin or Dallas, or Atlanta or some of these other markets, it was at the bottom. And in spite of those jobs are a lot of jobs aren't being added back at the same rate as other markets, the Houston market is bouncing back at not as strong as some of the other markets but an amazing way. And part of it is this in migration. People believe fundamentally that markets that have pro-business governments that are - that have decent weather and job growth opportunities that they're moving there. Even if the jobs aren't as buoyant today, they're still moving to those markets. And I think that's one of the things that's really pushed up all the demand side of the equation in all of our markets including Houston.
Neil Malkin: Yeah, that's great. Maybe just talking about the acquisitions or recycling. Obviously, cap rates are very low sub-four. But your AFFO cost equity is also in the mid-to-high-threes. Your leverage is lowest in the industry. Just wondering, given the expectations for outsized growth in Sunbelt markets, and I'm sure your conviction in that thesis as well. Would you look to dive a little bit more into the acquisition market kind of using your currency, picking up some leverage, which you have clearly the capacity to do? And just kind of increase your growth?
Ric Campo: The answer is yes. And we sort of showed that in the second quarter when we issued $360 million out of the ATM and brought $300 million in properties in Nashville. As sort of the best match funding we can see with the numbers you just put out, that you just discussed. When we look at, we look at the incremental sort of dilution rate if you issue equity or bring up debt towards acquisitions and development and but that's not the ultimate arbiter. What we really do is we look at the most important measure from my perspective, and our management team's perspective is our weighted average cost of capital relative to our terminal unlevered IRRs. And those are unlevered IRR, today, when you look at our weighted average cost of capital, it's been driven down obviously through rally of the stock price that tenure treasury being at 1.24% today, and bond price, bond yields being where they are. So when you look at a mid-fours weighted average cost of capital and we can acquirer a properties like in Nashville. And even though they're lower going in cap rates, when you look at it on a on an unlevered IRR over a seven to 10 year period, 6.5% unlevered IRR when you put in these kind of rent growth that we're having. And I would tell you that 150 basis points positive spread on acquisitions is rare in REIT land, and so that shows - I think it's a green light for growth both in the acquisition side and the development side as long as we manage our balance sheet appropriately. And you've heard me and our management team Keith and Alex talked about this that our targeted range from debt to EBITDA is five to four times. And during - sort of during good times and strong capital markets, you drive your debt-to-EBITDA down and you get closer to the four during tougher times or bad times, recessions, pandemics and capital market hiccups, it thrives - it sort of naturally goes up when cash flow has declined or interest rates rise. And what have you and that's where it kind of go mostly to five. So today we're in good times obviously strong capital markets very, very strong operating fundamentals and this is a strong spreads between our weighted average cost of capital and our unlevered IRRs. So we're going to methodically grow our company in this way. And today we already done $300 million of acquisitions way more to come. And as I said earlier, our $720 million development hopefully get a lot of that starting next year. And this is a time where it's pretty good time. So we're going to make hey while the sun shines.
Neil Malkin: Yeah, that's great. Congrats on a good quarter and keep up the great work.
Ric Campo: Thanks.
Keith Oden: Thanks Neil.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC.
Rich Anderson: Hey, good morning. So I guess 15% increase in rent is improving lives of people. But I am curious is that market or is that Camden plus market because of all the bells and whistles that you can offer people that your competition can't? I just wondering - and I'm referring to the July renewable activity or releasing activity.
Alex Jessett: Hey, Rich. That's total revenue. So that includes our technology package and all the other amenities that we provide our residents. So yeah, it's all in revenue. And you sort of looking back to the beginning of the year and then looking at asking rents currently. And as to whether it's improving their lives or not, we have - it's a three-legged stool, we are going to improve the lives of our residents, our shareholders, and employees. And so clearly, we're improving the lives of our shareholders. We've done so much over the last two years to improve the lives of our residents with our resident relief program and all the other things that we did. Obviously, some of that growth is reflects the fact that early on in the pandemic, we were the first company to across the board freeze rents on renewals, and the leases. And so obviously, there's some take back of what kind of could have occurred, had we not done - had we not made that conscious decision to allow our residents some slack in the midst of the early days of the pandemic. So yeah, it's the real numbers. And it's strong. And if you look out, as you look out - YieldStar, all these recommendations are being driven by our revenue management systems. And YieldStar is forward-looking after 90 to 120 days. So I think that this trend is likely to continue.
Keith Oden: Yeah, I would just add. Ric, you made the comment about improving their lives. I mean, we are. There's a candidate advantage, no question. And you don't get people to increase their rents that substantially and smile at the same time, without providing value proposition to that customer. You have to have clean grounds, you have to have well maintained properties, you have to be well located. All those value propositions support driving rents the way we're driving them today. Because our customers understand that we're a business and we need to improve our bottom, our top-line and our bottom line are for them to create value for themselves. If you look at the apartment industry, go down the scale of sort of more affordable housing where you have, I say, more affordable meaning less cost. But the quality of the housing as you go down with owners that don't understand these should reinvest in your properties, and you should make sure that they're clean and they're safe and all those things. That does really improve the lives of those customers. And the good news is our customers are all doing really, really well. When you think about our average income is about 100 grand, but the challenge with that number is we don't update it when somebody renews their leases. And when you think about the wages for people that are growing over 100 grand or are actually growing pretty substantially. And those folks all got stimulus money so they don't have money in their pockets. And they understand that the price of things go up. And as long as the value proposition is there and you took care of and during the pandemic and you can take care of them on an ongoing basis and you do well with that, they're willing to pay a higher price. It's like anything else the brand proposition is about is this price worth this brand? And you can always buy something cheaper. You can go to a lower quality apartment and get a less rent but you don't get the Camden experience.
Rich Anderson: I didn't mean to put you on the defense I was -
Keith Oden: That's okay. It's not defensive, that's just selling the right way.
Rich Anderson: Of the 14.6, how much of that is rent. And the reason I ask is when Alex mentioned 11% blended expected for the rest of this year. Is that also a fully baked in with fees and all and everything else? Or is that just pure rent? I'm just trying to get a direction off of that 14.6 that you started with July?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. So the 11% that is pure rent and 14.6 blended rate that we're talking about that is on a rental rate basis. We do pick up other fees, and those other fees are growing slightly north of 3%.
Rich Anderson: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Keith. I mean it's hard to have underperformers when you're up 15% in July. But when you take a look at the markets, if you're forced to rank order them, what are the markets that are sort of towards the bottom on a relative basis, performance wise? And what differentiates them from the guys that are sort of a step up from them these days?
Keith Oden: Well, if you rank them only, just looking at the 14.6 blended rate. And you just go down and scan down to the bottom, Houston is probably still at the bottom. But you're talking about instead of where it was in the first quarter, or fourth quarter of last year, it was still basically flat to down maybe 2% from the beginning of 2020. Houston now has a substantial positive and you're somewhere around 7% or 8%, up in Houston. So it if it weren't for the fact that the rest of the portfolio is producing as high as 20% trade out. Everybody would be applauding the fact or we would be applauding the fact that Houston is at 7 or 8. If you if you force it to be relative, there's always going to be somebody at the bottom that these are extraordinary growth rates in every single market that we're in.
Alex Jessett: I guess I'd say that the worse market that was DC - where DC proper where there's a ban on any rental increase.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then I mean, in terms of that, when you look at it. I mean, how much of the big jumps here are the removal of concessions versus - so on its effective rate versus at the end of the day pushing rental rate. Like where are the markets that you're pushing the market rate the most? And it's not - part of it's the removal of concessions and or the jump in occupancy that's driving the market performance?
Keith Oden: Rob, we don't use concessions. And the only time that we ever use any concessions is on new developments. And that's part of - it's just part of the marketing process and the expectation of residents. But outside of our development pipeline, we don't have any concessions across Camden's portfolio. So it is pure rental increases.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then Alex, did you push a bunch of operating costs into the first half of the year? Curious as to how you go from 58 same store expense growth in the first half, to sort of the 375 implied at the midpoint of guidance? How the back half sort of folds out for you?
Alex Jessett: Yeah, absolutely. It's entirely based upon tax refunds. So to give you the numbers in 2020, we had about $2.3 million of tax refunds. They entirely came in the first half of 2020. In 2021, we are anticipating the exact same number, $2.3 million of tax refunds entirely coming in the second half of the year. So it is just a timing issue around tax refunds.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, thanks, guys. Appreciate the time.
Keith Oden: You bet. Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Curious on the acquisition pipeline, how large you expect Nashville to be in the near term.
Alex Jessett: We'd like to get Nashville up to 3% or 4%. In the near term. When you start looking at economies of scale and efficiencies, we need - we really need to have 1500-2000 apartments to actually get to that efficiency level. And so we definitely are going to be aggressive in Nashville and continue to push there.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then are there any other new markets that you may be entering over the next year or two?
Alex Jessett: Right now we'd like our markets. And in the interest in Nashville has been good so far. So we're pretty good with where we are today for now.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. Can you provide a bit more of an update on your disposition timing? And where are you seeing buyer interest in pricing in a market like Houston relative to your prior expectation?
Keith Oden: Alex go ahead and talk about timing.
Alex Jessett: Yeah absolutely. So in our model, we are assuming the dispositions happen on November 1. We have two assets in Houston that just hit the market. We've got another two assets in PG County, which are going to hit the market next week. So it's a little bit early to sort of give any updates on pricing. Although we certainly expect that we're going to do much better than the original strike prices we had when we first went out.
Ric Campo: And our conversations with the brokerage community specifically around Houston, in the last 60 to 90 days. I think it's clear that the word is out that Houston rents are really, really accelerating hard. And so I think what they're telling us is a whole lot more interest just generally in Houston. As outset, we'll have to wait and see how it all plays out. But, clearly the improvement in Houston overall, is going to be a real positive for selling assets.
Amanda Sweitzer: Yeah, that's helpful. And then apologies if I missed it, but where do you stand in terms of receiving payments under rent relief programs? Do you expect any payments and how meaningful could potential evictions be in California for you once you're finally able to process them at this point?
Alex Jessett: So I'll sort of hit ERAP, which is just the payments that we're receiving. Grand total for us is, we're right around $4.1 million year-to-date. And obviously, most of that came in the second quarter. So we're starting to get - we're starting to get some traction. We're finally starting to get some reasonable traction in California. Although California is making up about 20% of our ERAP payments and is about 70% of our delinquency. So we certainly have a ways to go there. And then the number two market for us, which is interesting, because it has one of the lowest delinquency levels is Houston, which is also right around 20% of our collections. So we don't have any assumptions, any significant assumptions for ERAP payments coming in throughout the rest of the year. But as we've talked about, we've got sort of an $11 million receivable. So obviously we're going to keep working the process and hope to get some additional payments in.
Keith Oden: Of course as that $11 million receivable I think we've reserved like $10 million of the 11 right, Alex?
Alex Jessett: That's correct.
Ric Campo: Yeah. So we get payments. It'll be upside not downside. Now your question about evictions in California, the thing that's really interesting to me about the whole debate over evictions, and I was watching CNBC or CNN or someone last night talking about 12 million residents in America are going to get evicted when the CDC moratorium comes off. And I think that there is a risk of mass evictions, but that the risk is not in Camden's portfolio or any public company's portfolios. If you look at 70% of our receivables in California, those receivables are rent strikers. Those receivables are people who know that you don't get - there is no penalty for not paying Camden or anybody else to rent. And zero penalty. There's no late fees, there's no interest, there's nothing. And I also saw Gavin Newsom on the on the news last night as well, making the statement that if you haven't paid your rent for 12 months, and you have a quote unquote COVID reason, the State of California is going to pay your rent. And so when people hear that there's this confusion that, that if you owe rent for more than 12 months in California, the government's going to pay it. But the bottom line is, is that the $45 billion of the U.S. government allocation of money for renters has restrictions on it. It has means testing, it has a lot of restrictions. And those restrictions by the way, are what is why that - only about 10% or a little less than 10% of money has ever reached a resident yet in America. So are our people driving Tesla's, leasing $4000 a month apartments in Hollywood who have $100,000 in cash in their bank account aren't going to get ERAP money. And the question will, will be ultimately what happens to them? We've reserved against it. And ultimately, those people are going to destroy their credit. And when they figure that out, maybe they'll take some of that money out of their bank account that they have, and pay their rent. It will be interesting to see, but at least for us, it's not going to move the needle one way or another. Maybe all of a sudden, everybody in California pays their rent. We'll have a $5 million, $6 million or $7 million benefit. But it's not enough to move the needle. And we don't think ERAP is going to be a big thing for us overall, because our residents don't need the money. The money needs to go to people making $50,000 or less and needs to go to people that are paying $500 to $900 a month in apartment, it's not $1500 to $4000. So that's my little soapbox for government support at this point.
Keith Oden: Yeah. Amanda, I would just add to that. Because I think it's an interesting always put these numbers in perspective. We get pretty - we get probably more agitated - probably it's a moral agitation, not a financial agitation. Certainly I'm speaking for myself, but in our portfolio, we have out of our total 70,000 plus or minus apartments, we have 600 high delinquency residents. And our definition of that is there are three or more months behind on the rent. So it's 1% - a little bit less than 1% of our total resident base. So it's not a huge in terms of numbers, it's kind of big in terms of irritation. But and as Ric said, of that 600 high delinquency or high balance delinquencies, we've written it all off anyway. So anyway, we're going to keep work in the process. And for the residents in our portfolio who are eligible, we're going to make sure that they get taken care of.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks, that perspective was helpful. I appreciate all the commentary.
Operator: Next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore.
Rich Hightower: Hey, good morning out there, guys. I wanted to get your take on the fact that a lot of your competitors are starting to expand into markets that are new for them - not though new for Camden. And what are the methods that you can employ to sort of maintain Camden's edge in owning and operating or even developing in those markets?
Keith Oden: Well, the good news is these your vast markets. They're big markets, multi-billion dollar markets. So I would just say for years and years and years, we had to go to conferences and talk about how we thought the flyover parts of America are really good places to be and that the coasts were not necessarily our cup of tea. And I will tell you our experience in Southern California, which is the best part of California, when it comes to pro-business and what have you, shows that during tough pandemic times it was right move from our perspective to say in the flyover states. So with that said, the markets big market and we love competition. We'll be able to then show just how good Camden's operating edge is against our other public company peers when they start reporting numbers in our markets. So, we welcome to the market with them to the markets. It's great friendly competition and, and come on down.
Ric Campo: Yeah, I would just - I would add to that that the public companies where we compete with them. We all make the market better. I mean, they all use revenue management. They all smart, they raise rents when they should. The lowest common denominator in our business is still third-party managed assets that frankly probably aren't managed very well. So the more high-quality competition we have in a marketplace, the better we tend to do. And the evidence of that been the DC metro area where we've had - we have a significant presence among and with a lot of competition and the other is in California. So it's steel sharpens steel and bring it on.
Rich Hightower: Thanks for the thoughts.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: Hey, everyone, the $450 million in dispositions, can you just talk through the use of proceeds there, just given obviously the Nashville acquisition, we're already funded with ATM?
Alex Jessett: Yeah, absolutely. So we'll use those proceeds for additional acquisitions. Because if you think about the midpoint of our acquisitions is $450 million. And we've done $296 million plus or minus. Additionally, we'll use those for our development pipeline. So at this point in time, we're spending a couple hundred million dollars a year to fund developments, as well as repositions which we're funding and another couple of $50 million a year. So we've got plenty of really sort of accretive uses of the capital.
Brad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then just thinking about these 14% 15% rent increases in July. Like, what do you think that looks like in 2022? Like, next year, if we still see the same supply demand imbalance. Are we going to see still significantly higher than normal rent increases? Are people going to go you just raise my rent 15% last year, I can't do it again kind of thing?
Alex Jessett: Well, we're not going to get into 2022 guidance, obviously. But if you look at some of our data providers, like Ron Whitten, he shows very strong 2022 as well, just the backdrop of reopening and continuing demand in the multi-family sector. So trees don't grow to the sky, obviously. And if you look at the long-term history of multi-family, usually you have - when you come out of a big downturn, either a recession or pandemic, you have multi-year up legs. I think in 2010, we told the market was that we would have the best. The next three years would be the best revenue growth and operating fundamentals that we've had in our business history. And that came true, that was true. '11-'12 and '13 were the best operating fundamentals that we'd ever seen in our business career. Because it was a snap back from but not as big a snapback as the pandemic has been but it was definitely a snap back. So, I would expect based on the history. And unless something dramatic happens, we have a black swan and delta virus, you know, delta variant or something like that 2022 is going to be pretty good here. And then as Keith said earlier residents are not rent poor. They're paying 19% of their income for rent. So, on average if you go back to pre-financial crisis, they're paying in the 20s. And so, we are an affordable market still. And if you look at our average rent, it's $1500. And so for $1500 or $1600. So with that said, there's a 15% increase sounds like a lot than it is, but on a relative basis to the income growth that we're seeing. And as long as you're giving the value proposition to the resident, they accept it.
Brad Heffern: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. Hey, morning down there. So two questions. First of all, if we hear you correctly, you didn't really have any concessions in the portfolio. So it's not like you're copying rents off of a really low base of last year. Yes, there's more population moving in down to the Sunbelt, or to the Free States, whichever terminology that people want to use. But yeah, that continues. But still, the mid-teens rent spreads that you guys are getting in the acceleration. Just trying to understand that better, is that just something that there's a tonne of jobs, or suddenly everyone who doubled up last year just wants to be back. It just seems like everything is great, but at the same time, the magnitude of that demand just seems incredible. So I'm just trying to understand. Because again, it's not coming off of a really weak comp. It's like you guys were going 80 miles an hour, and now you bumped up to 120 miles an hour, and which is a pretty strong increase for a rate that was already going at a good rate down the highway.
Ric Campo: Yeah. The way I look at it is this. And we've had this debate in-house and talk to data providers like Ron and others. What we kind of settle in on is this, if you think about what happened pre-pandemic, we were having the best quarter that that we had a long time. We have positive second derivatives and most of our markets except Houston, in terms of revenue growth. And we were looking at 2020 has been a - kind of a step up in growth year from a - sort of that also ran years in '18-'19. So with that said, that demand just shut down. It was really good demand coming in the door, then that shutdown. And during that period too, if you look at some of the demographic numbers, we still had a million people that were - that should have been in the rental market that were not in the rental market. When you look at the millennials that are either doubled up or living at home or whatever that was at the beginning of 2020. So all that demand shut down. And then if you think about demand in 2020, any new demand that would have come, like in migration, or even people graduating from college or just coming into the marketplace in 2020 didn't happen. And then all of a sudden, you look in 2021, you have vaccines come into play, the masking goes away and help and all these places open up. So you now have 2019 demand coming to the market, 2020 demand coming into the market in 2021 demand coming into the market. All at the same time when the light switch went off at the beginning of or maybe the middle to the end of May. And so with that you've got - you just have people who were probably potted up with people they didn't necessarily want to be with. And they have plenty of money in their pocket through stimulus and job increases and all that. And they're all hitting the entrance at the same time causing occupancies to spike and therefore rents the spike as well. I don't know Keith if you have any.
Keith Oden: So the only thing I would add to it is, I wouldn't think of it as trying to explain 16% and how that works in the first six months of 2021. Because if you think about it in 2020, we were on track, when COVID hit, we were going to blow our budgets away. And we were budgeting up 5% or 6% on top-line revenue growth and we're going to kill those. And then COVID hits and it goes to zero. We froze rents, we froze renewals. So we missed an entire year of rental increases instead of our residents. And so I think we probably would have ended up 6% or 7% in 2020 ex-COVID. So some of this 16 is just a clawback of the rental increases that we didn't achieve in 2020, specifically, because of COVID. And if you live that way, now you're trying to explain, 9%-10%, which is still a crazy number. But we've seen that before. We've seen 9% 10% top-line rental growth coming out of the great financial crisis and going back to the tech wreck. So that level is not unprecedented in our world. But I think it's probably a better way to look at it.
Alexander Goldfarb: And so what you were saying earlier about this spilling into next year. It just means that with basically three years' worth of demand this year, it's going to take into next year to at least satisfy that.
Alex Jessett: I think that's what our data providers are saying. Yeah.
Keith Oden: It's not a onetime shot. Usually it's a methodical process.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Second question is obviously a lot of new competition, a lot of new entrants coming down to the Sunbelt to your markets. But I was sort of curious, you said that development spreads are the widest they've been? We do hear that in industrial but apartments, I'm a little surprised just given land costs, shortage of labor materials appliances, all the fun stuff. So do you believe that going forward, you're still going to maintain that really wide spread to development and the five and three quarters yields on new stuff or those comments were more on existing projects. But on a go forward basis, those yields are likely to temper maybe two five or something like that.
Ric Campo: Well, I think I said under our $720 million that we have in our pipeline that our developments yields are in the low-to-mid-fives. And I think we're going to maintain those. And we might even do better because of revenue, as revenue growth is so strong in these markets that our revenue projections will probably have more than offset costs increases. In terms of spreads, the reason the development spread is so high today is not that the yields have gone up, it's that the weighted average cost of capital has gone down. And cap rates have gone down. So if you're a merchant builder, and you're budgeting at 150 basis point positive spread on your development which is more a normal spread on development and you look at today and you're selling, you're selling let's say a 5.5 at a 3.5 cap rate, or 3.25 cap rate, you increase your spread. And it's primarily been driven down by the compression of cap rates. And when I talk about our spread being wide, it's because partially we are doing better on some of our developments from a yield perspective. But mostly, it's being driven down by our lower weighted average cost of capital. And so that's where the spread has been going down, I think that it is still difficult to buy land today and to make the numbers work. But when you look at the supply numbers, I mean, there's at least 400,000 units or 350,000 to 400,000 units that are getting sort of permanent every year that are making their numbers work.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Listen, thank you, Ric.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks, guys. You've historically talked about jobs to completions as a barometer of strength and fundamentals. So I'm curious what your revised outlook for this year is? And certainly, it sounds like jobs alone isn't really enough to explain some of the strength. But can you give us that figure? And then also, what ratio kind of the third-party forecasts are projecting for next year?
Alex Jessett: Yeah, so in terms of total supply, deliveries in Camden's markets in 2021 is going to be about 160,000 apartments over the entire footprint. That's roughly in line with what it was last year. And then if you look at Ron Whitten's work in 2022, we still end up with something around $165,000 our unit range in terms of deliveries. If you look at the numbers this year, it makes complete sense in terms of the ratio. In fact, it looks pretty bullish. You get numbers like seven to one on the 165 deliveries. But I think it doesn't make a lot of sense to think of it that way, just for 2021, you almost have to go back and look at MATCH 2020, where the job losses occurred and then add to it the recovery. We're still - in many of our markets, we're still not back to the employment levels that we were going into the pandemic. And yet here we are with the kind of demand that we've seen. And I think it's all the reasons that Rick talked about earlier in terms of just releasing a lot of pent up demand. But if you look traditional numbers, you would look at 2021 and 2022, and say, these numbers look really bullish overall. I think you got to temper that by the losses in 2020.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then with everything that you guys are talking about, on the development side, and the spreads and attractive cost of capital. I mean, it seems like developers might be licking their lips a bit. So really, where are you seeing the most activity from a permitting perspective or shovels in the ground that could move that supply and demand more towards equilibrium as you look maybe two or three years out?
Keith Oden: I guess it's complicated, looking two or three years out. Because for the last five years, we've looked out a year or two and said, well our supplies peaking, and because of either cost pressure or banking pressure or whatever. And it's never peaked. It continues to make its way up. So I think that - and the last numbers I saw from Ron shows, starts coming down in 2023- 2024. And I think that this is the time in the world where it's really hard to figure out what's going to happen a year from now or two years from now. I know that how is the ultimate tapering and the great experiment of massive fiscal and monetary policy. When that's turns around what's going to happen and how is that going to affect everything? And I don't think any of us know. That's why we want to be conservative in our business going forward. But at least from now, every market is at peak supply. And it doesn't seem to matter from an occupancy or a revenue growth perspective. It will matter at some point when - if we go into other jobs slowed down or some another recession. Obviously, that's when the world - that's when things change. And we'll just have to see. But right now, at least the next 18 months to 24 months things looks like that supplies not going to abate. It's going to continue to be pretty much high in every market. You do have some markets that are higher than others like Nashville and Austin, but then you look at the rent trade out in Austin and Nashville today. And it's at the highest - some of the highest rent trade outs we have in the market. So I don't know the answer, ultimately, but we'll obviously have to wait and see.
Ric Campo: Yeah, Austin, RealPage is our provider for permit data. The permit data is the most - I would say the least precise or reliable just because you're sort of forecasting behavior into the future. But on their numbers, they've got permitting activity of 170,000 apartments in our markets this year, and 169,000 next year. So again elevated activity, but I don't think these numbers reflect the most recent compression in cap rates. And they probably don't reflect the real updated cost numbers. So we're still in a race between cap rate compression and cost to build.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it? Appreciate the thoughts, guys. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street.
John Pawlowski: Hey, thank you for keeping the call going. Just one quick question for me. A few months ago, obviously, your cost of capital was a little bit different. So just curious how you thought through issuing equity versus selling a building too?
Ric Campo: Sure. So as I said earlier, the cost of capital has come down. And when we think about our capital structure, we think about our debt to EBITDA being between five times and four times. And it seemed opportune we're going to issue equity when it's an all-time high prices. And it was time that we issue. And the challenge with issuing equity oftentimes is that. And when you decide to do it relates to you know, blackout periods and those kinds of things. Because we don't have the flexibility that regular investors do in terms of buying and selling because of those blackouts. And so we're blacked out 42% of the time, in order to execute transactions like that. We will continue to recycle capital. So to me, it's not a one choice either you issue stock or you issue debt, or you sell assets. It's a combination of those three things that produce capital. And ultimately over the long-term, you have to layer in all three of those activities. We all know we have $100 million, roughly free cash flow and on a $16 billion company, it's hard to grow the company with $100 million a year. So the only way you can grow the asset base is either through equity or debt issuance. And on balance, the question of whether we sell assets or issue equity relates to what is the weighted average cost of capital? And what does that look like on a long-term basis? And when your weighted average cost of capital mid-fours and you can put acquisitions on your books at six or better, you should do that. We were going to continue to recycle capital through sales of properties and acquiring other properties. But when the capital markets are conducive to putting long-term accretive transactions on the books, like we have done in Nashville, that's the time that we issue equity.
John Pawlowski: And now I understand putting assets on the book and developing given the cost of capital. But for the better part of last year, the transaction mark color you've been sharing is signaling pretty sizable NAV discount not today, but several months ago. So just felt like selling assets are a cheaper source of funds than your common stock.
Ric Campo: Yeah, I think with cap rate compression the way it is, and that's why we're selling assets. We put up $150 million budget together at the beginning of the year to sell and a $450 million to acquire. And that's when our stock price was $95 a share at the beginning of the year in the way average cost of capital was north of 5. So things changed and the world of capital markets changed between the first year and now and we made the decision to issue equity along with that existing program. So, I mean, hindsight is always perfect. So last year when the stock was 62, if we could have executed a massive sale of assets that at a low cap rate and bought the stock that would have been opportune. But unfortunately, it didn't stay there that long. And this complication of, of not being able to execute 100% of the time makes it more difficult to do both those kinds of transactions both on the buy and sell.
John Pawlowski: Okay, understood, thank you.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey, guys. Hope everyone's doing well, I just kind of curious on how you're thinking about the kind of leasing season as we head into the fall. It just seems like it's going to go on for longer than expected and whether or not that influences your decision to kind of push rate a lot harder than you normally would, at this time of year?
Keith Oden: I think that if you think about our revenue management system, YieldStar is a forward-looking tool. And it's really basing, its most of its calculations on that using the levers, which is primarily price, and looking at 90 to 120 days. So the pricing that is being recommended by YieldStar, both on renewals and new leases and we're very disciplined around our revenue management system, 95% of the recommendations we take. And it's rare that we have an exception to the recommended YieldStar rates. What that tells me is, YieldStar thinks the market clearing price, that will maintain our occupancy rate north of 96% is 16% increases, looking out 120 days. So YieldStar will continue to push as long as the conditions on the ground permitted.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. And just curious, kind of any tweaks you have to make for next year, just given the change in seasonality or the revenue management system? Just kind of automatically adjust for that?
Keith Oden: No, the revenue management system is - the tweaks that we make are around sustainable occupancy levels. Occasionally we get up or down and then YieldStar adjust the price to make that happen over a period of time. Very small adjustments, but over looking at 120 days. The good thing about YieldStar is you don't have to be able to do that calculus, or have your property managers do any calculus around what's the market clearing price 120 days out that's what YieldStar does.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: A Thank you for taking my question. I know it's been a very long call. Just to follow up on the last question, I wanted to better understand the lease expiration schedule I guess the next couple of quarters. How that's been impacted by all the leasing that's been done and the COVID disruption and how that's playing into your thinking about the sustained strength of revenue growth near term?
Ric Campo: Yeah, there's always seasonality in our rent roll, but it's not dramatic. But so fourth quarter and first quarter are always - we have fewer transactions, fewer occupancy. Vacancies come available, just because there's less traffic in most of our markets. But it's not dramatic. It's a couple of percent flip flop between first and fourth and second, third quarters. And again, that's within the YieldStar model that it calculates that and maintains those exposure levels at optimized rates.
Haendel St. Juste: I understand that. But just want to better understand if there's anything about the number of units coming available that was meaningfully different in the next couple of quarters than say prior years during the same period.
Ric Campo: I don't think so.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay, thank you. And then the other question I had was I guess you've been pushing rates incurring a bit more turnover. Curious, your sensitivity there on incurring a bit more turnover? How much would you be willing to get comfortable to incur? And you're also pushing renewals more and more aggressively, wondering how much more you think you can push renewal here. Any municipalities or regions like say DC, California with a bit more sensitivity than pushing as aggressively another project portfolio?
Ric Campo: Well, in DC proper, we can't increase rents. So we were effectively frozen for rental increases in DC proper. In California, there's some recent legislation around rent control, but when you dig into it, it's CPI plus 6% plus or minus. And in most cases out there we're not impacted by that. So again, all of the math around recommended rental increases, it's not like we sit around and do what we think we feel like we should be doing for rental increases. It's all driven by the metrics within YieldStar. And we take those recommendations.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Okay, great. Well, we appreciate you being on the call today. Those of you who are left, sorry, went so long. But we try to answer all questions. If we didn't get this something on your list, we're available. So please give us a call or email Kim or call Kim and we'll get back to you. Thank you very much. And we'll talk to you next quarter or when the conference season starts after Labor Day. So take care. Thanks.
Keith Oden: Take care. Bye.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2021 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will attempt to complete our call within one hour as we know that another multifamily company is holding their call right after us. We ask that you limit your questions to two and rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks Kim. The theme for our earnings call music was have fun. We've always believed that our Camden teammates do their best work when they're having fun. That's why 25 years ago, we chose have fun as one of our nine core values. Having fun is an essential ingredient of maintaining a great workplace. When your team is having fun, they have smiles on their faces, which puts smiles on our residents' faces, which ultimately makes our shareholders smile. It's a formula that has allowed us to earn a place on Fortune magazine's 100 Best Places to Work With for 14 consecutive years with seven top 10 finishes. Just recently, we're pleased to announce that Camden placed number eight on this year's list. Creating a culture that encourages folks to have fun, requires consistent, intentional focus, especially during the pandemic. Over the years, we have created traditions that support having fun from skits and lip-sync contests, the fun videos that deliver important messages to our teams. The pandemic allowed us to come up with new ways to maintain our culture in the new work environment. Camden’s culture is our superpower that allows us to consistently perform at the highest level. And as Peter Drucker famously said, culture eats strategy for breakfast. Our earnings call platform allows us to share videos and enhance our messaging. Here's an inside view of one of the many cultural messages that we share with all of our Camden teammates this year and now with you. [Video Presentation] During the first quarter, we saw operating strength building in most of our markets. Clearly, the opening of the economy driven by the speed at which the COVID-19 vaccinations have been distributed has improved our results for the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. This has led us to increase our net operating income and our FFO guidance. As tough and strange as the pandemic made last year, we have used the time to advance many initiatives that will drive revenues, lower expenses and improve performance in key areas. To list a few, our investments in Chirp funnel and other AI opportunities will accelerate self-guided tours, virtual leasing and apartment package deliveries and keyless communities, all driving better customer experiences while increasing revenues and lowering expenses. Our investments in our cloud-based ERP systems have made remote working seamless, it streamlines data mining, moving us closer to the Internet of Things. It creates for a more robust ESG analysis and reporting on our ultimate carbon footprint reductions that we'll publish later in the year, we would be publishing a more expanded ESG report in the fall. I began the call with a discussion and a video on culture. We continue to do the right thing at Camden, moving forward on the journey to a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. Last summer, when there was great uncertainty, we advise our teams to focus on things they could control, get in the best health of their lives, embrace their friends and family as true partners with masks, proper social distancing, and vaccinations, of course. We also asked our team members to take care of our residents and each other and not to listen to the noise around them. We told them that the pandemic would pass and the years after would be great for our teams, their families, and our business. We see the light ahead and it's not a train. I want to thank our team Camden, your families for helping us get from there to here. Thank you. And I'll turn the call over to Keith.
Keith Oden: So we’re very proud of the fact that Camden, that we have been included on Fortune magazine's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For, for 14 years. It's an incredible accomplishment that reflects the fact that each of you takes pride in the workplace and continues to work hard, to make Camden a great place to work. So a lot of people think about the Fortune list and the Camden's culture and all the things that we do to support being a great workplace. And a lot of people look at that and they say, what they see is expense and cost. And what we see is investment. We're investing in our brand. We're investing in our people, we're investing in our culture. And ultimately, we think those things are far more important than the small amount of impact that the expenses that we have around maintaining Camden as a great workplace actually matter. And one of the ways to look at that is, is that we track our Camden's 20-year investment return against the S&P 500. And it's proof positive that creating a great workplace also creates great results for your shareholders. Over the last 20 years, Camden Property Trust has produced an annual return for our shareholders of over 11%. And the S&P 500 was about 7.5%. So almost 4% per year better than the S&P 500 for a 20-year period, that's pretty incredible. And we think it's directly attributable to the investment that we make in our culture and our people and making Camden a great place to work. So thank you for all you do. And thank you for being a part of this great company for all this period of time. Now, a few details on our first quarter 2021 operating results, same property revenue growth was down 0.4% for the quarter, and as expected our top performers who are located in our Sunbelt markets. With Phoenix at 5.8%, Tampa up 4.0%, Atlanta 2.2%, Raleigh 1.9% and Denver routing out the top five list at 1.3% up. Rental rate trends for the first quarter were slightly ahead of plan with sign leases down 0.8%, renewals up 3.4% for a blended rate of 1.2%. For effective leases, which were generally signed in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter, the blended rate was 100 basis points lower at 0.2%. Our preliminary April results indicated improvements across the board for sign new leases, renewals and blended growth, averaging 4.5%, 4.7% and 4.6% respectively. Future renewal offers are being sent out on average at over 5%. So our blended rental rates moved up from 1.2% in the first quarter to 4.6% in the month of April, this 340 basis point improvement exceeded our budget and was the primary reason for raising our full year revenue guidance. It's worth noting that Houston showed the fifth best improvement in revenue reforecast among all of Camden's markets and we now expect Houston revenues to be only about 1.5% down from last year. Occupancy averaged 96% during the first quarter of 2021, which matched our performance in first quarter of 2020, and was the highest quarterly up level achieved since the pandemic began. April 2021 occupancy has accelerated to 96.6%, exceeding our original budget and expectation and setting us up well for our peak leasing season, which has begun and generally runs through early September. Net turnover for the first quarter of 2021 was 200 basis points lower than 2020 at 35% versus 37% last year, marking yet another quarter of high resident retention and fewer residents choosing to move. Move outs to purchase homes dropped to 16.9% for the quarter versus 19% last quarter, which is in line with our seasonal patterns we usually see from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of each year. Next up is Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the first quarter of 2021, we commenced construction on Camden Durham, a 354 unit $120 million new development in Durham, North Carolina and we began leasing at both Camden Lake Eola, a 360 unit $125 million new development in Orlando and Camden Buckhead, a 366 unit, $160 million new development in Atlanta. Subsequent to quarter end, we began leasing at Camden Hillcrest, a 132 unit, $95 million new development in San Diego. In the quarter, we collected 98.4% of our scheduled rents with only 1.6% delinquent, this compares favorably to the first quarter of 2020, when we collected 97.9% of our scheduled rents with a higher 2.1% delinquency. Turning to bad debt. In accordance with GAAP, certain uncollected revenue is recognized by us as income in the current month. We then evaluate this uncollectable revenue and establish what we believe to be inappropriate reserve. This reserve serves as a corresponding offset to property revenues in the same period. When a resident moves owing us money, we typically have previously reserved all past due amounts, and there will be no future impact to the income statement. We reevaluate our reserves monthly for collectability. For multifamily residents, we have currently reserved $9.2 million as uncollectible revenue against the receivable of $10.2 million. For retail, we are fully reserved against our $2.3 million receivable. In mid-February, Texas experienced a significant winter storm resulting in widespread power outages, which led to among other issues, corresponding water damage from broken water pipes, less than 5% of our Texas units experienced any type of damage, with only 0.25% requiring the resident to temporarily vacate their home. Today, the vast majority of the damage has been fully repaired and operations have returned to normal. We are extremely proud of the efforts of team Camden in responding to this unprecedented event. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2021 of $125.8 million or $1.24 per share, $0.01 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $1.20 to $1.26. The $0.01 per share variance to the midpoint of our prior quarterly FFO guidance resulted primarily from both higher occupancy and higher rental rates at our same-store and non same-store portfolio, partially offset by the timing of certain property tax refunds in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, which we expected in the first quarter and will now likely not receive until the second half of the year. Contained within our first quarter results is approximately $900,000 of expenses directly associated with the Texas winter storm. Two-thirds of this amount is property level insurance over time and repair and maintenance expense. The remainder is corporate level and tied to relief efforts, including meals provided to our residents. The additional property level expenses were entirely offset by greater than anticipated amounts of unrelated insurance subrogation proceeds. Last night, based upon our year-to-date operating performance, our April 2021 new lease and renewal rates and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we have increased the midpoint of our full year revenue growth from 0.75% to 1.6%. Additionally, we have increased the midpoint of our same-store expense growth from 3.5% to 3.9%. This increase is entirely to account for additional property level salary expenses now anticipated to result from our reforecasted full year revenue outperformance. As a result, we have increased the midpoint of our 2021 same-store NOI guidance from negative 0.85% to positive 0.25%. Our 3.9% revised expense growth at the midpoint assumes insurance expense will increase by approximately 22% due to the continued unfavorable insurance market. Property insurance comprises approximately 4% of our total operating expenses. Additionally, our revised expense growth assumes that salaries and benefits will increase by 3.5% as a result of additional compensation tied directly to the now reforecasted revenue outperformance. The remainder of our property level expense categories are anticipated to grow at approximately 3% in the aggregate. Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2021 FFO guidance by $0.09 per share. $0.07 of this increase results from our revised same-store NOI guidance with the remaining $0.02 per share increase expected to be generated by our non same-store portfolio. Our new 2021 FFO guidance is $4.94 to $5.24 with a midpoint of $5.09 per share. We also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2021. We expect FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.22 to $1.28. The midpoint of $1.25 represents $0.01 per share increase from our $1.24 in the first quarter of 2021. This increase is primarily the result of an approximately $0.01 per share expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, resulting from higher expected revenues during our peak leasing period, partially offset by related compensation expenses, the seasonality of certain repair and maintenance expenses and increases from our May insurance renewal. As of today, we have just over $1.1 billion of liquidity comprised of approximately $260 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding under our $900 million unsecured credit facility. At quarter end, we have $358 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline and we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022. Our current excess cash is invested with various banks earning approximately 25 basis points. And finally, as I have discussed on prior calls, in 2019 and 2020, we set in play important technological advancements. 2021 will be the transition year that will lead to realize efficiencies in 2022, 2023 and beyond. From cloud-based financial systems to virtual leasing, to mobile access to AI technologies that allow us to meet residents on their schedule, we are poised very well for the future. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Alua Askarbek: Hi everyone. Congratulations on a great quarter. So I just wanted to start off a little bit big picture, asking more about the transaction in the market. I know you guys were guiding to about $400 million to $500 million. So how are you guys thinking about that now that we are about four or five months into the year and what opportunities are you seeing out there in the market?
Ric Campo: Well, definitely we are seeing opportunities, the challenge however, is the pricing is way, way beyond what we expected. The good news is, since we have a balanced disposition and acquisition program, we expect to get higher prices for our properties are going to sell. And so we're going to try to make that trade. If you go back to our last big acquisition disposition programs in the last cycle, we sold a lot of properties, bought a lot of properties and we’re able to upgrade the quality and the – quality of the portfolio over time. But that will tell you, I've never seen cap rates this low in my business career, I'll give you an example of real time property that we’re working on last week in Tampa – this week in Tampa, I just got the e-mail yesterday. So the original price talk for this reasonable property in Tampa, it's a middle of the road new development, decent property, we'll call it an A minus price talk at the beginning of the process was $77 million plus or minus, which would have been in low 4 cap rate kind of right at 4-ish. The price – the property was awarded at a little over $90 million which is a going in a cap rate of 3.2%. And what you – with a 3% growth in revenue over a seven year period the only way you get to a 6 IRR is to have a 3.75 exit cap rate. Now that's what properties are trading for in every major market in America today. So I think we'll be able to sell properties and buy properties, but the spread, I think between older and newer is definitely going to be really tight. And it's a good trade for us and we'll continue to do that. But pure acquisitions are pretty tough if you don't have a disposition behind it to try to capture that newer property and capture the lower CapEx part of the equation, that's why we would be doing it in the first place.
Alua Askarbek: Got it. Thank you. And then I think you guys commented a lot on how you wanted to enter Nashville. So what are you guys seeing there in terms of cap rates on the transaction market?
Ric Campo: Same. The cap rates are pretty tight in Nashville, too. Nashville is an interesting market because when you look at its supply side, it has probably the second most supply coming into the market. And so I think that of any other city in the country, so we're still – we're looking really hard in Nashville and we're actually – our teams are going to be out there next week and we're actually going out to live in a few properties next week as well. We think we'll be able to move into Nashville this year. And again, it's you – you can acquire properties and we can acquire properties, you just have to pay up today, it's – again, as long as we're selling properties at really high prices and buying properties are really high prices, I'm okay with that. And I think we'll be able to execute in Nashville.
Alua Askarbek: Okay, great. Thank you. Good luck with that.
Ric Campo: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.
Neil Malkin: Hello everybody. First question, can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of in migration in some of your markets, your kind of larger Sunbelt markets, obviously, COVID has kind of been the great accelerator for that. And just wondering if you people on the ground are telling you that they continue to see that in earnest, if it's accelerating, if it's kind of steady? Any commentary on kind of like where that's coming from, what markets are the biggest beneficiaries?
Ric Campo: Yes. So Neil, we continue to see elevated levels across our platform, but it's not new. I mean, we've had in migration going on and that has been exiting the Northeast and parts of California, mainly Northern California for the last decade. But clearly it's accelerated, and I would say the markets that we have – that’s the most impact and most visible right currently are in Atlanta, everywhere in Florida. And again, that's mostly a Northeastern phenomenon. In Austin, Texas, I would say that's the place where anecdotal evidence of out-of-state license plates in particular, California is pretty incredible. The trends in some of our markets around home prices that I think are exhibit characteristics of kind of people coming in and being willing to pay up, in Austin, Texas as an example, it has the highest spread between asking price for a single family home and selling price. So in the last 12 months, the average price – sales price in Austin, Texas for a single family home is 7% above what the asking price was. So it's just, these are kind of crazy numbers historically that we've never seen before, but I think it is indicative – continues to be indicative of people finding incredible housing value in our markets relative to the markets that they're exiting. So I think it's just a continuation of what's been going on, clearly it's accelerated, and I don't see, I'm not – a lot of people I think or some people think that this is strictly a COVID related increase. I'm not so sure that that's true. So I think the trend that's been in place a long time and continue probably at elevated level. Neil, if you look at the census numbers that came out, Texas came two congressional seats, California lost one, New York lost one, you go up into the rust belt and a lot of those States lost and Florida gained. And I think we have seen an uptick in Phoenix and in Florida for sure. But I think this was just a continuation, I agree with you totally, that the pandemic is the great accelerator. And I think what will really be interesting will be once the States are open, right, because California talks about being open, but it's really not open yet. And I mean fully, right, so when we get to a real pandemic is in the rear view mirror, then the question will be how – what happens over the next couple of years when people actually do have the ability to work from home and just use their laptop as their office, right? So I think we're in a good position and we've always wanted to be in these markets because there are pro growth markets and great weather and low housing prices that drives migration.
Keith Oden: So I would add to that, if you look at most of our new residents come from Sunbelt markets, but if you think about non-Sunbelt markets, New York is our number one non-Sunbelt provider of new Camden residents.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Thanks for that. Other one for me is maybe bigger picture, talking about cap rates coming down, and we've talked to brokers pretty much in all of your markets and sub-4 is like the name of the game. And when you think about your portfolio, it's a great aggregated, diversified portfolio, ridiculously low leverage compared to anything private, a lot of growth avenues there. Is there, I mean, do you think that there should be a rerating, or is it fair to say that cap rates on the public side need to come down or they're justified being lower? And if nothing else, the spread between coastal and Sunbelt should be compressed at least over the next several years and not the cycle.
Ric Campo: Well, if you calculate at the Camden's NAV based on the current cap rate environment, I mean, we have a spreadsheet that shows sort of various cap rates and what we think our NAV is. And if you use the Tampa number, we don't have that number on our spreadsheet, okay. I mean, we go to like 3.5 cap rates and we stop. And so, clearly the question will ultimately be, who is right, right, is it the private market that's right or the public markets are right. And we've had this debate forever that the public markets sometimes act as real estate and sometimes act as stocks and right. And so when the stocks get hammered, it's not because somebody is thinking about their NAV relationship to the private market, they're just selling the stock because they have an ability to buy some other stock that's going to go up faster or have whatever the reason for that trade is. I think we're trading more like stocks today for sure, and less like real estate. When you think about why somebody's paying a low 3 cap rate in Tampa, I think it's pretty basic. Number one, the 10 years at a very, very low rate, you still have positive leverage when you finance using a 10 year, let’s say 2.5 or a 10 year mortgage at 2.5 or doing some change and compared to 3.25 cap rate, you have a 100 plus basis, maybe a 90 to 100 basis points of positive leverage on that trade, and then you think about the worry that people have with the current sort of trajectory of trillion dollar here, a trillion dollar they're fed and government stimulus and everything else is going on out there. And you hear the word inflation, and you hear the word, oh, what happens, long-term inflation wise, well, multifamily, we price our property – our leases every single night and our leases roll over, where the fastest roller of lease type other than hotels and 8% plus of our leases roller very month, right? So it's a great inflation hedge if you're worried about that. And when you think about private capital, looking for a yield, multi-families a pretty good place to be in, and the supply and demand side of the equation is pretty much balanced. You have great job growth going on in most of these markets. And once the markets are opened up, I think the coastal markets will do fine, it'll just take more time for them to get better than it does, like the markets that have opened up. So I think that's why cap rates are really low. And I wouldn't say that the private side is crazy right now and clearly the gap between real cap rates in the private sector versus the public sector is – there is a bigger spread I've probably ever seen in my business career at this point. So who's right?
Neil Malkin: Yes. Well, obviously could you just – and what is the 3.5 cap translate and due?
Ric Campo: Well, I mean, you can do – you can look at just the NAV from the consensus NAV right now, it's like $119 a share. And it's like four – three quarter cap rate or something like that. For every 10 basis points in cap rate is like $2 a share, so you do the math. I'm not going to put a number out there, but I'll – but it's about that $2 a share for every 10 basis points.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey good morning. Good morning down there, and Keith, nice job deejaying this morning on the tunes. So two questions, first, obviously there are a lot of articles about the impact of the unemployment, the extended unemployment benefits was talking to a guy does business across a lot of different states. And there is feedback that people won't take a job because they're getting paid more to sit at home. In your portfolio, and I don't know how much of that was a driver of your need to increase the property level payroll, but are you seeing across your markets that sort of the economy is being held back, because people aren't taking jobs or we should read into it that the 4.5% rent increases that you guys got in April is an indication that if two different groups and the impact of the extended unemployment benefits has really no real impact on your guys' ability to perform, basically what I'm asking is as these benefits expire, would we see an acceleration of your portfolio or the two are not related?
Ric Campo: I think the two are related, but not directly, because if you think about the people that are unemployed today that are receiving benefits – government benefits, those are people making, I think a vast majority of make under $50,000 a year. And those are folks that are working in hospitality areas and things like that. And they're making 30% more by staying home than they are going back to work. Restaurants, for example, I was driving out yesterday afternoon, I saw a restaurant that had help needed in every position, $500 signing bonus if you come in, right. And so that is holding back some of the economy from that perspective, but our average income is over $100,000, so most of our folks are working, they're continuing to work and doing well. The biggest issue holding us back from a higher revenue growth are restrictions on increasing rent, certain markets like in California and in Washington D.C. And so our top line number would be higher by at least 50 basis points if we didn't have those restrictions in place in my opinion. So I think that once the economy opens more in these other markets and we get past this CDC restriction and the cap on renewals and things like that, then the multi-family business should be really good in the next six, eight, 10 months, once we get rid of the – get past that piece. In terms of people, our increase in costs for salaries today are not so much driven by – we can't find employees, but it's by outperforming their original budgets, so we have to increase our bonus accruals for them.
Alexander Goldfarb: We definitely like hearing about bonus accruals going up, so that's a good thing. The second thing is on the development side, obviously you guys have pared back your program tremendously over the years. But as you look at new markets like Nashville, or just try to deal with rising construction costs, are you guys seeing more opportunity to put Camden capital to work like funding other developer’s third-party and then do it as a takeout? Does that sort of mitigate risk or allow you to broaden your net or your view, is that you really want to do development on your own, because from start to finish, you feel that holistically it's a better risk proposition?
Ric Campo: I think that doing anything that isn't 100% Camden owned with Camden control that’s more risk not less risk to the process. And you can't really move the needle on – at least my – our opinion is you can't move the needle on driving revenue and driving new development deals really by doing JVs or doing equity programs or whatever you want to call them. And we still have the sting from a $3 billion joint venture program during 2008 and 2009, where our partners wanted us to default on debt so we could buy the debt back cheaper. And that was we – when we did those joint ventures, the $3 billion didn't really move the needle for Camden, but what it did is it, it created more risks when the market turned down and we had challenges with dealing with our partners, even though they were all deep-pocketed, they didn't want to bring any cash out of their pocket. So we're going to keep our balance sheet pristine, we're not going to do deals like that. Other companies have different views of that, I get it, but that's not Camden.
Keith Oden: And Alex, just on your point about the size of the development pipeline, if you take what's in lease up currently, plus what's under construction, we're close to $1.2 billion in new development. So we think we've been very opportunistic about taking advantage of these – delivering these yields into a declining cap rate environment that's going to create a ton of value. So I think $1.2 billion is about equivalent to our all time high in terms of a development pipeline. So we definitely see opportunities everything that we're working on right now based on kind of cap rates that’s in play for acquisition assets look like they're going to be really accretive.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just sticking with construction. What are you seeing on the cost side, both for the in place development pipeline also as you price out feature starts?
Ric Campo: So prices are up big time. If you look at – so let's take two periods of time, take April of this year – April of 2019 versus April 2020, costs were up 2% or 3% maybe and some markets actually flat. In the last 12 months since April of 2020 versus 2021 multifamily costs in total are up about 12.5%. And it's all primarily driven by, well, there is three big drivers, one is just commodity prices, if you look at soft lumber prices in last 12 months, soft lumber is up 83%, plywood is up 53% OSB board is up 65%. Even fuel, when you think about gas – fuel, diesel, gasoline is up 50%, 60%. Labor issues are there, supply delays – our supply chain backups are making products more difficult to get. And so the speed at which you can develop is slower. So it's a tough environment out there when it comes to cost. And good news for us is we did a walk in lumber packages on a several jobs that we had. So we don't have a lot of exposure on lumber at this point. We did lock in about 70% of the package, I really give kudos to our construction folks and our commodity sort of consultants for helping us navigate that – this tough water here. So we don't have – Camden doesn't have a big exposure to this big price increase, but it does affect the way we underwrite new transactions obviously, and it becomes more and more difficult. But I guess on the one hand with cap rates compressing as much as they are the spread on what you can buy an asset for versus what you can build it for a day, even with a cost increase is still pretty wide. And so, that's why you're going to continue to see new developments continue, even though the going in yields are going to be down the spread between what you can sell and buy for is still pretty robust.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just on the rental assistance plans. How do you think that impacts Los Angeles and Orange County specific to you?
Keith Oden: Well, it doesn't – so far it hasn't affected us in a positive way at all. And part of it is the – all of the various qualifying elements that you have to go through. And [Technical Difficulty] that our resident base does not qualify or has not qualified for any meaningful amount of rental assistance in particular in California, but that's – it's a little bit different market to market, we do have some markets where we've gotten a couple of $100,000 in rental assistance. But overall, this entire – if you take the effect of delinquency, the effect of not being able to get people moved out who are not paying their rent. Overall, the whole event has been a pretty significant net negative for us around the margins. And by that, I mean, we're now at about $9 million in receivables and that's about $8 million and then what we would normally carry in our receivable. So we hope that over time, a couple of different things will happen. We hope that as the – if the CDC mandate is not extended, which it's currently out to June 30, and I guess it's anybody's guess as to whether it will be or not, but if that is not extended, then we should be in a position to start getting back control of our real estate. And we think that's going to be very helpful and kind of whittling away at that $9 billion in receivables. But overall in our portfolio, that ERAP is not been particularly helpful because of the income of – average income of our resident base. So we'll see if in this next tranche there is fewer restrictions on how that gets used, but I'm not terribly optimistic about that.
Ric Campo: One of the challenges that you have in all this is that federal government puts this money out, there is – in the last two stimulus, the one in December and the one that happened in February $46 billion was allocated to rent assistance, which is a huge number, obviously. And to-date there is been just a minute fraction of that money going out. And part of it is that the government requirements to check the box, we were having a meeting with our California folks, and I think the last number I heard Keith was, that we've had to send out 10,000 pages of documents to our residents in California. And it's like what, and so it's all this massive just government requirements to say, you got this right, this right, this right, this right and here's what you can do. And when you start talking about 10,000 documents, what do you think those people are doing in those apartments are picking that document up, looking at it for the first paragraph and thrown it in the garbage. And so the challenge you have is that government requirements are tough. In Houston, for example, we’re involved in designing the first set of programs for apartment rent relief here. And we streamlined it, we gave out $70 million of money in Houston, Texas and did it really fast. And at the end, we ended up with $10 million more by the end of the year and we couldn't give the $10 million out, so we had to give it to the food bank, otherwise, based on government regulations, you'd have to give it back to the federal government if you didn't spend it. So the challenge you have with all this stimulus and these things is that, it's really hard to get the money out to people. And the people that are hurting are not the $100,000 households, the people that are hurting are the $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 players that are in C&D properties, that aren't back to work and are not getting stimulus money and what have you. And those are the ones that are the hardest to get check the box on, once they get tight, once they go through a website and you don't have all their information, they just leave and they don't – so you're losing them. So it's a challenge, and those items I think our industry has done a great job of trying to help the most vulnerable people in the multi-family space, but they just don't live at camp and then they don't live at most of the public companies apartments.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Thank you. You guys look great on video.
Ric Campo: Thanks.
John Kim: I had a question on the occupancy pick up you had – I had a question on the occupancy pick up you had in April to 96.6%. Were there any particular markets that drove that figure higher? And do you expect it to remain at this level for the remainder of the year? Or do you expect it to trend back down to 96%, which is where you operated back in 2019?
Keith Oden: Yes. So I think that if you look at our pre-lease numbers and go out 30, 60 days, the indications are pretty good that we'll stay above 96% for the next couple of months, obviously, we're coming into the best part of our leasing season. The strength was across the board, so just to put some perspective around it, we did – we obviously did a complete reforecast to support our change and increase in guidance. And of our 14 markets, if you look across our portfolio, the bottom up re-forecast revenues went – revenue projections went up in 12 of the 14. So the only two markets where revenue did not increase was San Diego and Orange County, LA. And the reason for that was – has nothing to do with the underlying strength of the market, which are both really good right now, it has to do with bad debt. So we continue to have a challenge in California with regard to elevated levels of bad debt, because we can't – because of the CDC, eviction mandate and all the rent strikers that we have in our portfolio in Southern California. So absent those two, which by the way we're very – only slightly negative on reforecast because of bad debt. Without the bad debt in California, we’d have been up on all 14 markets. And I don't think I've in my career ever seen a reforecast done where all 14 markets had a positive revenue impact in a reforecast. So I think it's strength across the board. And if you kind of – if you go to the top level of revenues in the new reforecast, we now have out of 14 markets, we have 13 that have positive revenue growth for the year. The exception to that is, I should call out in the opening comments is Houston and Houston is down to 0.5% negative total revenues for the year. And I can tell you that our Houston folks are working their tails off to get off that list, because they're the only one that has a negative number for the revenue reforecast, all the other 13 markets are really well positioned for peak leasing season.
Alex Jessett: So John, we've got seasonality in there, but our reforecast assumes that we're going to have 96% occupancy for the full year. Obviously, it's higher occupancy in the second quarter and third quarter coming back down in the fourth quarter, but to compare that to our original budget that's a 70 basis point improvement.
Unidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Thank you. And then on the cap rate discussion, we saw some of that cap rate compression was offsetting income, but at times, like that's not the case. But on that exit cap rate that you quoted on example in Tampa at three and three quarters, is the view that if cap rates are going to remain low because of rising construction costs, or is it the potential that the rental growth assumption that you quoted a 3% was a bit conservative? 
Ric Campo: Well, I think cap rates are a function, not of construction costs going up because that project, by the way, at the price that I stayed at the 90 million price, it's 18% above replacement costs. So replacement cost is not a bogey today that investors are looking at, what they're looking at is what kind of cash-on-cash return am I gonna get from this real estate? And a three, two cap rate is the competitive market today. And so whether when you think about how you do an IRR, right, an unlevered IRR has three components, what you buy in at, what your cash flow grows at and what you exit at. And so for years, the question of what is your exit cap rate seven years out, has been – that's like the argument about what's real CapEx, right. New development, you put in 250 and you know it's not that long-term, but that's what people use. And so ultimately, what will drive the exit cap rate will be the environment at the time. And we know what drives price of any asset is first liquidity, how much liquidity is in the market. And we know today that there's massive liquidity in the market beyond belief liquidity. The second thing that drives cap rates and prices is – and these are in the most important order is supply and demand. What's the business look like? Is it excess supply? Long-term how you feel about supply and demand dynamics relative to being able to drive net operating income or cash flow growth in the market today, supply and demand is pretty much imbalanced. You look at imbalance from – just from that perspective, in most markets. And so when you look at supply and demand, it's good, then the next is inflation. And then people have this inflation view or worry that you could have inflation. And then the last driver is interest rates. Lot of people think interest rates is the number one driver, but it's actually liquidity, supply and demand inflation, and then interest rates. So with that backdrop, cap rates are where they are because that really the first two issues, I think, and then maybe a little bit of an inflation issue. So who knows whether a three and three quarter cap rate is the right number in seven years, but I guarantee you, that's the only way, if you want a 6% IRR, unlevered IRR in seven years, that's the only way the math works.
Unidentified Analyst: So, Ric, are you concerned that people are underwriting between three quarters, or it sounds like you think it's rational at this point?
Ric Campo: No, I think people have been – if you want to compete in the market today and you have capital to place, multi-family is a coveted asset class for lots of reasons we talked about before. And so if you have capital that has to go out and you go, where's the alternative investment, if I can't – if I don't like a three, two in Tampa with the growth profile and everything that we talked about, then where are you going to put your money? You're going to go and – we're only 25 basis points on $300 million bucks right now in cash. The government is penalizing us because of the Fed and everything else going on, penalize anybody with cash. And so when you think about a cash flow stream that can grow, can be inflation protected, where it's a cash flow stream that people – it's hard to disrupt, right, because everyone needs a place to live. You can't live on the internet, or you can't discern mediated by technology or whatever. You can improve it, improve its production with technology. But everybody has to put their head down and go to sleep at night in some place. They may not need a kitchen, but they definitely need a bathroom. And so with all that said, it's just – it's the whole argument about why our asset prices, where they are and whether – what's your alternative from an investment perspective. And right now, multi-family looks good and people are willing to pay three, two cap. And as long as your weighted average cost of capital long-term is good. And you're making a positive spread on your weighted average cap cost of capital long-term, then go – that's why people are doing it. So I don't think it's wrong. I just think it is.
Unidentified Analyst: Interesting stuff. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. Following up on guidance, can you provide an update on the blended lease rates and bad debt assumptions that underlie your increased ranges?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So I think probably the best way to think about it is if you compare it to what we originally thought for blended rates when we did our original budget, we are increasing that by 50 basis points. So the math sort of works like this, our occupancy is up 70 basis points. Our blended rental rates are up 50 basis points that gets you to about 120 basis points. The offset to that is we are assuming that we're going to have slightly higher bad debt. That's entirely driven by California. And the fact that when we did our original budget, we thought AB-3088 was going to expire in beginning of March. Now it looks like that's the beginning of July at the earliest and so you've got sort of an offset from that. And so we think that our bad debt is going to be about 160 basis points for 2021, which by the way is in line with what we had in 2020. But if you compare it to 2019, which was a normal year that number would have been about 50 basis points.
Amanda Sweitzer: That's really helpful. And then on dispositions, are you still targeting sales in Houston, DC today and given some of your cap rate comments, have you changed the assumed cap rate spread between acquisitions and dispositions in your guidance at all? I think you were previously fuming about 150 negative basis points spread.
Ric Campo: We are still targeting those two markets, yes, in terms of dispositions. And I think we'll probably – in our guidance, we're continuing to use that same spread. And hopefully, we'll do better than that based on what we're seeing and hearing today where you likely will do better than that spread, but we kept that 100 basis points negative spread in the model. Alex, I'm pretty sure we did.
Alex Jessett: That's correct. Absolutely correct.
Ric Campo: I think the real variation in the model between the buyer and the sell will be timing, right. And that'll be an interesting – so there may be some timing differences given where things are, but and hopefully we will do better than that negative spread. Right now, it looks like we will, but that's what we used in the model.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Appreciate the time.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: Hey, everyone. I know we're at the top of the hour, so I'll just keep it to one. I was wondering if you could just talk through Houston, it was a little surprised to see the sequential rent growth down almost 4%. I know, obviously COVID didn't necessarily break that market and COVID leaving isn't going to fix it, but is there anything that you're seeing there that gives you optimism as we go forward, whether it's energy recovery, or supplier, anything else? Thanks.
Ric Campo: Yes. So the big challenge that we have in Houston right now is not – it's not employment related jobs that come back quicker than most people thought. The energy business is definitely getting better. It takes a while, but there's a pretty big lag between improvement in price of crude versus improvement in employment prospects in Houston in the energy business. But the issue in Houston is just supply. And we've talked about last year we dealt with about 20,000 new apartments that got delivered in Houston. This year, we're going to get another 20,000 apartments delivered. And unfortunately, a lot of those are in, they're not distributed geographically very well. So they end up – everybody, all the merchant builders sort of built in the same places. And we definitely are catching a fair amount of shrapnel from the lease up. So the merchant builders in the downtown area as well as uptown and midtown, so that it's more of a supply issue for Houston. We do get some relief next year, thankfully in terms of new supply. And overall, I would tell you that the general vibe of recovery in Houston is, I mean, Houston's open, people are out, restaurants are busier than I've ever seen them. So it's pretty robust – the feeling right now in Houston is pretty robust. So I think we'll do well as the – we'll do better as the year ensues. I think I shared with you, our reforecast for revenue growth in Houston is only down half a percent from last year. And then if you'd have told me, I certainly wouldn't have made that bet six months ago and we didn't when we were putting together the guidance. But that to me sounds extremely encouraging for our Houston portfolio relative to original expectations.
Keith Oden: I think also just to add onto the Houston story, the winter storm had a bigger effect on Houston than it did on the rest of the state and primarily because of what it did to petrochemicals and the plants in and around the ship channel. I mean, there are plants that are still – primary chemical plants that are still offline that are just getting geared up from the winter storm. So the winter storm definitely helped Houston back. It could have been a whole lot better in Houston, I think without the winter storm. And we're just – like I said, we're just starting to get that back. I think the other thing that's really interesting about Houston is the discussion of energy transition and what's going to happen with big energy and how big energy is going to make the transition from old school energy to more renewables. And we've seen a major acceleration of discussions by the large energy companies. And part of that is driven by investor activism. If you look at ExxonMobil as an example, I mean, I own Exxon’s stock. So I see all their proposals that these activists had put on their – in their votes and what have you. And finally, the U.S. majors are making a major move into this energy transition that Exxon, for example, just announced $100 billion carbon capture program that could go in and around the ship channel. And it's $100 billion to build it. It needs to be part of the government – maybe it's part of the government stimulus or infrastructure or whatever, in addition to Exxon putting their capital in. But I think there's going to be continued huge investments in these alternatives and wind and solar and carbon capture and Houston is going to lead that. So we're going to be in a position, where it's not old school energy that drives this market. It's transition energy, Texas already has the largest wind power source of electricity than of any state in the country. And we're investing massive amounts of solar. You saw Tesla has a big battery plant that a battery program that they're doing just south of Houston. So it's going to be a really interesting thing. So to me, the winter storm held us back, but once we get through the supply, Houston should be move up to the top quartile of our revenue growth in 2020 – middle to the end of 2022 and into 2023 and 2024 in my view.
Alex Jessett: And I'll also point out if you look at sequential occupancy increase, the largest sequential occupancy increase we had was Houston from fourth quarter to first quarter, it increased 110 basis points.
Brad Heffern: Yes, fair enough. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you. Just sticking with the theme there on Houston, I was curious if the positive guidance revision there was more just around that sequential uptick that you just diluted to an occupancy or are you also seeing a little bit better traction on lease rates as well? And then maybe, Ric, to your comment on when you think Houston starts to get better, is it probably mid-2022 by the time we've absorbed some of this peak supply?
Ric Campo: I think that's the peak supply side, plus you'll start getting better job growth in a more normalized environment, because what happened in Houston is you had the normal COVID unfortunately, call it normal COVID, job losses, right. But what's happened, you also have the oil and gas pounding, right. Last year at this time, I think oil and gas was within a few weeks of when negative, right. And so that was a huge issue here. And I think that that's over obviously. And that once we get a more normal environment in Houston and a more normal business environment where people are actually traveling for business and Houston will improve. When you look at visitors to Houston in conventions and things like that, it's more of a business destination than it is a tourism destination. And so I had a lunch with the head of the convention group that markets Houston's convention business last week. And they said – he said that starting in June, there are 18 citywide events. You have the world petroleum conference coming in December, which is a international event that was supposed to be last December, but it's going to be in December of 2021. And so once we get more momentum from the business side and the business travel side, we will – Houston will move quicker to that recovery, but I don't think that's – I think that's a mid – the end of 2022 event because of the supply.
Keith Oden: If you look at blended rates for signed leases from the first quarter of 2021 to April of 2021, Houston improved by 420 basis points. So still not an incredibly strong number, but an incredibly strong improvement.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. That's really helpful. And then Alex, just to clarify, on the 50 basis points increase in lease rate assumption, same-store revenue guidance, is that reflect simply leases signed at this point, or does it also assume higher lease rates kind of through the balance of the year?
Alex Jessett: Yes, it does. So it looks at what's effective for the first quarter signed today and signed today is obviously going to take you through the second quarter and a component of the third quarter, and then our expectations for the rest of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: That the lease rates in the back half of the year on both renewables and new leases are also higher than your original expectation?
Alex Jessett: Correct.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street.
John Pawlowski: Thanks a lot for keeping the call going. Just helping to better understand how the internal dialogue around share repurchases has evolved. Call it second half of 2020 and even early this year, you enter the downturn with a really well-positioned balance sheet. And suddenly all the only real dislocation comes it's growing your share price and that the private market is remained rock solid. You still believe you're trading at a substantial discount NAV and you've got a bit better clarity really since the summer on operating fundamentals. So just curious why you haven't taken advantage of the well-positioned balance sheet heading into the downturn on the share repurchases side?
Ric Campo: Well, the challenge that we have with share repurchases is that the windows that we can buy – or buy back shares is that that they're fairly narrow and what happens oftentimes, like when you think about the – we bought like $62 a share or something like that. And of course, we started talking about, okay, let's back up the truck, right. But on the other hand, then all of a sudden, the shares start moving up. And when you think about – when I think about share buybacks, it's like, okay, I want to be able to buy a lot of shares. I don't want to just go tickle around the edges and do 5 million, 10 million, 20 million or something like that. And so to me, it has to be persistent down and we have to have the ability to acquire enough to make a difference, because fundamentally, when you think about reap balance sheets and how we manage our balance sheet, we're a leaky bucket, right, in the sense that all of our cash flow or – not all of it, but most of it has to be paid out from dividends. And so when you're buying stock back in, unless you can make and get a big enough chunk to make a difference, I think it's just a kind of a waste of time. And so if you look back at every time that we've gotten to a point where we looked at the numbers and said, this looks like a really good price. It's gone up dramatically in the – and away from us in the windows that we can acquire the stock. So it's not that we don't think about it a lot. We do. But on the other hand, there's constraints on doing it, just are oftentimes just not worth the effort in my view. If it's the investors, if we buy the stock back and people go, they think it's cheap, then that's one thing, but you can make your own decision where you think it's cheaper, not in buy or sell it. And to me, it's a real capital allocation issue. If you think about when we did buy back stock big, it was when we had long-term periods and big open windows and one point I think we bought 16% of the stock back at the peak. And that was when the stock was low for months and even years and today it's just not – you don't have that opportunity.
John Pawlowski: I just mean more from the relative decision, right. So you put a dollar into a kitchen and bath or a dollar into your stock. It's just a relative decision. I mean, more talk about the second half of 2020. I mean, if you believe your NAV, whatever 130 or above, and you had that visibility in the private market side. And there was a good six, seven months where you could be selling assets and repurchasing shares. So it's just more that the dollar is fungible and it is an opportunity to cost the non-acting, I guess the final question.
Ric Campo: Yes. You can always do that, but I just think at the end of the day we're long-term, multi-family – long-term owners of multi-family properties. And so there's a lot of friction that goes in between selling assets. And if I could wave a magic wand and sell assets immediately and then – and have no risk of the execution and then buy stock and make a spread, yes. But the world doesn't work that way. There's a lot of execution risk involved in it. And it's something that when we talk about – when we started talking about doing it, then I don't want to borrow money or use the current strength of the balance sheet and then to buy stock and then go sell assets after it. So I hear you though, it's an asset allocation issue. And we I think investing in our existing assets, creating returns that we think are pretty attractive. That's what we've been doing. 
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you for the time.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates.
Alex Kalmus: Hi, thank you for taking the question. Over the pandemic, we've seen the renewal and new lease spreads pretty wide and your April signings. They seem to reach some parody there. Can you talk about the dynamics on the leasing side and how you're approaching that? Obviously, the occupancy is called through? So it's been a good decision.
Alex Jessett: Yes, so we use our revenue management system. You'll start to price both new leases and renewals. So the inputs to the model are similar on both sides. I would actually got a little bit of a timing issue in our portfolio because we actually voluntarily froze renewal increases early on in the pandemic. And we kept them frozen through mid-summer. So some of the natural renewal increases that would have happened are going to happen maybe in a little bit more robust way as we work our way through mid-summer but I think it just on both sides, it tells you that the model is foreseeing and foreshadowing. A lot of strength on both the new lease side and the renewal side throughout the balance of our reforecast period.
Alex Kalmus: Got it, thank you. And just touching on the supply side for a sec. We've talked about Houston, do you have some updates on some of your other markets and how that's progressing the – start of the year has been pretty strong on the activity front? So has that changed how you're thinking about certain markets?
Alex Jessett: No, if you take Witten's numbers for total deliveries in 2020, we were about 100 – across Camden's platform, we were about 154,000 delivered apartments and his forecast for this year is about 151,000. So there's some movement around some shifting among our markets, but in the kind of at 10,000 feet, the supply picture for this year is not going to be much different than it was last year. And with the exception of Houston, which obviously took the brunt of the 20,000 apartments last year, and then backed up with another 20,000 this year, most of our markets are in really pretty good shape fundamentally. And if you just kind of go back to, again, Witten's numbers, he's got job growth this year at $1.2 million, he's got new supply being deliberative about 150,000 apartments. And again, at 10,000 feet, that's eight times new employment growth to deliver supply, five times is a long-term equilibrium. So in the aggregate, those ought to be really supportive for – and look like they are going to be supportive for raising rents and renewals throughout the year.
Alex Kalmus: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Well, thanks for being with us today. I understand that the have fun video was a little choppy for the group in the replay. You'll be able to see it without being choppy and let us know how you like this new format. I think it's kind of interesting and it makes it a little more interactive and sort of helps go through when you're going through a slug and numbers, like we are kind of helps, you sort of follow that. So we look forward to hearing from you on this format. And then we'll see, and talk to I think most of you in virtual form in NAREIT, so coming up in the next couple of months, so take care and thank you.
Keith Oden: Yes. Take care.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's Fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2020 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on the call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will attempt to complete our call within one hour seriously. As we know that another multi-family company is holding their call right after us. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. The theme for on hold music this morning was changed. The COVID pandemic has brought with it sweeping changes in lives of every American, including how they work, where they work, and whether they can even work. Every business has had to change and adapt to this unprecedented pandemic. And thinking about the scope of these changes, I recall that quote from Jack Welch that I heard years ago, which is change before you have to. With only five words, Jack perfectly captured what has separated many companies' abilities to successfully navigate through the past year. Throughout our history, we have grown and maintained a culture that encourages and rewards efforts by Team Camden to change before we have to. Examples include, migrating to cloud-based financial systems over 18 months ago, making work from home seamless for most of our employees, creating a technology package for Camden communities that provides discounted high-speed Internet creating a more robust work from home experience for our residents, implementing a resident package delivery program that requires packages to be delivered directly to each residents front door, creating the same flexibility and convenience enjoyed by most single family homeowners and developing Chirp, a mobile access solution, which we sold to real page last fall. When fully rolled out in 2021, this product will enhance our on-demand virtual leasing and self-guided tours, while enabling unassisted tours and leasing outside of our normal office hours. Residents will also be able to schedule package and grocery deliveries directly to their apartments when they're away from home. We will continue to find ways to change before we have to and everything we do. For the past year, we have utilized virtual meeting platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams for investor and analyst meetings, in industry conferences, and internal Camden meetings. Beginning next quarter, we hope to offer our quarterly earnings calls on a more interactive virtual platform as well. So stay tuned. As we start 2021, our outlook is optimistic. Our assumptions are based on the first-half of the year and during a continued battle against the COVID virus, with ongoing difficulties for many businesses and workers until the country's vaccination rates accelerate. We hope that the second-half of the year will show improvement as more businesses reopen and more people ultimately get back to work. Fortunately, many of our Sunbelt markets in which we operate, have already reopened businesses and added back many of the jobs that were lost early in the pandemic, setting the stage for recovery in the second-half of 2021 and beyond. I want to thank Team Camden for a great 2020, while the operating environment we faced was one of the toughest ever, you had made sure that we improve the lives of our teammates, customers and stakeholders want to experience at a time well done and thank you. Keith, your chance for change.
Keith Oden: Yes. Thanks, Rick. And on the idea of change before you have to, I think, Henry Ford was onto something when he said if I had asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said faster horses. So consistent with prior years, I'm going to use my time on today's call to review the market conditions that we expect to encounter in Camden's markets during 2021. I'll address the markets in the order of best to worst by assigning a letter grade to each one, as well as our view on whether we believe that market is likely to be improving, stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview, I'll provide additional details on our fourth quarter operations and 2021 same-property guidance. We anticipate overall same-property revenue growth this year in the range of down 25 basis points to up 1.75% for our portfolio, with the majority of our markets falling within that range. The outliers on the positive side would be Phoenix, San Diego, Inland Empire and Tampa, which should produce revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range. At the low end of that range would be Houston, which is - which will likely remain in the down 2% range. Expected same-property revenue growth for 2021 is 75 basis points at the midpoint of our guidance range and all markets received a grade of C or higher with an average rating of B for the overall portfolio. Our outlook for supply and demand in 2021 is based on multiple third-party economic forecasts, and in general most firms projected a recovery in job growth in Camden's markets, along with a steady amount of new supply. We typically mentioned estimates provided by Witten Advisors on this call and they anticipate over 1 million new jobs for our 14 major markets in 2021, along with roughly 150,000 new completions. Other economists have projected up to 1.9 million jobs and 175,000 completions. So the outlook seems to be manageable regardless of which estimates prove to be correct. For 2021, our top ranking once again goes to Phoenix, with an average of 5% revenue growth over the past three years and expected revenue growth of 3% to 4% this year. We give this market an A rating with a stable outlook. Supply and demand metrics for 2021 looks strong in Phoenix, with estimates calling for over 90,000 new jobs and roughly 9,000 new units coming online this year. Up next, our San Diego Inland Empire and Tampa, both earning A minus ratings and improving outlooks. With 2021 revenue growth also projected in a 3% to 4% range and both markets produced 1% to 2% revenue growth last year, but are budgeted to accelerate in 2021 given recent trends. Similar to Phoenix, the San Diego Inland Empire market projects nearly 100,000 new jobs in 2021 with new supply of only around 7,000 apartments. Tampa should deliver around 7,000 new units, with roughly 50,000 new jobs being created providing a good balance of supply and demand in both of those markets. Atlanta and Raleigh round out our top five with budgeted revenue growth of around 2% for 2021 and ratings of A minus and stable. In Atlanta, job growth is expected to rebound to over 100,000 with only 7,000 new apartment completions. And Raleigh projections call for 40,000 additional jobs, with completions in the 4,000 to 5,000 unit range. Denver, DC Metro and Austin all received a B plus rating, but with declining outlooks. All of these markets have been strong performers for us over the past several years, averaging nearly 3% annual property revenue growth over the last three years and 2% last year. But we do expect market conditions to moderate over the course of 2021, given steady levels of new supply and increasing competition for new renters. Supply demand ratios in Denver and DC remained steady, with 65,000 and 90,000 new jobs anticipated, respectively, during 2021, with new supply coming in at roughly 8,000 and 12,000 new units, respectively, scheduled for delivery this year. In Austin, new supply has been coming online steadily for several years, with over 15,000 new units expected this year, offset by roughly 60,000 new jobs. In Southeast Florida, market conditions rate a B and improving outlook after ranking at a B minus C plus for the past two years, we're starting to see some improvement on the horizon and prospects for positive growth in 2021. New supplies remained steady over the past few years at roughly 10,000 new units, but 2021 estimates call for 70,000 new jobs in that market this year. Competition from for sale and rental condominiums is still an issue in that market, but we expect slightly better operating conditions in 2021 and an improvement from the down 0.4% same-property revenue growth achieved last year. Orlando earns a B rating with a stable outlook. Job growth is moderated in Orlando given their exposure to travel and hospitality industries. And that trend should continue in 2021. New development activity remains strong so the level of supply should be steady this year with roughly 8,000 to 10,000 completions versus 25,000 to 30,000 new jobs. Charlotte and Dallas both received B minus grades with a stable outlook. Our 2020 performance in Charlotte was slightly better than average for our portfolio. But the ongoing high levels of supply particularly in the downtown and in town sub markets will challenge our pricing power in 2021. Approximately 7,500 new units are anticipated this year versus roughly 8,000 that came online last year and the city should add over 50,000 new jobs. Conditions in Dallas are similar with 17,000 new deliveries expected this year, but job growth estimates are much stronger with over 110,000 new jobs expected. A healthy economy in 2021 should help Dallas absorb the over 20,000 units it's delivered in each of the past few years. But once again competition will be strong and pricing power likely to be limited. We gave LA/Orange County a C plus rating with an improving outlook. Our portfolio in LA County saw higher delinquencies and bad debt in 2020 than most of our other markets, but we're hopeful that conditions will begin to improve, particularly in the back half of 2021. Orange County should perform slightly better, but still not as well as our southern California markets including San Diego and Inland Empire. LA/Orange County faces healthy operating conditions with balanced supply and demand metrics. Job growth should be around 130,000 new jobs with completions of roughly 18,000 apartments expected this year. Houston received a C rating this year with a stable outlook as we expect to see negative rent growth again this year. Estimates for new supply are once again over 20,000 apartments coming online this year. So we do expect Houston will continue to struggle with many new lease ups and getting high levels of concessions. However, Houston's job growth might post decent recovery this year with nearly 100,000 new jobs expected, which would certainly help absorb some of the inventory in our market. Overall, our portfolio rating this year is a B, with most of our markets expected to moderate slightly in revenue growth for 2021 compared to 2020. As I mentioned earlier, all of our markets should achieve between a minus 2% and a plus 4% revenue growth this year, and we expect our 2021 total portfolio same property revenue growth to be three quarters of a percent at the midpoint of our guidance range. Now a few details of our 2020 operating results, same property revenue growth was one tenth of a percent for the fourth quarter and 1.1% for the full year of 2020. Our top performers for the quarter were Phoenix at 5.7%, Tampa at 2.9%, Raleigh at 1.5% and Atlanta at 1.3% growth. Rental rate trends for the fourth quarter were as expected with both signed and effective leases down around 4%, renewals in the mid to high 2% range for a blended rate of roughly down 1%. Our preliminary January results indicate a slight improvement across the board for new leases, renewals and blended growth. February and March renewal offerings are being sent out on an average of roughly 3% increase. Occupancy average 95.5 during the fourth quarter, compared to 95.6 last quarter and 96.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. January 2021 occupancy has averaged 95.7% compared to 96.2% last January and slightly up from 4Q '20 levels. Annual net turnover for 2020 was 200 basis points lower than 2019 at 41% versus 43%. And as expected move outs to purchase homes rose seasonally for the quarter to about 19%, but we're still at about 15% for the full year of 2020, which compares to an average full year move out rate of about 15% over the last four years. At this point I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks Keith and before I move on to our financial results and guidance a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed construction on both Camden RiNo, a 233 unit $79 million new development in Denver and Camden Cypress Creek II, a 234 unit $32 million joint venture new development in Houston. Also during the quarter, we began leasing at Camden North End Phase II, a 343 unit $90 million new development in Phoenix, and we acquired four acres of land in downtown Durham, North Carolina for the future development of approximately 354 apartment homes. In the quarter we collected 98.6% of our scheduled rents with only 1.4% delinquent. Once again, this compares favorably to the fourth quarter of 2019 when we collected 97.9% of our scheduled rents with an actually higher 2.1% delinquency. We do typically see a slight seasonal uptick in delinquency. Turning to bad debt, in accordance with GAAP, certain uncollected rent is recognized by us as income in the current month. We then evaluate this uncollected rent and establish what we believe to be an appropriate bad debt reserve, which serves as a corresponding offset to property revenues in the same period. When a resident moves out owing us money, we typically have previously reserved 100% of the amounts owed as bad debt, and there will be no future impact to the income statement. We reevaluate our bad debt reserves monthly for collectability. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $122.4 million or $1.21 per share, $0.03 below the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $1.21 to $1.27. This $0.03 per share variance to the midpoint resulted entirely from an approximate $0.035 or $3.5 million non-cash adjustment to retail straight line rent receivables during the fourth quarter. This adjustment represents retail revenue, which under straight line accounting, we have previously recognized, but not yet received, and whose ultimate collectability is now uncertain. Over 95% of this amount is from one retail tenant we have been in negotiations with since the summer. As the fourth quarter progressed, it became apparent that significant lease restructuring might be necessary, and we made the appropriate accounting adjustments. Same store net operating income was in line with expectations for the fourth quarter as a slight outperformance and occupancy was offset by the timing of repair and maintenance expenses, higher property tax rates in Houston and the timing of certain property tax refunds in Washington DC. For 2020, we delivered full year same store revenue growth of 1.1%, expense growth of 3.8% and an NOI decline of point 4%. The midpoint of our 2021 FFO and same store guidance is predicated upon our return to a more normal operating environment by mid-2021. You can refer to Page 28 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our financial outlook. We expect our 2021 FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $4.80 to $5.20 with the midpoint of $5, representing a $0.10 per share increase from our 2020 results. After adjusting for the fourth quarter 2020 $0.035 write off of retail straight line rent receivables and the 2020 full year $0.15 to COVID-19 related impact, which included approximately $0.095 of resident relief funds, $0.03 of frontline bonuses and $0.02 of other directly related COVID expenses. The midpoint of our 2021 guidance represents $0.08 per share core year-over-year FFO decrease, which results primarily from an approximate $0.08 per share decrease in FFO due to higher net interest expense, which results primarily from the full year impact of our April 2020 bond offering. And actual and projected 2020 and 2021 net acquisition and development activity and approximate $0.06 per share decrease in FFO, resulting primarily from the combination of higher general and administrative, property management and fee and asset management expenses combined with lower interest income resulting from lower cash balances and rates. And approximate $0.05 per share decrease in FFO related to the performance of our same store portfolio. At the midpoint, we are expecting a same store net operating income decline of 0.85% driven by revenue growth of 0.75% and expense growth of 3.5%. Each 1% change in same store NOI is approximately $0.06 per share in FFO. And approximate $0.04 per share decrease in FFO from an assumed $450 million of pro forma dispositions towards the end of 2021. And approximate $0.02 per share decrease in FFO from our retail portfolio and approximate $0.015 decrease in FFO due to the non-recurrence of our third quarter 2020 gain on sale of our Chirp technology investment. And an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO from lower fee and asset management income. This $0.28 cumulative decrease in anticipated FFO per share is partially offset by an approximate $0.11 per share net increase in FFO related to operating income from our non-same store properties resulting primarily from the incremental contribution of our six development communities and lease up during either 2020 and/or 2021. And finally, an approximate $0.09 per share increase in FFO due to an assumed $450 million of pro forma acquisitions midyear. Our 3.5% budgeted expense growth at the midpoint assumed insurance expense will increase by approximately 30% due to the continued unfavorable insurance market. Property insurance comprises approximately 4% of our total operating expenses. The remainder of our property level expense categories are anticipated to grow at approximately 2.5% in the aggregate. Page 28 of our supplemental package also details other assumptions, including the plan for $120 million to $320 million of on balance sheet development starts spread throughout the year. We expect FFO per share for the first quarter of 2021, to be within the range of $1.20 to $1.26. After excluding the $0.035 per share fourth quarter 2020 right off of retail straight line receivable, the midpoint of $1.23 for the first quarter represents a $0.015 per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020, which is primarily the result of a combination of lower fee and asset management income, and higher overhead expenses attributable in part to the timing of our annual salary increases. We anticipate sequential quarterly same store NOI growth will be flat as the reset of our annual property tax accrual on January 1 of each year and the typical seasonal trends of other expenses, including the timing of onsite salary increases will be offset by anticipated property tax refunds in Washington DC and Atlanta. As of today, we have just over $1.2 billion of liquidity comprised of approximately $320 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding on our $900 million unsecured credit facility. At quarter end, we had $325 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline. And we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022. Our current excess cash is invested with various banks earning approximately 30 basis points. And finally, as I have discussed on prior calls, in 2019 and 2020, we set in play important technological advancements. 2021 will be the transition year that will lead to realize efficiencies in 2022, 2023 and beyond. From cloud based financial systems, to virtual leasing, to mobile access to AI technologies that allow us to meet residents on their schedule, we are poised very well for the recovery. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Alua Askarbek: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions today. So I just want to start off quickly talking about your finance for acquisitions and dispositions for this year. So I was just wondering what are the chances that you're actually able to get to that acquisition amount and kind of what markets are you guys looking at? And there's a lot of activity in 4Q and I guess a little bit more about pricing?
Ric Campo: Sure. So the acquisition disposition program is balanced, right? So we have a midpoint of $450 million of acquisitions and a $450 million of dispositions. We feel pretty confident we'll be able to execute on those transactions. The private market is very buoyant, in spite of new protocol for how you underwrite properties today, given the COVID environment. But the - where we're - the strategy this year is going to be very similar to what we did in the last cycle. If you think about the last cycle, we disposed of roughly $3 billion for properties that were average age of over 20 years, and we acquired properties that were on average at the time, five or six years old. And the thing that was really interesting about that - those transactions is that the negative spread on old properties versus new properties was like 21 basis points in terms of AFFO. And so we think the same thing is going on right now where we'll be able to sell older non-core properties with higher CapEx and then buy newer properties with lower CapEx and better growth scenarios. We will be buying in markets where underweighting. So if you look at some of the markets that we have an underweight in, it would be Tampa, Raleigh, potentially Dallas as well Denver. The dispositions will come from our more concentrated markets and those would be Washington, DC and Houston.
Alua Askarbek: Got it. Great. Thank you. And then just a quick question on collections for 4Q. What were collections like in LA and Orange County this past quarter? And then just any other markets that were at the top range for collections?
Alex Jessett: Sure. So, obviously, LA County and California in general had higher amounts of delinquency. But if you look in the fourth quarter, so LA/Orange County was 7.2% delinquent. San Diego was 5.4% delinquent. That got us to a 6.4% delinquency for California. On the other side of that equation, Houston was 0.4%, delinquent, Denver 0.5% delinquent, Orlando 0.6, Phoenix 0.5 and Tampa 0.4.
Ric Campo: Yes, I would just add to that that California is just a classic example of people can't pay, they just won't. And it's not a function of the California markets are more negatively impacted. It's just a function of the government. Both the state and local governments have just kind of put this - put in the brains of folks that they just don't have to pay. And in all the various legislation and moratoriums and what have you, you just have a group of people that that look at it like getting a free loan from Camden, and ultimately, they will have to pay or their credit will be destroyed. And that'll be interesting to see how that all plays out and how the government responds to that going forward.
Alua Askarbek: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Hi, everyone. Good morning. First question, can you just talk about what you've seen, or the sort of progression or change kind of that’s apt to your music. With regard to in migration from coastal markets, MAA talked about sort of the highest, I think, in history, new leases from people out of state. Just curious, what kind of action you're seeing there? That'd be great. Thanks.
Alex Jessett: No, absolutely. So, as you know, migratory patterns have long since favored the Sunbelt. And we're certainly seeing an acceleration of that trend in this current environment. There are a couple of things that we look at. So for instance, our market score very well, when we look at one way U-Haul data, which is certainly an indicator of which markets are attracting and retaining residents. In fact, six out of the top 10 states for one way U-Haul traffic are where we operate. While traditional maybe we should call them out flow states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts are ranking towards the bottom. So along those lines, although most of our new residents, in fact, do move within the Sunbelt markets, New York is actually our number one non-Sunbelt provider of new Camden residents. And then finally, when we look at Google search patterns, there is a clear uptick in New York residents looking to move south into certain of our markets. For instance, from February of 2020 through December of 2020, there was an approximate 60% uptick in New York residents searching for Atlanta apartments. And the search volume of New York residents looking for Miami apartments almost doubled over that same period. So we certainly are seeing some very favorable trends, which now keep in mind, as I said in the very beginning, this these migratory patterns are the direct funnel out of the East Coast, West Coast and Middle America into the Sunbelt has been going on for quite some time. But it certainly does look like it is accelerating even more currently.
Ric Campo: If you look at announcements, for example, of moves of major companies, not only as Austin picking up a ton, including a $10 billion Samsung chip plant that just got announced recently. But 85% of all the office space in Austin is being leased by the fangs, which is pretty amazing when you think about that. So there's a - especially when you start thinking about West Coast migration to Austin and even Houston got a big number as well, Hewlett Packard Enterprises, their software and enterprise group just moved and announced some move to Houston as well. So like Alex says, it's been going on for a long time, but it's definitely accelerating now.
Neil Malkin: Yes, that’s what I thought the tech guys only live in California, guess not anymore.
Alex Jessett: No, not anymore.
Neil Malkin: Last one – yes, right. Last one, kind of going back to the first line of questioning. It's surprising that acquisitions are - in your guidance, just given the sort of sub forecast environment. I know that last cycle your balance sheet wasn't in a good position as you wanted you to be aggressive. I guess is that kind of going into the calculus of why you're being, I guess, aggressive here? And I guess, could you talk about just from an FFO standpoint, what kind of EBITDA yields do you think you're going to be selling not AFFO, but EBITDA yields, and then versus what you think you can buy at?
Ric Campo: Well, we think that, as I said, before, the negative spread on the last cycle was 21 basis points, on just what we look, we just look at real cash flows, and I'm trading from one property to another. The challenge with FFO and even AFFO is a better way to look at it.  But generally speaking, the - probably the widest spread we had in the last cycle was 60 to 70 basis points. And even though our budgets are conservative in that they're showing probably the higher end of that negative spread. But ultimately, what I think is happening out there is that when we start selling older properties, the biggest bid in the market today is for value add, and for older properties and so as opposed to newer development recently leased up. And so we think that the spread is going to be similar in terms of negative spread. But the bottom line is, if you look at what we did last time, we had 3 billion of dispositions, 2 billion of acquisitions and then over a billion of development, when you met - when you sort of bring the development alongside the disposition and acquisition program, you end up with a positive FFO contribution and AFFO contribution, in spite of the negative spread. So it's sort of - the way I kind of look at them at the acquisition disposition market today is the pricing is definitely very, very robust, there's a huge private capital bid. And as long as we're taking advantage of that huge bid on our older properties, then we're fine being a top bidder on the newer properties as well. So it's sort of like you're selling low cap rate older properties and buying low cap rate higher properties or newer properties. And that's exactly what we did in the last cycle. And to the extent we can keep that spread, pretty narrow on the negative spread between the cash flow that we're selling versus we're buying, we're going to do as much as we can to improve the quality of our portfolio long-term.
Alex Jessett: And keep in mind, there's a timing differential in our model. So once again, we're assuming the acquisitions will be midyear with the dispositions towards the latter part of the year.
Neil Malkin: Thank you, guys.
Operator: And your next question will come from Derek Johnson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everyone. Good morning. We're looking for a little more granular update on private markets. Now, has your team seen elevated levels of distressed asset deals? We were surprised not to see any opportunistic acquisitions in 4Q outside of the land parcels. So I guess the question, is this environment one where these potential opportunistic deals are still too risky until the waiver market stabilizes? Or do you believe private markets still need to adjust lower?
Keith Oden: Well, when you look at the public markets cap rates relative to private market cap rates, there's a massive disconnect. And I guess if you believe that the private markets are right, and the public markets are wrong, then there'll be an adjustment in the private market, right. But when you look at what's going on in the private markets, with a 10 year at 1%, with a reasonable spread, when you think about fundamentally negative interest rates and the ability for people to finance what is going to be a growing cash flow going forward. And even if you're worried about inflation this is a great asset class to own. And so I think at the end of the day, there are no distressed assets out there. And when you talk about distress, for example, we did pick up a development, we knew there was going to be shovel ready developments that we could pick up and we did one of those. The Durham project is a good example of that. And we have some decent land purchases that we've been able to do. But as far as distressed multifamily assets in America, they don't exist. If you think about the last cycle, most of the merchant builders, most of the of the - of anybody who's buying properties in the private side, have a ton of equity in their in their capital stacks, and so there's not a lot of high leverage complicated structural deals out there that you can get maybe now and then, but nothing of any significance.
Derek Johnston: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. Switching gears, so how impactful has the new administration's energy policy been on market fundamentals in Huston, which historically has well absorbed excess supply. And that's especially for your best in class use in portfolio and given the migration trends you highlighted. Are current energy policies creating a possibly more longer-term headwind in the Houston market, which is especially surprising, given that crude is in the high 50s right now. Thanks.
Ric Campo: Yes, so, I spend a fair amount of time with my energy friends debating this issue. And most of them believe that the Biden administration's short-term executive orders and view is going to drive energy prices up not down and improve their businesses sooner rather than later. And part of it is when you think about the - like the ban on new leases for drilling. In Texas, for example, I think we have less than 10% of the entire drilling community is on federal land. You go to New Mexico, it's a different animal. So what people think is going to - are going to happen is, in New Mexico, it's nearly 50%, I believe, or maybe even higher than that. And so in the shale goes into New Mexico, from the Permian Basin. So what people are thinking in Texas is that that people are going to abandon federal land in New Mexico and move over to Texas. And so the Biden - when you think about Biden administration and his climate change issues, it's definitely going to have a positive effect on the price of oil, which will have a positive effect on Houston recovery. The other thing I think that is happening is that the energy transition, the idea that these energy companies are - they know they have to transition to clean energy at some point. And we all also know that you're not going to get rid of fossil fuels for the next 20 years, because there's just no way you can flip a switch and get electrification of the entire highway system and all that. That's going to take decades to get done or maybe a decade or two. And so the Biden administration actually is a positive not a headwind for a Houston and energy recovery, in my view.
Derek Johnston: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Sumit Sharma: Hi, good morning. This is Sumit here in for Nick. And I'll keep the question to just one, because we're running up against the iron hour. And I want to have everyone ask questions before. So really, I mean, if you could walk us through what drove the sequential declining rents in occupancy Q-over-Q, particularly in Houston and DC? I mean, trying to understand whether the competition is offering more consistent than you do? Or is there something more seasonal about the decline? It doesn't seem to be reflected when compared to last year, so inquisitive about that. And then when we think about the dispositions that are focused on Houston or DC, at least you mentioned, a couple of questions earlier at the start of the call, is that improvement contemplated in your SS rent growth range for the year?
Keith Oden: So technically, that's two questions. So on the decline sequentially in Houston. There we had 20,000 apartments delivered last year. We're in the process of delivering another 20,000 apartments this year. And that's in into an already pretty weak environment, given what's going on. In even though I think Ric is right and I agree with the fact that the incrementally what's going on right now it's probably going to be a positive for Houston. The damage was already done in the last two years with the decline in the rig count from almost 900 rigs working to about 200 working. So the job losses that were associated with that fall off have already kind of worked their way through the system, but the bottom line is that 40,000 apartments being delivered in Houston at a normal, any kind of a normal absorption rate would require 200,000 jobs to be able to take up that slack. And it's just obviously hasn't happened. Now it looks like our data providers, they're expecting a much better result this year, maybe as much as 100,000 jobs, which would be great. And that would take up to 20,000 apartments that are being delivered this year. But we still have stuff that's kind of working its way through the system from the completions in 2020 that we've got to work through. So I think it's just as simple as that that we have - you got way too much supply. It's hand-to-hand combat on the stuff that's either downtown or inside close in assets, which makes up a decent part of Camden's portfolios, there's just a lot of competition we got to work through.
Ric Campo: And the only other thing I'd add to that is, although typically, we do see a sequential decrease from the third to the fourth quarter, 2019 was unusual because we actually had higher occupancy than typical, but a lot of this is also seasonality. What was the second part of your question?
Sumit Sharma: I guess you mentioned that your dispositions would be focused on Houston and DCC, it's related, so it's not a second question. I'm just saying. Is there any improvement in your SS statistics contemplated in your range towards perhaps the more optimistic side from the dispositions or no?
Ric Campo: Yes, so we believe that both DC and Houston we'd better in the second half of the year, and that's why we're going to be selling in the second half and not in the first half. And it's clearly - our strategy is based on that thought.
Keith Oden: And if you look at what's actually in our model, we're assuming 150 basis point negative spread, and we absolutely anticipate that we're going to be able to do better than that.
Sumit Sharma: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning down there.
Keith Oden: Hi, Alex.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, so the first question is just filling out on the on the capital, I'm not going to use the word capital allocations as it gets overused, but as you guys underwrite those new deals and developments, just speaking to every private guy next to industrial Sunbelt apartments are like the hottest asset class. And unfortunately, construction costs seem to be unabated. So labor, materials, all that fun stuff just continued to go up. So as you guys think about trying to invest in where people are paying three taps or develop where lumbers through the roof a constant part of your prior investment attempts have been like just inability to find deals that pencil. So do you anticipate anything changing this time? Or is previously where you commented that like Southern Cal was a discount to the Sunbelt, hence why you were hesitant to sell Southern Cal? Is that now changing where maybe there is a positive ARB there to sell Southern Cal and maybe that's one of the boosts that will help you make some of the numbers work, just trying to think about how you're viewing the investment world, because it definitely seems to just get harder and harder.
Ric Campo: Well, I think you're exactly right, it gets harder and harder, but I don't think there's an ARB between Southern California and any other market, I think there's still a very robust bid for Southern California in terms of pricing. So there's not - I can't sell in Southern California for a higher cap rate and then buy somewhere else. It's more - from our perspective, it is hard. And our people have done a really great job, our development team in manufacturing transactions that work. But again, it's $150 million to $300 million of starts and that's pretty much all we have been able to figure out at this point. In terms of when we start talking about the buy and the sell, that's a whole lot easier, because as long as we're selling at what we think is really good cap rates we can always buy you just have to be the highest bidder, right.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, so Ric, if you're saying that the Southern Cal is a good bid, does that mean you'd finally start to prune there and recycle out of the drudgery of dealing with Southern Cal?
Keith Oden: So we're in the best parts of California, okay, maybe ex LA, but when you look at a recovery scenario, I think those markets are going to do pretty darn well. So when we start thinking about longer term how we want to sort of position ourselves from a geographic diversification, I'm still good with California recovering in the next two or three years. The question of longer term do you want to put up with the people who don't think they have to pay the rent and the government issues, that's a longer debate. But every time we - when I'm when I'm looking at future cash flow growth, I think Southern California, especially where we are is going to be a - is going to recover and do really well. The dispositions are going to - I mean Ric mentioned earlier, we're looking for the dispositions to come from Houston and Washington DC, and that's based on - the assets are dear in every one of our markets, including Houston. But we're overweight in both of those markets. So at the margins, that's where the dispositions are going to come from.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, that's fine. The second question is, Alex, in your comments, you mentioned that the guidance is predicated on sort of return to normalcy by midyear and sort of looking at the economic data in the Sunbelt you guys have a much better situation to start from the US and the Coast. So how much change are you really expecting? I mean, it's - I assume that Atlanta and Houston are not like San Francisco or New York, where everyone's still at home. So can you just give us a sense of relativeness of what you mean by return to normal versus what we're experiencing here on the Coast?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely and a lot of it circles around bad debt. And so our belief is that bad debt will start to curtail in the latter part of 2021 to be more in line with what we see in a typical year, and sort of using 2019 as our guide, so that's one item. And then the second item is our ability to really sort of push new leases. If you think about it, renewals, we've started pushing those again, but we have not been pushing new leases in our book. But our hope is - and what's in our models, is that we're going to be able to start really sort of pushing there in the latter part of the year, obviously, not to huge numbers, but that's the perspective.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, thanks guys. Just a little more on the investment side, I'm curious if the assets in Houston and DC that you're targeting to sell, is it more of an age focused? Or are you considering selling any more of your infill assets that may be exposed to new supply? What's sort of the thinking around the product types that you're looking to dispose of in those markets, you mentioned that you're already overweight?
Keith Oden: Definitely, it's more age driven. And it's cap - what we what we do is we force rank all of our portfolio every year and we look at it every quarter, and we look at total return on invested capital, and what the growth rate on that invest - that return on invested capital will be for the next two or three years, and try to pick properties that are high CapEx with slower growth profiles. And if you have to put in CapEx, it doesn't give you a return than that obviously, lowers that return on invested capital in the future. And so bottom line is it - generally speaking, properties that are older with higher CapEx fall into that category. And when you think about recovery, even in Houston, generally speaking, when you have a recovery, the higher end, urban assets recover at a much faster rate from that perspective, so we don't look at it as, there's going to be a lot of pressure on lease ups and what have you in the urban core. So let's sell those assets and keep our sort of older, higher CapEx assets. So it's more about what we believe the next three years and sort of the drudgery of return on invested capital is after CapEx.
Austin Wurschmidt: Makes sense, I mean and then on the flip side, I guess, are there any smaller secondary markets, you're not in today that have good demand trends from some of these in migration trends to the Sunbelt, where maybe you could be more competitive from a pricing standpoint, or earn a premium yield and even tuck it into the portfolio without much added overhead? Have you considered that at all?
Keith Oden: Yes, so the one market that we've talked about in the past, it's the Sunbelt market that we've spent a lot of time in, trying to make sure that we just understand the lay of the land. We've done all the due diligence that we need to do that to know where things trade and have the right relationships as in Nashville. It has - I mean its right down the fairway of Camden's markets. Its high growth, highly educated population, there's then there's been a ton of new construction in Nashville, but so far that hasn't really shown up in pricing. It's expensive as most of our other cities are. So the one - that market would be one that is going to get a lot of attention, as we kind of look for what - is there an opportunity to expand and do we want to make a bet in Nashville too in the next as part of this rollout. But other than we're really happy with our footprint as you might well know from the geography and how it's performed through this part of the pandemic. So we'd love to add some assets in Nashville over time and make that one of Camden's core markets because it's got all the other characteristics that we look for.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then just a quick follow up, I mean is development as well as acquisitions on the table or are you thinking sort of one offs and building over time, or maybe something more on a portfolio or more scaling up a little quicker?
Keith Oden: Yes. It'd be acquisitions first, and then - and obviously, if we could find a multiple asset small portfolio that would be the ideal situation, but those are like chasing the unicorn these days in markets like Nashville.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the comments on migration trends. And I'm wondering for the new residents that you've seen move from New York or California or any of the other kind of higher tax states. Number one, are they working remotely or are they typically relocating for a job? And then number two, are you seeing any differences in income levels? And I ask if there's just an opportunity that ultimately you may be able to get higher rents if there's kind of a difference on the income side? Thanks.
Ric Campo: Yes, absolutely, so we do not pull that data specific to where they're from and their income. What I do know from all of my friends in New York City that every single time they come to our markets and realize what they can rent and the price of it, my gut is that they are probably used to pay a whole lot more rent and that gives them the capacity to lease with us and also gives them the capacity to absorb rental rate increases over time.
Keith Oden: Yes, I think there is some anecdotal evidence that people are more mobile and working from home and are renting apartments here and having - and not coming for jobs, per se, but already have jobs in other markets and they're just continuing to working at those jobs.
Ric Campo: And I'll add to that we have a banker of ours who has relocated permanently from New York to Houston and when I spoke with him and went through his daily expenses, as he put it, he has no expenses in Houston as compared to what he was - what was costing him in New York City. It is a dramatic uptick in a quality of life. And that's the reason why people have been attracted to send out markets for so long.
Keith Oden: Yes, I think the issue of whether people are making more money, can they pay more rent? I think the answer is yes. But right now, the idea that the market is soft enough where you can't push rents today, no matter what people make, right. And so ultimately, as the markets firm up, then the resident bases are higher income and can then take rental increases once we have pricing power to be able to do that. Right now, we just don't, given the pandemic and supply and all that kind of stuff.
Alex Jessett: One banker doesn't make a trend of three buddy, there's still a lot of us here that love New York City for all the things that provides.
Keith Oden: Yes, look, I think New York City is going to be fine long-term, I just think it's going to take longer to get back and same with San Francisco. But you can never write off those urban markets because people want to - they want what the urban markets give and I think the urban markets one of the things I think is really fascinating is urban in the Sunbelt compared to urban in San Francisco, New York and LA, for example. We leased 20 units in our downtown project - property last month. And that was really the highest we've leased in a long time. And even though there's only 16% of the workers that are working in downtown Houston, people are leasing apartments in downtown Houston. So I wouldn't write New York or San Francisco for sure.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Hey, guys. Hope everybody is doing well. I'll try to keep it quick. I know that there was some new lease up pressure on rents in the fourth quarter as we roll forward to '21 here. Can you give us a sense of whether the supply pressure is first half weighted back half weighted as far as you can sort of peg those precisely?
Keith Oden: Yes, I don't think it will have any meaningful distinction. And I say that because whatever has been forecast or put in people's models, as far as the actual month of delivery, they've been wrong for the last three years, and that's going to continue. It takes longer. There's still a lot of pressure on skilled labor. The process of going through inspections and getting the city officials to sign off is slower, so that everything that can go against a schedule is going against the schedule right now. So my guess is that even if you had a month-by-month role, I wouldn't put much stock in it as far as accuracy is concerned. And when you get - in a market like Houston, where you're going to get 20,000 apartments it's - it doesn't matter if 2000 of them moved from February to November, the answer is no.
Rich Hightower: Right. Okay. Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: And our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, guys, quick one for me here. What's the thinking on Dallas here to number four markets have been fairly soft last couple of years? Sounds like more of the same this year. And maybe can you pair that with some comments on Atlanta with just leapfrog Houston as your number two market, are you going to continue to add more there or you're pretty happy with your exposure?
Keith Oden: Well, we like Dallas long-term and we definitely can move some of our exposure up there. We also like to - when you look at their growth profile looks really good over the next two or three years. And so we think that Dallas is going to be a top quartile revenue growth market here in the next few years. As far as Atlanta goes, yes, Atlanta is a large market for us right now. We've been - we have acquired properties here, but we've been more of a developer in Atlanta and we'll probably stay that way for a bit. And our acquisitions, if you look at our markets like Austin, we have 3% or 4% of our portfolio there. And in Tampa, it's like 4.5% and Raleigh, it's 5%. So those are the markets, we're going to try to spend more time in from an acquisition perspective, so we can get that balance a little bit more. And we use start looking at the growth profiles of Tampa and Orlando, or Tampa and Raleigh and Austin even those are all really good strong growth markets long term.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Thanks. And forgive me if I missed this, but where the 320 million development starts you got line through this year and what type of yields are you underwriting?
Keith Oden: So those are those are - the new starts this year are -
Alex Jessett: So if you look in our supplemental package, we're actually under the development pipeline, we always put them in order. So the first one we have which is Camden Durham, which is the site that we just purchased in the fourth quarter and it was shovel ready. That's $120 million. And then proceeding that is - or following that as Arts District or Cameron Village, so some subset of that, but Durham is the one that we expect to get started pretty soon.
Keith Oden: And Durham is classic - it's an urban project, but it's more urban and Durham is not urban and LA and those yields are going to be - in California we're going to be in the low five and the sort of middle of the countries we're going to push on six.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. On the 30% increase in insurance costs you expect, can you provide any more color and why it's too big increase and if there's any particular market that's impacted more?
Ric Campo: So what I will tell you is - just a couple of sort of facts before we start that discussion. In 2020, the US set a record for 20 billion plus natural disasters. Globally, there were 69 billion natural disasters in 2020. That is causing a global insurance challenge and so to give you an idea, our property insurance - now we do our renewals in May, on May 1, but we are being told that property insurance for us will be up on the premium side about 40%. And that GL will be up almost 100%. This is not a Camden specific issue. This is 100% an issue of the global insurance market. So therein lies the challenge. It's interesting, because I talked to all of my peers, we all have the same problems. As I said, it's not a Camden issue. And in fact, what I will tell you is that Camden is going to do better than most, because number one, we actually develop the vast majority of our real estate. So on the property side we know exactly what's behind the walls. And that's very helpful if you're trying to insure. And then on the GL side, we have fantastic loss claims. So that's going be very helpful for us too. But that's the real issue. And that's what we're all facing.
John Kim: But is it fair to say, Miami, Houston, California, those are the markets that are impacted more than some of the others?
Ric Campo: No, so you have to remember once again, I said this is a global issue. And when they underwrite us, we do not go out and get property specific insurance. They're looking at our entire book of business. And by the way for habitational, which is one of the least favorite for insurance providers, we score very, very well, because of the quality of our real estate, and the fact that we've had very limited losses and we survived natural disasters exceptionally well. So we score very well. This is not market specific issues. This is across the board habitational. In addition to all people who are seeking either property or general liability insurance.
John Kim: Okay, my second question is on your ability to push renewal rates. You mentioned pushing new rates in the second half of this year when things normalize. But what's your ability to push or increase renewal rates given you typically don't provide concessions?
Keith Oden: Yes, so we're running about from 2% to 3% right now on renewals. And we've got renewals that have gone out for February and - through February and March. And we think we're going to realize somewhere in the 3% range up on renewals. And that's been true. We've been in that range now for since we reinstated raising rates on renewals. So I think that - I think we've proven that that's kind of what the market will allow right now in terms of renewal rates without giving up occupancy. And we still have - our retention rates are still at historic highs in terms of the ability to maintain a residence. So it's clear that we're not forcing any vacancy by where we are on renewal rates right now, which is going to be in the 2% to 3% range.
Ric Campo: If you look at what's in our budget for the full year, we are anticipating renewals to increase by 3% and new leases to be down about 2%, so this all comes back to the original question that our guidance is predicated upon a recovery in the second part of the year. So if we get a strong recovery, then obviously we can push those rents further, I mean push those renewals further. But to Keith's point, what we're currently doing is 3%.
John Kim: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Just one final question for me, Alex, in terms of other revenue, like fee revenue, hitting same store revenue, parking, late fees, common areas when you put it all together, what's the kind of year-over-year lift or drag on same store revenue versus 2020?
Alex Jessett: Yes. No, absolutely, so here's how I would sort of break out the difference between 2020 and 2021 when it comes to revenue. The first thing is that we are anticipating lower bad debt in 2021. And that was the other component of that our guidance is predicated upon a recovery. So we think we'll pick up about $2 million for lower bad debt. We think we'll pick up about another $2 million for lower fee concessions. And then what we think is higher utility income should be about a million and a half plus. Sharp on the revenue side should be about 1.2 million for us. And then renter's insurance and we've got our new renter's insurance program that we're rolling out should be about a half a million bucks. And that pretty much makes up the delta between our 2020 actual revenue and our 2021 budgeted revenue.
John Pawlowski: All right, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Pardon me, your line may be muted. And our next question will be Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alex Kalmus: Hi, thank you for taking the question. So given that we're shifting in from the late stage of loss cycle into this recovery, have you given thought about the balance sheet and potentially expanding the leverage profile to expand in those quality markets, especially given sort of the wall of capital supporting multifamily in the transaction market these days?
Ric Campo: The answer is no. We have - Well, the answer is yes. We think about our balance sheet all the time, but the answer to are we going to increase our leverage profile beyond sort of the metrics that we have been talking about for a long time, which is keeping our debt to EBITDA between 4% and 5% or four and five times? That's where we're going to stay and we think that the given the we are at the start a new cycle, I think. But on the other hand I remember in I was at my last conference in March, the first week of March of 2020. And that question came up multiple times, people sort of maybe criticizing us for our low debt profile. And then - and they kept asking me, well, what what's going to be the problem? What do you think is going to happen? Why do you need to have a strong balance sheet? And then two weeks later we have the pandemic, and then all of a sudden stock price goes to 62 bucks from $120. The financial - the capital, markets shut down dramatically, including the unsecured debt market. And all of a sudden people started talking about Camden's amazing strong balance sheet best in the sector and they're going to be defensive, and who's got too much debt. And so we're going to continue to keep it one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, just because there's a potential of a recovery, which I think is going to happen, but we are going to keep our strong balance sheet with us for a long time. That's a fundamental Camden thing you can take to the bank, I think.
Alex Kalmus: For sure, yes, I guess this was predicated on a limited distrust we're seeing and maybe there's more - some more room, but understood and very prudent. And then this could be yes or no question given how we are, but just looking at the land purchases from last year or at the beginning of the year, sort of the same market you've already done, but the land price tag was a little higher in November. Is that something that is happening throughout the market? Or is this because the deal was more urban and ground ready as you mentioned earlier?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So if you look at our land acquisition in the fourth quarter, this was a shovel ready site. So we effectively bought permits, we bought plans, we bought all of these other things that go along with getting ready - a deal ready to go. So it's really is an apple and orange.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much.
Ric Campo: Okay, we have - I don't think we have any other questions. So we appreciate your time today and we will visit with you on our new interactive virtual platform next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan. Please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete third quarter 2020 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on the call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will attempt to complete our call within one hour. As we know, another multi-family company is holding their call right after us. We already have 15 analysts in the queue right now. So please limit your questions to two. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. Our on-hold music today was attributed to team Camden. We wanted to celebrate the incredible results of our onsite team supported by our regional and corporate staffs that they have achieved throughout the COVID storm. Despite all the turmoil, team Camden never stopped taking care of business. That's what you can expect from a team of all-stars. Instead of 1,000-yard stare, team Camden showed up every day with the eye of the tiger, reminding us of what we know is true, you're simply the best. So this evening we will join you in spirit, as you all raise your glass to celebrate your remarkable performance. Cheers. Our performance for the third quarter was driven by our team, but was also aided by our Camden brand equity and our capital allocation and market selection. We've always believed that geographic and product diversification would lower the volatility of our earnings. We’re in markets that are pro-business, have an educated workforce, low cost of housing and high quality of life scores. These attributes drive population and employment growth, which drives housing demand. The only exception to this market generalization for us is Southern California. Compared to most other parts of California, however, our properties are in the most business friendly cities and areas in the state. Our markets have lost fewer high paying jobs than other markets in the U.S. As a matter of fact, it's 5% losses for Camden markets versus 15% for the U.S. Overall, year-over-year employment losses through September have been less in our markets. Job losses in most of our markets have been in the range of down 2.5% to down 5%, the best being Austin, Dallas, Phoenix, Tampa, Atlanta and Houston. Toughest markets have been Orlando, Los Angeles and Orange County with job losses between 9.5% and 9.7%. Another key employment trend – our other key employment trends are that are supporting our residents' ability to stay in their apartments and pay rent is that when you think about the job losses that we lost at the beginning of the pandemic, there were 22 million jobs lost, 11 million had been added back. Of the jobs that have not been added back, 5.8 million are low-income workers making less than $46,000 a year. And another group 4.1 million folks have not been added back that make between $46,000 and $71,000 a year. So the lion's share of the 11 million jobs that haven't been – that have not been added back are really not our residents. There are lower income workers that do not live at Camden. Most of our residents have higher income than that. And it's unfortunate that we have that many job losses, and we obviously need to add those jobs back as soon as possible, but they aren't negatively impacting Camden's resident base. Again, I want to thank our team Camden for delivering living excellence to all of our residents, and I'll turn the call over to Keith Oden, our Executive Vice Chairman.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. I'll keep my remarks brief today so that we can get to as many of your questions as possible. Obviously, we're more than pleased with our results for the quarter. This is certainly the kind of performance that is worthy of celebration by team Camden. Overall, things seem like they're getting back to something closer to normal, and that's quite a contrast to where we were in April and May of this year. A few signs that conditions of stabilizing our markets, occupancy for the third quarter was 95.6%, up from 95.2% in the second quarter. Several of our communities are actually exceeding their original budget for occupancy. Turnover continues to be a tailwind at 48% for the third quarter and only 42% year-to-date. There continues to be a lot of anecdotal evidence that home sales are spiking. In our portfolio, we had 13.8% move-outs to purchase homes in the first quarter of this year that moved up to 14.7% in the second quarter. And in the third quarter, it moved up again to 15.8%. But if you take the average, the average year-to-date move-outs to purchase homes, it was 14.8% versus a full year 2019 of 14.6%. So really very little change year-over-year. We did see a little uptick in October to 18%, but Q4 is always a little bit elevated. Clearly, this is a stat that bears some watching to see if the anecdotal evidence starts showing up in the stats. Thanks to all at Camden for a remarkable year so far. Everybody keep your rally caps on for the rest of the year, and I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett.
Alex Jessett: Thanks Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance and brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the third quarter of 2020, we stabilized Camden North End I, a 441 unit $99 million new development in Phoenix, Arizona, generating over a 7% stabilized yield. We completed construction on Camden Downtown, a 271 unit $131 million new development in Houston. We recommenced construction on Camden Atlantic, a 269 unit $100 million new development in Plantation, Florida. And we began construction on both Camden Tempe II, a 397 unit $115 million new development in Tempe, Arizona, and Camden NoDa, a 387 unit $105 million new development in Charlotte. For the third quarter of 2020 effective new leases were down 2.4% and effective renewals were up 0.6% for a blended decline of 0.9%. Our October effective lease results indicate a 3.5% decline for new leases and a 2.1% growth for renewals for a blended decrease of 1%. Occupancy averaged 95.6% during the third quarter of 2020 and this was up from the 95.2% where both experienced in the second quarter of 2020 and that we anticipated for the third quarter of 2020 leading in part to our third quarter operating outperformance, which I will discuss later. We continue to have great success in conducting alternative method property tours for prospective residents and retaining many of our existing residents, with actually a slight acceleration in total leasing activity year-over-year. In the third quarter, we averaged 3,227 signed leases monthly in our same property portfolio, slightly ahead of the third quarter of 2019 where we averaged 3,104 signed leases. To-date, October, 2020 total signed leasing activity is on pace with October, 2019. Our third quarter collections far exceeded our expectations. As we collected 99.4% of our scheduled rents with only 0.6% delinquent. This compares favorably to both the third quarter of 2019, when we collected 98.3% of our scheduled rents with a higher 1.7% delinquency and in the second quarter of 2020, when we collected 97.7% of our scheduled rents with 1.1% of our residents in a deferred rent arrangement and 1.2% delinquent. The fourth quarter is off to a good start with 98.1% of our October, 2020 scheduled rents collected. Turning to bad debt, in accordance with GAAP, certain uncollected rent is recognized by us as income in the current month. We then evaluate this uncollected rent and establish what we believe to be inappropriate bad debt reserve, which serves as a corresponding offset to property revenues in the same period. When a resident moves out owing us money, we typically have previously reserved 100% of the amount owed as bad debt and there'll be no future impacts to the income statement. We reevaluate our bad debt reserves monthly for collectability. Turning to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2020 of $126.6 million or $1.25 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.08 per share. This $0.08 per share outperformance for the third quarter resulted primarily from approximately $0.055 in higher same store revenue comprised of $0.025 from lower than anticipated net bad debt due to the previously mentioned higher than anticipated collection levels and higher net re-letting income, $0.01 from the higher than anticipated levels of occupancy and $0.02 from higher than anticipated other income driven primarily from our higher than anticipated levels of leasing activity. Approximately $0.005 in better than anticipated revenue results from our non-same store and development communities. Approximately $0.005 in lower overhead due to general cost control measures and an approximately $0.015 gain related to the sale of our Chirp technology investment to a third-party, this gain is recorded in other incomes. We have updated our 2020 full year same store revenue, expense, and net operating income guidance based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, we now anticipate full year 2020 same-store revenue to increase 1% and expenses to increase 3.4% resulting in an anticipated 2020 same store net operating income decline of 0.3%. The difference between our anticipated 3.4% full year total expense growth and our year-to-date total expense growth of 2.4% is primarily driven by the timing of current and prior year tax refunds and accruals. The increase to our original full year expense growth assumption of 3% is almost entirely driven by higher than anticipated property tax valuations in Houston. We now anticipate total same-store property taxes will increase by 4.7% in 2020 as compared to our original budget of 3%. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of a $1.21 to $1.27. The midpoint of $1.24 is in line with our third quarter results after excluding the previously mentioned third quarter gain on sale of technology. Our normal third to fourth quarter seasonal declines in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover and personnel expenses are anticipated to be entirely offset by the timing of property tax refunds, lower net market rents and our normal seasonal reduction in occupancy and corresponding other income. As of today, we have just under $1.4 billion of liquidity comprised of approximately $450 million in cash and cash equivalents. And no amounts outstanding underneath our $900 million unsecured credit facility. At quarter end, we had $384 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline. And we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022. Our current excess cash is invested with various banks earning approximately 30 basis points. At this time, we’ll open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Sumit Sharma: Hi, good morning, guys. This is Sumit Sharma here in for Nick. Thank you for taking my question. So the last quarter you guys played The Doors, and two quarters ago, it was a Led Zeppelin cover. So very strong picks, both of them match, right. And today’s whole music, as you mentioned earlier, it was the Eye of the Tiger. So I’m thinking you guys are feeling better. So it’s kind of my obligation to ask you, but what factors or risks could actually change your optimism looking ahead in terms of collections and market dynamics?
Ric Campo: I think it’s all about reopening the economy and obviously, what would worry us today is 33 states spiking with coronavirus and certain – where we heard – I heard this morning on the news that El Paso was thinking about a shutdown. Ultimately, I don’t think anything works in the economy, whether it’s apartments or any other business, if you don’t have employment and you don’t have the economy working going forward. And so what would concern me would clearly be a go back to a March, middle of March shutdown. And if that happens in America, then all bets are off again on everything, I think.
Keith Oden: Yes. I would just add to that, that policy driven mandates regarding the ability of landlords to control the destiny of their real estate similar to the CDC mandate. If we start seeing those types of mandates at the national level that continue to push out the ability for landlords to get control of their real estate through the eviction processes, that needs to come to a positive ending in terms of allowing landlords to get control of their destiny and their real estate. So I would add that to Ric’s point about getting the economy open again. So those two things probably would be at the top of my list.
Sumit Sharma: Great. And if you guys could sort of comment on Camden Downtown I in Houston. I know it’s 39% leased, but it’s in a market that you saw the largest year-over-year and sequential occupancy drops. So I’m just trying to understand whether newer apartments are easier to lease as we’ve heard from other markets, or is there some of the factors that could drive optimism for the project? I think you have downtown doing the pipeline. So I know it’s probably for prospective start, but just wondering what could sort of change the equation on that particular asset?
Ric Campo: Sure. Houston, I think in general, I’m going to talk about Houston, but I think most markets in America, maybe ex-California, most of our markets are experiencing supply and demand fundamentals the way they were pre-pandemic. Now there’s definitely a pandemic kind of overlay, but Houston was a soft market going into the pandemic. If you think about the energy business in 2019, the energy business was not that great. I mean, at the beginning of 2020 – sort of third quarter of 2018, oil went from $70 a barrel to under $40 a barrel at the beginning of 2019. And so energy wasn’t really recovering. And then what was going on is you had Houston was kind of the only market in America in 2017 that had actually a decline in supply. So of course, what productive merchant builders do is they build their pipelines up and Houston now has a lot of new development that’s coming online. So what’s driving the Houston market today is definitely some weakness because of coronavirus, but generally speaking, Houston’s actually fared pretty well. We’re down year-over-year of 5% in terms of job growth. We’ve lost 300,000 jobs and out of the half of those are back, which is pretty amazing, it’s sort of about 150,000 jobs lost. So I’m actually very encouraged by the downtown lease-up because we’re leasing about 7 to 10 units a month there. Normally you lease 30 units a month. But given that downtown office occupancy is about 15% right now, it’s actually doing really well. And I think there are a couple of pieces to that equation. And I think a lot of people forget that urban properties or downtown properties like in Houston or Atlanta or Dallas or Charlotte are not the same as Downtown New York or San Francisco, or – mostly the Southern cities and cities that are less dense than some of the challenges that are happening in San Francisco, New York, they’re just not the same. And so our urban is very different than urban in some of the other markets that people think about. And so ultimately our second phase is definitely there, but we’re not going to start at anytime soon given the supply and demand pick up. I think downtown will continue to be really good over a long period of time. We’re definitely going to be challenged in terms of achieving our original perform on this project during the pandemic as we would be with any property today that’s in lease-up. With that said, I think it’s – the fact that it’s 39% leased is really good. We did have a Y Hotel in there to start with. And of course, given the pandemic, Y Hotel doesn’t make sense in a hospitality side of the equation today.
Sumit Sharma: Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Alua Askarbek: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions today and congrats on a great quarter.
Ric Campo: Thank you.
Alua Askarbek: So to start off, just thinking more about the leasing activity as well. Big picture, are you starting to see a slowdown in any particular markets or across the board in your Sunbelt markets as we head into the quieter months? Or do you still see a lot of demand and especially a lot more demand of movement from out of state and out of the area like the Northeast and West Coast?
Keith Oden: Yes. We definitely are seeing in-migration, but that’s been going on for the last decade from Northern markets and from California to some of our markets. Clearly, it’s gotten – it’s ramped up during the pandemic, but that’s a trend that’s been in place for a long time. In terms of overall traffic, our traffic numbers are down year-over-year low double digits, like 12% down in total traffic. But the interesting thing is, is that the traffic that we do get is much more motivated. Our closing rates are higher. We’ve intentionally dialed back on some of our internet’s fin because we just don’t – we’re at 96%, almost 96% occupied now, and the traffic that we do get is very motivated. So while traffic is down overall, we still see more than enough traffic to maintain our occupancy where it is right now. It’s always going to slow down in the fourth quarter. We’ll start seeing that. And as we get into, particularly into the holiday season, traffic falls off. But that’s okay with the way our portfolio is structured with our lack of leases that come – that roll over during that period of time, we don’t need that much traffic. So overall, I would say that the traffic feels pretty normal across our entire portfolio. The chat where we do have challenges are where, as Ric mentioned, we’ve got – you just got a ton of new supply that’s coming on. And so outside of – so I would say outside of Houston and maybe South Florida, all of the places where we experience some weakness are related to supply that’s coming on in most of the last cycle, the heaviest dose of supply was in the urban markets and urban infill, and where we have communities that are directly affected by other merchant builder lease-ups, that’s where our challenge is.
Alua Askarbek: Got it. And then just thinking about the renewal rates. So I see that rates are going up in October. Do you expect them to keep going up and kind of like, what are you guys keeping out in November and December for the renewals?
Keith Oden: Yes. So we said when we voluntarily put renewal increases on hold for about three months, we felt like at some point when we got back to normal traffic levels, normal operating conditions, in terms of being able to take care of our residents and take care of our new customers that we think will trend back to where we were pre-COVID. And we were pre-COVID and across the portfolio, we were in the 3.5% to 4.5% range on renewals. We think we’re headed back there and maybe it’s in the first quarter of next year. But we think that we’re headed back to more – that more normal looking level of renewals. We’re a little better than 2% now. I would expect to see that continue to tick up. We just started back sending out renewals and all of our markets. And I think we had everyone back to kind of normal order in September. So I think that’ll continue to tick up and we should get back to roughly where we were pre-COVID.
Alua Askarbek: Got it. Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate all the operating comments and it being close to normal, but just four of those markets that do remain a little weak. What are you seeing in terms of concessions either in your portfolio or at the market on stabilized properties? So not on development, but on stabilized properties.
Ric Campo: Nick, we don’t really – other than in our development communities, which is that’s just more of a historical norm for that, where you offer a month free round of a concession, we don’t really do concessions in our portfolio. We’re on net pricing, and we’re driven completely by our YieldStar revenue management system. We have very few overrides to the recommendations within the YieldStar system. So I know it’s become – the term effective rent has become much more prevalent because we do see our competitors going back to the use of concessions. I suspect even the competitors that are using YieldStar as their primary pricing mechanism. If you’ve got a – if you’re sort of in a panic mode, and YieldStar is telling you to gradually toggle back rents, but you’re at 85% occupancy; a lot of people just don’t have the tolerance and the patience to let YieldStar or any other revenue management system make those decisions, so you end up with people who take the YieldStar recommendation and then do a month free rent. And we definitely see that, there’s no question about it, but it’s just not something that we do, and it’s not something that we are – that we intend to do.
Nick Joseph: Thanks – sorry, go ahead.
Ric Campo: You’re not going to see us start talking about effective rents. What we see – what we show you as pricing is what our leases are being signed at.
Nick Joseph: And there’s no disadvantage from a marketing perspective, if the property next door, even if on a net effective basis, you’re at the same point. If someone sees kind of a month free rent or two months free rent, you don’t see any difference from a marketing perspective?
Ric Campo: We don’t. And the reason we don’t is that our marketing teams are trained to sell features and benefits, and customers know what the net rent is, right? So if the market is down two months free, right, so that’s a huge discount in the rent. And at the end of the day, you’re just doing – you’re creating a financing mechanism for the resident, right? They know what their effective rent is during their lease term. And you’re just creating a mechanism for them to get up rent, free rent. So if the overall market is two months free, then our effective rents are going to come down, but they’re not. And so it’s kind of one-off. So we don’t think of it as a negative competitive situation for us at all. And our people know how to sell through it.
Keith Oden: And it’s just a fundamentally bad business practice in a world where people can move in and then sort of file a CDC declaration and then sort of get their rent deferred. If you start off with two months free and offering them that incentive to move into your community, you may end up with two months free and then a CDC declaration beyond that. It’s just a bad business practice. And honestly, it’s mostly merchant builders who are – they’re trying to get, they opened a community and they’re 30% occupied and they’re trying to get to the finish line, and they do what they have to do.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good morning down there.
Ric Campo: Good morning.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Just following up on Nick’s question, just so I’m clear because a lot of your peers talked about at the extreme two months free, and then sort of going from there. So across all your markets, including Southern Cal and D.C., it sounds like you guys really aren’t either you’re not seeing much free rent competition or whatever free rent is in the market just really isn’t material or impactful to you. Is that the takeaway?
Keith Oden: Yes. I wouldn’t say it’s not impactful. I would just say that it’s factored into our YieldStar net pricing. Like Ric said, if you’ve got six communities and lease-up, they’re directly competitive with you, and they’re all given two months free rent, the market clearing price for our community, our rent is going to go down, and obviously that’s reflected. You see in some of these markets in Southern California market, we’ve had our – we’ve had to reduce our rental rates or YieldStar has recommended reducing rental rates across the board, but it’s not – I would say it’s not a meaningful in terms of the overall experience in our portfolio. If you think about – Alex, if you think about the third quarter, we had – of our 14 markets we had 10 of those markets that actually had higher revenues than the third quarter of last year. Orlando was basically flat and we had two that were down. So it’s – the overall picture in our portfolio is one of, yes, it’s not back to where it would have been had we not had COVID, but you got 11 of our markets. So of our 14 markets, they’re actually have positive revenue year-over-year and that’s pretty good.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is for Ric, we’ll ask you the – we’ll make you the Chairman of the Sunbelt, Chairman of Texas, and certainly does, I think if you’re a Port of Houston chairmanship. But this morning CBRE announced that they’re going to move from LA to Dallas, where I guess the CEO is from anyway. But just given the discrepancy and employment rebound between your markets versus the continued lockdowns and restrictions on the economies in the coastal blue states, are you guys hearing more business leaders’ talk, increased chatter about relocating their companies to the Sunbelt? Or the trends that were already in place that were driving the businesses to move down there are the same; they haven’t accelerated or because of what’s happened with COVID fallout?
Ric Campo: I think it’s definitely accelerated. The trends have been in place for a long time, but there’s definitely more chatter and more discussion about sort of these pro-business markets. And when you look at a market like Houston, you’ve lost all these jobs and then we’ve added half of them back, and in LA they’ve added zero back. I mean, you look at Houston. Even with energy, we’re down 5% year-over-year in September and employment in Houston, which is big, right? But LA is down 9.7% and it has added back zero jobs. And so I think that the migration from some of these markets will continue. The long-term trends are in place, but I think people call COVID the great accelerator, right? Because what it’s done is it’s accelerated that the notion of work from home, the notion of less commutes, the notion of virtual leasing. And we were talking about all that, and then all of a sudden we had to like put it in place in a week. And I think that migration trends are going to continue, and the great COVID acceleration is probably going to accelerate.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning, everybody. So it sounds fair to say that even though I think you mentioned occupancies at 96%, you feel comfortable continuing to trend higher on renewals. Over time, you expect new lease pricing could remain under pressure because in order to remain competitive versus some of these lease-ups and stimulate traffic, you need to continue to offer kind of that negative roll down on the new leases. Is that fair? Or could we actually see it improve as well with the renewal rates?
Ric Campo: Yes. Austin, that’s fair in the markets where we have the most new construction that’s being delivered to this year and then believing over into 2021. So our challenges are almost entirely – we’ve got the fundamentals are good. The employment’s coming back. There’s plenty of traffic. There’s a lot of demand for the type of communities that we operate in the locations that we operate. However, in some of the markets, Houston would be an example. Dallas is an example. Charlotte is an example. Our communities are located in places that are the most desirable places for merchant builders to build new products. So they get impacted directly by all the new construction that’s going on. And unfortunately in those three markets that I just mentioned, the construction levels that are the deliveries of multi-family apartments in 2021 are roughly the same as they were this year. We’re going to get another 20,000 apartments in Houston. We’re going to get another 20,000 apartments in Dallas. We’re going to get another 13,000 apartments in Charlotte. So the places that are impacted by new supplies are going to continue to be under pressure. However, when you go to the Phoenix’s of the world, Raleigh, Denver, Tampa, these are not markets that have been the subject of a lot of new supply, and they’re going to continue to outperform for that reason. They got good job growth, they have good fundamentals. They’re great places to do business. They’ve got good in-migration patterns and they just don’t have a lot of new supply. So I think that’s going to continue to be the bifurcation and our portfolio is the supply markets that’s probably going to continue into 2021. I think it’s likely that we’ll get a decent amount of relief in 2022, but we’ve got to get from here to there first.
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s a helpful detail. Thank you. And then I wanted to hit on the development starts. Can you just provide some of the economics underlying the deals on the new starts? What you’re assuming in terms of trended rents et cetera?
Ric Campo: Sure. Our new starts, if they’re urban, the projected yields, stabilized yields are between 5% and 5.5%; and our suburbans are 6% to 6.5%. We generally, what we do is we do untreaded rents to as a hurdle to start with. And then we put in what we think the rents might do over a period of time. And our stabilize years do use trended rent. And today, it’s interesting to pay on the market. We have rents going down and then going back up. And if you look at depending on the market, and this gets to Keith’s point on where the supply side of the equation is the, the markets, some markets, we think are going to be back to 2019 rent levels by second quarter, first to second quarter of 2022 or 2021, and other markets are going to take longer. And so our trending definitely we have been more conservative in how we think rents are going to grow over the future. But those are the yields and sort of the way we model these developments.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Hey, good morning, guys.
Ric Campo: Good morning.
Rich Hightower: I guess to follow-up on the idea that COVID is accelerating trends that were underway already, just to dig into this uptick in move-outs for home purchase statistic. I know that you said the year-to-date average is pretty stable year-over-year, but maybe more recently, you’re seeing an uptick there. So what – as best you can tell, what would you attribute it to? Is it COVID per se causing those moves? Or is it sort of the demographic tailwind that should help home ownership over the next 5, 10 years, and COVID is just accelerating that? It’s been a long time since we’ve seen home sales this strong in this country, we’d have to go back to the, I think, early to mid-2000. The template that we’re operating from probably doesn’t help much. So what do you guys think about that and what should we expect?
Ric Campo: I do think it’s COVID accelerating, absolutely. So if you think about the oldest of the millennials, right, the oldest millennials are in their mid-30s, and what they’re doing now is they’re starting to form households. I have – my two daughters are 36 and 38, and they’re having their third children right now, okay? And so they’re classic millennials. And if they were living in apartments, they would be buying houses, right? And so I think that we always expected the older – oldest of the millennials to buy houses at some point. And actually that’s a really good thing for America because when you have good housing demand, moving out to buy a house doesn’t ultimately hurt apartments because what happens is you have a better economy. People are building houses and there’s lots of products being put in those houses, and it’s good for the economy overall. And a lot of the workers that actually build the houses live in apartments. And so with that said, I think it’s definitely accelerated by COVID. I think the historically low interest rates are part of the equation as well. And one of the things I think is actually really fascinating too, if you look at the savings rate between the start of COVID and where it is today, people aren’t spending money on stuff and they’re saving their money. And so you have people who didn’t have enough money for down payments. And what have you now that actually do because of COVID, because they’ve saved a lot of money by not going out to restaurants and to football games and vacations and things like that. I don’t think that you’re going to go to a 25% move-out rate like we had during the you could fog a mirror, get alone days, but it is a rational thing to happen at this point. One of the challenges that you have, and then there I’ve had some questions, when we had – after our Labor Day, we’ve had lots and lots of calls with shareholders and potential shareholders. And a lot of the discussion is, are you going to have massive move-outs from the urbans to the suburbans and from millennials buying houses? And the interesting thing is that the answer is no, because there’s no place for them to go. And if you look at housing inventory in Houston, Texas, right, one of the softest markets, we have to get some gives me energy of our building, we have a two-month supply of housing in Houston. And so even if we – if you had a 20% move out rate for apartments, you can't because there's no place for them to go, there's no inventory. And there's no place for an urban dweller to go to the suburbs, because the suburbs are awful too. So this is a long-term trend, maybe over the next 15 years it could happen. But I don't think so. I think that once COVID is over, you'll have people still want to go to bars, that's one of the challenges we have right now in the spikes, right. People are getting COVID – tired of COVID and they're just putting – they're going out and doing things socially. And I think that will continue in the future. So, I am not too worried about homeownership rate ticking up. I actually think it is a good thing overall.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Thanks for the comments.
Operator: Our next question will come from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Hey everyone. Good morning.
Ric Campo: Good morning.
Neil Malkin: I know Los Angeles, Orange County are some of your tougher markets, but don't worry. I'm sure, miraculously they will all open up November 4. First question, with technology that you guys have employed, just with the mobile apps and leaned on more heavily because of COVID in terms of how people are leasing and viewing your apartment homes. Are there things that maybe you can talk about today that you think that you can bring forward with you? When COVID is behind us, to sort of gain more efficiency, may be increased our long-term margin, that isn't maybe like one time in nature.
Ric Campo: Yes, absolutely. As we talked about COVID has really has been the great accelerator. And ultimately when we look at our ability to open up locks now on a remote basis, when we look at our mobile applications that we're using for maintenance type work, et cetera, when we're looking at virtual leases, I think all of these things are going to ultimately end up making us so much more efficient than we ever would have been if it wasn't for COVID. To the point that was made earlier, a lot of these things we had talked about for a year or two, and we probably thought it was three years on the horizon and miraculously all of a sudden it became one month on the horizon. So I think we've had some really, really great efficiencies. And I will tell you that I do think the mobile application to open up door locks in common area space is going to be an absolute game changer for not just Camden, but for the industry.
Neil Malkin: Yes, appreciate that. And maybe going back to Austin's question on development or maybe the whole, I guess transaction in marketing that context, you obviously started three projects. I don't recall what your completion schedule looks like for your current pipeline, but what's your comfort in accelerating that, the development just given the – what looks like to be a favorable 2022 for deliveries? And then how does that – I guess, what is the transaction market look like from a disposition standpoint, just given very favorable pricing with high demand and low interest rates?
Ric Campo: So for development, we would like to – we think the development markets can be very good in 2022, 2023. And we're going to try and do as much as we can. It's not easy to get the right numbers in the right – you still have, when you have construction costs continue to rise, maybe at a lower rate because of COVID, but it's still construction costs have not come down. And so it's still difficult to get the right numbers to work well, but we definitely have a pipeline and we will continue to try to add to that pipeline because I think that's one of the – if you're going to deploy capital, development is definitely the number one place for us at this point. In terms of the acquisition and disposition market. So, transactions are about one-third of what they were last year at this – through the end of October. And so clearly transaction volumes down big time. But what is trading is trading at all time high prices and low cap rates. So cap rates have come in dramatically since COVID and I will tell you that we have not seen an acquisition opportunity that has a four in the cap rate, they're all three’s and some change. And we're talking Houston, Dallas, Austin, Denver, you know, Tampa, Orlando everywhere. And so with that said, we have – we're not – acquisitions are really tough when you start with three. And so people have obviously lowered their IRR hurdles and then with interest rates as low as they are most leveraged buyers, or even with a, say a three and three quarters cap rate, they're still able with positive leverage to get very nice cash on cash returns relative to alternatives out there. So from a disposition perspective, clearly it's an interesting environment. I still think that we need a little more market clearing, a little more sort of what's going to happen between now and sort of first quarter. If you look at what Camden did in the last big cycle, we sold $3 billion worth of the assets who were 23 years old or more. And then we bought assets that were four years old and the unique situation there was, we sold that cap rates – we're very close to the cap rates that we bought at. And if that continues to – if that opportunity continues, we may do some of that in the future as well. But it's definitely a tough acquisition market, probably very positive disposition market for developments where we're focused on right now.
Neil Malkin: Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning guys. Ric, can you just expand on your comments there about construction costs, I mean there's been a spike in lumber costs? What are you seeing in labor and other materials cost and how much higher was your construction costs on the projects you started in the quarter relative to if you'd started them pre-pandemic, if it all.
Ric Campo: So I think that clearly the COVID has increased costs because of time and general conditions. For example, we have a property in – that we're building in Downtown, Orlando. And the challenge you have with COVID is you have to do all the proper PPE and the proper distancing. We have one way, stairwells and we have to keep our employees and our construction workers safe, and we're all about that. But it just makes the project go slower. Right. And the challenge is, it's sort of a manufacturing process and as you slow it down, your general conditions go up. And we haven't had big cost spikes, mostly it's just been delays and increases in general conditions and those kinds of things. I think that labor is a little more difficult today, in terms of – because of the timing of projects getting completed and costs are definitely not going down. And one of the challenges I think that everyone's having today is, I think this is an interesting situation, the most supplies, for example, getting the right equipment and supplies to the properties is starting to be an issue. And primarily because people sort of – their inventories are way down and they're having to restock inventories today. And that inventory restock has been a real – has been a challenge. And so I would say that, prices today are 2% to 3% higher than we saw on our last starts, but that's actually good because it used to be, 7% to – maybe 4% to 8% higher. So the good news is the rate of growth has come down, but it hasn't come down enough to improve your yields and what have you, that's why numbers are still hard to make.
Keith Oden: And Rob, I would just add that. And you mentioned it in your question that the one area that we have had definitely definite challenges and my guess is that everything, we look at indicates it's going to continue to be a problem in lumber. And we've definitely had a spike in lumber costs and as the single family home construction market ramps up, which is in the process of doing right now big time, just in response to the demand, what is out there in demand for new housing, is that ramps up it's a wood product, and there's going to be a lot more pressure on lumber as we go forward. So that's the one area probably as opposed to Ric's overall commentary on costs that, we are really looking at hard for trying to figure out ways to manage our lumber package costs.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then Keith any markets that you see is showing incremental weakness in September, October, that's more than just seasonally. And then also, how many residents would be on your evict list today that you can't do given the pandemic restrictions?
Keith Oden: Well, we have it's not a big number. For the CDC mandate, we think we have about 110 residents throughout our entire 60,000 apartments that are – have, have given us a CDC mandate evictions pending. It's less than 200 to 300 in the system-wide and some of those actually pre-dated COVID and we're working through those, because most jurisdictions have not had allowed us to go back to the people who were already in default status prior to COVID and, and work that through the process. So in most of our markets with the exception of California, which has its own set of rules and restrictions, most of our other markets are back to a regular order in terms of processing evictions. It's just not a huge deal in our world outside of California, obviously in California, you've got a different set of factors there that kind of frustrate our ability to work through the process. It's been a rolling extension of all those protections for the residents and who knows when they're going to – when we're going to see the end of that, but big picture, it's a small, very small component of our overall challenges. We probably having a non COVID environment, 50 to 70 evictions system-wide monthly. So if you just do an average for the year, it's maybe 600, 700 people being evicted out of 56,000 apartments. And so it's a really minuscule number. The biggest issue is are these high balance delinquencies in California, and it's not that they can't pay us, they won't pay. That's the moral hazard you have there. It's fascinating to me to see that we have an – today we have an 8.6% delinquency rate in LA, and we have a 0.4% delinquency rate in Houston. And the difference between the two is moral hazard.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then any markets showing incremental weakness in September, October, more than just seasonal?
Keith Oden: No, no.
Rob Stevenson: Okay thanks guys.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Our next question will come from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please go ahead.
Amanda Sweitzer: Great, good morning. Can you guys talk about what you're seeing today in terms of construction financing? Have you seen any other lenders or debt funds kind of come in and fill the gap from national lenders pulling back, and then just how have development loan terms changed from pre-COVID, both in terms of interest rates spreads and then LTVs?
Keith Oden: Sure. Yes. So there definitely have been pullbacks from money center banks on development and the debt funds are not coming into to fill the gap, but what's happened is, smaller regional banks are definitely coming into to fill some of the gap. The biggest issues that early on, I think Ron Witten had construction starts falling by 50% in his original projections. And that was driven by the debt capital market. And the debt market is being under pressure because of COVID. And then now I think he's saying, believes that it's going to be down by instead of 50%, maybe 30%. And it is definitely driven by debt. The biggest challenge that merchant builders are having is that banks do not want to syndicate. So getting loans over $50 million is troublesome and getting a loan over $100 million is very difficult. So properties in California and other big urban developments are definitely having a real hard time getting financing. I think that spreads have stayed reasonably tight and with interest rates falling the way they have. I think there's been, I've seen some folks talk about floors in their construction loans because just because rates are all time lows. The lenders need a reasonable minimum interest rate or minimum spread, I guess. So there are those getting put in place, but the biggest issue is the loan amount. And I think that's where the challenge is, because it's requiring a whole lot more equity. And there are some debt funds are coming in and bridging that equity with mezz financing, but that's generally the construction market is actually in.
Amanda Sweitzer: Well, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Kim with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on cap rates you're seeing in the threes. Are these more stabilized assets and the two cap rates or are they assets with potentially some of these have potential and to stabilize deal to be higher?
Ric Campo: They're stabilized cap rates and oftentimes and the challenge we have when we start underwriting those is that they're stabilized full, 93%, 94% occupied, but, but they are – there's a tremendous number of new developments around them leasing up. And so the questions that I have when we look at a three and three quarter, 94% occupied project with 2,000 units leasing up around it, is how can you actually hold that cap rate. It's likely to be, to go down beforeit goes up given the competition. And so these cap rates are very sticky today because of the just the wall of capital and the very, very, very cheap financing. You can get a Freddie-Fannie loan, very decent leverage it, two and some change for seven to 10 years. And if you're a floater, you can get a floating rate debt for under two. Right. And so it's – that's going to keep the private market very, very buoyant. And when you think about fundamentals, post-COVID, the multi-family, market's going to come back and most people believe that will be back to 2019 or early 2020 rents by 2022.
John Kim: Okay. And then Alex, you mentioned that you sold the Chirp Technology to third party. I'm just wondering why you chose to sell this platform, and then I'm assuming it doesn't impact the rollout across your portfolio, but just wanting to make sure that was the case.
Alex Jessett: No, yes, it does not impact a rollout across the portfolio at all. And we anticipate being fully rolled out by the end of 2021. Ultimately we came up with Chirp because there was a need that we needed to solve, and there was nobody else in the industry that was solving that. And so we spun it up, but we always knew that ultimately it needed to belong to somebody else that could run with it and could market it to third-parties, et cetera. And so we found a very natural buyer that we think is a great fit with us. And so we consummated the transaction, but we are still very, very much involved. And as I said, right now, we've probably got a little bit over 50% of our communities have the gateway aspect rolled out and that's what opens up the sort of the exterior doors. And we've got about 5,000 units signed up with the locks.
John Kim: May I ask who the buyer was.
Alex Jessett: Yes, it was RealPage.
John Kim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Zach Silverberg: Hi, good morning guys. As you discussed migration trends have been certainly in your favor here for the past couple of years and COVID will certainly provide the easier year over comp in 2021, but with occupancy and retention near all time highs, home sales and supply picking up in some corners of your market, putting it all altogether which cities or markets do you feel best or most worried about in 2021?
Ric Campo: Yes. I think that we're just starting the process of putting together our property level budgets for 2021. And my guess is that the markets right now where we have the most momentum on new lease rates and renewal rates will probably continue. And I think that some of the markets that have continued to have supply challenges in 2021 are going to be under pressure. And I’ve mentioned those earlier, Houston, Dallas, Charlotte going to continue to have supply pressure. We're having great success in Phoenix, Denver, Raleigh, Tampa and my guess is that, that those will start out at probably top of the deck in 2021.
Keith Oden: One of the things I think is going to be really interesting is to see the unwinding of the 18 to 29 year olds that have moved home with their parents. And that should be a tailwind post-COVID. When you look at prior to COVID and this is a big number, and it always hurts my head to think about this, because I have some know kids moving home. So pre-COVID, we had 39% of 18 to 29 year olds have lived at home. It's spiked to 30% to 46% in the middle of COVID, now it’s about down to 42% by the end of the third quarter. So one of the positives for us is we've had some of that demand released. There's still over a million, sort of missing millennials that are doubled up or at home. And once COVID breaks and job gains come back, those high propensity renters will come back into the market. I think more than offset people moving out to buy houses.
Zach Silverberg: Kind of appreciate the color. And I guess just the follow-up sort of earlier comment or question. I was wondering if you could provide any more color in the product type or geography where bad debt has run a little bit higher and has your average credit profile tenants changed throughout the pandemic.
Ric Campo: So bad debts or delinquencies if you want to call them that are highest in California, for sure. And that's primarily, as Keith mentioned driven by policy there, AB-3088 and what have you, it's just a policy there. The other market would be South Florida, South Florida is very tourist driven, obviously and South America travel driven. And we've seen maybe a 100 basis points to 200 basis points higher there than the rest of the markets, but most of the markets are pretty much in a normal kind of state including Orlando for a matter – given the situation in Orlando where you have same kind of 9% job losses there. In terms of credit quality absolutely not, the credit quality is one of the most important things we keep high, because we could easily increase our occupancy by 150 basis points. We dropped our credit quality, but what would happen is that you would you end up with more bad debts and more evictions and more skips, and we'd just be – there's just no upside ever in lowering your credit quality. And we are seeing no difference in delinquency from Class A, Class B or urban to suburban. Yes, delinquency is the same across the board.
Zach Silverberg: Awesome. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question will come from Alexander Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alexander Kalmus: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I was just circling back on the point regarding demographics. When you think about your portfolio today in the mix of one, two, three bedrooms that you have, do you think you're accounting for the growing cohort? Are you properly positioned for those grown families or would you like to see more three bedrooms in the future?
Ric Campo: Yes. If look at our three bedroom components we have about 6% of our portfolio is three bedrooms. And I bet if you took our three bedrooms compared to our one bedrooms our move out rate to buy houses would be substantially higher in our three bedrooms than our one bedrooms. So we have always generally, catered to a single people or people with one or two people in the apartment and not to families because they have a higher propensity to move out to buy houses or to rent houses. In addition families just require more stuff, more amenities and things like that. We have a property, for example, in Denver that that has all, twos, three bedrooms and not very many, one bedrooms, and it's a great family property, but it has a higher turnover rate and higher move out rate to buy and rent a house than any of our other properties in Denver. So it's not a market that we are catering to or will cater to in the future.
Alexander Kalmus: Got it. Thank you. Makes sense. And just looking at utilities expenses, they weren't that inflationary from last year. So do you have a sense on going back to work in your markets? How many of your tenants are working from home versus going back at some of your peers had much higher utility increases? Given the usage on the apartments?
Ric Campo: Yes. What I will tell you. If you look at utility expense, there was not a significant increase, but if you look at utility rebilling, which is probably a better way of thinking of it, there was a large increase. So we do believe that we've got a lot of our residents are at home, utilizing a lot more water than they and trash they typically would. So we think we've got a great deal of our residents are in fact working from home.
Alexander Kalmus: Got it. Thank you for the color.
Operator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Thank you. And thanks for being on the call today. We will – I am sure talk to lot of you at NAREIT here coming up soon. So, thank you and we will see you later. Have a great weekend and stay safe.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, welcome to the Camden Property’s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today’s call represent management’s current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden’s complete second quarter 2020 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will attempt to complete our call within one hour, so we ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. The theme for our on-hold music today was strange days. It’s one of the most common ways I’ve heard people life during this pandemic, strange days indeed. It’s common for some to refer to current state of affairs are unprecedented. I’ve concluded that while almost all agreed that these are strange days whether or not people believe these days are unprecedented is definitely age related. Younger people are more likely to view our current situation as unprecedented. People of my age are older and a far less likely to see these current strange days as unprecedented. In 1967, when I was 13 years old and a rock bank named The Doors released the song titled Strange Days. Clearly, I’ve a background from that. This is the first verse of the song. Strange days have found us. Strange days have tracked us down. They’re going to destroy, our casual joys. We shall go on playing or find a new town. The Doors were way ahead of their time both musically and culturally and indeed the next few years after 1967 will bring an extended period of strange days and civil unrest that were orders magnitude stranger than we’ve seen thus far during a COVID storm. I’m naturally optimistic and I promise you, this too shall pass since we’re all in this together. We’ll continue to encourage our Camden team to stay true to Camden’s Why. Our purpose for being, that is to improve the lives of our team members, residents and shareholders. One experience at a time. Apartment demand is strong in a market than we’ve expected given the nearly 40 million Americans that have filed for unemployment benefits with an official unemployment rate of 11.1%. Camden’s geographic and product diversification has continued to lower the volatility of our rents and occupancy. Camden’s Sunbelt market have fewer job losses than close to markets in the US overall. Our product mix that offers varying price points in urban and suburban locations continues to work for us. Camden was prepared to the pandemic, we have a great culture and flexible workplace and amazing employees that have adapted very, very well to the current work environment. Our investments in technology moving to the cloud based operating systems and our Chirp access systems have allowed us to not miss a beat when it comes to leasing or operating our portfolio or making payroll and some basic things like that. We have the best balance sheet in the sector and one of the best in replanned overall. We were prepared and continue to be prepared to do as well as we can in this environment. I think we’ll do well long-term. I want to give a shout out to our amazing Camden’s teammates for all that they do for our residents and taking care of each other every single day. I’ll turn the call over to Keith Oden now for couple comments from him. Thanks.
Keith Oden: Thanks Rick. Strange days indeed. My prepared remarks today will be brief as we want to allow as much time as possible for Q&A. we want to make sure that we’re providing you with the information that you find most useful to your ability to understand the current state of affairs in Camden’s market. At the outfit of the COVID storm, we held an all Camden conference call during which we told our Camden team that our highest priorities were number one, taking care of our Camden family and two, taking care of our residents. During the second quarter, we made good on that promise. We undertook various initiatives including a frontline bonus paid to our 1,400 onsite team members and we provided grants to almost 400 associates from our long-established Camden Employee Emergency Relief Fund. We also established Camden resident relief fund from which we were able to provide grants to 8,200 residents at a time of maximum financial uncertainty in their lives. We were pleased to be able to provide this level of assistance to the people who were financially impacted during the early stages of the COVID crisis. On our first quarter conference call, we were asked when we thought we could reintroduce guidance and we said that when we felt like we had reasonable visibility into the next quarter we would do so. At that time based on the confidence level that we had from our operations and finance teams regarding our projected May and June results. On a scale of one to 10, it was probably a two, not good. As we sit here today, while our confidence level is less than it would be in normal times. We do feel it is sufficiently to provide guidance for the third quarter and we’ve done so. I want to acknowledge the amazing job the team Camden has done in continuing to provide living expenses to our residents despite the radical changes we’ve made to our policies, procedures and protocols. It’s been incredible to the whole [ph]. Keep up the great work. And with a little good fortune, for which we were long overdue, we’ll see you soon. I’ll now turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden’s CFO.
Alex Jessett: Thanks Keith. For the second quarter of 2020 effective new leases were down 2.1% and effective renewals were up 2.3% for a blended growth rate of 0.3%. Our July effective lease results indicate a 2% decline for new leases and a 0.2% growth for renewal for a blended decrease of 0.9%. Occupancy averaged 95.2% during the second quarter of 2020 compared to 96.1% in the second quarter of 2019. Today our occupancy has improved to 95.5%. We continue to have great success in conducting alternative method property tours for perspective residents and retaining many of our existing residents with only a slight deceleration in total leasing activity year-over-year. In the second quarter, we averaged 3,855 signed leases monthly in our same property portfolio as compared to the second quarter of 2019 when we averaged 4,016 signed leases. July 2020 total signed leasing activity is in line with July 2019. For the second quarter of 2020, we collected 97.7% of our scheduled rents with 1.1% of our rents in the current deferred rent arrangement and 1.2% delinquent. This compares to the second quarter of 2019 when we collected 98.6% of our scheduled rent but with a slightly higher 1.4% delinquency. The third quarter is off to a strong start with 98.7% of our July 2020 scheduled rents collected ahead of our collections of 98.4% in July of 2019. Last night we reported funds from operations for the second quarter of 2020 of $110.4 million or $1.09 per share representing a $0.26 per share sequential decrease in FFO from the first quarter of 2020. As outlined in last night’s release included in this $0.26 sequential quarterly decrease is $14.02 of direct COVID related charges incurred during the quarter. After excluding the impact of this aggregate $14.02 per share sequential FFO decreased $0.12 in the second quarter resulting primarily from approximately $0.05 per share in lower same store net operating income resulting from a $0.02 per share decrease in revenue from our 90 basis points sequential occupancy decline, a $2.50 per share decrease in re venue resulting from an increase in bad debt reserves from approximately 45 basis points in the first quarter to approximately 180 basis points in the second quarter and an approximate $0.50 per share sequential increase in expenses. Approximately $2.50 in lower non same store development and retail NOI also resulting from a combination of lower occupancy and high bad debt reserves and approximately $0.04 per share in higher interest expense resulting from our April 20th, $750 million bond issuance. Turning to bad debt, in accordance with GAAP certain uncollected rent is recognized by us as income in the current month. We then evaluate this uncollected rent and establish what we believe to be an appropriate bad debt reserve which serves as a corresponding offset to property revenues in the same period. As previously mentioned, for same store our bad debt as a percentage of rental income increased from approximately 45 basis points in the first quarter to approximately 180 basis points in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we reserved effectively all of the 1.2% of delinquent rents as bad debt. Also in the second quarter, we reserved effectively half of 1.1% of deferred rent arrangements as bad debt. When a resident moves out owing us money, we have already reserved 100% of the amounts owed as bad debt and there will be no future impact to the income statement. We reevaluate our bad debt reserves monthly for collectability. In the second quarter for retail which is not part of same store. We reserved 100% of all amounts uncollected and not deferred which totaled approximately $800,000. Last night based upon our recent trends, we issued FFO and same store guidance for the third quarter. However, given the continued uncertainty surrounding the social and economic impacts from COVID-19 at this time we will not provide an update to our financial outlook for the full year. For the third quarter of 2020, as compared to the third quarter of 2019 at the midpoint. We expect same store revenues to decline by 1.6% driven primarily by lower occupancy, higher bad debt and lower miscellaneous fee income. We expect expenses to increase by 4.5% driven primarily by higher property insurance, higher property tax assessments and large property tax refunds receive in Atlanta and Houston in the third quarter of 2019. As a result, we expect NOI at the midpoint to decline by 5%. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.14 to $1.20. The midpoint of $1.17 is $0.08 per share better than the $1.09 we reported in the second quarter. However, after adjusting our second quarter results for the previously discussed $0.14 of COVID related charges. Our $1.17 midpoint for the third quarter is a $0.06 per share sequential decrease resulting primarily from a $4.50 per share sequential decline in same store NOI as a result of $0.50 per share decrease in revenue resulting primarily from lower net market rents and a $0.04 per share increase in sequential expenses resulting primarily from the typical seasonality of our operating expenses, the timing of certain R&M cost and the timing of certain property tax refunds and assessment. And approximate $0.50 per share decline in non same store NOI resulting primarily from the same reasons and an approximately $0.50 per share increase in sequential interest expense resulting from our April 20 bond issuance. As of today, we have approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity comprised of just over $500 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amount outstanding on our $900 million unsecured credit facility. At quarter end, we had $185 million left to spend over the next 2.5 years under our existing development pipeline and we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022. Our current excess cash is invested with various bank earning approximately 30 basis points. And finally, a quick update on technology. As I discussed our on-site teams are having great success with virtual leasing and we just completed our second virtual quarterly close, a task that would been so much harder if not nearly impossible without our investment in a cloud based financial systems. As mentioned yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, we’re continuing our pilot of Chirp our smart access solution with great success and we’re finding even more ways to utilize as the Chirp technology. At our pilot communities for self-guided tours, our leasing teams can use the Chirp access applications to grant a prospect limited access to tour both the community and specific available apartment homes in a completely touch less exchange. There is no need for the prospect to pick up physical keys or fobs or ever even enter the leasing office. Our leasing teams create the prospect a Chirp account, grant them access to the best apartments. Chose and [indiscernible] their unique wants and needs and then determine when the prospects access will expire. Additionally, we can utilize Chirp to quickly and automatically control the number of residents who have access to an amenity space such as a fitness center at any given time. Amenity spaces deemed as reservation only. Will require residents to use the Chirp access application to reserve a specific timeslot. Only those residents with confirmed reservations will have access to open the door of the amenity space for the allotted time. When the reservation expires, so does access to the amenity. Clearly, in this COVID environment our Chirp initiative takes on even more importance. At this time, we’ll open up the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Thanks for the initial comments. I thought it might be most helpful to talk about the markets in particular your 3Q guidance. Alex, I think you talked about lower occupancy, higher bad debt. I guess can you talk a little bit more specifically on Houston and maybe even Phoenix. We were surprised to see the 2% occupancy drop in Phoenix. Thank you.
Ric Campo: Jeff, Houston continues to be one of our weaker markets. We have two challenges headwinds and separate from the COVID in Houston. The energy business is obviously still continuing to be under pressure. But also, we were scheduled and continue to be scheduled to deliver roughly 19,000 apartments in 2020 according to Vitans [ph] numbers so those are in the process of being brought online. The place where we see the most impact to that is in Downtown, Midtown area where a lot of the new deliveries are coming online. So that would have been an issue irrespective of trying to absorb 20,000 apartment, 19,000 apartments in an environment where the job growth was already going to be a little bit under pressure from the energy business and yet on top of that, the job losses that are not related to the energy business at all. Yes, I mean it’s more of a challenging environment. We think that in terms of renewal leases or renewals that are going out in Houston, one out in July those are going out at basically flat. It’s one of the - so our renewal overall across our markets for the July renewals that went out is about 1.8% across the platform. It’s as high as 4% renewals in Austin and then at the low end of that would be Houston at basically flat. So it certainly feels like from a renewal standpoint more getting back closer to regular order in terms of every market that we are operating in, we’re sending out renewals with increases. Specifically in Phoenix, at the seasonal weakness that we always have in the middle of the summer. The 2% occupancy drop is a little bit more than what we would normally see but it’s not unusual to have that kind of weakness. We still have pretty decent rental growth in Phoenix and it continues to be on a projection going forward. It continues to be one of our bright spot markets for us. It’s been incredibly strong for the last two years and we think that market is going to continue perform well for us.
Jeff Spector: Thank you.
Keith Oden: And Jeff, when we talk about lower occupancy and higher bad debt, we’re comparing the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020. We actually expect third quarter 2020 occupancy to be relatively flat to the second quarter 2020 in the aggregate.
Jeff Spector: Okay, that’s good to know. Thank you. My second question, if I can ask. Your peers talked about an Exodus [ph] to single family rentals this past quarter. Are you seeing the same thing in your markets?
Keith Oden: The single-family market or move out to apply single family homes went up slightly at the beginning of the quarter, but it flattened out and it’s still in 14%, 15% range. Obviously with low interest rate and the marginal folks that were going to go buy houses, are buying houses right now. But generally speaking when you look at our demographic profile with a lot of single folks that are living in our apartments even with low interest rate. They’re just not buying houses and so with that said we haven’t really seen any increase in moving out to rent houses or buy houses.
Jeff Spector: Thank you. I wish everyone well.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Go ahead.
Nick Yulico: First question is just on your new leasing renewal pricing. It did actually get a little bit better, it looks like in July versus the second quarter. And I just want to be clear here on the renewals because it sounds like some of the renewals that you’re doing now are also improving versus the second quarter so, just trying to understand how we should think about rental pricing dynamics in the third quarter and the rest of the year. I mean, are things getting better or worse you think?
Keith Oden: Well on the renewal side, there’s no question they’re getting better. Part of that though if you’ll recall for the first 90 days after the COVID storm hit, we went to shut down mode. We actually from a policy perspective just so we’re not going to take any renewal increases for the next 60 to 90 days and then as it turned out it was a little right at 90 days that we just did not process. We offered everybody renewal at flat. Now, could we have as it turns out in 2020 in hindsight, could you’ve gotten 1% or 2% increases? Probably. But from the standpoint of two thoughts on that. One was we just had no idea how to measure the collapsing demand from 30 or 40 million evaporating. So there was a great concern on our part that you need to keep every resident that you have in place, that it’s possible. So that was one part of it. The second part was really more of a - it was just more. In terms of resident who have been kind of shut in to their apartments most of them working from home. And at the time, we had been mandated in almost every case to close all amenity spaces. So you have people who are in the midst of pandemic, 40 million job losses and then they can’t even use the amenities. It just seemed like a terrible idea to be pushing through rental increases to our residents at a time where they couldn’t even full value of the proposition that they’ve felt they bargained for, so part of it was just to protect the relationship that we have with our residents and not create that kind of tension that would come from leasing consultants trying to get what would amount to $20 or $30 rental increase from residents in that timeframe. So the net of all that is, our renewals were probably under what could have been achieved in the first half of the year and obviously it’s back to regular order now and we’re just in a really different place. We’re in different place. Our residents are in a different place. For the most part our amenity spaces are all open, some with restrictions. But they’re open again. So we expect much better results on renewals. But new leases in July were just tiny bit better than a tick up from where we in the first half of the year. I think more importantly for us. Is that we were able to maintain and above 95% occupancy rate with between the new lease activity and the renewals. So to me that was more important to see the stability there and it gives us something to grow on, going forward.
Ric Campo: Let me just add that. Early on in the pandemic, we along with the leadership of the NMHC Group, Doug Bibby and his team. We hosted an industry conference call and then we came up with as a team the best practices for the way the industry ought to face the pandemic and the industry was all about, even before late fees were banned by governments or evictions and things like that. We came out with a set of principles that were just bind to help residents in a very uncertain time. And one of the principles was, flat renewals, no late fees, work with people in terms of payment plans and things like that. I think the industry did a great job of showing it that they really care about their customers and so to Keith’s point. Sure we could have renewed leases during the first part of the pandemic at decent rates. But we just chose not to now. There are some folks in our industry that just didn’t do that and they did raise rents and you know that’s just not our culture. And I think most of the industry followed those principles of trying to help their customers in a very, very uncertain and complicated time. The thing it’s really interesting about this is that, we’re four months into it right, which is like nothing compared to the financial crisis and all that. And so, so uncertain and I think that people -- when you think about how you treat your customers. It’s all about building your brand long-term and making sure that customers understand that you actually care about them.
Nick Yulico: Okay, thanks. That’s helpful. Just second question would be, if you have any stats you can provide on the nature of your total portfolio in terms of which buildings you think are high rise product versus not. I mean, I think you definitely have some in Hollywood, Washington DC. I think you have at least one in Houston. And whether you’re seeing as well any difference in leasing demand for what would be more high-rise concrete steel type product versus lower rise stick and brick product? Thanks.
Ric Campo: For us the good news. I don’t know if it’s good news or bad news. So we don’t have as many high rises as we have mid and low rises. We balanced the portfolio pretty well to - like just take Houston as an example. We have two high rises in Houston that are actually high rises, 22 storey, 30 storey. We’ve seen really no change in demand for high rises and some in those markets and same at DC. Because DC is actually a stand-up market for us right now, which is great? But when you think about our portfolio in Houston. We then go to a midrise where you might have a H3 building and then six H3 building and then we go to down as low as two or three storey lots. Actually we have some older property we built, older properties we built and then 20 years ago, that are two storey. So we tend to be more suburban, more lower density but we really haven’t seen a lot of differentiation between high rise or low rise given though we don’t have many high rises. And then I think the other part of that equation is sort of geographic mix and product mix that we have and generally speaking we’re sort of skewed towards suburban and more B than A. right now, we don’t really see a lot of variation in collections or in demand for any of that product. It’s all about the same.
Nick Yulico: Thanks, appreciated.
Operator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: It relates to the bad debt. I was curious, how much of an impact that had on your same store revenue growth in the second quarter and then what did you assume for bad debt in 3Q same store revenue guidance because from the July collections data. It looks like they were actually better than both the first quarter and 2Q of last year?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely so. As I said our bad debt went from approximately 45 basis points in the first quarter to approximately 180 basis points in the second quarter. So you can look at that, 140 basis points and that’s a direct reduction in revenue on a sequential same store basis. So you can do the math on that. When we look at what we’ve got in our model on a go forward basis. We’re anticipating that the third quarter bad debt drops down to somewhere right around 125 basis points so it goes from 180 to 125 and so hopefully we’ll get some pickup on that. Now that pickup is going to be offset by slightly lower net market rents and will also be offset by slightly lower re-letting income. We did get a fair amount of re-letting income in the second quarter as we did have folks break their leases.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood. And then as it relates to Chirp. Just curious what’s kind of timeline for rolling that out across the portfolio and then can you remind us, how we should think about the returns there and how you guys are measuring that?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So you have to think about Chirp and two components. The first one is the gateway and that’s the Chirp that controls the access gateways also controls the amenities space etc. we’ve rolled out right around 12,000 units and we expect to have gateway rolled out across our entire portfolio really by the end of the year. The second component is, what we call the [indiscernible] curb-to-couch solution which includes gateway but also goes to the individual locks of the unit and we’ve rolled out about 1,500 doors with that solution and we expect that probably by about this point next year, we will have total sales. So it’s gateway plus lock rolled out across our entire portfolio. It’s really interesting when we originally looked at what the value proposition was for this, we looked at a lot of things around not having to re-key locks, time that are on folks, people spent, letting vendors etc. in. and then we also knew that there was some embedded value proposition to a resident to be able to push a button and let the pizza delivery guy in the gate and go straight to their front door rather than having to get out of their jammies and walk down to the front gate and open it up. We never would have thought of COVID-19 and all of the additional benefits that we’ve not gotten from this. And so we’re still at the point of trying to quantifying all of the benefits. But I will tell you when we look at orders that we see that say, gyms must be a 25% capacity or 50% capacity. This is nearly impossible for a typical apartment operator to enforce. However with our Chirp access application, we can do that and we can do it very easily. When we think about virtual leasing which is undoubtedly the future of our industry. You can’t have virtual leasing unless you have an access application that opens gate, close doors. So there are a lot of additional benefits that we’re still in the process of quantifying. But ultimately, we think this is a huge differentiator for Camden and ultimately, we’ll be huge differentiator for the industry.
Austin Wurschmidt: So you’re attempting the measure and all what you think the returns are, is it just an additional offering across the entire portfolio that you think will generate value just overtime from a demand perspective and just resident satisfaction perspective?
Alex Jessett: That’s exactly right. I think ultimately a resident of Camden who has Chirp, when they got look at an additional or at another community and they realize that they will have to take time off work to let their dog walker into their apartment when they realize that they will have to meet all of their guests at the front gate. I think they will ultimately pay us to have the flexibility and to have the convenience of the Chirp application that will provide.
Keith Oden: I think the other issue is cost savings because when you think about the number of keys we have and lost keys and emotion that goes on with having to help people open their doors and things like that. It ought to be a relieve us some cost and allow our on-site people to in fact serve the customer better.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: The Chirp feature sounds pretty interesting, just given I’m guessing all the different uses of that can be. So just two questions here. The first is, in California maybe I missed it. What percent of your residents are basically free loading? Are in there not paying rent and off those that aren’t paying rent, how many do you think will not pay rent versus are just saving the money and once the eviction moratoriums go over, they’ll pay you the back rent? Along with some hopefully there’s interest that accrues, but I’m not sure.
Alex Jessett: So when you look at July delinquency California has improved tremendously. It’s still our highest delinquent market. But it’s at about 3.6% today. Obviously, time will tell as we’re able to start enforcing contracts what percentage of those folks actually pay. But as I said, it is a significant improvement from where it was four months ago.
Alexander Goldfarb: And where was it four months ago?
Ric Campo: I kind of stopped because there’s no late fees. They’re banned by the government. I think it’s really instructive though when you look at in Houston for example. Our Houston numbers are not even single digits. They’re in the point 3% or 4% range and California is 3% change. It shows you sort of mentality and that gets to the whole sort of Government Issue. I mean if you’re a resident in California and you listen to the Mayor of LA, the Governor. Their messaging is, don’t worry you don’t have to pay and the limitation of late fees. The limitation of being able to evict somebody creates, what we call ghosting. Which is they just don’t show up and they don’t have the ability. They know they don’t have any negative recourse, you’re not charging them interest or late fees and they know they can’t be evicted and so you just have, you have this ghosting scenario that happens out there and it is a - I think a serious morale hazard issue and it’s just - in most of our Sun Belt markets people just think, they should pay their rent on time, if they have the money and California, it’s just a little different animal.
Alexander Goldfarb: So Ric, your view is that most people will pay when they have to or are these all the people Alex that you said you wrote off as delinquents and you wrote them all off and you’re not expecting any of them to pay.
Ric Campo: We’re writing them off based on our policy. But I think that folks that care about their credit and care about - if you care about your credit you’re going to pay. A lot of the people that aren’t paying today actually have the ability to pay. They’re just not paying. So we have clearly modified our bad debt policy and increase the accrual for bad debts. But we might be surprised that people actually do pay when the government tells them they should pay. I think one of the things that it is really interesting and this is I think sort of system wide but it’s probably more important in California is that, the Apartment Associations are trying to educate people because when the Governors and Mayors say that there’ll be no evictions. A lot of folks think that means, that get free. Right. And like okay, we’re not going to evict or foreclose on anybody and they think that during that period it’s free. And we’re educating people saying, rule number one it’s not free. Number two, if you do run up a debt and you don’t pay the debt then you’re going to ruin your credit and the next apartment you’re going to try to lease is going to have a real problem with you and you’ll not be able to lease an apartment or get credit and so I think that education process is really important for the industry because people don’t get it. That actually it is a debt and you do have to pay it.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, you guys I mean to your comment it sounds like everything is stabilized and while you’re expecting lower occupancy, that’s year-over-year. So basically, you’re flat from the second quarter and the impact in the third quarter is really from just continued bad debt and some lower fees. So I guess, why do you guys think that your markets, your portfolio is holding up better than the coastal urban guys who are continuing to unfortunately experience accelerating weakness. I mean you guys have had increased COVID recently. But that doesn’t seem to fade a factor. So what do you think is it, is it just less social unrest, less of the protest or what is going on your market for you guys seem to stabilize where in the coastal areas it seems to be accelerating?
Ric Campo: Yes, I think it’s exactly that. I think number one as I said in my earlier comments. There have been fewer job losses. When you look at job losses. I mean they’re significantly higher in the coast and the Sun Belt markets have not lost as many jobs and when you look at social unrest there’s an issue too. There are some markets where you can’t even get to your property because of the urban nature and the sort of takeover block in certain cities. So I think it’s all about the things that been driving our markets before when you think about recoveries, the Sun Belt recovers quicker and has more jobs generally. And so I think it’s really a jobs issue more than anything.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Joseph from Citi. Go ahead.
Nick Joseph: You mentioned not only four months into this and given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty and elevated unemployment. Do you currently expect any more tenants or employee relief or frontline bonuses to incur?
Keith Oden: Yes, we don’t have any plans currently Nick to do anything along the lines of what we did in the second quarter. The impetus for that was I’ve laid out some of the rationale earlier in my comments. But in addition to that, it was just the timeliness of it. It was such a jolt to so many people in the way it happened unlike in previous downturn. Where there was sort of this rolling layoff scenario, people had time to adjust and make preparations. This is was you think you were good on a Friday and on Monday, your job is gone and so people were, there was an urgency to getting some financial relief to both residents and our Camden employees who got affected. The impact to that was really always to bridge a gap in time to get to a scenario where there was a more permanent relief available to both residents and to Camden employees and that’s happened. And it happened through the stimulus, it happened through the plus up on employment benefits. Now there’s - there’s lot of wrangling now about - are they going to extend that into what extent. But even in the scenarios where they talk about not including the plus up, the provision the most conservative provision that I’ve seen is 70% of your previous income in unemployment payments and honestly for most Camden residents where we have an average household income of about $105,000 our average rental payment is about 18% of that. So if you’re paying 18% of your rent, you’re getting 70% in unemployment. Most people can figure out a way to make that work. So now that’s the long answer to saying, we don’t anticipate it.
Nick Joseph: That’s helpful. I reckon that it’s only been probably two- or three-months max. But have you seen any differences in terms of delinquency or turnover for those residents who received any of the relief?
Keith Oden: No we haven’t. Although I think the thing is very encouraging for us is the collections number that we’ve seen year-to-date or month-to-date in July, 98%. We actually have collected have collections higher in the month of July at this point in the month than we had in 2019 which is fairly remarkable and my guess is, is that there is some component of that people have - some associated goodwill. But it’s hard to know, what people’s motivations are.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Neil Malkin from Capital One. Go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Are you seeing an increase in migration into your beautiful Sun Belt market from the coast which like Alex is alluding to are getting pretty dicey, more dangerous? So I’m just curious is that trend is exacerbated or any comments you’re getting, anecdotally on the ground from your managers?
Ric Campo: Sure, so clearly the in migration out of coastal markets has continued. It’s been going on for long time and we start looking at U Haul rates. It’s cheap to leave. It’s cheap to go to California and to Seattle that’s very expensive to move out of it. I think it’s like four, five times more expensive to lease one of those U Haul to go out of California to Texas or Arizona than it is to go into California because there’s too many of them coming out and not going in. The other thing that we’ve been watching is, is postal forwarding. Where you forward your mail and there’s been a tick up mail being forwarded. It’s hard to tell whether people are just sheltering in place out of their markets. But I think it’s just a continuation of really a long-term trend. If you look at - if you take immigration out of the equation there’s been out migration in California and New York and for the last 10 years and the only thing that is increasing - gets to be positive, is immigration. So I think that’s going to continue. I don’t think - I guess if you - if the issue is, do all the coastal markets, do they rebound as New York City rebound. I think we have to think about like after 9/11. After 9/11 Downtown New York was like people talked about how it will never come back, right. Well, it did. I think that Americans have short memories and when it comes down. How do I feel about where I am? I think the fundamental challenges and highly regulated very experience markets where people are paying 40% to 50% of their income for rent or housing, that just is unsustainable and that’s why I think a lot of them out migration has happened for a long time and I don’t think that’s going to change. And will people put up with it and deal with it in the future, yes. I don’t think big cities are going to empty out. But I just think it’s just the pressure on people to want to have a decent place to live without having to pay after income. It is going to continue to drive out migration into these more affordable markets and I think that’s going to continue.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. Appreciate that I agree. Second one, in terms of the development. It seems like and the acquisition side is going to be less fruitful just given the available and low-cost debt right now. So it seems that development deals, land deals are probably going to be your best bet particularly with your balance sheet. So I’m just wondering if you can talk about how you see that. What are the opportunities in front of you? Are you seeing like land deals coming - falling to or coming to market? And also if you take a look at ever doing preferred or mezz lending with some sort of equity at the end participation. Thanks.
Ric Campo: So we have started to see some shove already development deals that where the merchant builder couldn’t get their financing or the equity pulled out or they underwrite. It’s hard to underwrite anything today, right. Given the uncertainty about where the markets going to be in two years. And so even though in longer term I think people feel like development is definitely going to be a good option. We already started to see some price softness in the construction market which is good. So we were seeing 3% to 5% increases. Now we’re seeing flat to 2% to 3% down which is really good. So we’re sorry to see some of those opportunities. It might be you know - I think it’s a little early still because the market just hasn’t, we haven’t had a shakeout yet and that will take maybe through the end of the year to have that happen. In terms of getting involved in mezz or pre-sales and things like that. We have stayed out of those kind of products over the years. Primarily if you think about it, in the financial crisis we had about $3 billion worth of joint ventures and other types of structures and we thought it lowered our risk and what it really did is, increase our risk because our partners and having to work through the issues that the financial crisis created took a lot of time and effort and so we decided after that, that we would not do things that wouldn’t move the needle for Camden. I assure you can do go $500 million worth of mezz and move the needle a little. But at the end of the day what moves our business long-term is our cash flow that we grow from our properties and so we want to have the cleanest balance sheet in a simplest structure and not have any distractions having to deal with small equity positions or mezz positions and then have to go deal with people in that, that’s just in our forte. We might do pre-sale or something like that. But we’re definitely not going to do mezz or anything like that. It just doesn’t move the needle enough and it’s too much of a distraction for our teams and we want them focusing on the big picture where shareholders have 100% of the exposure in the property.
Neil Malkin: All right. Makes a lot of sense, thank you guys for the time.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Go ahead.
John Pawlowski: I’m curious as some of the Sun Belt economies [indiscernible] kind of walk back reopening plans in recent weeks and months. As you’ve noticed in July any meaningful inflection point in terms of leasing velocity or notices of move out in any of your larger market maybe excluding Houston?
Keith Oden: Yes, I’ll even include Houston and say that we have not seen any meaningful pullback. I mean it’s the - if you think about what we went through in terms of converting our approach to be basically 100% virtual leasing for a period of time. So we got that tradecraft down to an art and so, prior to the kind of most recent spiking in cases in Texas and particular but also in Florida. We had gone back to sort of hybrid model where we would allow access to our leasing offices for someone that wanted to do an in-person tour as long as they have both our folks and the prospect worse mask and socially distance. So we did that and then with the spiking, the feedback we got from our folks is they just were not as comfortable with that approach. So we went back to basically an appointment only virtual tour. And so most of what you see in July activity which is really good for us was activity of that variety. I think it was in first week in July we went back to a kind of a virtual only model and we’re fine with that. And our folks are proficient at it. They’re comfortable with it. The prospect interestingly enough, when we ask our prospects what their preference is about 30% to 40% of our prospects tell us that they would prefer this permanently as a way to lease apartments. So I think it’s going to be a part of the mix for the future and we’re really good at it. So I think we’re good.
John Pawlowski: Okay, but on the move-out side any interesting shifts across markets or your 60-day exposure coming up here?
Keith Oden: No we’re in good shape. Our pre-lease numbers are really healthy. Which is why we got the comfort level that we got to give guidance for the third quarter? July is basically over, so you’re looking at August, September. We have pretty good visibility and to the free lease numbers traffic is good, our closing percentages are where they need to be and like I said earlier John. The key for us was being able to maintain a 95% plus occupancy while we reinitiated renewal increases and we were getting back to something closer to flat on new leases.
John Pawlowski: Okay, last one from me. In some of your harder hit economies like in Orlando or Houston. If you’re a buyer in those markets today on a stabilized deal. What kind of discount on asset value basis would you be looking for versus kind of pre-COVID levels?
Alex Jessett: It’s a complicated question because there’s just no trades going on. And the trades that are going on, I think people are buying by the pound and not by the cap rate or the discount. So often times, I think fundamentally pricing hasn’t changed in the private market and cap rates have declined and compressed in the market because people are - if you look at the cash flows people thinking that underwriting them, going down over the next call it, six months or eight months or however long the pandemic lasts. And then they, if you look at [indiscernible] numbers. There’s a pretty big snapback in 2022, sort of end of 2021, 2022, 2023. So if you’re underwriting a project in Houston or anywhere today there is no discount and you have to take a lower cap rate and then I think the belief that is that, is that the cash flow will grow faster than before the pandemic and you’ll get back to a total return that is rationale total return with that increase in cash flow. So the real question is going to be to me, is how fast will investors get to that level? And then I guess there’s just a wall of capital out there and with the treasury at 0.5% something financing on existing assets is incredibly cheap and when you look at leveraged buyers. You’re going to look at their equity returns with incredibly low cost of debt. I think there’s going to be a lot of activity and interest in multi-family. The question will be how long does it take to get those investors to a point where they can feel like they can do some underwriting in the next couple of years. The development side is a little more complicated because constructions loans are really hard to get today. Lenders have lots of others issues in real estate, be it retail and office [ph] and others. And so increase in exposure for them in a construction side and multi-family is hard for them to do today and I think that’s where the opportunity might be from an acquisition perspective, but we’ll just have to see.
John Pawlowski: Okay, thanks so much for the thoughts.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Go ahead.
Rich Anderson: So I guess it was Chirp because Tweet was taken.
Ric Campo: It’s an homage to a hummingbird.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Anybody in field here, how would you characterize the amount of what you call the ghosting or people taking advantage of regulations in states like California? How much did that supply view in terms of the number of people, was it lesser or more than you thought? And the reason why I ask is, do you think there’s a longer-term impact in your underwriting criteria in terms of looking at the individual credits of your tenants before signing a lease?
Keith Oden: Yes, so in terms of the impact in our California portfolio so if you break it out between, where we’re total collections and LA, Orange County which is our lowest collection for the second quarter of 2020, we have collected 92.6% of our scheduled rents and that’s the lowest in our portfolio and it’s really not even close beyond that. Everything else in our portfolio, Southeast Florida is 94% and then everything else is above 95% and most are in the 98% range. So it’s clearly an outlier. But if you take the 92.6% collected and you break it out between deferred payment plan and truly delinquent, 2.3% is deferred payment and 5.1% is delinquent. So the 2.3%, we have had conversations with the people have said we have financial distress, we need a path forward and that means we have a written agreement with them on how they’re going to get whole on the rent from a standpoint of their delinquency. So the 5.1%, so if we don’t for the most part they don’t communicate. Maybe they can’t pay and just choose not to communicate. But our guess is that, they’re a pretty large percentage of those folks, have just gone dark because they think they cannot pay their rent for some period of time and get away with it. And so the challenge is, that the policy prescriptions of no evictions, no late fees and by the way sort of wink and a nod among political leaders that we can’t give you direct rent relief. But we’re creating conditions on the ground that prevent you from being evicted from your apartment and in some way, that’s rent relief which it’s truly not from a liability standpoint. But from the standpoint of do I have to pay, it does create that. So I think this is a unique circumstance relative to this pandemic and it’s hard for me to imagine. Even in the great financial crisis. We didn’t have policy prescriptions of that variety anywhere including in California. Now may the politics have changed that much in the last 10 years? But I think it’s probably ultimately, ends up being pretty unique to this particular pandemic and not some greater incidence of policy prescriptions around, you can’t evict people who don’t pay their rent, that’s my personal view.
Rich Anderson: All right. And then second question is, Ric you mentioned, you think there might be some permanency to this sort of move to the suburbs and B the versus A and so on. But I’m not sure I agree with it being a permanent condition and maybe I’m putting words in your mouth. But nonetheless, to what degree could this alter your strategy? I know you kind of already fits into your wheelhouse a bit already. If you believe in some systemic change to that conversation, do you see a systematic change in how you’re going to pursue the business longer term?
Ric Campo: If you heard that I thought there was a permanent shift from urban to suburban or high rise or major cities to smaller cities, I don’t believe that. I really don’t. Like I said earlier, we have - people have short-term memories and at the end of the day. Once the pandemic is over. Everybody gets back to work and they’re focusing on their lives. They’re going to do what they want to do and I think people do love urban environments. They love restaurants. They love going to the ballpark and when that comes back. They will engage that again. I do think that there will be some. But I do think that continue out migration from coastal markets to Sun Belt markets is going to continue. But I don’t know that it’s not going to - those markets are still going to be fine markets long-term. They’re just going to have issues that they have today pre-pandemic. So from our perspective when we start thinking about where we want to be, it continues to be the same drivers longer term which is high job growth, low pro-business governments, good weather, young people, great workforce, that kind of stuff. I think from a sort of product mix perspective. We definitely are going to continue to invest in urban and suburban properties. I think that from a development perspective. We are thinking really hard about our spaces and how we utilize the space inside the common areas and are thinking a lot about okay, maybe the work from home is going to be a bigger piece of the equation because I do think that, that the work from home is going to be massively more than it was pre-pandemic and primarily because if you think about Camden. We have 450 people plus or minus working from home and they’re doing really well. And so the people that had hour commutes one way are going wow, I got two hours of my life back, plus I don’t have wear and tear my car and all those expenses. So we can get people their time back and raises in essence by letting them work from home. So from our perspective we’re going to spend a lot more time looking at our properties and creating a more user-friendly work from home environment. Prior to once the pandemic hit, one of the things we did is amp up the bandwidth in all of our properties because if you had low bandwidth. I mean we were just getting people going nuts because they couldn’t do Zoom calls and things like that. So we amped our bandwidth up and I think we’re going to - so when we think about modifying our existing buildings and then building new buildings, you have to think about that work from home component. I think that’s going to be a big shift.
Rich Anderson: All right, great. Thanks for the color. Appreciated.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Go ahead.
Rich Hightower: I’ll be quick. I just want to make sure I understand something here. As far as the collections raised in 2Q, where did the relief funds fit into that? Was that part of that calculation or separated, how do we understand that relationship?
Alex Jessett: Yes, it was separated.
Rich Hightower: Okay, so it’s not included in the 97% plus collected in 2Q.
Alex Jessett: That is correct.
Rich Hightower: Okay, thanks for that Alex and then I guess just to pile on to the anti-California sentiment. How do you think about the Southern California footprint longer term? It’s a tough market to build and it checks a lot of the boxes, Ric I think you described about the nature of the workforce and people want to be there and this and that. But how do you think about political risk and the impact to cap rates and values over the long-term? How do you think about that?
Alex Jessett: So I think California will always be a market that people want to be in. it’s one of the biggest economies in the world. If it was its own, country. It’s always going to have challenges that just like New York City has challenges but people love to live in New York City and I think they love California. California will continue to struggle with its issues. But I think that long-term California is a good market and I don’t think when we start talking about our portfolio and when you think about our Sun Belt mix. California right now is dragging our performance down and have we not had California then we would definitely have better same store numbers and better everything, better collections and all that. So but ultimately when you think, the way I think about portfolio is geographically, diverse and product mix, diverse portfolio and over a long period of time. The volatility balances out and we lower volatility prior to the pandemic. Southern California was one of our better markets. We were growing 3.5%, 4% and the average is good. It was offsetting our slower growth in Houston. To me, I know that there’s a lot of people piling on to California, New York and Seattle and some of these other markets. They’re not going away, there will be good, long-term markets and hopefully the pandemic moves through fast and we’ll get back to good growth. They will continue to have the pressure from government trying to cap rents through rent control and other issues. But generally speaking, even if you put a rent control law and generally is better for the incumbents and harder to build means that you don’t have competition so the offset to maybe the tough government and out migration is you’re not going to rebuild those markets very often and they’ll still be good.
Rich Hightower: All right, thanks for the comments.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead.
John Kim: You guys too popular for one-hour call. Had a couple questions on guidance. You mentioned a lower occupancy which is clear on a year-over-year basis. But I was wondering how you see it trending during the quarter because you already had a 30 basis points sequential increase in July and the second part is, are you seeing so expense guidance for 4.5%? How much of that was already contemplated when provided your original guidance was 3% for the year? I know that kindness isn’t cancelled [ph], just wanted to see how much of that was new versus already none?
Alex Jessett: Yes, I mean so if you think about it. Our second quarter 2020 occupancy was 95.2 and for July it is 95.3. I told you that it was 95.5 this morning. So obviously we’re getting some uptick. But effectively in our guidance we’re assuming that occupancy is flat in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. When you look at expenses almost all of that was known. Really the largest driver that we typically have in expenses is the timing of property tax refunds and it’s just the way the timing works that the third quarter was going to have higher sequential property tax number and in fact, if you looked at it on a third quarter, 2020 to third quarter, 2019 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. You also had the same impact where we got some very favorable refunds in Atlanta and in Houston in the third quarter of 2019. So that’s really the driver. The drivers are by in large property tax driven.
John Kim: Okay, that’s helpful and you guys talked about some of your changes in potential long-term strategy. But I had a question on shorter term strategy. It seems like a lot of people up here in Northeast are contemplating becoming snowbirds this winter. I was wondering if you anticipate that happening, if you see potentially higher demand if you’re willing to potentially provide some shorter-term leases to meet that demand.
Ric Campo: Well we definitely will provide short-term leases to meet that demand at a premium rate for sure. And that we are open to all comers when it - if that happens and we’re ready even though our occupancy levels are really high right now. We still have room to move those occupancy levels up.
John Kim: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Zach Silverberg from Mizuho. Go ahead.
Zach Silverberg: My first one is just, some of your peers’ sort of spoke about migration of college students from city-to-city. Just curious if you guys see any potential headwinds as universities are more reluctant to open international students has been to travel and are there any sort of markets that are disproportionately impacted by this trend?
Keith Oden: Yes, we haven’t seen any impact of that nature. I think there’s still so much conversation around who’s going to open and how and when, that until we probably get into actually the month of September to see what we’re all that shook out, if the college level, we’re just not going to no. we don’t really have, Austin would be probably a market where it’s always been a big university town. But within the context of how much Austin has grown over the years that’s become less and less important. But outside of that, I think it just remains to be seen on, how many of the students actually are going to get called back to the university to an in-person experience around the margins, I guess it could matter. Our portfolio doesn’t tend to have a lot of student participation.
Ric Campo: Just anecdotally, one of our board members is the Chancellor and the President of University of Houston, her name is Renu Khator. And Renu on our board meeting on Wednesday told us that their enrollment is actually up at University of Houston and that the only part of the equation that they’re having trouble with is international students because of travel issues. But she was surprised that their number is actually up and they’re going to do a combination of in-person and virtual. But I think that people are continuing to enroll in colleges at pretty record numbers.
Zach Silverberg: Got you, that’s helpful and just a final one here. I understand that a few transactions on the market closed lately. Most were likely done or negotiated pre-COVID. But curios if you’re seeing anything in the shadow market and what buyers maybe underwriting right now and what IRR’s they’re sort of targeting?
Alex Jessett: So there have been some transactions done. Some were definitely under contracts and hard, earnest money that closed pre-COVID timeframes. But there have been a few transactions that have happened in this environment and as I said before the cap rates have compressed and we’re hearing numbers like cap rates are in the threes in Dallas and Houston and I think that people are sort of most investors are kind of wait and see attitude in terms of what they think underwriting is going to be like. When you think about the tenured treasury being where it is today and sort of interest rates lower for longer even more now than before the pandemic. I would think that underwriting IRRs have to come down some and I think that’s probably going to happen.
Zach Silverberg: Got you, appreciate all the color guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Kalmus from Zelman and Associates. Go ahead.
Alex Kalmus: Looking into Southeast Florida performance, outside of expected pressure in LA continue to lag the rest of your portfolio on some key metrics. I’m just curios if you could give some more color on, what’s called the challenging recent environment there?
Keith Oden: Yes, so there’s two challenges in Southeast Florida right now. And one is, just traffic in general. There’s less of a propensity for people to want to engage in a virtual scenario in Southeast Florida. So we just have - we have a little bit less traffic there than what we would normally expect this time of year. The second part is on the operation side just collections. So Southeast Florida for the second quarter of 2020, our collections were 94% and that would make it the second most challenged market behind, LA, Orange County. So those dual challenges are definitely something that we’re dealing with in Southeast Florida.
Alex Kalmus: Got it, thank you and curious about the non-trade [ph] enabled properties. How is the leasing dynamic there? And how are you guys approaching those? Are those typical in-person showings or are you still using virtual to your advantage? Thank you.
Alex Jessett: Yes, we’re still using virtual. But it’s really if you think about it, it’s a little bit old school and it involves a lockbox with a key where you can pick up the key and you can pick up the fob and then you have a map. It certainly is an effective way of doing it, but clearly no way near as effective as using an application that has a definitive start and definitive end that can also open not just the access gates but the door units. And I think that’s the big benefit we’re getting from Chirp from the communities that have Chirp rolled out.
Alex Kalmus: Sounds good, thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Thank you. We appreciate you participate in the conference today and we will look forward to speaking to you in the future. So thanks a lot and take care. Have a great rest of the summer.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-08 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Camden Property's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2020 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will attempt to complete our call within one hour, so we ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim and good morning. Our on-hold music today was unsurprisingly pandemic themed and included a couple of selections for Michael Bilerman's personal COVID-19 playlist. Four of the five songs were probably familiar to many of you and the fifth song was a unique cover of a Led Zeppelin classic. Even that song has a COVID-19 connection. A resident at Camden's high-rise community in St. Petersburg, Florida wanted to do something special for his wife's birthday and despite the at-home stay order. He asked if he could use the roof of the community's parking garage to sage a concert for his wife. Of course, we agreed. Not only did he surprise and delight her, but all of the other residents whose homes overlooked the garage rooftops. They got to enjoy an incredible performance by Sean Hopper and Chris Barbosa from their perfectly socially distant balconies. This is just one example of the many ways that we and our residents are working together to help ensure we make the best of this complicated journey we're on. I want to give a big shout out to team Camden for their resilient, their commitment to improving the lives of teammates, customers and shareholders, one experience at a time. Our on-site property teams have really stepped up to help our residents during this unprecedented time, to make their homes a true place of refuge. Our corporate and regional support teams have continued to be highly productive, adapting to telecommunity without missing a beat. During times like this, it brings the importance of our homes to the forefront. I'm proud of Team Camden. Thank you. We'll use most of the call today answering questions about what we're seeing in our business in real time. We won't spend much time talking about the distant first quarter and will not provide guidance for the rest of 2020 in this uncertain environment. We are more prepared for this recession than any other, thanks to the lessons learned in the financial crisis. We know that we will come out of this recession in a great position with financial strength and a focused motivated team. Keith?
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Someday, someone will write a novel titled "A Tale of two Quarters" and it will begin like this. It was the best of quarters, it was the worst of quarters. Camden just arguably had the best quarter in our 28-year history. We had the highest FFO per share of $1.35. We had the biggest quarterly outperformance relative to our established guidance. We had a sector-leading same-store NOI growth rate of 5.7%. And yet, in the last two weeks of the quarter, everything changed. Fortunately, our leadership team has been together for decades and we've dealt with our share of disasters and disruptions. Our experience with previous dislocations provided us with a road map for navigating this pandemic. First, take care of the Camden team. Make sure that they were operating in the safest possible environment. Also, make sure that we address their financial well-being. Employees that are under personal financial distress will never be able to do their best work. To accomplish this, we did two things. First, we added $1 million to our long-standing employee emergency relief fund. $750,000 of that came from Camden and $250,000 came from Camden's executives. We provided grants of up to $3,000 that were made available to our employees whose family's income had been impaired or whose living expenses had increased due to the COVID-19 impact. To date, we have provided 350 employees with total grants exceeding $1 million. Second, last week we announced a bonus exclusively for our frontline employees, both on-site operations and on-site construction teams of $2,000 for each full-time employee, totaling approximately $3 million. The best way for us to ensure that our residents are afforded living excellence is to ensure that our Camden team remains physically, mentally and financially healthy. Our next priority was to assist our residents who had lost jobs or substantial income from the COVID-19 impact. In April, we announced a $5 million resident relief fund for Camden's residents who were experiencing financial losses caused by the COVID pandemic. The resident relief fund was intended to help impacted residents by providing financial assistance for living expenses such as food, utilities, medical expenses, insurance, child care or transportation. The objective was to provide residents with a bridge to get to other forms of assistance such as unemployment insurance, stimulus checks, or PPP loans, many of which had been delayed beyond their expectations. We subsequently approved and delivered relief funding to nearly 2,400 Camden residents totaling over $4.5 million. We didn't give out the entire $5 million. Some people ask for less than the maximum amount of the grant and some of the applications in the initial group were not qualified. So, in order to fulfill our commitment to distribute the entire $5 million of funding, we allowed additional residents to submit applications on April 20. All residents who submitted a qualified application demonstrating loss of income due to COVID-19 were eligible to split the remaining $460,000. Between the date we announced the resident relief fund and the date we reopened the fund which was only nine days, an additional 12 million Americans filed unemployment claims. We knew the need for relief had increased, but we really had no idea how much. In the second round of resident relief, we reviewed and approved over 5,800 additional applications, which would have amounted to $79 per person if we had stuck to the original plan to split it among of the remaining $460,000. As a result, we decided to increase our initial commitment of $5 million to $10.4 million, allowing all the approved applicants to receive grants for $1000 each. This brought the total number of Camden residents receiving resident relief fund assistance to approximately 8,200. We're very proud of the way that we have been able to support our residents as well as our Camden team members during these complicated times. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's CFO.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Eight weeks ago, our corporate and regional teams began to work remotely. In two months so much has changed, but our teams continue to adapt and respond to each new situation. The technology investments we have made in the recent past are paying dividends. We just completed our first ever virtual quarterly close, a task that would have been so much harder without our investment in a cloud-based financial system. Our on-site teams are having great success with virtual leasing and we are preparing for our first ever virtual annual meeting of shareholders. Understandably taking a backseat to the discussion of current operational trends, Camden had a great first quarter, helping to position us well for the COVID-19-related environment we now face. Details about our first quarter performance are included in the earnings release and supplement published last night and available on our website. So right now, I will focus primarily on operating trends we've seen in the second quarter. But first, rental rate trends for the first quarter were as expected until mid-March when our leasing offices were closed to the public and we began offering existing residents 0% increases on renewals. For the first quarter of 2020, new leases were up 0.5% and renewals were up 4.2% for a blended growth rate of 2.5%. Our April results indicate a 2.5% decline for new leases and a 0.1% growth for renewals for a blended decrease of 0.8%, which is approximately 500 basis points below the blended growth of 4.1% achieved in April 2019 when we were clearly operating under more normal circumstances in a pre-COVID environment. As a reminder, our new lease and renewal growth data is based on when leases are signed versus many of our peers that report based upon when a lease becomes effective. We believe our methodology represents a more real-time view of what is happening on the ground. However, if we use the same methodology as our peers and look at leases that became effective in April, our new leases would have declined 1.2% and our renewals would have increased 4.5% for a blended increase of 2%. Occupancy averaged 96.1% during the first quarter and 95.6% in April compared to 96% in April 2019. Our current occupancy rate is 95%. Although current situations are certainly affecting people's living decisions, we continue to have great success in conducting alternative method property tours for prospective residents and retaining many of our existing residents. In April 2020, we signed 3,807 leases in our same property portfolio comprised of 1,322 new leases and 2,485 renewals as compared to 2019 when we signed 3,756 leases comprised of 2,025 new leases and 1,731 renewals. For April 2020, we collected 94.3% of our scheduled rents with 2.5% of our residents entering into a deferred rent arrangement and 3.2% becoming delinquent. In a typical month, delinquency would be approximately 2%. So our April collections were 96% of typical. Markets experiencing higher than normal delinquency rate includes Southern California at 9% and Southeast Florida at 4%. Markets with delinquencies at or below 2% include each of our Texas markets, Austin, Dallas, and yes, Houston, along with Phoenix, Tampa and Orlando. So far, rent collections in May are trending slightly ahead of April. Regardless of our current collections rent is still contractually due to Camden from each of our residents. According to GAAP, certain uncollected rent is recognized by us as income in the current month. Any rent recognized as income in the current month without corresponding cash receipt will be re-evaluated in subsequent months depending upon future payment history. The resident relief funds, that Keith mentioned, also as according to GAAP, will be recognized as a separate offset to property revenues in the quarter. The $750,000 contribution to the employee relief fund will be expensed to Camden's corporate level G&A, and the approximate $3 million bonus to our frontline employees will be predominantly booked to property level expenses. In addition Ric Campo and Keith Oden have each agreed to voluntarily reduce the amount of his annual bonuses, which maybe awarded in the future by $500,000. The aggregate $1 million reduction in compensation will serve as a contribution to the just mentioned payments. And now, a brief update on our real estate activities. During the first quarter of 2020, we stabilized Camden Grandview Phase two, a $22.5 million 28 Hometown home development in Charlotte and we began leasing at Camden Downtown, a 271 home new development in Houston. Also, during the quarter, we acquired five acres of land in Raleigh for the future development of approximately 355 apartment homes and we sold approximately five acres of land adjacent to one of our operating properties also in Raleigh to facilitate a public right of way. This disposition created an unbudgeted gain on sale of land of approximately $400,000, recognized as FFO in the first quarter. We decided to temporarily suspend construction activity on our recently announced Camden Atlantic development in Plantation Florida, as only very minor site work had been completed to date. And due to the impacts of various local ordinances combined with current market conditions, we have delayed the expected dates for initial occupancy, construction completion and project stabilization by one to two quarters at almost all of our new developments. We will continue to update these dates as we gain more clarity. Turning to liquidity. Subsequent to quarter end, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 2.8% and an all-in yield of 2.9%. We received net proceeds of approximately $743 million net of underwriting discounts and other estimated offering expenses. As of today, we have approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity comprised of almost $600 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding under our $900 million unsecured credit facility and we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022. At quarter end, we had $235 million left to spend over the next 2.5 years under our existing development pipeline. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 4.2 times, a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 6.4 times and 100% of our assets unencumbered. Our 2022 debt maturities include $100 million in January and $350 million in December. And we have not yet made any decisions about prepaying those or any other future debt maturities. Our current excess cash is invested with various banks earning approximately 30 basis points. Turning to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2020 of $136.3 million or $1.35 per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04. This $0.04 per share outperformance for the first quarter primarily resulted from approximately $0.005 in higher same-store net operating income resulting from higher rental income and general expense control measures, approximately $0.0075 in better-than-anticipated results from our non-same-store and development communities including our recent acquisitions, approximately $0.01 in lower interest expense as our original guidance anticipated a $300 million 30-year issuance mid-February at 3.4%, approximately $0.005 from the previously discussed gain on sale of land in Raleigh and approximately $0.0075 in a combination of lower overhead costs and higher fee income. Given the uncertainty surrounding the social and economic impact from COVID-19, we withdrew our previous 2020 earnings guidance and we will not provide an update to our financial outlook this quarter. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi everybody and thank you. Some of your peers have focused on maintaining occupancy over price, some have paused pricing and lost occupancy, while others have temporarily put in place concessions to kind of bridge the gap. So, I guess the question is, how are you balancing these scenarios at this point? And to what level could occupant decline to where you're still comfortable if you want to maintain price?
Ric Campo: Yes. So our long-term average occupancy is in the 95%, 95.5% range. We've been running above that for about the last 1.5 years. And at the same time, part of what was driving that was we had really great traffic and we had the ability to push rents without having any impact on occupancy. So if you think about where we came from at the end of the first quarter, we were at 96%. That was about in line with our plan for the quarter. We dropped to 95.6% by the end of April. And as we sit here today, we're about 95%. So yes we have seen a decline in our occupancy. It's not anything that we're overly concerned about at this point. We would like to maintain our occupancy somewhere around the 95% range and we'll adjust our metrics to make sure that that happens. With regard to your question about concessions, we don't -- we use net effective pricing. We have not offered concessions. So, it's all based on our revenue management model. And we think our customers are smart enough to make that determination on their own about upfront concessions versus net effective rents. The other thing is that in this environment, we just think it's you're unnecessarily taking unnecessary risk and complication when you start concession in an environment where you've got tenants -- there are residents that are under potential financial distress going forward, so that's something that is not something that we have done and not likely to do. So, yes, I think we'll make sure that we -- based on the traffic that we're seeing and the pricing trends that we're seeing, we'll do -- we need to do to try to maintain our occupancy somewhere around the 95% level.
Derek Johnston: Okay. And just a quick follow-up is, how has leasing demand evolved from let's say April into May? And how do you see it unfolding through the important spring and summer season?
Ric Campo: Yeah. So, if you think about it in three time frames, the first would be something that's relatively normal in our world and that would be from the beginning of January through March 15, when kind of the world changed and that – in that time frame, over the prior year our traffic, our guest cards visits new leases we're all almost exactly in line with where we would have been in 2019. So, it was clearly business as usual good steady heavy traffic and converting roughly 8% or 9%, of all of the guest cards and about 20% of all the traffic. So the next period of time is kind of the March 16 through April 12 that four-week period where it was the maximum kind of the shock effect of people being told to stay at home. Obviously, we had a huge impact on our guest cards in that time frame dropped about 45% of normal. Our visits – our physical visits dropped about 84% of normal. So, huge change in consumer behavior and our new leases during that time frame were roughly 50% of what they would have normally been. The next time frame that, I think is relevant for you to think about would be sort of from the April 13 timeframe through this week. And we're getting closer back to something that looks and feels a little bit more normal on guest cards. We're down about a 13% over where we were this time last year for that time – for that three-week timeframe. Well, we're still way down on visits and that's not necessarily concerning to us. We're still 62% on physical visits from where we have been but that's because we've completely changed our business practice to virtual leasing and that's – there's some actual – some interesting benefits to the – that our residents have pointed out about being able to lease an apartment that way. So that one is not particularly concerning, new leases are definitely down over the prior period. We're down about 21% on new leases from where we were for that three-week period in 2019. The offset to that has been our renewal rate has increased pretty substantially. We had the lowest turnover rate that we've ever had in our company's history at about 37%. I didn't think I would ever live long enough to see an apartment portfolio with a 37% turnover rate, but that's kind of where we are. So I hope that gives – I mean, so big shock for the first four weeks and then a recovery through this week that's getting within hailing distance of looking like normal.
Derek Johnston: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Hey. I wanted to sort of get your perspective on how you think about the $10 million of relief that you provided to your residents. It's 1.5% of annual NOI, 6% on a quarterly basis and 18% of sort of monthly. I guess, is this going to be a recurring? Should tenants not be able or need more assistance in the future? Do you sort of view this as a concessionary tactic of being able to provide additional funds for them to be able to ultimately – I mean cash, is fungible, right? They can pay the rent or they can pay their normal expenses. So, how should investors be thinking about future programs like that?
Ric Campo: Yeah. So the way – I think the easiest way to think of it is in a couple of different pieces. One piece was the immediate financial impact to 8,000 of our residents. And while there was a lot of talk about stimulus checks and there's a lot of talk about PPP money and then possibly even stimulus checks that were going to be sent out. The reality is that in state unemployment that people were trying to get through the queue and the reality is that, the impact of this was so sudden and so many of our residents were caught off guard and didn't have the financial resources. It wasn't really about paying rent. It was about paying groceries and medical bills and transportation expenses, child care and those kinds of things that were completely unexpected to a lot of people. So we just felt like that because we were getting anecdotal evidence and feedback from our frontline teams about the financial difficulty and the urgency of the situation that, we felt like we could do something quicker for most people that honestly was intended to be a bridge to get to something that's more durable, whether it's state unemployment, whether it's the stimulus check or ultimately one of the PPP grants. So part of it was an immediacy part of it for financial need, part of it was the ability to assist our residents at a time of their maximum financial stress. Now we – so if you think about our resident base, we have roughly 80,000 adult lease folks their signatories on a lease. And about one in 10 ended up getting the resident relief funding from us and so it was to address an immediate need to get people to a bridge to a more permanent and durable situation. And then the issue of what they do with their money it is – cash is fungible and we made no requirement whatsoever that you apply it to rent. Some people may, but that's the choice that they're going to make. But it's really more about the long-term brand issue for what Camden stands for. And I think as this unfolds we're going to get – we'll see a positive effect of the actions that we took on behalf of our residents and our employees, and we're willing to play the long game. The – all of the financial impact as you walk through those numbers are correct. It will all be – it will happen in the second quarter. And then we'll be back to a more normal run rate. And to the third question, which is do you anticipate doing this in the future? We have no current plans to do any other resident relief plans. It's possible that, if our employees continue to have financial needs and we – at some point we may want to look at replacing our emergency relief fund. But that's a program that's been in place for over a decade. So immediacy, assistance, brand long-term about how we conducted ourselves at a time of maximum financial stress for our residents were all the things that we had in our mind.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Let me just add to that a little color too. Because to me, there's been a lot of discussion these days about how companies ought to be more socially responsible how they -- it's not about the bottom-line only, it's about taking care of customers, it's about taking care of communities, taking care of employees. And so, we just thought that the benefit of immediacy, very quickly getting the folks the money when it was hard to get money from the government, it created a -- put a zip in the step of our employees. And even residents that didn't apply for the grant actually communicated with us and sent us, just thousands of congratulatory e-mails, saying, no. I don't need the money. But I understand now why, I really live at Camden. And as long as I'm a renter, I'll be with you. So, to me, this is our way to sort of say to the industry. And the corporate world in general, these are the right things you should do. I will tell you that multiple companies followed our lead. And I spoke with probably 10 different companies on, how we did it and why we did it, around the country and that was a good thing. So to me, it really is about the long game. And it's about being a good corporate citizen to your community and your customer.
Michael Bilerman: How did you weigh providing capital? And checks to people versus simply, entering into deferral agreements for a period of time, for their rent until the government assistance, comes into play?
Ric Campo: Well, we did that as well. Over 2% of our people have payment plans now or 2.5% something like that. And so, so we did both. But ultimately, when you think about -- when we started thinking about, what could we do that was a major statement that was going big, if you want to call it that that would be an amazing thing for not only our employees, but residents and residents that didn't need the money, right? And so that's why, we sort of did what we did, as opposed to saying "Hey, we'll defer your rent." And the idea was look, bridge people from point A to point B, because one of the things I think is really fascinating is, when the government obviously stepped up in a major way with increasing unemployment insurance benefits by $600 extending them beyond what the states had as well. So a person -- if we had a two income household and each person made $40,000 each our average household is about $105,000 or $110,000 something like that. But the maths that I’ve seen is based on a $40,000 person. Their take-home pay was roughly $6,500 a month and the rent says $1,500. And once they apply for unemployment insurance, if they both lost their jobs then you have a situation, where they actually get an increase in their income of roughly $1500. And so, the amazing -- so from our perspective we thought, it's going to be hard for people. Because there are so many people applying all at the same time people to get this money. But ultimately when you bridge that gap, they will have funds available that -- if they lost their jobs. And then, the other part on your question is the, whole gig economy. We have tons of gig economy, people that work for us or that -- not work for us, but our residents. And they're having just a tough time, navigating legacy systems that states have with respect to unemployment. And it's really hard for those guys to get lined up. So that's kind of -- that was the longer thought process behind it rather than just saying okay we'll defer your rent.
Michael Bilerman: That's really helpful. And just last question, so out of those 8,000 residents who took the money, what percentage of those paid their full rent? What percentage of those paid no rent? And what percentages are on deferrals?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. The exact numbers I don't have right here. But the vast majority of the folks that receive money from us paid their full rent.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. Thank you.
Ric Campo: And I think in Alex's opening comments he gave indications that our May collections are actually running slightly ahead of April collections. And that's certainly to me a little bit unexpected given what's happened in the world in the last 30 days.
Michael Bilerman: Right, yeah. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Our next question today will come from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Good morning. Thank you. And thanks for all you're doing. For what it's worth, BofA's ESG strategists continue to point to the growing importance of ESG. So thanks again for your efforts. My question today is on, Houston. If you could just talk about, the Houston market it seems to be more resilient than we were expecting possibly even you and your team in terms of collections occupancy. It looks like it was up year-over-year 40 bps. And then, if you could also discuss your downtown project that you're leasing up please?
Ric Campo: Sure. So Houston is definitely a very interesting market. The -- when you look at what's happened in Houston there were 342,000 people filed for unemployment, through this current period. By the end of the month, it will probably be more like 400,000. And I know people sort of connect Houston with Energy and they should because Energy is a big part of the economy here. But it's also a broad economy 7.2 million people fourth largest city in America. And there are a lot of other things that go on besides Energy. And so Energy is definitely top of mind. Energy obviously has had a real rough road that they've been on. And probably will be a rough road going forward. The -- to give you a sense of the last cycle in Energy here in 2014 to 2016, Houston lost a net 5,000 jobs. And what Energy did is they lost 950,000 jobs. And then other -- the economy was doing well in the other parts of the Houston economy, that are more related to the U.S. economy were doing well. Petrochemical businesses were doing well because of low oil prices or their feedstock and that tends to give them higher margins. As long as the overall economy is doing well, then the sort of downstream part of Energy does well. In this situation we have the U.S. economy going down and at the same time that Energy is going down. The 95,000 jobs that were lost in Energy they've added back about 30000 of those jobs. So what was going on with Energy prior to the pandemic was that Energy was actually starved for capital during the 18 months prior to the pandemic. And they really didn't add all the 95,000 jobs they lost. And the interesting thing is they almost doubled their production in the Permian between 2014 -- or 2016 and 2019 as a result of just more efficiency and better technology and things like that. So, the good news is Energy doesn't have 95,000 jobs to lose because they only brought back 30,000 of those 95,000. So while Energy will -- places like Midland and the Permian are definitely getting hammered for blue-collar workers that are working on rigs and what have you. And they are starting -- some of the service providers are starting to lay people off. The Energy hit is probably going to be a lot less than it was in the 2015 to 2016 cycle because they just don't have -- it's many people left to take out if you will. So that's the one hand. If you look at -- generally the -- we listened to two big players here Patrick Jankowski, Bill Gilmer from U of H. Patrick's with the greater use of partnership and they've been economists that have been following Houston forever and so both of them think that Houston will have net job losses in 2020 between 75,000 and 100,000 jobs. And so even though you had 400 -- you have roughly 400,000 people on file, the question ultimately is how fast do those -- do the consumers get out of their bunkers and do they start getting back to sort of normal. Texas is phasing in and opening program with retailers open now with 25% sort of occupancy levels. By the middle of -- by the 18th they're talking about going to 50%. So there is an opening phase by the end of the month. They are in theory going to be open. We'll see how -- whether consumers actually come out of their bunkers or not. And that's the big question I think we have nationally. The other thing I think is really interesting and this could be a real benefit for Houston longer term is that even before the pandemic, Houston Energy executives were calling for energy transition plans, meaning that if you look out in the future, oil demand was supposed to peak in 2030 or something like that. And so all the major oil companies are focusing on how do they transition. I think this pandemic and the Saudi-Russia issue when oil went negative has created a massive wake-up call for these energy folks. And so people don't realize that Texas is number one in wind generation. And in the next two years it will probably become number one in solar. And so I think we have a real opportunity in Houston to actually lead the Energy transition with all the brain power and engineering power that we have with Energy. I think the Energy companies think of themselves as maybe the Kodak in the film business and they don't want to be -- go the same way that Kodak or Polaroid went. And I talked to a lot of senior Energy executives and I think that's kind of happening. And I think it's a major happening right now. So, that could be a positive for Houston over the long term. The Downtown project, we are in the early stages of lease up. It's definitely tough sledding right now. We've been absorbing about 10 units a month which is pretty slow. The -- but we are making leases. We made leases in the last couple of weeks. We're I think 16% leased at this point. We did have -- part of the building was structured as a Y hotel. And prior to the pandemic they have the highest number of pre bookings of any Y hotel that they've ever done. And of course we know what happened to that now in the pandemic. So, we're not sure exactly how that's going to play out over time. But it's a great piece of real estate. It will be great long term but in the near-term it's going to be definitely leasing that project up
Jeff Spector: Comments were very helpful. One follow-up on a previous question. To confirm are you saying that your applications are back to normal your recent applications let's say as of this past week or 2?
Ric Campo: No. They're not back to normal. In terms of guest cards which would be kind of the what you think of as the starting process for leading to a lease we're about 13% below where we were this time last year. And that's for the period between April 13th and May 6th. We're about 13% below what we would normally see or what we saw last year in terms of guest cards.
Jeff Spector: Okay. Thanks for clarifying. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning everybody. You guys have indicated that you're offering flat renewals, but I don't believe you've specified a time horizon where some of your peers had said 90 days or maybe through June 30th. So, curious how you're thinking about when you might start to take more of a market-based approach or let the revenue management system take over as it relates to renewals. What are your thoughts on kind of changing your stance there at this point?
Ric Campo: Well, I think what we all have to do in this environment is sort of play it by ear and see how the market is responding. So, we have put out guidance that we are going to hold things flat for 60 days. And the 60 days would have been sort of I guess expiring in mid-June perhaps but maybe to the end of June. But I think what we really have to do is kind of feel out the market try to understand how our customers are feeling and our employees are feeling. Because if you think about a renewal let's say if you're getting a 4% increase in a renewal we're talking about $45 or $50 a month to a resident. And when we're in a -- the reason, we froze them and the reason, we did all of the other things we already talked about doing is we wanted our employees focused on one thing and one thing only. And that was taking care of those people in real-time right now with their issues. I don't want to have those employees having to knock on the door and say, hey, by the way, I know, this is really a tough time, but can you give me $45 more, because we need it. And so for our view our view is that we stated the 60-day, but we will plan it -- we will make changes as the market dictates. Once we get back to a more normal situation, our customers know that we're like any other business and, a, they need to pay their rent; and, b, ultimately they -- we provide value to them through all of the packages that we have. And part of the issue you have today is they can't even use the pool or the barbecue grills or the gyms or things like that. And so I hate to ask somebody to pay higher rent, when they're not even getting the full complement of amenities and packages like that. So we will -- 60 days from now and then we will evaluate as we go forward. And ultimately, I think it will be better for our customers, better for our employees to evaluate it in that way.
Austin Wurschmidt : Got it. Got it. No, that's helpful. But just to understand it then. Is that renewal -- the flat renewal offer then end of June, is that for renewals then into kind of July August that those are getting offered?
Ric Campo: Yes. Our renewals we generally go 60 days out, but right now we're going 90 days out.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Thank you. And then just last one kind of following up on the Houston commentary. Helpful comparison from kind of 2016, 2017, when things turn negative certainly a delay from when oil rolled over from late 2014, but curious how the supply setup looks differently than last time. I think I recall supply ramping pretty significantly into 2016 and 2017. And today things are fairly shut down. So how would you compare and contrast that side of the equation?
Ric Campo: I would say, the supply -- well the Houston supply is actually peaking right now. We had -- when you think through the supply, it actually fell off in 2015, 2016, 2017. And then when Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017, we ended up with very high occupancy. And so Houston was the only market in America that where you could tell a story that had a recovering economy and a declining supply picture. So what productive developers did was, they ramped up development in Houston. And so today we have 21,000 units that were permitted in 2019. And the projections for 2020 were 14,000, 15,000. That will probably fall off some. But Houston will have more supply to deal with than it did during the 2017, 2018, 2019 kind of time frame. And so ultimately, though, however, when you look at some of the projections on supply everywhere, the peak supply was somewhere around 400,000 units. And most of the analysis that we see around the country are supply dropping to barely over 100,000 units net. And that generally is what you see in a economic situation like this is equity for new development and construction loans from new development are very, very, very difficult to get today. And if you didn't have it already lined up, you're probably not getting that done. And it'll be interesting to see how that all plays out, but Houston does have a supply issue, it has to work through in this environment. That's why I said, our Downtown project is going to be tough sledding for the next year and a half.
Austin Wurschmidt : No, I appreciate the thoughts. It’s helpful. Be well. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico : Hi, everyone. Ric, I just wanted to ask you about the balance sheet. I mean, clearly you're in a very good position low leverage a lot of cash. How should we think about your deployment of the balance sheet over the next year? And are you seeing any interesting acquisition opportunities opening up yet realizing, it maybe early also thinking along the lines of maybe partnering with private developers who need capital. I mean, how are you kind of envisioning the opportunity set here?
Ric Campo: Well clearly the -- our balance sheet is the strongest in the sector. We're sitting on over $0.5 billion of cash with an unfunded $900 million line of credit. And this is exactly where we want to be. Over the last two years in every single conference that Keith and I and Kim and Alex attend people pound the table going, why are you going under leveraged? Why are you sell under leveraged? Why are you issuing equity? Those kinds of issues. And what our answer was, was that we're in the longest economic recovery in American history. And something is going to come along, that's going to change that. I don't know what it is, but when that happens, I want to be positioned to have the best balance sheet in the sector, because there should be opportunities that come up over that. Now all of a sudden now we know what happened, right? And now could we have all predicted this? We didn't predict the why it happened, but we did predict that it could happen and would happen and it did. So that's the positioning we're in. Now about opportunity, opportunity will happen. There's no question, because if you look at the merchant builder model they have high prefs or prefs that eat at their profits and their capital every single month. And as you have -- when you have an environment like this, where the future is uncertain and you have capital issues that are much more leveraged than we are. So are there going to be amazing opportunities like during -- that presented themselves and in 2009 and 2010? Unfortunately, we weren't positioned to be able to deal with the amazing opportunities we saw then. I think there will be some, but it's very early to tell what they are going to look like. I think that most people are hunkered down. And if you didn't have a transaction that wasn't completed wasn't hard earnest money or financed and ready to go, you're probably not getting that deal done. So it will take a few months for the market to kind of settle. There's really not a lot of transactions going on. To the private developer question we have been fielding lots of calls from private developers who want – who thought they had their equity in their debt and now they don't. And they're either trying to sell us their plans and get out of the trap, whole with their chase money. We fundamentally will not partner with private developers or do mezzanine financing or anything like that. One of the other big things we wanted to do during the – after the financial crisis we wanted to have a very simple structure. Our cash is our cash and we're going to be 100% and when we invest we'll invest 100% of our assets in that. We do have a joint venture relationship with Texas teachers, which is very good. But fundamentally we won't be doing private developer equity transactions.
Nick Yulico: And in your experience, how long is it going to take before you can become more comfortable with underwriting rents for the future development pipeline?
Ric Campo: Well I think the – I don't know how long it is yet because we've only been in it for 1.5 months, right? But I think that there are some fundamental things that you can count on. You can count on people needing a place to live. You know what the forward supply picture looks like. And you can also sort of plan for some scenarios on how the market will open over time. And so I think that gives you once we get a little closer to how does it – how do places open and how do industries adapt, industries like leisure industries or the oil and gas business in Houston and those kinds of issues that will give you more clarity. And with capital structure we have now we'll be able to make earlier decisions and make more aggressive bets than others I think. So I think that it will become more clear probably in the next three to six months. And then you'll start seeing activity and people making decisions on what they're going to do going forward. And so I don't think it's going to be years but it's definitely going to be a few months.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question will come from Neil Malkin of Capital One. Please go ahaed.
Neil Malkin: Hey, thanks, guys. I guess just kind of maybe digging into the previous question. What is your view on development within your portfolio and your markets over the next 12 months? I mean like you said starts are expected to be close to nothing but you're in a position balance sheet-wise where it would behoove you to start now and really reap the benefits in 2022. Any thoughts there?
Keith Oden: Yes. We have – we've got a decent development pipeline. We think it's appropriately sized given kind of the opportunity set out there right now. As far as additional starts we had original guidance. We had a couple of starts for 2020. We'll wait and see on those. The one in Florida Atlantic, we had literally just were in the process of finalizing our pulling permits for construction. We really hadn't – doing some site work et cetera. So we just put that on hold out of an abundance of caution. But at some point, my guess is is that when we see a little bit more clarity on what the job and the reemployment situation is going to look like in some of these markets then, yes, we'll probably forge ahead with our planned developments whether it gets done this year or whether it leads over into the first quarter of next year. We still think fundamentally there's a lot of value to be derived. And – from doing what we do with our construction and development team. So a little – as Ric said it's too early to kind of even start speculating on that because we need to see a few more cards. It's still really early but we're clearly going to use our balance sheet strength to do two things. We have $235 million left to fund on our existing pipeline and it's a great development pipeline that's being delivered in a very geographically diverse way. So that's one thing that's a priority for us is to complete that and not have to have any stress at all about funding $235 million to complete that pipeline. And then secondly, we'll turn to opportunities for capital allocation whether we'll look at what does new development look like in the new arena and then compare and contrast that to potential acquisition opportunities that inevitably are going to come our way.
Neil Malkin: Makes sense. Other one for me is can you just juxtapose or compare and contrast your kind of core Sunbelt markets with your Southern California markets, just in terms of delinquencies, people who contacted you about payment plans. And then how things are performing on a submarket and price point spectrum?
Alex Jessett: Yes absolutely. And as I said in the prepared remarks if you look at California for us, for the month of April, California was 9% delinquent. If you sort of break that into two categories, LA, Orange County being one that was around 11% and then San Diego, Inland Empire was around 6%. If you compare that to obviously to our Sunbelt markets, our Sunbelt markets are considerably lower and in fact, if you look at our total delinquency, which we reported at 3.2%, if you were just to back out California alone that number would drop to 2.4%. So California is definitely putting a – is putting a drag on our numbers.
Keith Oden: So just one of the things that's interesting that we – data that we got from the resident relief fund is we really didn't see a disproportionate number of residents applying for the resident relief fund from California, which is kind of interesting if you think about it. It was -- it's about what you would expected it to be. And about -- it was pretty equivalent across our entire footprint of our portfolio. So plus or minus we have 80,000 adult lease signatories with over 8,000 people who applied and verified that they either lost their job or lost significant income. And we didn't really see a big -- there wasn't a disproportionate amount in California and yet we're 10% delinquent. So what -- so one conclusion from that is that, while our California portfolio is not under any disproportionate financial stress it's under disproportionate behavior stress. And those are very different things. And as long as policymakers continue to kind of accommodate that behavior, it's going to remain under stress. I just don't -- I don't see any way around it, but that's very different than saying can they pay -- do they have the ability to pay? If they were financially impaired they would have applied for the resident relief fund. And so we know that there's a chunk of residents in California who are behaviorally acting not appropriately.
Neil Malkin: Huge -- amount of hazard out there. Thanks guys with the question.
Operator: Our next question today is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning, everyone. And I would echo, I mean, I think you guys have been great for your residents employees. I mean remember back with Harvey, you guys helped your employees rebuild. So I think it's good that you guys help out. And interesting the moral hazard comment Keith on the -- on Southern Cal. Not to leave Jessett -- Alex Jessett out of the conversation, but a double question for him. One it just -- in full disclosure of the accounting treatment for the $10 million -- or I guess $11 million, but $10 million when you net out the senior comp -- how that will hit the P&L? And then a separate but included in the question for you, have you seen the rating agencies change their tune this time? It seems like we've seen very few REIT downgrades. Clearly, apartments are better than retail, but still everyone's been affected. Are you -- is your sense from the rating agencies like you guys just did your issuance last week that the agencies are giving the companies more time to settle out what the run rate NOI impact will be before taking action? Or what's your sense?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So the first question when you look at the resident relief funds the way we will account for it is as an offset to revenue. Now we're not going to run it through same-store, but it will be in revenue. And if you think about our Components of NOI page in our supplement, it will be its own separate category. So we'll take the entire amount in the second quarter as an offset to revenue. When you think about the rating agencies yes, obviously, I've spoken to all the rating agencies over the past couple of weeks as we got ready for a bond issuance and as we completed a bond issuance. The first thing, I would tell you is that REITs by and large are so much stronger today than they were leading up to the last downturn. And I think that is giving the rating agencies some comfort. I think the other thing that you have to look at is one of the big issues that rating agencies look at is access to capital. And when Camden is able to go out and start with what was originally issued -- or originally, sort of, whispered as a $300 million bond transaction. And really quickly grew to over $8 billion of demand which led us to upsize it to $750 million, I think, events like that give the rating agencies a great deal of comfort about the access to capital that most of us have. And I think that's why you're going to see them obviously, be much slower in making rating decisions than they were in the past. And then I'll add to that, that if you think about what did happen during the last downturn there were a couple of rating agencies in particular that were very reactionary and sort of, moving people down two steps in one action. And I think they really quickly realized that that was an overreaction. And I think they've, sort of, learned on that side as well so.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second is I don't think you addressed the hospitality market in a question, but you did say that Orlando, Tampa and I think Phoenix, were all some of your best rent collection markets. So can you just comment on what's going on there? Maybe your residents aren't as into hospitality as other people in those markets, but what the impact is?
Keith Oden: Yes. I wouldn't have included Orlando in the less than impacted. We are seeing outsized impact in Orlando. Tampa not at all is performing better than most and so is Phoenix. So of those three markets that you mentioned, I think that the weakest of those three would be Orlando and it would probably be in our bottom three or four.
Alexander Goldfarb: What is that Keith? Orlando 10% collection -- 8%?
Alex Jessett: No. So Orlando -- so what Keith was talking to is pricing power in Orlando. If you actually look at delinquent in Orlando, Orlando is only 2% delinquent. Maybe it's a matter of time and we'll see how May results end up, but it is holding on remarkably well in April.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today is from Rob Stevenson with Janney.
Rob Stevenson: Thank you. Good morning. You guys have given April occupancy rent numbers, but how should we be thinking about operating expenses? I mean, you're saving on turnover cost. There's probably some other expense lines that you're also saving on. But then you probably have higher insurance and maybe utility costs with everyone staying at home. And then there's some extra COVID expenses. How does this all offset? Are operating expenses higher or lower today? How should we be thinking about that?
Alex Jessett: Yes. Ultimately, you've got a couple of things that are going on there. So first of all, the $3 million bonus that we discussed that is going to be booked to operating expenses.
Rob Stevenson: I mean, I'm just talking about the normalized excluding the stuff that's not recurring?
Alex Jessett: So once you pull out the $3 million and you look at the salary side, we should expect to have some general salary savings associated with open positions that are going to stay open a little bit longer. The other thing that everybody is seeing really across the board is that benefit costs are coming down. Ultimately in this, sort of, COVID-19 environment, people are just not going to the doctor unless they absolutely have to. And in fact I will tell you that most of the hospitals and doctors that we know personally are really seeing a downturn in the amount of cases they're seeing today. So I think you're going to see savings on the salary side ex the bonus. When we come to utilities, obviously, the trash is going to be a little bit higher but keep in mind that we rebuild almost all the utilities back to our residents. And then where you really are going to have savings is on R&M. So as we retain more of our residents, obviously, our turn costs go down and that's a reasonable number for us. Property taxes for us right now, we started the year thinking we're going to be at 3%. We don't have any reason to believe that's any different. We just went through our insurance renewal. We thought our insurance for the full year was going to be up somewhere around 20%. That's exactly where we ended up. So I think by and large once you strip out the non-recurring events you should have some minor savings on expenses.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And COVID doesn't overwhelm that?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. And then the last thing to add and I know you wanted to strip out expenses that were sort of nonrecurring. But we do have property level COVID-19 expenses. When we look at our number for April, that's right around $300,000. And that's associated with additional cleaning masks the fact that we're having special services come out to enter into units to do the repair work. So you absolutely are going to have some COVID-19 related costs.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And the second one for me is when you look back at the global financial crisis, which I guess is probably the best example that we have at this point. What was the final collectability rate at the end on those tenants that deferred rent got put on payment plans, made promises to pay the noncash payers at that point in time? What did you wind up collecting at the end?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. So if you go back to that point in time we really didn't have deferred programs. I think probably the better way to look at it is to look at what did bad debt do. And so bad debt started off right around 50 basis points. And it actually increased to about 100 basis points during the crisis.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Alex Jessett: Absolutely.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Rich Anderson of SMBC. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Ric Campo: Morning.
Rich Anderson: Appreciate as always on-hold music, WCPT. So question -- first question is you get good results relative to perhaps some expectations in terms of rent collection in April. Looking even a little bit better in May, at what point do you say, boy this is pretty resilient, we might actually be able to provide some guidance in the second quarter. How many successive of months of proof that you've got a good flow of rent coverage by your residents that will get you to a comfort even if we're not past this and we're still in quasi lock down around the country?
Keith Oden: I need to see a couple of weeks where we don't have another $3 million -- three million unemployment claims filed.
Rich Anderson: Yeah, okay.
Keith Oden: I mean, I guess, its better that it's not six million, but three million is just a staggering number. So until we kind of get to maybe an inflection point or somewhere where you kind of say everybody that's going to be unemployed by this by and large already is. Then I think you can start making some more rational estimates of what does the next 60 or 90 days look like. But to me it feels like there's still -- it's kind of still moving away. I guess, there are some of the good -- I guess there's good news in a sense that as it turns out all these the state unemployment claims turn out to be lagging numbers, because people have been in the queue for -- they've been unemployed for longer than they've been able to get their claim filed. So it's entirely possible that what we're seeing now is kind of in the rearview mirror, but I don't think we'll know the answer to that for another month or two. But I can -- I think I can speak for everybody here by saying Rich as soon as we get to a point where we think we can give you some meaningful guidance we'll do it.
Rich Anderson: And then the other thing is all of you, you and your peers were ahead of a curve in terms of tech investments and that's obviously helping you now through the leasing process. Curious though if you were somewhat concerned going into it maybe not ready for prime time yet as they were not fully rolled out. If that was something that has proven itself out so far there have been any hiccups in the process. And a corollary to that question is, do you see any scenario where you can have more robust leasing activity in this environment when you consider elevated close rates and people just processing and coming to grips with this new normal in terms of the leasing process in today's environment. Could we actually get to a point where it's almost just like it but for different reasons?
Keith Oden: Yeah. Rich we had several different pilots underway for doing some version of virtual leasing and self-guided tours. So we were -- we had put in a lot of time and effort on it. But we had not yet convinced ourselves that our customers would accept in large numbers that not having the one-on-one interaction, personal touch, Camden cares approach to the leasing experience. I think we've put that one to rest in the sense that the feedback from our customers regarding the virtual leasing experience. So number one we ramped up -- we went from our toes are in the water and maybe up to our ankles to we just dove off. And I mean we're just in it head deep, and so we were able to quickly do that because of our history of rolling things out and technology initiatives and getting buy-in very quickly. So, that all -- getting that process in place and just taking the plunge and saying you don't have an option now and we're not going to talk about it anymore. We're going to do it. So that was good in the sense that our folks quickly adapted. The flip side of it is, is that the feedback from the residents has been incredibly positive. I mean to the point where there are a lot of people who've indicated, I like this better than whatever process we had in place previously that involved a personal visit and a tour and the rest. So I think that there are permanent changes that are coming out of this. That's just one of them. There's going to be a bunch of others, but that's probably the most immediate in terms of business practices that when we come out of this even if somebody waived a wand and we were back to January type conditions, we're not going back to that from the standpoint of how we operate on-site. There's too many too many clear advantages and also consumer behavior is probably ahead of where we were.
Ric Campo: Yeah. Let me add too on -- just on the work side of the equation. Our corporate office and our regional offices we have been out of the office for a long time now. And I think Alex had his fastest close in terms of closing our quarter all done virtually all done in the cloud and we took -- we spent a fair amount of money and it took us two years to implement a cloud-based technology. And we complained about it forever until we had to actually use it. And now people are going wow that's amazing. So I think there's going to be dramatic changes in how people think about the workplace, how they think about how do you start your workplace back? Do you start at 25% people 50% people? And I think we have a fair number of people that really like Zoom and like telecommuting the way they did. I drove in and it usually takes me from -- I'm sheltering, I'm in between houses here in Houston. So I have a place out in Columbus, Texas, which is about an hour in a normal commute day it's an hour and a half-ish or an hour and 45 minutes. And it took me less almost about an hour to get in today. So a lot of -- I think there are going to be a lot of fundamental changes in how we all do business not just on-site but in our corporate offices as well. And companies that haven't invested in the technology and don't have that ability to immediately plug-and-play at their homes are going to be really disadvantaged. And I think it's going to make us think more about the homes and what -- our people need to have high speed Internet. They need to have -- it needs to be secure and all those things. And I'm sort of excited about that a bit because it could deal with a lot of really -- you could end up with a lot of really cool and more flexible workplaces than we've had in the past.
Keith Oden: I'm enjoying a four second commute myself so. Yes. All right. Thanks guys and gal.
Rich Anderson: Thank you, Ric.
Ric Campo: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question today will come from Zach Silverberg of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Zach Silverberg: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious on some comments you made about turnover. How low do you think they can actually end up? And are you seeing any extra benefits on the revenues and expenses side?
Keith Oden: Well, I never thought we would get to 37%. So I'm probably not a good one to ask but can it go lower? Yes, I think so because the -- for a couple of reasons that people who are enjoying the living experience that they -- and it's not everybody understands it's not optimal to be sheltering in place. But the companies who have taken extraordinary care not just turning -- keeping the place open keeping the lights on. The companies who have taken extraordinary care which are by and large our public competitors and probably a dozen or so really, really well-run private companies are going to differentiate themselves as a place to live for the next five years out of this kind of mess that we're in. And so, I think it's actually been a time where, if you love the place that you live in and you're being cared for and you're being in extraordinary ways being taken care of. You got to question why would you leave that? Because the pain associated with not being cared for correctly and properly in this kind of environment is probably not a risk that a lot of people are going to want to take. So, that's not going away anytime soon. So could the 37% become 33%? I suppose it could but we'll see.
Ric Campo: On revenue expenses generally, lower turnover lowers expenses. You don't have to relet. You don't have to have commissions on it. You don't have to redo carpet stuff like that. And on revenue, I'd always rather have a renewal at a maybe a lower rate than a new lease because you're saving all the other costs, so low turnover is a real good thing long-term for this business and for Camden.
Zach Silverberg: Great. Appreciate the color. And just on your press release, you outlined last April or a more typical month about 1.5% delinquency. What percentage of this 1.5% do you end up ultimately collecting? And what is sort of the time frame behind that?
Alex Jessett: Yes absolutely. So, it usually takes us sort of a month or so and we'll work that 1.5% down to what is typical which is about 50 basis points.
Zach Silverberg: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alex Kalmus: Hi. This is Alex Kalmus on for Hardik. Thank you for taking my question. On the expense front, property taxes were obviously a tailwind this quarter. Can you walk us through the market level buildup for this decline and what you expect on going ahead? Is this all from Texas?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So if you think about what we had for property taxes, it was predominantly driven by some select refunds that came -- that we got in. And those were all refunds that we knew were going to come our way. You've got -- you had Dallas was represented as was Atlanta. And so, that was all very typical. If you think about property taxes in general, I started the year believing that property taxes were going to be up right around 3%. And I still think that is going to be the case. If you think about the markets for us that are sort of a little bit of an outlier on the property tax side. You've got Houston currently which is sort of up 7%. And you've got Orlando which is up about 9%. But you've got that offset by some of our markets that are actually having negative growth when you think about refunds. So, where we are today, we think 3% is probably a pretty good number. What I will tell you is what typically happens. When you go through cycles like this the great thing about property taxes is it's the one large expense item that actually can turn negative. And in fact, it did turn negative during the last downturn. And I assure you that all of us that have very good tax consultants and I know that Camden has some of the best tax consultants out there. And I know that because our peers often call us and ask us who we use. Our tax consultants are out there and they're ready to fight. And so, maybe we don't get the benefit in 2020, but I'd expect to see benefits in 2021.
Alex Kalmus: Thank you for the color. And just a quick follow-up. With regards to the renewals that you're offering are a lot of these -- are some of these under 12 months? Or are we thinking mostly 12-month lease renewals?
Keith Oden: The vast majority of them are taking 12-month renewals. We offer the terms depending on anywhere from nine months to 15 months, but it's predominantly 12 months. If your question is short-term renewals, no, we're not seeing that. People are -- I think people are wanting certainty of their living conditions for the next year.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer session. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Great. Well thanks. We appreciate taking the time to visit with us today and we will talk to you soon. Take care.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Also this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2019 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will attempt to complete our call within one hour, so we ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes.  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Richard Campo: Good morning and welcome to the beginning of the new decade. Our on hold music today featured five seemingly random songs. But there's always a method to our madness. There's also a contest but with a twist. We know that our success is driven by our Camden colleagues, so the contest is for them. The five songs were selected by our executives on the call today, Kim Callahan, Alex Jessett, Malcolm Stewart, Keith Oden and me. Each was asked to select their favorite song of last decade that just ended. Five songs were Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen; Humble And Kind by Tim McGraw; Uptown Funk by Bruno Mars; The Fighter by Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood; Can't Stop The Feeling by Justin Timberlake. The first person to email Kim correctly matching the executive with the song they selected will get a shout out and a prize. Good luck.  In order to move forward into the next decade, I think it's always important to look back and take a stock of our accomplishments in the last decade. Here are a few highlights.  We improved the quality of our portfolio and created value for our stakeholders through 3 billion in sales of properties with an average age of 23 years, 2.3 billion of acquisitions with an average age of 4 years, 3 billion of development creating 1.1 billion of value for stakeholders, $500 million of redevelopment and repositioning of 40,000 of our apartment communities creating $525 million of the value. We improved our debt-to-EBITDA from over 8 times to just under 4 times with all assets unencumbered and all debt unsecured. We doubled our AFFO per share and nearly doubled our dividend. We built an amazing culture of employee excellence that was included on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list every single year in the decade with a number of top 10 finishers.  Team Camden ended the decade with a remarkable performance in 2019, exceeding all of our established goals. And we were positioned for a strong start to this new decade as we continue to improve the lives of our employees, our customers and our stakeholders, one experience at a time. The best is yet to come, don't believe it, just watch.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. Consistent with prior years, I'm going to use my time on today's call to review the market conditions that we expect to see in Camden's markets during 2020. I'll address the markets in the order of best to worse by assigning a letter grade to each one, as well as our view on whether we believe that market is likely to be improving, stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview I'll provide additional details on our fourth quarter operations and our 2020 same-property guidance.  We anticipate same-property revenue growth this year in the range of 2% to 4% in each of our markets with the exception of Phoenix, which remains our top market and should produce revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range. The weighted average growth rate is 3.2% at the midpoint of our guidance range, and all of our markets received a grade of C plus or higher this year.  As I mentioned, our top ranking for 2020 goes to Phoenix, our number one performer in 2019 with a 5.9% revenue growth and a 3-year average revenue growth of 4.9%. We get Phoenix an A rating and a stable outlook. Supply and demand metrics for 2020 look strong, with estimates calling for nearly 50,000 new jobs and only 6,000 new apartments coming online this year.  Up next are Raleigh and Atlanta both earning an A minus rating with stable outlook. In Raleigh, new developments have been coming online steadily with 5,000 new units delivered last year and another 6,000 expected this year. Job growth has also been strong and 20,000 new jobs are projected for 2020. Employment growth was also strong in Atlanta last year with approximately 70,000 new jobs added and projections call for 45,000 additional jobs in 2020. Completions remain steady with 9,000 new apartments delivered last year and 11,000 more scheduled for this year.  Denver receives an A minus rating with a declining outlook. Our Denver portfolio has been a strong performer averaging nearly 5% annual same-property revenue growth over the last 3 years. But we expect the market conditions to moderate over the course of 2020 given the somewhat elevated levels of new supply. Over 30,000 new jobs are expected in 2020 with around 9,000 new units scheduled for delivery.  Orlando makes our top 5 cut again this year receiving a B plus rating with a stable outlook. Job growth has been strong in Orlando over the past few years and that trend should continue. However, the strength of the Orlando market has attracted more new development activity. So the level of supply is rising. 35,000 new jobs are expected there in 2020 with 8,000 to 10,000 completions. We get Southern California and DC Metro each a B plus rating with a declining outlook. Our portfolio in Southern California bases healthy operating conditions with balanced supply and demand metrics. But after several years of relative outperformance, we expect some moderation in pricing power this year. Job growth should be around 130,000 with completions of 25,000 expected in 2020.  Our DC portfolio placed in our top five revenue growth last year. With elevated levels of supply coupled with uncertain employment growth forecasts, political risk and an election year, make us a bit more cautious on our outlook for DC this year. Supply should remain steady with completions around 13,000 units in 2020, but most job forecasts are predicting a noticeable slowdown in DC this year, which could impact our pricing power in that market. In Tampa conditions are currently a B with an improving outlook. Tampa's new supply should come down slightly to around 4,000 units with 20,000 new jobs projected, putting the jobs to completion ratio at a healthy level of around 5 times. Our Tampa portfolio was close to 3.1% same-property revenue growth last year, and we believe the growth rate could accelerate during 2020.  Austin and Charlotte both moved up in our rankings this year from B minus grades to Bs with stable outlooks. Our 2019 budgets for Austin and Charlotte originally call for revenue growth in the low 2% range, however market conditions firm over the course of the year resulting in actual revenue growth of over 3% for 2019 in each of those markets. We believe that the revenue growth for 2020 will be in the similar range to last year. New supply remains steady in Austin with approximately 10,000 new units anticipated this year, with the economy strong and the city should add over 30,000 new jobs again this year. Conditions in Charlotte are similar with 25,000 new jobs projected and 8,000 new units expected for 2020. Conditions in Dallas firmed a bit since last year's report card and the market earned a B minus with a stable outlook again this year. New supply has been persistent in Dallas with 20,000 completions recorded in both 2018 and 2019 and another 20,000 units projected to deliver this year.  Job growth continues to be a bright spot with 50,000 to 60,000 new jobs expected. But given the current supply and demand metrics, we think that Dallas market will remain very competitive in 2020. In Southeast Florida market conditions rate a C plus, but with an improving outlook. New supply and job growth have remained steady over the past few years and 2020 estimates call for over 30,000 new jobs and 9,000 new units. Competition from for-sale and rental condominium is still an issue in that market. But we expect slightly better operating conditions in 2020 and an improvement from the 1.4% same-property growth achieved -- revenue growth achieved last year.  And Houston receives a C plus rating with a stable outlook as we expect to see limited revenue growth again this year. Estimates for new supply in 2020 vary widely from a low of 9,500 to over 20,000 units coming online this year. So the market is definitely going to see an increase over the roughly 6,000 units delivered in 2019. Annual completions in Houston have ranged anywhere from 5,000 units to 22,000 units per year over the past 20 years. So 2020 supply levels will be moving back towards historical long-term averages. Houston’s job growth may also revert to its long-term average of around 45,000 new jobs per year resulting in limited pricing power and revenue growth for our portfolio this year.  Overall, our portfolio rating is a B plus again this year with most of our markets expected to moderate in revenue growth during 2020. As I mentioned earlier, all of our markets should achieve between 2% and 4% revenue growth this year, with the exception of Phoenix budgeted slightly higher. And we expect our 2020 total portfolio same-property revenue growth to be at 3.2% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Now, a few details on our 2019 operating results. Same-property revenue growth was 4.1% for the fourth quarter and 3.7% for the full year. Our top performance for the quarter were Phoenix at 6.3%, Raleigh at 6%, San Diego/Inland Empire at 5.3%, DC Metro at 4.8% and Denver at 4.7%. Rental rate trends for the fourth quarter were as expected with new leases down slightly two-tenths of 1% and renewals up 5.1% for a blended rate of 2.2% growth.  Our preliminary January results indicate 5.4% growth for renewals and eight-tenths of 1% for new leases for a blend of 3.1%, which is consistent with January 2019. February and March renewal offers are being sent out at an average increase of over 5%. Occupancy averaged 96.2% during the fourth quarter compared to 96.3% last quarter and 95.8% in the fourth quarter of '18. January occupancy has averaged 96.2% compared to 95.9% in January '19. So we're off to a good start this year.  Annual net turnover for 2019 was 100 basis points lower than 2018 at 43%. Move-outs to purchased homes were 15.9% for the quarter and 14.6% for the full year compared to 15.5% for fourth quarter of '18 and 14.8% for the full year of 2018.  At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate and capital markets activities. As mentioned on our prior quarter's call, during the fourth quarter we stabilized our Camden McGowen Station development in Houston, Texas. And we began construction on Camden Atlantic, a 269 unit, $100 million new development in Plantation, Florida.  Late in the fourth quarter, we acquired Camden Carolinian, have recently constructed 186 home apartment community located in Raleigh, North Carolina; and Camden Highland Village, a 552 home apartment community with an adjacent 2.25 acre development site located in Houston, Texas. The combined purchase price of $220 million for our fourth quarter community acquisitions was significantly below replacement costs and we expect these acquisitions to produce a stabilized yield of approximately 5%.  For full year 2019, we completed acquisitions of 4 communities with 1,380 apartment homes for a total cost of approximately $440 million. And we acquired 3 undeveloped land parcels for a total cost of approximately $37 million. Also, late in the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of our Corpus Christi, Texas portfolio and exit of that market. The assets sold included 2 wholly-owned communities with 632 apartment homes, and one joint venture community with 270 apartment homes.  Our net proceeds were approximately $75 million. This portfolio had an average age of 22 years, with average monthly revenue of $1,300 per door and annual CapEx of approximately 2,000 per door. Using actual CapEx, this disposition was completed at a 5.5% AFFO yield generating a 12.75% unleveraged IRR over a 20 year hold period. Based on a broker cap rate, which assumes $350 per door in CapEx and a 3% management fee on trailing 12 months NOI, the cap rate would have been 6.25%. Our time in Corpus definitely puts sunshine in our investors’ pockets. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired 4.9 acres of land in Raleigh for approximately $18.2 million for the future development of approximately 355 apartment homes.  On the financing side, as previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter we completed a $300 million 30-year senior unsecured bond offering with an all-in interest rate of 3.4%. We used the proceeds for the early redemption of our existing $250 million, 4.8% bonds due June 2021, and the prepayment of our $45 million 4.4% secured mortgage due 2045. These transactions locked in 30 year debt at near all time low yields, and extended the average duration of our debt by approximately three years. After taking into effect these transactions, 100% of our debt is now unsecured and all of our assets are now unencumbered.  In conjunction with the redemption and prepayment, we incurred during the fourth quarter a one-time charge to FFO of approximately $0.12 per share.  Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.9 times and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 6.4 times. We ended 2019 with only $44 million outstanding on our $900 million unsecured line of credit. Our current line of credit balance after the January 2020 payment of our fourth quarter dividend and the payment of property taxes, which are disproportionately due in January is approximately $180 million. At quarter end, we had $772 million of wholly-owned developments currently under construction, with only $359 million remaining to fund over the next two years. Moving on to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 of $125.6 million, or $1.24 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.01, primarily from higher same-store net operating income resulting from higher levels of occupancy and other property level income and continued lower turnover costs, lower taxes and general cost control measures.  For 2019 we delivered full year same-store revenue growth of 3.7%, expense growth of 2%, and NOI growth of 4.7% as compared to our original same-store guidance of 3.3% for revenue, expenses, and NOI.  You can refer to Page 27 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2020 financial outlook. We expect our 2020 FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.50 with a midpoint of $5.40 representing a $0.36 per share increase from our 2019 results. After adjusting for the 12% non-core prepayment penalty incurred during the fourth quarter of 2019, the midpoint of our 2020 guidance represents a $0.24 per share core increase resulting primarily from an approximate $0.19 per share increase in FFO related to the performance of our same-store portfolio. At the midpoint, we are expecting same-store net operating income growth of 3.3%, driven by revenue growth of 3.2% and expense growth of 3%. Each 1% increase in same-store NOI is approximately 5.75 cents per share in FFO, an approximate $0.17 per share net increase in FFO related to operating income from our non-same-store properties resulting primarily from the incremental contribution of our 4 acquisitions completed in 2019, and our 10 development communities in lease-up during either 2019 and/or 2020, partially offset by the recently completed disposition of our 2 wholly-owned Corpus Christi communities, and an approximate $0.04 per share increase in FFO due to an assumed $300 million of pro forma acquisitions spread throughout the second half of the year at initial yield of 4.5%.  This $0.40 cumulative increase in anticipated FFO per share is partially offset by an approximate $0.02 per share decrease in FFO from an assumed $200 million of pro forma dispositions at the end of 2020, an approximate $0.04 per share decrease in FFO resulting primarily from the combination of lower interest income, resulting from lower cash balances and higher corporate depreciation and amortization due to the invitation of a new cloud-based accounting and human resources system.  Our combined general and administrative, property management, and fee and asset management expenses are effectively flat year-over-year. An approximate $0.07 per share decrease in FFO due to higher net interest expense resulting primarily from actual and projected 2019 and 2020 net acquisition and development activity partially offset by the 2019 accretive refinancing of debt. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes $300 million of new unsecured debt issued in the first half of the year. And finally, an approximate $0.03 per share decrease in FFO due to the additional shares outstanding for full year 2020 following our first quarter 2019 equity issuance.  At the midpoint of 3% for our expense growth, we are anticipating that most of our expense categories will grow at approximately 3% with a notable exception of property insurance, which is anticipated to increase at approximately 20% due to the currently unfavorable insurance market.  Property insurance only comprises 3% of our total operating expenses. Property taxes represent a third of our total operating expenses and are also projected to increase approximately 3% in 2020, more in line with long-term trends. The previously discussed savings on Texas property tax rates as a result of the passage of the Texas House Bill 3 and Texas Senate Bill 2 which reduces school district tax millage rates by approximately $0.07 in 2019 and an additional $0.06 in 2020 and capped local governments tax revenue increases at 3.5% for cities and counties and a 2.5% for school districts without voter approval are offset by property tax increases in other markets, including Washington DC, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  Page 27 of our supplemental package also details other assumptions, including the plan for $100 million to $300 million of on balance sheet development starts spread throughout the year. We are finalizing our pilot of Chirp, our mobile access solution. And we'll update you further as we firm up our deployment schedule. Our 2020 guidance does not assume any incremental FFO impacts from this initiative, which we expect to be meaningfully accretive in 2021 and beyond. We expect FFO per share for the first quarter of 2020 to be within the range of $1.29 to $1.33. After excluding the $0.12 per share fourth quarter 2019 prepayment penalty, the midpoint of $1.31 represents a $0.05 per share decrease from the fourth quarter 2019 which is primarily the result of an approximate $0.02 per share decrease in sequential same-store net operating income resulting primarily from the reset of our annual property tax accruals on January the 1st of each year, and other expense increases primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends, including the time and onsite salary increases, an approximate 1.5 cent per share decrease in FFO due to a combination of lower interest income, resulting from lower cash balances, and lower fee and asset management income, an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO due to higher interest expense, an approximate $0.01 per share decrease from our previously disclosed fourth quarter 2019 business interruption insurance recovery and an approximate $0.01 per share decrease from our wholly-owned Corpus Christi dispositions.  This 6.5 cent per share aggregate decrease in FFO is partially offset by an approximate 1.5 cent per share incremental increase in FFO from our recently completed Houston and Raleigh acquisitions.  At this time, we'll open the call up to questions. 
Richard Campo: Yes. Before we start our first question and answer, we let our Camden folks know that we do have a winner to our Camden contest. The first person to correctly identify the songs with the person that submitted them is Loris Brooks, who is our Senior Benefits Administrator here in Houston. She correctly identified Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen with Kim Callahan; Humble And Kind by Tim McGraw with Mr. Malcolm Stewart; Can't Stop The Feeling by Justin Timberlake with Alex Jessett; Uptown Funk by Bruno Mars Mr. Campo; and shockingly The Fighter by Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood with me. And now we'll turn it over to open it up to questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Maybe just to start it on Houston, you did 2.1% same-store revenue in 2019. It sounds like you're expecting a similar level of growth this year. But given the increasing supply and the job growth comments that you made, just wondering how you can tie those two and what you're seeing more from your portfolio specifically?
Alex Jessett: Yes, Nick, you're correct. Our original guidance last year for Houston included right at 2.1% growth, and that's about where we are this year. So the -- one of the challenges on the Houston data is you have estimates from our providers that range all the way from new completions of a low of about 9,500 apartments to on the high-end almost 20,000 and that's a meaningful difference in that spread. We took the average -- or we're sort of planning our game plan around the average of those two outliers. We have 5 data providers. The average is about 14,000 to 15,000 apartments.  So even that -- so that doesn't seem that unmanageable in an environment where we think we're still going to get 45,000 to 50,000 new jobs and the estimates on the job growth are much more tightly bunched than the new supply. My guess is the new supply number is still -- there's still a lot of fair amount of uncertainty as to the timing of deliveries and which seemed to always be getting extended further and further out.  So we think that -- and then the second part of that is, is that our portfolio has a pretty decent mix of urban core and suburban assets. And even though a fair amount of the supplies more so this year than in previous years is coming in the suburbs, we still think that our balanced portfolio is well positioned. Probably going to see a little bit more impact as we did last year in the urban core just because that's where the current leased-ups are happening. Probably going to get a little bit more impacted late in the year from some of the suburban assets. But over all-in-all, we still feel pretty good about our ability to grind out another 2% in Houston market that's going to continue to be challenged. And there's nothing new or even very interesting about Houston being counter cyclical to the rest of our portfolio. This is about the 7th or 8th time in 30 years that we've seen results like this where Houston is definitely -- it’s just counter cyclical.  And people dig into and try to put a lot of analysis around it, but I don't think you really need to over think it too much. The reality is, is that -- and it's just as stark is this is that lower oil prices are really good for everybody else in the country and not good for Houston, and the reverse is also true. So we've been -- we had a lot of times in the past where Houston was an outlier to the top end of the range and right now it's an outlier to the bottom.
Keith Oden: Let me just add that, I think the interesting thing -- and this will apply to all markets, including Houston, but I think it supports -- it's really supported better in Houston than the other markets maybe. When we talk to our data provider providers like Ron Witten, for example, I'm going to paraphrase what Ron said on his last client call with us, which we did last week. He said that permanent demand is just disproportionally strong versus the underlying economy.  If you just look at the underlying economy and you look at job growth slowing at -- supply at all time highs, you would say, “Well, how can you have revenue growth in apartments when you're -- when you have supply with the backdrop of job growth falling year-over-year?” And the answer is, is that we just have this really interesting demographic tailwind. And the tailwind is the term that Ron uses and I think it applies to Houston as well. You have continued growth in young adults who have a high propensity to rent apartments and you have lifestyle folks non-couple types that have a higher propensity to leasing, there's more of them today.  And then when you look at propensity to rent for every demographic age group, all the way up into the 60s, those cohorts have grown dramatically in terms of propensity to rent when you think about people that who are in their 50s before it's like, well, they're going to buy houses, stay in houses, already in houses, but actually selling houses are renting. And so the rental population is increasing at a faster rate than we would ever expect, given the backdrop of job growth. One of the other really interesting studies that came out was Freddie Mac, their housing summary in 2019. There was some data and it was reported in the Washington Post just recently about 40% renters say they will likely never buy a house. And that's up from 23% of renters saying that in 2017. And then 80% of those folks -- about 80% of the 40% says that rent fits better for their lifestyle, they don't want to be -- they don't want a mortgage, they want flexibility and the optionality of being able to move whenever their lease is up. And so I think that continues to drive all the markets, including Houston. Houston does have more supply coming in on a relative basis than it did in the last few years. So it’s just keeping that revenue growth muted. But ultimately, I think the demand side of the equation is definitely far greater than the economy would sort of indicate. 
Nick Joseph: Then maybe just quickly on DC. You had mentioned political risk in an election year. What have you seen in DC I guess in election year and then maybe the following year that that’s maybe different than other years? 
Keith Oden: Well, we have done some analysis on election years versus the overall economy in DC. And interestingly enough, it sort of picks up during the election year and then it sort of depends on who gets elected. Because if you have an incumbent that gets elected, what happens is you don't have a flurry of changes, right? So you don't have lobbyists now that need to retool because they have a new administration. So that tends to be -- if you got a new administration, you tend to have more growth in DC during that period, because you have sort of the existing incumbent lobbyists and business people sort of having to retool and figure out how that improve their position vis-à-vis the new administration. So generally, it's good in the year leading up to -- it helps the economy in DC and the economy nationally leading up to an election that DC actually benefits if there's a change of administration. 
Operator: And our next question will come from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. Regarding Phoenix, it continues to be a strong market as you're forecasting this year as well. When you think development will pick up in the market to meet that demand, and why hasn't this occurred yet? 
Keith Oden: Well, we've got -- in our Phoenix numbers, John, we've got completions picking up slightly in 2020. We were about 6,800 delivered units last year, looks like we're projecting about 7,600 units this year. So that's about a 10% increase. That's probably still not sufficient to get ahead of the demand.  One of the things about Phoenix which is different than a lot of other markets that, that we operate in is just the lack of competition that we have from public companies and probably fewer merchant builders that are indigenous to Phoenix than you have in some of the other cities that we build on. So you just got a different embedded base, a little bit different competitive profile, and then you got a -- we’re -- I'm not aware of any other public companies that have anything currently under construction in Phoenix, there maybe one or two. But it's minimal if any as opposed to some of our more well traveled markets, Washington DC, Southern California, the Florida markets and even Denver and Dallas. So, just a different profile. But my guess is, is that if you look at what projected job growth is again in Phoenix next year, where the consensus number is, it’s somewhere in the 34,000, 35,000 jobs. If we get 7,500 apartments, that's roughly equilibrium. But I just don't think the capacity is there to ramp up the way some of the other markets can and have historically. But results like that ultimately will attract competition. And I think that good test case of that is Denver, which we operated in with very little outside competition from the public companies for a number of years. And that's obviously changing as well. So I'm guessing that will ramp up. 
Richard Campo: I agree with Keith in a sense that the pipelines in these markets are pretty much as full as they can get. When you look at the -- sort of the permit data and what have you repeat times in most of these markets and the challenge that we have and other developers have is that it's just really hard to make numbers work in lots of markets including Phoenix. Construction costs continue to go up high faster than rental rate increases go and it's hard to make those numbers work. And I think most people would like to ramp up their business but they really have a hard time ramping up from this high level already. 
John Kim: And my second question is to the JT TEN, Alex. What are your views on moving to a core focus or guidance number and the pros and cons of reporting NAREIT versus core?
Alex Jessett: It's interesting because I heard yesterday that probably one of the last hanger-ons of not having core FFO, has gone over to the dark side. So at this point in time, we plan on reporting FFO based upon the NAREIT white paper. I think there's a lot of importance around doing that. If you think about it, the SEC enables NAREIT have a non GAAP measure as long as it's consistently applied. And so we're going to keep with that and we're going to consistently apply it basically on the white paper at least for the foreseeable future.
Operator: And our next question will come from Shirley Wu of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shirley Wu: So my first question is actually a follow up to Nick’s question on Houston. I think in the last quarter call you mentioned that historically 40% to 50% of the demand in household formation was driven by jobs, but that capture rate actually fell last year to 15%. But you were actually seeing a more positive turnaround. Could we get a little bit of extra color in terms of how that has continued to play it out or if that turnaround has continued to improve?
Richard Campo: We have seen a higher capture rate of multifamily versus single family. And I think when we made that comment on last call, it was interesting because we’ve dug down into this data. And it was very unusual for single family demand to exceed multifamily demand in Houston and in any market, because it's been -- multifamily demand has continued to outstrip single family demand from a rental perspective.  And it was just an aberration. We had our data providers look at it. And part of it was that when the job growth that happened, the people were already here, because Houston did have a -- the downturn with the energy business. So you had 80,000 plus jobs that were lost in the energy business. And those people -- a lot of those people lived in homes. And then when the new jobs were created, those people took those jobs.  They're already in either a rent home or an owned home and the demand for multifamily or the competition for those housing those housing units went a single family as opposed to multifamily. That has turned around now because we added more jobs that, that -- and we've also seen in migration rate from -- for people moving into Houston improve and go up during 2014 to 2016 timeframe, people used to come -- before that they were coming here because you get a job easy. Then during that energy downturn, it wasn't as easy. They weren't as plentiful. We did have -- we didn't have negative job goes, but people sort of heard about that and they didn't come to Houston, didn't move to Houston to take a job. The other thing that was happening at the same time is that you were having -- we have a historically low unemployment rate in every city. And so a young adult can get a job in pretty much any city in America, if they want to stay there. So there’s a little bit of a decline in migration rates because of that as well. And I think just the migration rates overall in the country are down because of this very tight labor market. So you can get a job in the city you live in, you don't necessarily move out of the city, or move into another city to get the job.  That might be a little different for the coastal cities where you still do have out migration in California and New York and other places for tax reasons and high cost of living reasons and things like that. But we have definitely seen the capture rate for multifamily demand increase this year, and we think it's going to increase next year. We're not going to have a -- we will continue to outstrip single family demand versus multifamily.
Shirley Wu: And so my second question has to do with turnover. So I think turnover has been continued to trend down across the board for all your competitors. And it's gone so low to a point where do you think there will be a continued deceleration in turnover, or do you think it's going to kind of taper off or pick back up?
Richard Campo: I don't know Shirley, for the last five years, it's ticked down in our portfolio. And every year, I've kind of mused out loud that we've got to be approaching the limits of what the turnover rate can fall to, but it fell again last year. And it's -- I think a lot of the factors that Rick mentioned about the -- just the demographics, we just have to change our thinking about what turnover rates are likely to be in the future, because it's -- five years is more than enough to call a trend. So I think we're going to probably a permanently lower turnover part of the cycle and this is likely to continue. It's hard to know where this is like the falling homeownership rates, it's hard to know where it stops, but at some point you got I believe it'll reach some logical endpoint or low point but we haven't seen it yet.
Operator: And our next question will come from Rich Anderson of SMBC. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: So picturing Rick at a Bruno Mars concert but any way. 
Richard Campo: I mean we have seen it. We got him here for Super Bowl and we brought him in Friday night of Super Bowl and we went to that concert. 
Rich Anderson: Anyway so the year last year started from a same-store NOI and just look at the NOI line at 3.3% and you ended the year, full year 4.7%. It’s precisely the same number this year to start -- again NOI, not revenue at 3.3%. I'm curious how much is 2020 perhaps going to look like 2019 where you said, a reasonable but perhaps beatable same-store profile as we go through the year or do you feel like 2020 is different than 2019 at least in that regard?
Keith Oden: Rich, I'm going to answer your question on the revenue side of things, because there are a lot of things that happened on the expense side, property. Just -- I don't know, we did there just sort of random walk sometimes. But on the revenue side of things, you're right, we went out last year with guidance, original guidance was 3.3%. And we were -- basically our forecasting and in modeling had occupancy rates pretty much in line with what the prior year did. 2018 we hit 95.8% occupancy in our portfolio wide, which was the highest occupancy level on same-store that we've ever had. So if you go back 20 years, our 20-year average for same-store occupancy is about 94.6%. And all of a sudden we get this increase in occupancy rate, we had a peak in what we thought would probably be a peak of 95.8%.  In 2018, those were kind of -- we felt like kind of crazy high numbers, and then we sort of repeat, but we thought well maybe we can maintain that. So that's what we modeled in 2019. So that -- the 3.3% had an expectation somewhere around 95.7 to 95.8. Well as it turns out, occupancy rate over the course of the year ticked up, we end up averaging 96.1% occupied for the full year of 2019, which explains the lion’s share of the difference between 3.3% revenue growth and a 3.7% revenue growth for the year. There were a few other ins and outs, few out performances, but the lion’s share of that was the increase in occupancy rate.  So question really is, is that, are you taking a 30-year high occupancy rate and saying that's going to be repeatable and in our world it looked like the 96.1% occupancy rate was a little black swan-ish. And so naturally there's a little bit of reluctance to repeat that and as far as modeling for next year. So we moderated the occupancy rate a little bit in light of 2 primary facts. We know that deliveries in Camden's portfolio of new supply are going to be up about 15,000 apartments over last year. That’s about a 10% increase. So we know we're going to get more new units than we had last year.  The flip side of that is we also know that based on the job growth estimates in Camden's portfolio, job growth in across our platform is coming down somewhere in the 100,000 jobs over the course of the year range. So you're going to get fewer jobs, you're going to get more supply. It just feels to us like we're probably going to have a little bit different supply demand challenge in 2020 than we had last year. So the flip side of that is, is that if we end up catching lightning in a bottle again, and we average something in the 96.1 range, that's captured by the high end of our revenue range for this year at 3.7. So that's how we ended up settling our guidance for this year. 
Rich Anderson: Okay. And then could you -- I mean based on what everything you just said there, fewer jobs more supply and in your world decelerating revenue at least from your standpoint today, yet you're ramping development I think $100 million more of projects, core -- sequentially versus the third quarter on tap now. How does that reconcile based on what you just said? You're showing some confidence in the development side and yet you're kind of playing it a little closer to vest on the operating side.
Keith Oden: Well, it's primarily because the development starts kind of lumpy, right? You put property under contract, it takes you a while to get -- especially in California to get permits and what have you. And so we've been consistent in saying that we will be a $200 million to $300 million a year development start company. And if you go back to our peak development, we definitely have throttled it back a bit. But on the other hand, when you look at sort of going forward with the $200 million to $300 million, I think it’s sort of a steady state kind of a -- not a bullish -- not necessarily an overly bullish view, but just a more moderate view. And when you look at what's happening in the acquisition market, cap rates continue to compress to levels that I can't imagine -- that I never thought I could imagine when people are paying sub-4 cap rates in Dallas and Austin and other markets like that. And so it really makes -- it makes our spread between what we can -- where we can invest our capital via if we do acquisitions versus the development, that development still gets paid very well from a premium perspective compared to acquisitions.
Operator: Our next question will come from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: The other income per occupied unit accelerated this quarter. And I'm interested if that was driven primarily by parking fees and the rollout of the smart home technology initiatives you've discussed. And then what do you expect other income growth could look like in 2020? 
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So we didn't really pick up much from the smart access. We do have our parking initiatives, which we're starting to get some traction on and we're also getting a slightly higher amount of recapture on our utility income, and that's what you're seeing in the fourth quarter. If you go into 2020, we're basically assuming that, that non -- call it, non-apartment rental income will be in-line with our apartment rental income. So you've got other income which is what we all think about but we also do have parking revenue, which we're not calling other income, we're calling rental revenue. But when you put that acceleration in there as well, it should all be in-line. So there should not be a dilutive impact in 2020 from other income.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then maybe sticking with you, Alex. As far as the balance sheet, where do you guys expect to finish the year from a leverage perspective? And what would get you more comfortable levering up from the current levels of around 4 times call it? 
Alex Jessett: Yes. So we've always said that we're comfortable in the 4 to 5 times range. And so we're here today at 3.9 times. So obviously we've got a little bit of a capacity. When we look at our models, we've got ourselves sort of in the mid 4 times by the end of the year, but obviously we'll keep watching that closely and make sure that we understand what our capital raising alternatives are throughout the year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: So just two questions. But first, I mean, on the NAREIT FFO versus core, preference would be NAREIT FFO which just makes comparability easier and the core FFO everyone sort of picks their own metric makes it tough for comparison.
Alex Jessett: Hopefully you got my answer that I agree with you.
Alexander Goldfarb: That was pretty darn clear. So the question -- two questions. First, going back to Nick’s question on Houston, I hear you Keith that Houston has gone through booms, costs been great market over time. But still since the oil bust, it has lagged. And to Rick's point on cap rates and where things are trading, it would seem like there's an art here where you can maybe trim some of your Houston exposure and reinvest that in other markets at an accretive spread, whether it's either maybe markets with faster growth, so same cap rate, but faster growth, or maybe development. So can you just talk about whether almost north of 11% of Camden in Houston make sense, just given how the market has performed maybe 8%? I don't know, I mean, I don't know what the number is. But maybe something lower is better and put that money in markets that are showing more consistent growth?
Keith Oden: Well, when I think of growth, I look at it over a long period of time, Alex and it's not the variability from year-to-year and a portfolio like ours is not that concerning to me. It's more what's the long-term growth been. And if you go back to a 20-year history, Houston has outperformed most of our other markets over that period on just a pure NOI basis. So it tends to be a little bit more volatile for sure. But in the context of what we're trying to achieve, which is a total shareholder return, grow NOI over a long period of time. It still fits what we're trying to do very well. Now, with regards to the timing and what's your exposure today, where's it going? I think that that somewhere around -- given the size of the Houston market, somewhere around 11%, 12% makes sense for a long-term target. But that -- having said that, it behooves us to be opportunistic as to when we put money to work in these markets and not necessarily in tune with the underlying -- is the market -- one of the -- at the top of the peer group today, it's more where will it be over the next 10 years.  So if you think about from a timing standpoint, we just bought an asset in Houston at the end in the fourth quarter that we think was an extraordinary value play. We think we bought that asset at a roughly 30% discount to replacement costs at a 5% kind of stabilized yield. Those are numbers that you can get in most of our -- certainly the replacement cost numbers, you can't touch that in any of our other markets. So if you're thinking about this as a 10-year -- sort of a 10-year horizon, 5 to 10 years, that's an incredible play.  So to your point of could you be selling Houston now lightening up and redeploying the capital? Sure you could do that. But if Houston right now springs as one of our most attractive and I think in 2020 also will screen as one of our most attractive acquisition opportunities, then it's sort of -- it's almost -- it would hurt my brain in a really bad way to be thinking of Houston as a fantastic acquisition market, and then disposing assets into that. It's just hard for me to think of it being a great buy market and a great sell market at the same time.  Having said that, we clearly have the opportunity when Houston is in a more recovered state and people are trading not necessarily at discount to replacement costs, to sell some of our older assets in Houston at an appropriate time which is we don't think is now but to do that, to bring our exposure back down to the level that we want it to be at and end up with a newer higher quality portfolio in Houston and just live with the timing aspects that are associated with that. 
Alexander Goldfarb: And then second is on development. You just bought the Raleigh site, you also issued some ATM. So maybe you can talk about where you see new development yields today when you're starting projects. I think your stabilized stuff you said was sort of 5-ish, but maybe where your underwriting development yields today? And just understanding how that compares to where you raise capital on the spread?
Richard Campo: Well, the development yields that we’re targeting today -- we're still targeting suburban development deals in the 6 range and the urban development deals in the low 5s. And the -- in terms of the spread to -- I don't think it might spread to issuing capital today. We think of it on a more broad basis. So the way I think about and we think about our costs of capital is it's our long-term weighted average cost of capital. And with a balance sheet that’s about a 75% equity, 25% debt spread, when you do a sort of capital asset pricing model analysis of what is your -- what is Camden's cost of capital? It's around a little slightly higher than 6%.  So when we look at a development transaction or an acquisition, we look at what our unlevered IRR would be over 7 year period on that development, and that needs to be higher than our cost of capital and it needs to be 150 basis points wide of our cost of capital plus or minus. Acquisitions can be tighter than that because you don't have the development risk.  So how we manage our balance sheet in the short-term is sort of being opportunistic with debt rates, being opportunistic with equity issuances to try to keep our balance sheet in the right place, given where we are in the market cycle. But I don't think about the incremental cost of capital on whether I'm doing a 30 year bond deal or issuing equity on the ATM. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from Robert Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Given a California is roughly 12.5% of your NOI across 12 properties with a legislative, regulatory, ballot issues, et cetera, how are you guys thinking about capital deployment there beyond the one project you have under development, and potentially the one that's in the shadow pipeline? 
Richard Campo: We still like our California portfolio in spite of the legislative issues, because where our portfolio is in probably some of the less risk markets in terms of rent control. The statewide rent cap really doesn't affect us that much because you’re talking about a CPI plus 5 kind of number which we’re right now not getting. And, so I think I would be a little more nervous, especially with the renewed Costa Hawkins ballot legislation that's likely to be on the ballot in 2020 that would allow cities to get more aggressive. Our portfolios just are not in the cities that are more militant when it comes to rent control. And even with all the sort of negative aspects of California with cost of living and all that, it's still a pretty good market to be a multifamily owner in and I like the exposure there. 
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And Keith you were talking before about the turnover being low and can't get much lower, et cetera. I mean how much -- I mean there's obviously positives to that from a same-store perspective. But is that putting a drag on your redevelopment given the fact that you're getting access to fewer units on an annual basis? And how are you guys working around that?
Keith Oden: Yes. At the margins it matters a little bit, but you're talking about the difference between 43% and a 44% turnover rate year-over-year between 2018 and 2019. If you had a 5% or 10% delta in any given year, that would probably affect the repositions. But the fact is that as Rick gave the numbers in his opening remarks, we've done almost 40,000 apartments. And so we're down to -- I think the active reposition pipeline right now is only about 2,900 apartments. So the vast majority of the reposition activity that was available to happen in our portfolio has already happened.
Operator: Our next question will come from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: I guess we've covered a lot of ground on the call so far. But just along the topic of very low acquisition cap rates and compressing development yields out there, Rick, you've done a good job in the past of sort of laying out what the competitive landscape looks like, just in the sense of the typical capital stack for developer or maybe competitors on the acquisition side, hurdle rates and lender requirements. Can you maybe just walk us through what the average math looks like nowadays, and maybe how that compared to where we were a year ago?
Richard Campo: Well, a year ago interest rates were higher, right, than they are today. So the capital stack has improved for the acquisition folks, because interest rates are seriously much lower than they were last year this time. And you did have a really interesting situation last year, when you had coming out of the 2018 cycle, right? And so we thought that you would have some pressure on merchant builders and pressure on others to where you have the buy side of the equation having the advantage versus the sell side. And that just hasn't manifested itself yet, except for maybe a few markets in some unusual situations where we've been able to uncover. But cap rates continue to be very, very sticky if not going down, and primarily because of the -- the capital is very, very available. Even though if you look at private equity trying to raise funds from pension funds, those numbers are pretty -- are down and getting new funds rate -- and new funds being raised in that way is definitely down. But there's still a massive amount of capital that's already been raised that's unfunded that needs to find a home. And so I don't think we lack any capital from the equity or the debt side of the equation. It has actually improved and created more pressure than you would think. 
Keith Oden: Yes, just to follow-up on that, we were -- I was in -- we were in Multi Housing Council -- National Multi Housing Council Annual Meeting in Orlando last week. And just to give you an interesting data point with regard to how many -- the amount of capital and the amount of participants that is brokers and companies that are in the multifamily field and chasing deals right now. 2 years ago at the NMHC National Meeting, comparable meeting, there were 5,500 credential participants. This year, there were 8,000 credential participants at the same exact conference. So in 2 years, an additional 2,500 people paid a pretty healthy price to show up and spend 3 days at the NMHC. So I'm inclined to call peak NMHC and we'll see where it goes from there. But there is -- the amount of people interested in the space has grown dramatically, the amount of capital, there's no end in sight. So, I think there's more of the same in-store for -- on transactions. 
Rich Hightower: Yes. I mean that's helpful color, guys. I mean any quick commentary maybe on LTVs or lender requirements, debt service coverage, those sorts of things, just to kind of get a sense of that? 
Richard Campo: Yes, LTVs are 70% to 80%. And one thing that's been interesting is as the banks have sort of tightened their areas, debt funds have expanded dramatically. Debt funds -- now over 20% of the multifamily fundings are coming from debt funds, both development and acquisitions. And two years ago debt funds were maybe 5% of the market, now they are 20%. And so it's not just banks or insurance companies, it's these debt funds. So there are mezz programs out there too. So I know developers here putting 10% equity, 20% mezz and 70% construction loans from debt funds or banks. And so you can get up to 90% financing with a mezz piece. And the mezz competition is, is as aggressive as we've seen in a long time too. It's definitely much wider than then treasuries, but it's 500 basis points, 600 basis points above the 10 year, you can get a mezz piece to get your 90% financing.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: So just want to go back to the leverage topic. Your leverage is clearly the lowest in the sector. And you look at the rest of the multifamily REITs they tend to have debt-to-EBITDA 5 times or maybe above. And I know your proxy does spell out that having leverage in the low 4 times range is a performance metric for executive comp. And so I guess I'm just wondering why you feel the need to have it that low. So this was put in place years ago as a performance metric to get your leverage down. It's come down. Why do you still feel the need to have your leverage so much lower than the peer group? 
Richard Campo: It's primarily based on sort of where we are in the cycle. We have called the top of the market a couple times in the last few years and missed that mark, obviously. But I would point you back to the fourth quarter of 2018 when the world was changing dramatically and the tenure was over 3 and all of a sudden people started talking about prices falling. And our stock price fell pretty dramatically along with others. And so we're 10 years into the longest U.S. recovery in the history of -- since the great depression or maybe even the history of America, I'm not sure if it's the history of America. But I think with the unusual and maybe it’s usual now with low interest rates, and maybe it's going to be low forever, I don't know, but your peak supply, the longest recovery ever, I think you need to be cautious in this area and our Board feels that way, and we're going to keep our debt-to-EBITDA at the low end of the range until there's maybe signs for us that there may be clear sailing. But I can't imagine not having a recession in the next 5 years. And so if, we do, I want to be positioned -- I want Camden to be positioned to take advantage of what could be interesting opportunities and the discussion that we just had on the last question, when you think about people who are rushing into the space today paying sub-4 cap rates, and leveraging to 90% with mezz, I'd like to know who they are in the future when we have a recession?
Nick Yulico: That’s a fair point Rick. I guess I'm just wondering though why it needs to be as low as 4 times right? Which is clearly -- is a performance metric that you guys hit max payout on that, if you keep it 4. Why is that the magic number? And does at some point the company revisit this and think about, hey, maybe now is the time to be doing more development. And so we can do that and we don't need to keep our leverage that well.
Keith Oden: Yes. So Nick, just a point on the performance metric. The metric is 4% to 5% is arrange for debt-to-EBITDA. So if it mirrors our guidance to the street, and I think in Alex's answer earlier in his commentary, if we have a bond transaction model that if we do our book of business as we currently have it laid out with acquisitions development, funding, et cetera, we'll end the year at 4.5. And that's right in the middle of the range that we've given guidance to not only the performance metric, but also guidance to the street.  So I don't -- I think by the end of the year all things being equal, we should be somewhere in the middle of -- near the middle of the range of the 4.5, 4 to 5 times which we think is still appropriate given all the Rick’s commentary. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: I know it’s been a long call, so just one for me. A follow-up on Houston supply. It does look based on the data I'm looking at, like the number of deliveries or the quantity of deliveries picks up kind of as the year goes on this year. And so given this visibility in the first part of ‘20, do you maybe worry a little bit more about kind of a back half here and then how things might shape up for ‘21 or do you look at it as supply kind of naturally spreading itself out a little more kind of as things are delayed? Just curious how you are thinking about that?
Richard Campo: Yes. So, well, the way we look at Houston -- you have to remember, Houston is a vast market, 650 miles -- square miles, right? And so, one of the things that's really interesting about the Houston supply, this kind of just shows you what lenders and merchant builders have done. They are moving out of the core, urban core and moving into the suburbs pretty dramatically. To give you an example, in KD, there are 3,000 units that have come online this year in KD. We have 2 joint venture properties in KD and nothing else. There's 3,000 units coming online in the Woodlands. We have one -- two joint venture properties that are up towards the Woodlands, but are not Woodlands proper. So that 6,000 units that are coming online in Houston that are really not competitive with our submarkets.  So the way we look at Houston is, number one, I think that it’s always -- clearly the back half of the year is going be more pressured than the front half of the year, just always is with -- especially with the ramp up of the development, starting sort of beginning of last year, they'll bring products on and it's -- and we also have clearly continued slippage of ones that were supposed to be in the first and second quarter, they go into the third and fourth quarter.  So with that said, the back half of the year would probably be a little more difficult than the front half. But keep in mind that the key is where is that product and how does that affect our product in the suburbs, and we think that we're reasonably insulated from a lot of the supply because Houston is so big.
Drew Babin: Okay. From a timing perspective you kind of look at it as maybe more of a general overhang that will persist for a certain period of time rather than anything potentially lumpy given how spread out the market is? 
Richard Campo: Yes.
Operator: Our next question will come from Neil Malkin of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Hopefully, we can keep this call going till like 1 East Coast time. 
Richard Campo: Why not? In the senate.
Neil Malkin: No way. So anyways, permits picked back up in recent months. And you talked about debt funds kind of filling the void there. I'm just wondering if you think we've kind of reached a structural peak in terms of supply just given the types of delays and labor constraints, such that even though permits might be picking up, we're continuing to see so many delays. Like is this kind of the most that we can physically produce and we shouldn't really expect anything to really acute the rest of the cycle? 
Keith Oden: So, if you look at our data providers, and you look at to 2020 completions versus 2019, both in Camden's markets and nationally, completions are expected to be up about 10% year-over-year. And then if you look at their -- and these are not -- obviously, they have been less of a -- less certainty to them but in the 2021 numbers there's a slight uptick from that. So not major, but -- so the answer to your question is, I'm not sure it's -- I don't know if it's a structural capacity, but it could very well be that it's a financial wherewithal and call it developer capacity. Because you do reach a point where even if money is certainly relatively plentiful, there are aggregate limits on what lenders are willing to -- how much they're willing to play with any particular sponsor. So I think it's -- I don't know, if it's structural in terms of the construction providers. We clearly have had -- getting the existing book of business completed for everybody and every one of our markets has been challenging for the last five years. And I just don't know how that gets any better in an environment where you have a constraint on skill labor, but more projected completions. I just think it gets worse.
Neil Malkin: Yes. Okay, that makes sense. And last one is, in your operating expense guidance, do you bake in any successful real estate tax appeals?
Alex Jessett: Yes, we actually do. So if you look at 2019, we got refunds in of about $2.9 million. In 2020, we are anticipating $2.6 million of refunds. So pretty close to what we received in 2019.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Just one from me. I wanted to go back to your cautious comments on DC for 2020. I guess, are you seeing anything on the ground today in terms of foot traffic, concession trends that suggest that the third-party forecast for still in job growth could come to fruition? Because the declining to from 2019 level for the mid-4% of revenue growth, down from the 4.8% you did this quarter seems to be like a pretty sharp pivot in terms of the trajectory of pricing power. So is it just caution versus the third-party forecast? Or are you seeing it happen today? 
Keith Oden: Well, if you take -- so there is 2 things on the forecast. Our primary provider is Ron Witten, as everybody knows. And he's got 2020 employment growth at 13,000, which is at the low end of everybody else's range. And we've challenged that number and -- because it doesn't seem consistent with what we're seeing. But if you look at the average of the data providers that we have, it includes CBRE, RealPage and Marcus & Millichap, it's close to the 25,000.  So it certainly seems like the average is probably makes -- it makes more sense when you look at the numbers. But if it's closer to the lower end of that range, and then it's going to be a challenging market, because we're going to -- we know we're going to get 11,000 to 12,000 additional apartments in DC Metro. Now again, the DC Metro story is always a little bit tricky, because you guys think about where the footprint is and our footprint is different than most of our competitors. And it includes Northern Virginia and Maryland and some of suburban assets that we continue to just have incredibly strong results from. Where we do -- the only place we do have challenges is where there's a sub-market where we've got immediate construction, early stuff going on, and we get impacted like anyone else does. But -- so I don't -- I think our game plan next year reflects a fair amount of realism in terms of what we expect to see. Obviously, 2019 was an unexpectedly good year for us in the DC market. And I'd love to see it repeat. I'm just not sure that based on the data that it makes much sense to be particularly bullish -- more bullish than we are in our forecasts. 
John Pawlowski: On the ground today, the team has not really seen any recent changes in terms of renewal pricing or concessions or foot traffic?
Keith Oden: No, I don't -- in fact our market update call the other day I would describe them as very optimistic in terms of their game plan for 2020. We asked everybody to give us their -- on a scale of 1 to 10, how achievable is this and they were in the 9 to 10 range. So they feel very comfortable with their game plan. So no change, no low concerns based on current conditions in DC. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste : So, a couple quick ones from me. So, first, I guess I'm curious on any updated perspective on rent control in some of your Sun Belt markets to this year? Per national multi housing it looks like Florida introduced measures last year that would remove the state preemption of rent controls, and those bills are poised for consideration here? And then there's also been some chatter in Atlanta, while Georgia too has a state level preemption against rent control. It looked like the city council there recently introduced a resolution encouraging the states to allow cities in that state to pass rent control legislation?
Keith Oden: Yes, Haendel, there's talk and there's chatter, and there's activism around the idea of some form of rent control in almost every state that we operate in. The question is, how far advanced is it? What's the traction? The market that I would say is more on my radar screen as far as actionable legislation that could impact us would be Denver. I mean, they're pretty -- there's been a lot of conversations. There's been a lot of local initiatives around the idea of rent control. I'm not overly concerned about the other ones you meant, Florida, for example. It's possible that some -- that there might be something introduced. It's hard for me to get my head wrapped around a statewide initiative in the State of Florida around rent control at this point, but it’s something you got to be aware of. I mean, the ground is shifting on this for sure. And we are having conversations, having conversations in States that five years ago you probably would have said, that's not ever going to be a conversation in the State of Florida or Atlanta or Texas. But it's just something you got to be really aware of, and ultimately the -- how many of them progress to the point where you're actually in a firefight like you're in California over specific initiatives. That remains to be seen. 
Richard Campo: Yes. And I just don't see it happening in those markets. As Keith pointed out in Houston, for example, there has been discussion of rent control here, because housing prices, apartment prices have gone up and affordable housing is really tough here. And the interesting thing is, they will talk about it and then when you get people in a room that understand the politics of the area, they know it's never going to happen. And so, I think that there's a lot of talking, but you don't have the same kind of political polarized sort of hardcore blue folks like you do in California, New York and some of these other markets, when you get to the ultimate -- and these are red states, and pretty much going to be that way for a long time, and which would preempt a lot of state stuff. 
Haendel St. Juste: And can I get you to talk a little bit more about the Chirp mobile servicing platform that you're planning to roll out here? How should we be thinking about that incremental cost? What are the key features or focus areas? And then, maybe, can you talk broadly about the expected benefits and put some -- maybe some broad numbers around potential expense savings or NOI, margin benefit? You mentioned no accretion this year, curious what that could look like maybe in two or three years time? 
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So, what it is? It's a mobile access solution that would enable both the residents and vendors to using their smartphone to enter the premises and also enter the locks of the individual communities. We are in the middle of our pilot. The pilot is going very well. And we will have more information for you as we get a real deployment schedule. I will tell you that we have done a lot of studies around this. And when you really look at what our consumers are willing to pay for, there are a lot of smart home technologies out there that are getting a lot of press, but the reality is, is what our consumers are most interested in is access.  And so that is what we are primarily focusing on. And in addition to the fact that we know that our residents are willing to pay for this amenity, and it truly is an amenity, we believe that there's going to be efficiencies on the operating side, if you think about the amount of time that we spend either rekeying locks, letting vendors in, dealing with lockouts, et cetera, there should be some fairly meaningful savings on the expense side. But once again we're firming all this up. As I said, 2020 is really a year for rollout and the deployment and our pledge to you guys is that we will update you quarterly as we know more.
Operator: Our next question will come from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Just wanted to dig into the other income effect, specifically in the fourth quarter? And just where different things are accounted for. So I think Alex mentioned briefly, parking as you guys account for it a little differently than other -- traditional other income. If you could share the breakdown of where parking is and maybe the cable bundles and all these other things are accounted for that would be good?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So if you are on Page 7 of our supplemental package you'll notice that we have property revenues as one line item. If you go down to our footnote, which is footnote A, we try to break out rental revenue versus other revenue that is tied with a contractual obligation. So if you sort of think about rental revenue, we deem parking revenue, because you're effectively renting parking space to the rental revenue. But we certainly think about our tech package, valley waste, et cetera, that would fall into the other income category.
Hardik Goel: And then at the margin level I guess for the same thing. If I'm looking at the rental rate sequentially, it’s up roughly 70 basis points, but the revenue for home is up 40. So is that just a drag from other income. How do I interpret that at the market level? 
Alex Jessett: Well, I think what I would look at is, if I go to the fourth quarter comparison and I would say that monthly -- average monthly rental rates were up 3.4%, yet revenue for occupied home was up 3.7%. So if you look at the monthly rental rates about 3.4, and then you add your occupancy of 0.4, that gets you to 3.8, which is pretty much in line with 3.7. So I would tell you there's really not a drag there from any of our additional other income categories.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rick Campo, CEO for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
Richard Campo: We appreciate you being on the call and supporting Camden for last decade and look forward to being with you for the next decade. So take care and thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete third quarter 2019 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. I know that several of the multifamily calls this week have gone over 90 minutes in length, so we will attempt to be brief in our prepared remarks and try to complete our call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard Campo: Thanks, Kim, and good morning. Today's on-hold music was provided by the Talking Heads. In their hit titled Once in a Lifetime, they say that life is same as it ever was, which seems to describe the strength in the multifamily space. Camden's third quarter earnings and same property net operating income growth was better than we expected, leading to another guidance increase making that three for the year. Apartment demand continues to exceed new supply in our markets, driven by higher job growth in the national average. Household formations continue to be strong through the third quarter to nearly $1.4 million increase in household formations this year so far, the highest in the last 10 years. Apartment capture rate has remained high. Apartments continue to be the home of choice for millennials and many others. The record high employment has finally started to bring some of the millennials that are still living with their parents since the great recession back into the apartment markets. This puts smiles on the faces of the parents, their grown children and the apartment owners. We continue to improve the quality of our property portfolio through development, acquisitions, repositioning and selected property dispositions, while maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in REIT land. I want to give a big shout out to our Camden teams for their focus, vision and hard work making sure that they are improving our team members, our customers and our stakeholders' lives one experience at a time. Thanks. And I will let Keith take the call from here.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Our third quarter results marked the third straight quarterly beat in same-store raise, which leaves us well positioned for a strong close out to 2019. We will be providing 2020 guidance next quarter along with our customary report card and letter grades for each of Camden's markets. Our most recent third-party economic forecasts are indicating supply will peak in Camden's markets in the aggregate in 2020 with a slight decline in 2021. Most of our markets will see flat to declining supply next year. However, we do expect to see increases in Houston, Orlando, Atlanta, Dallas, and Austin. Some highlights from our same-store results include the fact that same-store revenue grew at 3.6% in the third quarter and 1.4% sequentially. Our top markets for the quarter were Phoenix at 6.9%, Raleigh at 5.3%, San Diego/Inland Empire up 4.5%, Denver and DC Metro both up 4.1%, and Atlanta up 4%. Our weaker markets remained South Florida and Houston below 2%. Regarding occupancy, our focus remains on maintaining occupancy above 96%. We averaged 96.3% in the third quarter of 2019, up from 96.1% in the prior quarter and 95.9% in the third quarter of 2018. Year-to-date, occupancy was 96.1% versus 95.7% last year, and October occupancy remained slightly above 96% at 96.1%. Turning to leasing activity. Third quarter 2019 new leases were up 2.4%, renewals were up 5.1%, for a blend of 3.6%. This compares to a third quarter 2018 blended rate of 4.1%. This 50 basis point decrease in rents was mostly offset by our 40 basis point increase in occupancy compared to last year. October prelims for new leases were flat as expected and up 5% on renewals for a 1.9% blend, roughly the same as October of 2018. November/December renewals are being sent out at an average 5% increase. Our net turnover continues to set new record lows for the third quarter of 2019. It was down to 51% versus 54% last year. Move-outs to purchased homes for the quarter was 14.3%, which was the same as last quarter in the third quarter of 2018. For this metric, 14% to 15% is beginning to feel like the new normal for move-outs to purchased homes versus the 18% to 20% rate prior to the Great Recession. Regarding technology initiatives, Camden is evaluating numerous initiatives to increase revenues, reduce expenses and provide an overall better living experience for our residents. We have completed the rollout of mobile maintenance and an enhanced self-service online functionality for our residents. We are currently piloting Chirp, our proprietary mobile access solution, and we will update you periodically on our technology and innovation initiatives. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander Jessett: Thanks, Keith. And before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate and capital markets activities. During the third quarter of 2019, we began construction on Camden Hillcrest, a 132-unit $95 million new development in the Hillcrest neighborhood of San Diego, California. Subsequent to quarter end, we stabilized our Camden McGowen Station development in Houston, Texas, generating a yield in the low-5% range. As a result of the elevated supply in the midtown submarket, this yield is slightly below our original pro forma, but within the range of our expected returns for similar mid and high-rise urban development. As a supply dynamic in midtown continues to improve, there will be further upside for Camden McGowen Station resulting from its irreplaceable location adjacent to public transportation and a vibrant city park. Later in the fourth quarter, we will begin construction on Camden Atlantic, a 269-unit $100 million new development in Plantation, Florida. For 2019, we have now completed $218 million of acquisitions and $185 million of new development starts. We are actively working on several additional real estate transactions which, if successful, would close around year-end and are therefore not included in our fourth quarter guidance as the impact to the quarter would be immaterial. On the financing side, subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $300 million 30-year senior unsecured bond offering with an all-in interest rate of 3.41% after giving effect to underwriters discounts and other expenses to the offering. We used the proceeds for the early redemption of our existing $250 million 4.78% bonds due June of 2021, and the prepayment of our $45 million 4.38% secured mortgage due 2045. These transactions locked in 30-year debt at near all-time low yields and extended the average duration of our debt by approximately three years. After taking into effect these transactions, 100% of our debt is now unsecured and all of our assets are now unencumbered. In conjunction with the redemption and prepayment, we incurred a one-time charge to FFO of approximately $0.12 per share. This charge represents the combined amounts from make-whole payment on the previously outstanding $250 million bond, the prepayment penalty on the $45 million mortgage and the write-off of remaining related loan cost. Again, this $0.12 charge was recorded in October and is included in fourth quarter and full-year FFO guidance. Turning to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2019 of $130.5 million or $1.29 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.01. This $0.01 per share outperformance resulted primarily from higher same-store NOI, resulting from a combination of higher than anticipated levels of occupancy and lower than anticipated real estate taxes. We have updated and revised our 2019 full-year same-store revenue, expense, net operating income and FFO guidance based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. As a result of our better-than-expected third quarter same-store occupancy, which we believe will carry over to the fourth quarter, and our anticipation of continued lower property taxes in the fourth quarter, we increased the midpoint of our full-year revenue growth guidance from 3.4% to 3.5%, and we decreased the midpoint of our full-year expense growth guidance from 2.75% to 2.2%. The anticipated property tax savings are primarily being driven by lower Texas property tax rates as a result of the passage of Texas House Bill 3, which reduces school district tax rates by approximately $0.07 in 2019 and an additional $0.06 in 2020. As a result, we are now anticipating full-year property taxes for our same-store portfolio to increase at just under 1%, approximately 200 basis points inside our prior guidance. The result of this higher revenue guidance and lower expense guidance is a 50 basis point increase to the midpoint of our 2019 same-store NOI guidance from 3.75% to 4.25%. Last night, we also revised the midpoint of our full-year 2019 FFO guidance from $5.09 to $5.02 per share. This $0.07 per share decrease includes the impact of the fourth quarter $0.12 per share charge related to the early debt repayment. Excluding this charge, our full-year FFO per share guidance midpoint increased by $0.05 per share as the result of our anticipated 50 basis points or $0.025 per share increase in 2019 same-store operating results, approximately $0.01 of this increase incurred during the third quarter with the remainder anticipated in the fourth quarter, $0.015 of higher interest and other income, resulting primarily from higher cash balances and other miscellaneous corporate income, and $0.01 from anticipated fourth quarter business interruption insurance recovery from the prior period for one of our non-same-store communities. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.21 to $1.25. The midpoint of $1.23 represent a $0.06 per share decrease from $1.29 reported in the third quarter of 2019 and includes the impact of the fourth quarter $0.12 per share FFO charge related to the early debt repayment. Excluding this $0.12 charge, our fourth quarter FFO per share guidance midpoint increased by $0.06 per share as compared to the third quarter as a result of a $0.02 per share or just over 1% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, driven primarily by our normal third to fourth quarter seasonal declines in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover and personnel expenses, a $0.02 per share increase in NOI from our development communities and lease-up, our other non-same-store communities and the incremental contribution from our joint venture communities, a $0.01 per share increase in FFO associated with the previously mentioned fourth quarter business interruption insurance recovery from one of our non-same-store communities, and a $0.01 per share decrease in overhead expense due to the timing of various corporate initiatives and expenditures. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.9x and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 6x. We ended the quarter with no balances outstanding on our $900 million unsecured line of credit and $157 million of cash on hand. After closing our $300 million bond offering on October 7, redeeming the $250 million bond on October 23, and repaying the $45 million mortgage on October 31, we now have approximately $73 million of cash on hand. At quarter end, we had $672 million of on-balance sheet developments under construction with $337 million remaining to fund over the next 2.5 years. At this time, we will open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Trent Trujillo: Hi, good morning. So I appreciate the prepared comments about the potential for some acquisitions around year end. But just for some context, can you give an indication of how many deals you're looking at and the approximate value of that pipeline?
Richard Campo: We are probably evaluating $1 billion of transactions, and that's kind of on an ongoing basis. It's likely we'll close one or two of those by the end of the year, and we're talking probably hitting our original guidance or being slightly ahead of the original guidance, which would be $100 million to $200 million by the end of the year.
Trent Trujillo: Okay. And a quick follow-up on that same topic. So earlier this year, you removed dispo guidance – dispositions from your guidance because you had other sources of funding which included equity issuance, and your stock is now at an all-time high. So how are you thinking about your cost of capital and the potential to issue more equity to take advantage of some of these opportunities that you're seeing?
Richard Campo: Well, clearly our cost of capital has gone down this year by virtue of – when you think about the 30-year bond, we did at an all-in rate of 3.41% including fees. And clearly, the high – the stock price at this level lowers our costs as well. Ultimately, in order to grow, you either have to issue equity or issue debt, and we have said for a long time that we're going to manage our balance sheet to be one of the best balance sheets in the entire REIT sector. So to the extent that we can match fund acquisition opportunities or fund our development, ultimately we do need to be in the capital markets. So we want to be opportunistic in that area. This year, we've issued over $1 billion worth of the bonds and a few at really good rates, and we did an equity issuance in February. So we will continue to try to be prudent in our capital management and make sure that we have a use of funds before we load up the balance sheet. Right now, we have cash on our balance sheet and we need to spend it.
Trent Trujillo: Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. You mentioned that you expect supply to peak in 2020. Can you provide some more color on that in terms of expected deliveries in 2020 versus this year, and then maybe specifically for DC and Houston?
Richard Campo: Yeah. So Nick, in our – this is using Ron Witton's numbers. In 2019, across Camden's footprint, this year in 2019, we're going to get roughly 137,000 deliveries that ticks up in 2020 to about 150,000, and then that comes back down – as we mentioned, it will come down slightly in 2021 to about 147,000. So the progression is 137,000, 151,000 and then back down to 147,000 with a peak in 2020. In DC, the numbers are basically flat 12,000 this year, expected 12,000 next year and another 12,000 in 2021. Houston is the big change. We go from roughly 8,000 apartments this year to about 15,000, which is percentage wise is a big jump, but 15,000 is closer to the long-term average for deliveries in Houston. So we'll – looks like we're trending back to kind of what the long-term average has been, but it's a pretty big jump over 2019.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. And so when you think about how that plays into Houston, obviously it's been a little bit of a drag this year in terms of same-store revenue growth versus the portfolio overall. How do you think about operating that portfolio going into heightened supply next year?
Richard Campo: Sure. The Houston market is an interesting market because we expected Houston to be better this year than it has been. And what's going on here is that we continue to have strong job growth, 75,000 to 80,000 jobs. The unemployment rate dropped dramatically here over the last couple of years, and what we thought would be higher apartment demand didn't materialize the way it usually does. And what happened was – and I think this is sort of indicative of migration rates around the country. They've gone down primarily from historical numbers, and that generally – that's a function of the unemployment rate being low everywhere. So there's not as much incentive for somebody to leave their city if they can get a job and they can create a situation for their family there to go to another city. So that's one of the issues. The other issue in Houston, which is pretty interesting, is that when our unemployment rate went down, the new jobs that were created, they were taken by existing people who lived here who already had a housing solution. So they either lived in a house or an apartment already, and we didn't create new demand as a result of that. And when you start looking at the numbers going forward into 2020 and 2021, we think that flips. Usually apartments are getting maybe 40% to 50% of the demand in household formations driven by jobs, and last year, they got about 15% of the capture rate in Houston. So we think that's going to turn next year – it started turning already, and we're going to see it turn in 2020 and 2021, which should be more constructive for being able to lease those apartments that are coming online during that period.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Shirley Wu with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shirley Wu: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So you guys talked about Houston a little bit. So could you also talk about Southeast Florida where you're also seeing a little bit of a softer market, and what could potentially happen in the near-term to make that market better or worse than expected?
Richard Campo: Yes. Shirley, in Southeast Florida, there's two primary issues. There has been a moderation in job growth for sure, and we're running between Fort Lauderdale down from about 15,000 jobs in 2019, looks like it's trending to about 13,000 jobs in 2020, both of which are on the low end of their historical rates, about the same thing in Miami, 18,000 jobs this year, trending to 15,000 next year. You still have a pretty big overhang of condominium – shadow inventory of condominiums. They're soaking up some of the demand at the higher end of the market. So that's a little bit of an issue on the supply side. In 2019, in Fort Lauderdale, we had about 3,000 apartments. It looks like that's going to be less than 2,000 in 2020, which should help some. And then, Miami, you've got total supply this year completions about 7,700, and it looks like that drops down to about 7,000 next year. So while we think that that scenario looks like it's in equilibrium, it certainly doesn't feel like a scenario we're going to see a great return to pricing power in South Florida in 2020. We'll see. We're in the process right now of putting together our bottom-up budgets and we'll provide you with a lot – hopefully a lot more clarity and guidance on our view for South Florida on our next conference call.
Shirley Wu: Got it. That's helpful. And as we're talking about this topic on supply, as you anticipate higher supply into 2020, could you talk a little bit about your strategy going forward and that focus on occupancy versus rates?
Richard Campo: Yes. So if you look at Camden's total footprint, you've got – the supply is going up across our markets from 137,000 to about 151,000. So it's 14,000 apartments over Camden's entire footprint. Roughly 8,000 of that is in Houston. And again, the 8,000 gets us back in Houston to kind of a normal run rate for absorption. So the anomaly of that 14,000, about 8,000 of it is in Houston, and it's not – it's coming off such a low base that doesn't seem terribly troublesome to us, and the rest of it is sort of a rounding error across our markets. I think, from our perspective, 2020 in the aggregate, is going to be a lot like 2019, but you're going to see some movement around the markets. I think I mentioned the markets where we've got supply increases, including Orlando, Dallas, Austin and Houston. And then pretty much everywhere else in our portfolio, we should see moderate declines in supply. So we are going to maintain our strategy of trying to maximize occupancy at this part of the cycle. We just think that that's probably the better trade off. So again, when we put together our plan for next year, my guess is, is that we'll be planning for something that's a little higher in average occupancy than what you would have seen on our portfolio over the last five years, but maybe not materially, but maybe 95.5% to 96%. We've been fortunate this year to be able to outperform occupancy every quarter so far, and it looks like that will carry over on the fourth quarter this year.
Shirley Wu: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good morning down there. Just two questions. First, on the transaction market, you guys have been pretty clear the past few years that it's obviously tough to acquire. And just sort of curious, as cap rates and rent growth across the country almost converge just sort of the same levels regardless of market, are you guys finding that your IRRs are the same as you underwrite or are you seeing more competition from maybe some of the coastal markets or rent control markets coming your way where the IRRs that you're underwriting this year may actually be lower than what you would have had last year just given the competition?
Richard Campo: Well, I think the – generally speaking, the reason we haven't been as aggressive from acquiring properties is because of that issue, right. I mean, when you get down to the issue, we want to have a decent spread over our long-term costs of capital on our terminal IRRs. And so the going-in yields are pretty much the same across the country. And for the type of property we're looking at it, we're now at sub-4s in most markets, including Houston. And so the idea of the growth that you have to have from that starting point to get a terminal IRR that is a decent spread over your long-term cost of capital is tough. Now, that's why we haven't bought as many properties. So bottom line is, we're looking for kind of a needle in the haystack where it's undermanaged, it's under what we could build it for, so under restoration costs. And so it's a challenge getting those units in that regard. So with that said, there is a hope that in the next year or two, there'll be a sort of convergence of sellers that will have to adjust maybe going-in yields or pricing, if you will, to match what the buyers really want because there is sort of a – there is this big bid ask spread and there's a massive wall of capital out there that needs to be placed, and the sellers need to recharge their own balance sheet so they can continue to develop.
Alexander Jessett: On the second part of your question, which was kind of the – is there a migration of capital flows from the – to Sun Belt markets from other lower cap rate markets, and the others, there are some pretty decent indications recently that some of the big players that have historically wanted to play only in the gateway cities and the coastal markets are migrating into the Sun Belt for all the reasons that we like our footprint where it is right now. The job growth, it continues to outperform the rest of the U.S. in our markets, and cost of doing business and the regulatory environment is certainly more friendly in most of our states. So I think there is some evidence that that's going on, and it does put additional pressure on cap rates. On the question of kind of IRRs, the flip side of the cap rates that we're chasing is that as you underwrite an IRR, you got to be realistic about what an exit cap rate is. And if you're looking at acquisition cap rates at $3.75, whereas before we would have been hard pressed to even think about a $4.25 exit cap rate, but that's the price of poker. And so when you do the underwriting with what we think are realistic exit cap rates based on the current environment, your IRR is not that far off of where it would have been a year ago. The challenge, as Ric pointed out, is if you're starting from a $3.75, it almost doesn't matter what your math is on the exit cap rate. First of all, we're going to hold these assets when we buy them for probably 20 years. Secondly, to get from $3.75 to have sort of a run rate that's above our weighted average cost to capital just seems like forever. So we're reluctant in the same way that you think about lenders who at some point in time quit lending it over a spread and say, it's the floor. I don't really care what the spread is. I'm not willing to lend money below X. In our world, we're just not willing to invest money below X.
Alexander Goldfarb: It's certainly amazing to talk about $3.75 in Sun Belt market. I'm sure you've never met those together. The second question is for Alex on the property tax. You said that there's an impact this year of savings, but you also expect another savings next year. So just from a qualitative standpoint, I know you're not giving guidance, but still if we think about next year, how do we gauge the amount of savings that we should anticipate or is that sort of savings already in the third quarter run rate?
Alexander Jessett: Without giving guidance, what we will see is further decreases in tax rates in Texas in 2020 at $0.07 in 2019, it's an additional $0.06 in 2020. And then obviously the offset to that is, we were very successful in 2019 with the amount of refunds that we've gotten in. And so we'll see how our budgets play out for the refunds we anticipate in 2020.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Richard Campo: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Your starts under construction and shadow pipeline continues to remain robust. How are you viewing the development platform given the compressing development yields in this environment? And has the low end of yield expectation range comfortably declined to, let's say, around 5%?
Alexander Jessett: I think the answer is absolutely we are continuing to be in the development business and we like where we sit in that regard. We've generally started between $200 million and $300 million annually and we have a pipeline to continue that process. Yields have definitely come down, returns have come down on development as a result of rising construction costs going up faster than rental rate increases have gone. And our last book of business that we completed, our average return was around 7%. Now our average returns are around 6%. And when you think about the blended rate of the different types of assets that we're building, we're building suburban wood-frame assets that are trending at the higher level and higher returns than the urban concrete higher densities, and those are going to be in the low 5%s. And the stick-built suburban properties are going to be 6% and some change, and so, our blended rates are going to be probably 100 basis points less than we got on our last cycle. On the other hand, when you look at the spread that you're getting for the risk of developing, the spreads has actually stayed the same because cap rates have compressed and people are paying sub 4% cap rates for assets of these kind of qualities or the spread in terms of risk reward that we're getting from developing continues to be robust. We need at least 150 basis point positive spread on a development project versus an acquisition. And we're continuing to get that because of the compression in cap rates and the wall of capital that continues to bid up the existing properties.
Derek Johnston: Got it. Understood. And then just switching to DC just quickly. So DC does contribute an outsized amount of NOI versus other metros in the portfolio. And yet the rest of the portfolio is in the Sun Belt which we of course – will make sense. So how do you see DC fitting into the mix going forward considering you don't really have any ongoing development or communities planned in the pipeline I believe at this point do understand that there is one redevelopment project going on? So how do you view the DC market going forward?
Alexander Jessett: Well, we still think long-term the DC market is – we're about appropriately allocated to the DC Metro. Keep in mind that we have DC proper assets, and then we've got the Northern Virginia and all the way into Maryland. Yes, there's sort of a – there's probably a way that all those markets are affected by it, but they all have their own individual drivers. We just finished two pretty sizable developments in DC. We've finished NoMa last year. Our lease up there in DC Proper. So we continue to be very constructive on DC. It certainly outperformed our expectations this year. We're at 4.1% NOI growth in DC, and relative to our overall portfolio, that's accretive to the average. And that's the first time that's happened in a number of years. So we continue to like that area, we'll continue to invest. And as I said, we just wrapped up about $425 million of new development in the DC Metro area in the last two years. So it continues to be an important part of our portfolio, and I gave it a – DC Metro a letter grade of B with a stable outlook that probably was wrong. It probably was more like a B or B+ stable or maybe B with an improving outlook based on the performance of our portfolio so far.
Derek Johnston: Thank you.
Operator: We will move on to the next questioner, which is Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Alex, you referenced in your prepared remarks numerous initiatives that you are working on to improve revenue and expenses. Can you expound on that, and do you expect it to be more of a contributor, I guess, to revenue growth in the $50 million of revenue enhancing CapEx that you guys have completed this year?
Alexander Jessett: Are you talking about the technology initiatives that we're working on?
Austin Wurschmidt: These technology initiatives or I guess other items that will contribute to topline growth.
Alexander Jessett: Yes. We're always looking for new areas of enhanced service where we can drive value to our residents. And certainly, one of the areas that we've spent a lot of time exploring in the last year is creating opportunities for parking options for our residents, where people might be willing to pay for reserved parking for an additional space, etcetera. So that's an area that probably has gotten more focus of our attention in the last 12 months. In terms of technology, there are a number of things that we're looking at. I mentioned that we already rolled out the mobile maintenance, which has been a real game changer for us. The other thing that we're working on right now is a smart lock solution, and we have a proprietary product that we're piloting right now. There are a number of “smart lock solutions” out there, but the economics of them just don't work for the multifamily industry. The game changer will be when someone comes up and we hope that we will be that entity comes up with a solution that is cost effective for the multifamily business as opposed to the high-end condo business, and we are pretty well down the trail on a proprietary solution that we're piloting in Houston right now. We're already rolling out the perimeter access piece of it. And in the first quarter, next year, we'll be rolling out the smart lock component. So, we just – always keep your head up and keep looking and be aware of any opportunities that we have to better serve our residents.
Austin Wurschmidt: Can you give us a sense of what the spend is on that and what the returns are you expect from those items?
Alexander Jessett: We don't have that nailed down yet because since it's a proprietary product it's something that at a point in time. We'll make available to anybody else who wants a smart lock solution with economics that work in the multifamily business but we haven't nail that down yet.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. And then just last question for me to the extent you're successfully close on the $100 million to $200 million of deals, you referenced in the acquisition pipeline and you kind of utilize that available cash on the balance sheet as future opportunities arise. I guess what's your willingness to utilize the ATM versus an overnight?
Alexander Jessett: Well, the balance between ATM and overnight is interestingly enough, it's about the same in terms of cost to the company and obviously it's more efficient and quicker to do overnight versus ATM, because you can only sell a limited amount of volume each day. But really the determining factor for our capital allocation is really trying to match fund, the investments that we're making, and so we'll use the most efficient platform to do that and use the combination of debt and equity as we have in the past.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. Thanks for the thoughts.
Operator: Our next question will come from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Alex on for Drew. First off, looking at McGowen Station, curious how aggressive you guys have to get on concessions there to get it fully leased? And then also, was that yield coming a little lower than you initially expected? Have you reevaluated your underwriting expectations for the Downtown development right down the road?
Richard Campo: So, on the first question, McGowen Station. McGowen Station market kind of range depending upon what time of year and what was going on anywhere from a month free to two months free, sometimes two-and-a-half. When you look at the Downtown, Midtown and Greenway markets, that – and Houston, that's probably where the most – the highest percentage of properties are at very high end. So it's definitely been a slugfest there from that perspective. Now that we're stabilized, we're feeling pretty good about McGowen Station. It's definitely a lower yield than originally projected. The Downtown project, we are definitely going to open up and do the same concessionary market. The good news is, there's not a lot of new properties opening their doors in Downtown. But the Midtown and the Greenway does have an effect on that. So we expect that to be a concessionary market for at least the next 12 to 18 months, but we're confident that – that Downtown continues to be a very positive place for people to live. In the last five years, you've gone from 4,000 people living in Downtown to 10,000 people living in Downtown. And there's been about $3 billion worth of investments to improve walk ability, and parks, and transit, and what have you. So, we think long-term, and even in the near-term, Downtown will continue be a great place for people to an alternative for people to live. You've seen much more densification in Houston. And the folks that are living in Downtown are sort of surprising me, because they're tending to be an older demographic rather than a younger demographic, primarily because of the price point that the downtown buildings are offering, but we feel good about it. We will open and do concessionary market there for sure. And we are taking some of the units out of the Downtown market, Downtown building, by doing a Why Hotel, and we'll have 100 units out of the building that will be a hotel, which will be an interesting test because, on the one hand, we'll have cash flow generating from the hotel. They tend to get occupied very quickly. And that cash flow will offset what we would otherwise have in vacant units. And we'll be able then to sort of lease up a smaller property as opposed to the whole property, and then we'll be able to sort of close down the Why Hotel over a period of time while we continue to lease up.
Unidentified Analyst: That's a very helpful color. And then, lastly, looking at LA and Orange County, how does that revenue growth result come in relative to your initial expectations year-to-date? Curious if supply has been the motivating factor that looks like you guys have been pushing occupancy over rates. So just curious what you've seen in that market.
Keith Oden: Yes. So we had, at the beginning of the year, rated LA as an A-minus and improving in Orange County, A-minus improving. So we were very constructive on LA. Orange County at the beginning of the year, just sort of based on the way our portfolio is positioned. We've got a pretty different footprint than a lot of our other public company brethren do in California, its all Southern California. And even within Southern California, it's not concentrated in LA. So, I think it's performed in line with our expectations. Obviously they've had a real – a moderate increase in new apartments in LA and Orange County. We had roughly 3,500 apartments in Orange County, total of about 13,000 in all of Greater LA. So, those numbers look like they're trending down next year in both markets. Decent job growth continues – we continue to see in LA and Orange County. So, I don't – I know that there has been a little bit of disparity between our results, a little bit better than some of our competitors. But it certainly wasn't unanticipated for us that we would have a good constructive year in both of those markets at the beginning of 2019.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question will come from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Going back to that supply forecast for this year versus next year, does that take into account delays in construction time for next year?
Richard Campo: I would say, yes, because our data providers tell us that they are doing a lot of work around trying to get refined in terms of delivery dates and do it kind of monthly as opposed to looking at quarterly or even like just looking at aggregate numbers. Having said that, for the last three years, every all three years, I would say both data providers have underestimated the amount of slippage. So I can't imagine – maybe they got ahead of it for 2020, and we're really going to go from 137,000 to 151,000. I'm just calling me as skeptical based on the last four years of estimates versus what actually materialized. So I hope that there's a little bit better refinement in that data, but I guess I'll believe it when I see it.
Wes Golladay: Got it. And then, looking at the balance sheet, I mean, it looks really good there. The one thing that does stand out is, you do have some 5% coupon debt maturing in, it looks like, 2023. How soon can you get after that piece of debt?
Alexander Jessett: Well, the 2023 maturity definitely is when we'd like to take out. The challenge we have is the prepayment penalties are very expensive. The closer you get to it, the lower it goes obviously. And as we took the $12 million charge for the early extinguishment of those bonds that we replaced with a 30-year bond, we'll look at those opportunities. We sort of look at the $12 million charge, as we've had a breakeven analysis that basically told us that if the rate went up 18 basis points or spreads GAAP to 18 basis points we – between the time that we issued in October versus the maturity of these bonds. And it's sort of like buying insurance on 18 basis points, which is what we did. And when we look at – that cost today would be a bigger spread and a higher – much more expensive insurance policy. And when you get down to 10 basis points or 15 basis points, when you think about how spreads move and how the treasuries move, that's a rational insurance policy to buy. But today, the much more expensive, and that's why we wouldn't take that out today. But as we get closer, looking at what happens to rates and spreads, we could make that decision in the future.
Wes Golladay: Great. Thank you, I'd say.
Alexander Jessett: I was going to say, absolutely, we look at this all the time and we're running math on it probably weekly. Right now, the prepayment penalty on that would be about $20 million, so as compared to the $12 million that we just incurred. So we are looking at it on an ongoing basis.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys
Operator: Our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Zachary Silverberg: Hi, guys. This is Zachary Silverberg with Haendel. Just a few questions from the cost side. Can you talk about some of the big moves in same-store expenses and some of the core markets that you saw in 3Q, specifically in Atlanta or the big jumps in Charlotte and Southeast Florida?
Alexander Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So, when you look at Atlanta, we got some very large property tax refunds in the third quarter. I'll tell you. Those were in fact in our plan. So there was really not a surprise there for us. If you look at Charlotte, keep in mind that Charlotte really had very high property taxes. We talked about that in the beginning of the year. If you remember that Charlotte actually does a reval every eight years, and this happened to be in the reval year, so as a matter of fact, our total Charlotte property tax growth for 2019 is right around 35%, and if you're looking at that Southeast Florida that's also property tax driven. So really they're all they're all property tax driven and it depends upon the timing of either when refunds come in or as I said with Charlotte just the overall increase in that market due to the fact that they reval every eight years.
Zachary Silverberg: Right. Thanks. And you mentioned the benefit from taxes, but do you guys anticipate any other tailwinds or headwinds and reassessment of taxes or anything of that sort in 2020?
Alexander Jessett: Yes. I mean, so the only thing that we're looking at in 2020 is that Raleigh also revals every certain year. So, Raleigh is going to reval in 2020, and that's going to be over four years. Obviously it's a smaller market for us. So it shouldn't be as incremental as what we saw in Charlotte. And then, just to clarify on taxes. When we talked about a $0.07 reduction or a $0.06 reduction in property tax rates in Texas, what we're talking about is not FFO per share. We're talking about as a percentage of the mill rate. So, if you think about it, a standard mill rate in Texas being, call it, $2.22 per 1,000, if you have a $0.07 reduction, what that works out to be is about a 3.5% reduction in Texas due to the rates.
Zachary Silverberg: Thanks for the color.
Alexander Jessett: Absolutely.
Operator: Our next question will come from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Yes. Hey, guys. First question on Houston in general, first, sorry about the World Series.
Richard Campo: Was there a game?
Neil Malkin: Yes. But just given the fact that the market really is so heavily on energy, I know you've talked about medical being a big presence, but it really seems to ebb and flow with how the energy sector is doing, plus the fact that it's very easy to bring on supply quickly. I wonder, do you ever think about maybe paring down your exposure in that market, just given the volatility and sort of one main demand driver of it?
Richard Campo: Well, I think that is a misconception that energy drives Houston fundamentally, because if you look at – let's just talk about middle of 2014, when energy prices were over $100 a barrel and then they went to $20 million and some change by 2015. Energy industry lost 80,000 jobs in Houston. And at that time, the Houston produced another 80,000 jobs in the petrochemical business, the medical business and other ancillary businesses. So, Houston had basically a flat job growth for a couple of years as a result of that, and then the market responded by starts dropping from – the good news about the ability to add supply is, you can cut the supply as fast as you can add the supply. So we cut the supply pretty dramatically, and the market didn't have a major dislocation like it had maybe in the 1980s. So, Houston is a much more diversified economy than it was in the past. And part of the – and when you think about just the price of oil, what happens there is that relates to drilling and activity from that perspective. But the petrochemical part of the sort of downstream energy business is actually doing really well. A third of all gasoline, for example, is manufactured in the Houston Ship Channel. 60% of airline fuel is manufactured there. So, there's a lot, and a lot of primary chemicals are continuing to do really well as long as – and those are more driven not by energy prices but by economic activity. So, if you have a – clearly a recession on the horizon, then that's one of the reasons Houston is less – sort of less bulletproof from a recession. If you go back into the '80s when the US had a recession, Houston never felt it because it was so energy-dependent mostly on the upstream side. With that said, we definitely look at our allocations of our real estate, and we want to make sure that we're balanced. Houston represents about 11% of our portfolio today. It's been a great long-term market for us, but we definitely look at where we're buying and where we're selling. And you haven't – you don't see a new development in Houston other than in our joint venture right now. But that doesn't necessarily mean the opportunity isn't here because to me, I think, one of the misconceptions of Houston, a lot of people made a lot of money in our stock when we underperformed in the market in 2014 by 2,000 basis points and – because they sort of threw the stock out the window because of the energy situation even though we didn't perform from a cash flow perspective that badly here. So, we're going to make investments here and we're going to stay in Houston. We'll toggle it here and there, but we have never considered like leaving this market or anything like that, maybe slowing the growth or perhaps carrying back some of the assets that are maybe needing more CapEx, but beyond that, we're long-term players here.
Keith Oden: And, Neil, thank you for your condolences to our Houston Astros. But like I told everybody in Camden, DC is our largest market, Houston is our second largest market. Before they ever played a game, Camden was a winner, and one of the teams is going to end up – one of the teams is going to end up with the trophy.
Neil Malkin: Good way to look at it. Okay. Last one from me. A lot of companies have been talking about tech and integration and how that feeds into various platforms on both revenue and expense management sides. You're obviously not spending – doing the smart home route, but I'm just curious how you're thinking about using technology to proactively help with things like CapEx. Anything along those lines you're doing that could either be on the revenue or expense side that you're kind of leveraging big data or the Internet of Things, I guess, to sort of enhance your platform with?
Richard Campo: Well, I would – first of all, dispute that we're not doing smart homes, because we are – we're doing the smart homes that people want. People, for example do not want systems that turn their lights on or not. They definitely want smart thermostats and things like that and access. We do a lot of focus groups and spend a lot of time trying to understand what our customers want and what they are willing to pay for. And so on that side of the equation, we're pushing the edge of the envelope to create value for customers and drive revenue for us. On the big data, we have just completed and are in the process of putting additional nodules on our modules on this system, but we just completed an Oracle Cloud-based system where our financial reporting and HR is now going to be in the cloud. And that is going – that is all about big data, it's all about having access to all of our data via smartphones, and then being able to drive expenses lowering CapEx. I think the Internet of Things is a real thing. And so, ultimately when you have your data all in the same place, and it's communicating across platforms in the cloud, we'll be able to leverage smart devices in our air conditioning units and in our maintenance facilities so that we can, instead of fixing a broken one, we can – that inconvenience as a tenant or a resident, we can actually do preventive maintenance, which would save us money over the long-term. So I think, that was a big investment and a massive amount of time and effort. It's nearly a two-year project, and everyone in our Company was involved in it. The teams did a great job even though it was – definitely those kind of big ticket projects are very painful because you're doing your regular job, plus trying to implement a new system, and our teams did a great job managing what is a tough thing, and ultimately our big data and our ability to analyze and understand how things are working is definitely going to be enhanced dramatically as a result of that project.
Neil Malkin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Just one quick one for me. Keith, I was hoping you could compare 2019 operating backdrop versus 2018 as it relates to urban versus suburban properties, and what you're seeing on the rent growth side, or are suburban properties coming down to earth versus urban, or are they still pulling ahead? Any comments there would be great.
Keith Oden: Yes, John. Pretty consistently this year our urban product has outperformed or the suburban product has outperformed by about 50 basis points. It's primarily the result of where the last cycle of product got built. And it was overwhelmingly, the merchant build community was definitely had a bias toward urban assets. That's where the buyers of that product wanted to – that's where the demand was for their product on an exit basis. So, yes, that we continue to see that, it hasn't changed. It's one of the things in our Houston portfolio that's actually helped us pretty dramatically and our suburban assets have held up really nicely. And the real supply challenges, as Ric mentioned, have been in the Midtown, Downtown and Greenway Plaza area. So – but absolutely it is a trend, it's continued. My guess is, is that as they always do the focus – because there's so much competition in the urban core areas that you're probably going to see a drift back toward the suburban assets by the merchant community, and we'll deal with that when we have to.
Alexander Jessett: Yes. And just to be clear, I was talking portfolio wide, so that comment holds in the supply related markets of Dallas, Charlotte and other markets as well.
Richard Campo: Yes, that's across – the 50 basis points is across Camden's entire portfolio.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And has a similar margin this time last year?
Richard Campo: Yes, it was.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just coming back from just the company level stuff, can you guys talk a little bit about the challenge of allocating capital today and some of your peers are really going out there issuing equity and expanding the size of the company. You guys have been more prudent. How do you see this play out longer-term, five, 10 years, this wall of capital issue? What could change? How could this wall of capital shift elsewhere? And what is it about the narrative that you think will keep it there or move it?
Alexander Jessett: Well, I think the narrative will change when there is – when we have a recession, right and when we have the next cycle. The question about what happens, and generally what happens in a business contraction is that people lose jobs, demand is reduced as a result of that situation. And then what happens is you have landlords, especially new developments that are in lease ups that have to discount dramatically to buy market share. That generally has an effect on pricing, and you're able – cap rates rise and prices sort of go down. The thing that's kind of – and I guess on the recession side, last year at this time when the market was going down and everybody was talking about recession and the Fed was rising. Now we're in a – on accommodative easing cycle. We don't you know sort of bet on recessions or major upticks. We're trying to keep, be in a position where we sort of plan for the worst and hope for the best. That's why where our balance sheet is where it is today because you don't know what's going to happen in the future. I guess, the real interesting part of multifamily, and I think the reason multifamily is one of the top real estate classes, multifamily and industrial have the hot hands, and that's where investment capital wants to go. In the multifamily space, that's because people need a place to live. And when you look at the demographics, and you look at the sort of where people live and how they operate today, especially the millennials, they are doing everything later in life, they're buying houses later in life, having kids later in life, they don't want – they want the optionality of an apartment. So apartments are really good. And then, if you think about, well, if interest rates go up because of inflation, apartment leases rollover on average of 8% every month, then we're repricing our asset every day. So you have a good backdrop for inflation. So that's why capital is coming this way. We are expanding our business as well, when you look at the development pipeline, plus the acquisitions, $400 million or $500 million a year of additional capital that gets put out. Now if we could – if we're very – ultimately we're at the beginning of a cycle. If this is 2012 or 2013, we might be more aggressive on all those fronts, but because we're late in the cycle and there's a lot of uncertainty out there, we're going to be more prudent.
Hardik Goel: Got it. Just a quick follow-up on that. You mentioned cap rates of 3.75%. You may be have an exit of 4%, 4.5%. Is it conceivable that in a recessionary scenario, not for you guys because you guys have a strong balance sheet, but for private operators that are underwriting like that, is it possible that they see they significantly underperform the underwritten returns because cap rates cap out more because they're starting from such a historically low base.
Alexander Jessett: Well, that's definitely the risk, right? I mean, because if you're wanting a 6% IRR and you start at 3.75% and you then have a growth expectation of the cash flow and an exit cap rate, I mean, if cap rates gap 100 basis points, you need a 25% increase in revenue or NOI to be able to offset that kind of increase in cap rate in order to make a return. So I think that if you're in a – that's the inherent risk of buying a cap rate at that level today. It's worked out for lots of folks, because the rents have grown and cap rates have continued to stay very low, but ultimately, people might be disappointed in their returns if you have a scenario where cap rates gap and rents don't grow as much. I think the issue of whether somebody gets in trouble financially, I think that's probably a low risk because you just have – there's a lot of equity in the system. Even in the development game, the merchant builders are all 30% to 40% equity today because of just the way banking – the bank system is requiring the equity. So I don't think there's a lot of – there will be a lot of financial stress in terms of people having to sell. But on the other hand, there are expectation of their pricing and their margins, their profit margins, which have been amazingly high and sticky for a long time. It will probably revert to more normal levels or less than they originally anticipated.
Hardik Goel: Thank you. That's great color.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Guinee: Thank you. John Guinee here. Two curiosity questions, looks like San Diego is about $720,000 a unit for a pretty small project, 130-odd units. Can you talk about what you're building there and why it hits that price? And then second, if I look at your redevelopment summary, is it okay, to just project out maybe 1,000 units a year, get this kind of major overhaul, and people should think about that as an ongoing CapEx?
Alexander Jessett: So, on San Diego, the short answer is, it's the price of poker for an A plus location that's adjacent to the Hillcrest neighborhood, where single family homes, little bungalows sell for $1.5 million, $2 million. You're mile-and-a-half from Balboa Park. You're two miles from Downtown. And I don't – I'm generally not a believer in using the word unique for real estate, but this is a really unique site. It's literally up on top of a block with a view of Mission Bay. It's almost required that we build that scale and scope of project. And again, you're talking about comparable rents in that neighborhood that are pushing $3.80 to $4 a square foot. So, the returns work because people are willing to pay a premium to be in that neighborhood. They're a relatively small unit footprint. But yes, it's expensive to build in California for sure. On the 1,000 units annually, I think that is a rationale thought process. We haven't moved through our portfolio, but we will continue to make that investment. It's the best investment on the board that we can make as redeveloping our existing properties.
John Guinee: So, what do you think you decide to redevelop one property a year?
Richard Campo: Yes. I think you have to split it into two categories, so repositions which is separate than redevelopment. In repositions, we're doing about 2,300 units a year and I think that's probably a pretty safe number to continue. When you look at the redevelopments, there's four communities. They're all unique in that they're all high-rises and they are communities where there was extensive exterior renovations that were necessary. I would tell you that that particular pool is a little bit shallower than the pool of repositions. So, we'll keep looking for redevelopments. I wouldn't expect to see a huge amount of these on an ongoing basis. But as I said, we'll continue to add the repositions, think about 2,300, 2,500 plus or minus a year.
John Guinee: And that's more of a $10,000 to $12,000 price tag?
Richard Campo: It started that way. It's getting to creeping it up a little bit more closer to the, call it, $15,000 to $20,000 price range just for obvious reasons. But we're still getting the fantastic returns on those repositions.
John Guinee: Great. Thank you.
Richard Campo: You're welcome.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard Campo: Well, thanks for being on the call today and we will see a lot of you at NAREIT coming up. So, thanks a lot.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-26 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete Second Quarter 2019 Earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, Executive Vice Chairman; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will be brief in our prepared remarks and try to complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn it over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks Kim, and good morning. Our on-hold music today was courtesy of Dire Straits, and although our cost of capital has decreased over the years, we still don't get our money for nothing. However, our unique culture allows our associates to experience that ain't work, and that's the way you do it. Thanks to our Camden team members for improving the lives of our employees, our customers, and our stake holders one experience at a time. Our multifamily business continues to be strong, market fundamentals remain good as supply gets absorbed in all of our markets. During the first half of 2019, we completed over $1 billion of debt and equity transactions designed to strengthen our balance sheet and give us maximum financial flexibility in this part of the real estate cycle. We accomplished these fundings and have been able to increase FFO guidance, in spite of having more cash earning lower rates than we originally anticipated. FFO growth per share for the quarter and the year increased 7.6% and 6.8%, respectively. We added to our development pipeline and completed the acquisition of Camden Rainey Street in Austin in the quarter. We are on track to meet or exceed our original acquisition targets of $300 million for 2019, in spite of a very difficult acquisition environment. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Malcolm Stewart on his promotion to President of Camden. Malcolm will continue in his role as Chief Operating Officer. Keith will continue his responsibilities as Executive Vice Chairman. These moves are part of our long-term succession planning initiative, creates position space for other senior executives in the future. I will now turn the call over to our new Executive Vice President, Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Regarding my new title, I'd like to address the biggest concern that's been expressed so far. Yes, I will continue to co-host Camden's annual Happy Hour at the summer NAREIT meeting. Now back to business. Our second quarter revenue results were in line with our increased guidance, which sets us up for continued strong results for the balance of the year. Overall, same-store revenues were up 3.4% for the quarter and up 1.5% sequentially. Second quarter growth in our top four markets were Phoenix at 5.7%, Denver 5.1%, LA-Orange County 4.8% up, and Atlanta at 4.6%, up. As expected, our weakest markets for the quarter were South Florida, Charlotte, and Houston with revenue growth in the 1% to 2% range. Regarding rents on new leases and renewals, second quarter new leases were up 4.1% and renewals were up 5.6%, for a blended increase of 4.9%. The second quarter 2019 blended rate of 4.9% was a 30-basis point improvement from the second quarter last year of 4.6%. July preliminaries are at 4.1% increase on new leases, 5.3% on renewals, for a blended growth rate of 4.7%. As expected, we've seen steady improvement in our new lease rates from January through June, and as is normal, the new lease pricing will begin to taper off as we approach the end of our spring-summer peak leasing season. Our August and September renewal offers continue to reflect a healthy rental environment and are being sent out at an average increase of 5.7%. Our qualified traffic remains strong and supportive of our above trend occupancy levels across all of our markets. We averaged a strong 96.1% occupancy in the second quarter versus 95.8% occupancy in the first quarter of 2019, and 95.7% in the second quarter of last year. July occupancy is trending to 96.3% versus 96% last year. Our turnover rates continue to run at historically low rates with the net turnover in the second quarter at 46% versus 49% last year. During the quarter, our move-outs to home purchase remain low at 14.3% versus 14% in the first quarter, with both quarters well below the 14.8% for the full year of 2018. It appears that the rising price of starter homes will continue to put a damper on home ownership. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the second quarter of 2019, we purchased for $120 million Camden Rainey Street, a newly constructed, 326-unit, 8-story building located in downtown Austin. We began construction on Camden Cypress Creek II, a 234-unit joint venture in Houston, Texas, and we stabilized ahead of schedule our Camden Washingtonian development in Gaithersburg, Maryland, generating a 6.5% stabilized yield. We also purchased approximately four acres of land in the NoDa neighbourhood of Charlotte for the future development of approximately 400 apartment homes, and purchased approximately 12 acres of land in Tempe, Arizona, also for the future development of approximately 400 apartment homes. On the financing side, in mid-June we completed a $600 million dollar 10-year senior unsecured bond offering with an effective average interest rate of approximately 3.67% after giving effect to the settlement of in-place interest rate swaps and deducting the underwriter's discounts and other estimated expenses of the offering. As a result of these in-place interest rate swaps, we will recognize interest expense at 3.84% for the first 7 years of the note, and will recognize interest expense at 3.28% thereafter. Turning to financial results. Last night we reported funds from operations for the second quarter of 2019 of $128.6 million, or $1.28 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.02. Our $0.02 per share outperformance for the second quarter resulted primarily from approximately $0.01 in higher same-store net operating income resulting from lower levels of self-insured employee healthcare costs, lower property taxes, and lower other property expenses that resulted from general cost-control measures, approximately $0.5 in better than anticipated results from our non-same-store and development communities, and approximately $0.5 in a combination of lower overhead expenses and higher fee and joint venture income. Last night, based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we also updated and revised our 2019 full-year same-store guidance. Because of our better-than-expected second quarter same-store expense performance, and our anticipation of lower property taxes in the back half of the year, we decreased the midpoint of our full-year expense growth from 3.35% to 2.75%. These anticipated property tax savings in the back half of the year are primarily being driven by Atlanta and Houston, where we have both received favourable current year tax valuations and had success with prior year appeals. As a result, we are now anticipating full year property taxes for our same-store portfolio to increase it just under 3%, approximately 100 basis points inside of our original budget. The result of this decreased expense guidance is a 35 basis point increase to the midpoint of our 2019 same-store NOI guidance, from 3.4% to 3.75%. Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2019 FFO guidance by $0.02 per share, from $5.07 to $5.09. This $0.02 per share increase results from our anticipated 35 basis point, or $0.02 increase in 2019 same-store operating results -- $0.01 of this increase incurred in the second quarter, with the remainder anticipated over the third and fourth quarters, and an approximate $0.01 from our second quarter outperformance not associated with same-store results. This $0.03 aggregate increase in FFO is partially offset by the approximately $0.01 combined impact of our $200 million larger than anticipated June bond issuance and the timing of various real-estate transactions. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2019. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.26 to $1.30. The midpoint of $1.28 is in line with our second quarter results. As expected, sequential increases in revenue are offset by the typical seasonality of our operating expenses and the incremental contribution from our development and acquisition communities are offset by additional interest expense resulting from our June bond offering. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt to EBITDA at 3.9 times, and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 6.4 times. We ended the quarter with no balances outstanding on our $900 million unsecured line of credit, and $150 million of cash on hand. 98% of our debt is unsecured, and 99% of our assets are unencumbered. We have $577 million of on-balance sheet developments currently under construction, with $311 million remaining to fund over the next 2.5 years. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Just looking at your weighted average monthly revenue per occupied home, it looks like it's about 40 basis points below the rental rate growth. I'm wondering, what's the drag from other revenue that's causing that? And then how do you expect that to trend for the remainder of the year?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely, because we have higher occupancy, and because we're having lower turnover, what we're starting to see is the incremental impact from damage and cleaning fees and bad debt is coming down on a year-over-year basis. That's the impact of what you get when people just aren't moving out.
Nick Joseph: Would you expect that, kind of that spread between the two to continue for the rest of the year? Are you expecting turnover to pick up?
Alex Jessett: At this point, we're anticipating that although we're having exceptionally low levels of turnover, we think generally it's going to stay fairly low for the rest of the year.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on the land purchases, you bought more in the quarter, what are you seeing in terms of pricing there? And maybe tie it to what you saw earlier in the cycle for land pricing.
Ric Campo: Land prices definitely have increased, along with everything else with costs and what have you. And so while land prices have increased, the idea that land price -- that construction costs, along with land prices, have driven yields to the point where it's not -- some of the projects aren't making sense. So, I think sellers are adjusting and making sure that they can sell at some level. So, I don't think that land prices are continuing to rise as fast as they were given the difficulty of underwriting today, in today's environment.
Keith Oden: And also, Nick, just to add to that, the Phoenix site that we bought is something that we've been working on for the last several years. So that's reflective of pricing that was two or three years ago. And the site in Charlotte is an emerging market for sure, and we have had great success in kind of getting ahead of where the growth is coming. So, we felt like we got a really, an attractive price for that site as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. Can you remind us what percentage of your same-store revenue comes from multifamily rents versus fees retail rents and other income items?
Alex Jessett: I would say it's probably pretty close to about 95%, but we'll have to get back to you on that.
John Kim: Okay. And Alex, and the answer to the prior question, so the lower other income, is that all turnover-related fees or were there, was there an impact on like technology [Speech Overlap]?
Alex Jessett: Yes, the largest component of it, as I said, is turnover related. So it's, if you think about damage fees, cleaning fees, and bad debt. Now there is a slight component that's associated with the tech package because obviously we finished rolling out the tech package last year, and so we're not really getting that much of an incremental impact in 2019. But that's a slight component of it.
John Kim: And you don't expect turnover to go up with new lease growth being so strong?
Alex Jessett: I would tell you if you would have asked us this question last year, we expected turnover to go up, and it continues to stay at record low levels.
Ric Campo: Part of it is this whole idea that when you think about in-migration to different markets and about the way people move around in the country today. They just don't move as much. And that's been a trend for the last two or three years, and a lot of it has to do with the unemployment rate being so low everywhere. So people sort of think they don't have to move to another hot city to get a better job because their job, the jobs in the cities they're in are doing well, given the low unemployment rates. So you started to see migration rates slow and a lot of different markets, and that just keeps people kind of in their apartments longer because they're not moving around.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Leigh Wu] of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, good morning and thanks for taking the question. So could you guys talk about some of the markets that you've seen outperformance or markets that have lagged your initial expectations? And any extra color on what's driving that outperformance versus underperformance would be great.
Keith Oden: Leigh, if you were to line up our results halfway through the year with our initial letter grades that with it, we issue at the beginning of each year with our guidance, I would tell you that there is not, there is not a single one that I would change other than maybe a plus to a minus here and there. So we're really tracking about as we expected we would across our entire platform. I mean, in the second quarter, obviously, we do a reforecast from our original for our regional guidance. We do a reforecast every quarter. On our -- on $250 million worth of revenue forecasted for the second quarter, we were within $100,000. So pluses and minuses here and there, but nothing that would even be worth calling out to your question. The markets that we expected to be at the top of the charts are there and then obviously the weaker markets -- the Houston, Charlotte, and South Florida -- are the most impacted by new supply relative to job growth and that's, again, that's pretty predictable, and was predicted.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, so could you guys maybe talk about maybe the Houston market a little bit more? And also your development in lease-up, your McGowen Station, how that's been doing versus initial expectations.
Keith Oden: Yes. So, Houston is, again we, at the beginning of the year we projected it to be one of our weaker markets and primarily because just the geography of the competitive set, and the units that have gotten, that were delivered in 2018, they are still in the process trying to get absorbed. There were so many apartments that were delivered in the midtown and downtown area that all of the new developments, and as well as existing assets have suffered by the competitive nature of merchant builders trying to get to the finish line. The challenge has been that the merchant builders are not getting to the finish line. Most of them thought their downtown and midtown assets would be -- would have been stabilized by the end of 2018 and it just hasn't happened. There is a -- so one of the things, even though Houston created almost 80,000 jobs, or is on track to create 80,000 jobs this year, the nature of those jobs is a little bit of a mismatch with the high-end product that got built in midtown and downtown. The jobs that have been created, by and large, are hospitality, retail, construction to a certain extent, but the sector that has not participated in job growth is the energy sector. So all of the large integrated oil companies, which are still primarily the preponderance, are located in the downtown area for their office space, they're just not on a hiring mood and it remains to be seen when that's going to happen. You don't have to go back to really a little over three years ago. The energy companies were just finishing their downsizing, and the recency effect of having to lay people off and then fast forward three years later, there is a great deal of reluctance to start increasing head counts. So I think the energy companies are kind of doing more with less, and at some point that will reach a breaking point and they'll start hiring again. But in the meantime, the jobs that are being created even though they, it looks good in terms of aggregate numbers. They're not jobs it necessarily support the kind of rents that you need to live in the midtown and downtown area.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trent Trujillo of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Trent Trujillo: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to go back to revenue. So the operational update you provided earlier this quarter at NAREIT that was showing a blended rate growth of 4, 7 through May, and there some overtures that it could accelerate further in June based on historical trends, which would possibly lead to raising same-store guidance. So it sounded like it had picked up. So how much thought did you give to raising same-store revenue guidance, given where first half came in?
Ric Campo: Yes. So, if I -- as I mentioned, we did the reforecast for our second quarter and we ended up almost exactly on top of where our reforecast was, so based on that we have -- we feel like we have really good visibility for third and fourth quarter and obviously we've gone through the reforecast for that. So we still feel very comfortable with our guidance that we've reiterated. We did raise revenue guidance last quarter, and we've maintained it for this quarter. And so we're comfortable with where we are in terms of where we think the end of the year will shake out in a 3.4% total revenue increase.
Trent Trujillo: Okay, that's helpful. And then shifting, I guess going back to acquisitions. You've alluded to achieving or even exceeding the high end of your range. Could you give some indication as to what's in your pipeline and the confidence that you can put to work all the capital that you have raised so far?
Keith Oden: Sure. We have -- the last chart I looked at had like 14 properties that were in excess of $1 billion that we had in various states stages of due diligence, in terms of whether we were going to going to try to be the ultimate winner. The interesting thing about acquisition guidance is you can always hit your guidance if you're just the highest bidder. And we try to be as disciplined as possible in this very, very aggressive acquisition environment. And so I think we have better confidence today in that, in that the properties that we're looking at now are -- we think there are several that are in the sort sweet spot of what we're looking for. What we're looking for is newer properties that haven't stabilized or have management issues and we think there are going to be some opportunities for us to to at least meet our guidance, and hopefully exceed it.
Trent Trujillo: Okay, and one -- sorry. One quick follow-up, maybe for modeling purposes, on recurring CapEx, you spent about $31 million year-to-date and I realize, fully realize, that this spending can be lumpy. But are you still comfortable with the original guidance of $68 to $72 million for the year?
Alex Jessett: Yes, we're still comfortable with that.
Trent Trujillo: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Santos of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Daniel Santos: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick ones from me. The first one is on the management shuffle, should we expect any G&A impacts from any internal promotions? And then other than maybe who is going to host NAREIT Happy Hour, are there any changes in role responsibilities?
Ric Campo: The answer is no to both.
Keith Oden: Unfortunately, the answer is no, especially NAREIT.
Daniel Santos: Fair enough, fair enough. And then second, are there any sub-markets where you're starting to get maybe a little nervous about supply that's coming down the pike, that's making you maybe consider your -- reconsider your exposure in the future?
Ric Campo: No. The thing I think that's been a very interesting and positive about this cycle, is that, this real estate cycle, is that, is that all markets have been able to absorb their supply even in the supplies that are at peak levels. We think next year we start seeing some moderation in the peak at some, in some markets. But the good news is we've had enough job growth and had enough, enough stickiness of the existing customer base, is that the fact that we have lower turnover means we don't have to find as many new residents. And so that, in combination with a decent job growth market and great situations in each city, you've been able to absorb the supply without having a major negative impact. Now clearly markets like Charlotte and Southeast Florida -- maybe Charlotte is a great example where you've had a lot of supply, but you've had great job growth to back it up. And while it's moderated, it's put a damper on big rent increases for existing properties. You're still positive, maybe 1% or 2%, and in light of how much supply is coming on, I think that's a very good backdrop. So ultimately the real question for us, longer term, is where are we in the cycle? And then when you look at projections out further, the question of with an unemployment rate in the threes, and how do you get -- where do you find the people to add the jobs? There's jobs available and the economy is doing well, but there is a lot of concern about job growth, the ability of job growth slowing as a result of the inability of people to find people to actually take those jobs. Heretofore we've had, at least the last year, there has been people coming out of the -- back into the workforce, and what have you, to fill those jobs. But generally supply is, it's been really good and well-absorbed.
Daniel Santos: Awesome, that's it for me. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. So I want to go back to last quarter's call. As we were discussing new lease rates and the expectation that new lease rates wouldn't push much higher than the 2.8% you achieved in April, but in fact you did see significant improvement in May, and June also seemed strong. So I guess I'm also curious what may have offset the benefit from the higher new lease rates, as it seems like renewals are pretty much in line with expectation, and that you're tracking above the 3% to 3.5% blended lease rates that I believe you assumed in your initial outlook.
Keith Oden: Yes. So we're, our guidance assumes total revenue growth of growth of 3.4%. We were 3.7% in the first quarter. So clearly we -- and when we do our reforecast and looking out. It's just the fact is that some of our markets, in particular Houston, Charlotte, a little bit of, a little bit in South Florida, and also beginning to see signs in Austin that just the constant backdrop of too many apartments being delivered in markets and sub-markets where we're competitive with that new supply, is at some point it takes a toll. And obviously I think you're seeing some of that in those, in those four markets, and we expect that to continue throughout the balance of 2019. Now the good news is we still have markets that are doing 5% plus on blended growth rates, and those are going to continue to help. But clearly when you're modeling, you're 3.7 in the first quarter you we maintain guidance it raised it to 3.4, but maintained at 3.4. The math is pretty simple that you're going to see some deceleration and in blended average rental rates through our total revenues through the third and fourth quarter. And that's what we expect. But, and we think it's moderate in terms of the deceleration that we could see in the third and fourth quarter. And if we get to the end of this year and we have another print of 3.4% total revenue growth on top of what we had in the last couple of years, we will probably all shake our heads and say job well done.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. I appreciate the thoughts there. And that kind of leads a little bit into my next question. You gave a little bit of a glimpse into 2020 supply and as well as how '18 and '19 were shaken out, but as we sit here today, I am curious -- how '19 playing out heretofore, versus your expectation? And are you just assuming what wasn't delivered in the first half gets delivered in the second half? And then how was Ron Witten's forecast for '18 from initial projection perspective? And then what ultimately played out in '18?
Keith Oden: Yes. So Witten, which is who we primarily used for completions on, across our platform, right. The actuals for 2018 were about 137,000 deliveries across our platform, which was a little bit less than what we had it at his original -- if you go back 12 months prior he was off by about, about 8,000 apartments. He had a 145,000 plus or minus being delivered in 2018 and the consequence of that, as you just mentioned, that ends up rolling into 2019. 2019 currently he has almost spot on with 2018, at a 137,000 again. So there is movement around in our platform, but the aggregate deliveries across our platform almost identical from actuals of 2018 to what he's projected in 2019. Where it shows up is that now, whereas for two years, we were sort of pointing to, and everyone was pointing to 2019 being in the peak deliveries nationally, and we thought that would play out in Camden's portfolio as well. But based on Witten's new numbers for 2020, which he has going up from 137,000 to 151,000, clearly some of that 6,000 has rolled -- 8,000 from '19 rolled to '19, and another 8,000 or 9,000 from '19 is now rolled to 2020, and it looks like 2020 is going to be the peak. I hope that we're finally reaching the actual peak for deliveries across, across our platform. He's got them coming, starts coming back down in 2021, but not a huge amount. So, I think it's very likely that the rollover from '18 to '19 continued, and will continue throughout 2019. And I hope that we have -- we're going to see the peak deliveries of something around -- somewhere around 150,000 completions in 2020.
Austin Wurschmidt: And what percent of the 137,000 in 2019 is expected to be delivered in the second half of the year or absolute numbers?
Keith Oden: Yes, I don't have that in front of me, but I mean it's -- I'd be surprised if it wasn't pretty equal across our platform where there's not a whole lot of seasonality in how and what we build, with the exception of Denver.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question. Can you actually talk a little bit about the timing of the development starts for the new land purchases in Charlotte in Tempe, and what type of yield ballpark are you currently projecting there?
Ric Campo: Sure, the starts for those units will be toward the end of this year and beginning of next year and the, mostly 2020 starts, when you get down to it. In terms of development yields, the yields were -- our yields in our pipeline are anywhere from 5% roughly on the high-rise urban and about 6.5% on our suburban. And just to give you some color, there's been a lot of discussion about yields, yield compression because of cost increases going up faster than rental rates. In our last book of business, our ranges were 5 to 7.5, and now they're about 5 to 6.5.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay, that's helpful. But maybe you could tell me what type of -- I'm assuming the stabilized yield you're protecting there, so maybe some color on the projected rents and expense increases you're projecting as part of that?
Ric Campo: Yes, you're talking about rent increases in the development?
Haendel St. Juste: Yields, I'm assuming stabilized yields you quoted, just curious what embedded within them.
Ric Campo: Yes. So that, it depends on the market, but generally we're not inflating our rents much more than 2% or 3%, given where we are in the current market. And generally what we do is -- we do two methods of analysis. One is un-trended returns and the other is what we expect the returns to be, and those are the returns I just gave you. And I think the rent increases are, like I said, anywhere between 2% and 3% max, and operating costs, we're inflating them at pretty much at 2% to 3% as well.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. I'm curious about the Charlotte development in particular. Given the relative revenue weakness and the supply commentary you mentioned earlier on that market, I guess I'm curious what about that project specifically gives you the confidence to start that in light of your earlier commentary?
Ric Campo: Well, as Keith said earlier, the noted -- it's Charlotte NoDa, which is a on the rail line and it's basically north of downtown Charlotte. And we're going to start construction on that project and in January of '20. And so it's not going to deliver really effectively until end of '21, or middle of '21, into '22. And the Charlotte market while, while it's having some issues now with absorption, over time it's one of our best markets and we think that fundamentally that this project will, given where it is and on the rail line, that it will absorb into the market the way the other ones are absorbing in the market today, which would be a very positive reasonable yield and another great asset for us in Charlotte.
Haendel St. Juste: That's helpful, thanks. And one last one if I may. I don't know if I missed it earlier, but maybe you could share some color on the initial yield for the Austin acquisition and maybe some of the longer-term operating upside, if there is any there? Thanks.
Ric Campo: So, we were trying to buy our models. Our acquisition program today is to buy assets that are, that are either -- that have not been stabilized from a lease-up perspective and this, and the Austin asset, we would definitely categorize it that. And then at a below replacement cost, somewhere between 10% and 20% below replacement cost, and then having upside to be where we can bring our management team in, bring our technology packages in, and then drive, drive cash flows up. So generally the theme of that is you're going to buy properties that are in the low fours, four-and-a-quarter-ish, kind of, kind of existing cap rates and we're going to try. Within -- we think fundamentally within a couple of years, we'll be able to get it up to a five cap rate in terms of by implementing Camden revenue management systems and technology packages and what have you. That would be the model we're looking for, and that's pretty much where Austin is.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin of Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Question on maintenance CapEx, it ran a little high relative to our estimates, kind of on a per-unit basis in the second quarter, and I guess it's a sign of trends. The same factors influencing development costs, influencing CapEx, and maybe there is kind of a per-unit number that you think is kind of budgeted for this year, if you could remind us what that is?
Keith Oden: Yes. So what I would tell you is it's entirely timing based. So, if you looked at our original guidance, it was $68 million of $72 million, and we anticipate being right in that range. So, what you saw in the second quarter, as compared to your model, is probably just a little bit of a timing issue.
Drew Babin: Okay, that's helpful. And a question on Southeast Florida -- obviously that's the market that maybe the job growth has been as hot as the rest of the sun belt. Obviously there is some supply there. Can you talk about who is adding jobs there and what types of factors might get that market going again? And could a currency fluctuation or something like that possibly maybe bring more activity in? Just based on your experience in the market I was hoping you can maybe give some color there.
Keith Oden: Yes. So I think if you take Witten's numbers for projected job growth in Fort Lauderdale, 12,000 jobs -- or excuse me 27,000 jobs end of this year, and that drops a little bit into 2020. Same thing for Miami -- Miami, Witten has got 2019 jobs at 20,000, going to 14,000 in 2020. Given, the amount of new supply that's been delivered in both Miami and, and Fort Lauderdale, not just in rental apartments, which is what you think of is our direct competitors, but the number of for-sale condos that have been delivered across those two CBD's is just kind of crazy. So it doesn't show up -- it doesn't necessarily show up in the stats on employment growth compared to completions. But it is a really significant factor in both of those markets. Job growth hospitality continues to be construction jobs, continues to be a big piece of the equation, just because of all the construction activity, and not just residential, but also commercial construction activity. But I don't, I don't think it's the character of the jobs in the Miami, Fort Lauderdale markets. I just think it's the amount of supply of both for-sale and for-rent product that we've had to try to absorb there.
Ric Campo: To your point of currency valuation changes and what have you, I think there is definitely an impact on Southeast Florida, given it's sort of the capital of South America, if you want to call it that, or Central America. And you have seen when there are times of volatile currencies issues down, there is, there has been flight capital and folks that have come into the market. And a lot of the condos that Keith is talking about that are competing with apartments are actually people generating hard currency that are South American owners that are just trying lease a very expensive apartment or condo cheap, in order just get some hard currency. So it's an interesting market. Long term, it's a great market, but it is just has a few headwinds right now.
Drew Babin: Okay. That's all helpful. And just one last quick question on Southern California, obviously your performance in that market looks better than peers, kind of as a product of what you own and where you own it. The last couple of quarters, it seems like the revenue growth has been more occupancy gains and decent rental rate growth and maybe not performing rental rate growth, but still kind of in the upper two's. I guess, have you seen anything so far in the third quarter that would indicate any kind of marginal softening in Orange County, or near San Diego, or have trends, the kind of trends in the first part of the year kind of continued? So you still expect to do pretty well in those markets?
Keith Oden: I think that that LA-Orange County and in our San Diego platform, as you mentioned, were -- we have a little bit different geography than most of our comps do. I think that the strength that we've seen for the last two quarters was we modeled that strength. And so I think when you look out on our reforecast, it looks like it's going to continue. Yes, we've had the occupancy gains in both, both those markets but that's been true across our entire platform. I think I gave in the prepared remarks a preliminary number of of it looks like we're trending in July toward the 96% occupancy, which is, as you all know from long years of doing this with us, that's really unusual in our portfolio. And where we've operated in the 95% to 95.5% range for so many years that it feels a little bit unusual to be in the 96, is much less 96.3, so that -- the occupancy pickup is not just a Southern California phenomenon, but it's really pretty much across our entire platform.
Drew Babin: So I take that I mean rental growth trends, as far as leasing activity, so far into the third quarter are pretty much on target with budget?
Keith Oden: They are.
Drew Babin: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. On the acquisition front, would the Pure multifamily portfolio have met your quality criteria?
Ric Campo: It would not have met our existing quality criteria at this point. It was definitely an interesting portfolio and an interest print, pricing wise. We evaluated the portfolio and it was -- the challenge for us with it was number one, it wasn't in that kind of sweet spot that we're looking at today. And number two, it was highly concentrated in Dallas with some suburban properties that we are really excited about. So there -- and there were a lot of sort of other issues around it and we would not ever been as aggressive pricing wise that it ultimately traded at.
John Pawlowski: And then just a broader question on portfolio acquisitions, what is the appetite? I know pricing matters and markets matter. What is the appetite to do just larger portfolio deals right now?
Ric Campo: For the right product in the right portfolio, it would be, we'd be fine, doing a large transaction. I think the challenge you have with large transactions, and not Pure is probably a good example of it, I think if Keith was asking this -- answering this question on Pure, he would say there are three properties in the whole portfolio that we would, that we would have wanted to buy. Now on the other hand, you might change your strategy from an acquisition perspective. If the pricing was where you wanted it to be, and you could change your criteria too, if you thought there was value to be had in it. I think the challenge you have with portfolios just fundamentally is that they tend to be -- have assets in them that you don't really want. And you so you kind of have to take them to get what you want. And then the question is how much, what percentage of the portfolio is something you really want to want to buy? And then what are you going to do with the other ones that you don't want to buy, that you have to buy? Are you having to pay a price where that you think you can either move out of them are trading around in the future? So, often times we see these portfolios and go, let's, if we wanted to buy a $1 billion of properties or $1.2 billion of that properties like Pure had, we're just going to be the highest bidder on, on 12 $100 million projects that we want to buy. And so, to me, unless there's something strategic around it, or the pricing is so good that you kind of want to do that kind of business, that's why we don't, we haven't done a large transaction in a while. It's just, there is the pricing today is very robust for everything and actually you probably get a premium for if you're a seller of a large portfolio today.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Is the pricing getting irrational or too irrational in any market where you'd consider ramping dispositions right now?
Ric Campo: You know what? I don't think it's irrational. I think, because when you look at the map on Pure or in the math that we're seeing on these other properties, people will just reduce their return requirements to a certain extent, and multifamily fundamentals continue to be reasonable even in, even in markets that are oversupplied or that have lower rent growth because they're oversupplied from that perspective. I haven't seen any like real head-scratchers. When it comes to dispositions, we have sold a lot of properties over the last, in this last cycle. And we've traded out 20-plus year old assets for newer properties in the four to five year range and funded -- used dispositions to fund development as well. And so we don't have a lot of assets that we really want to part with right now. But-- so I don't, I don't think we felt like the market is so irrational pricing-wise that I got to get in there and sell into it. Because when you sell into it, the question is, do you think prices are going to, going to go down or be able to, so we can redeploy that capital? And given the interest rate cycle we're in, given the length of the recovery, and given the fundamentals for the business, it's really hard to make a case for apartment cash flow and cap rates to change dramatically right now. So the answer would be no.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford of MUFG. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford: I wanted to ask about the management transition. Should we be expecting more management changes near-term as part of the succession planning? And Ric, how should we be thinking about your tenure?
Ric Campo: So I don't think you should anticipate something next quarter or the quarter after that. So this is a -- we've been in succession planning mode for quite a while. I do have my 65th birthday next week, and so I'm glad we didn't do the conference call right on that day. But Keith and I are -- and Keith's younger than me, by the way.
Keith Oden: And always will be.
Ric Campo: So -- he will be. And really I know, Malcolm is probably going to hit me for saying this. He is actually slightly older than me. So when you think about, when I think about about succession planning, I think you have to, especially in a culture like Camden, we are going to internally grow our next tier of management. And they're all with Camden right now. So Keith and I have, and have had for a long time, a long-standing succession plan with our board. So, and I know some people on the call have asked this a specific question and we told them about it. So each year, at the beginning of the year we commit to a three-year term. And that it's basically a letter that we sent to the Board that says, Keith and Ric are going to stay for three years. If there is a reason or they don't, we don't still fulfill that commitment, maybe a health issue or something like that, then the person who doesn't fill it -- so if I didn't make it through that 3-year, Keith agreed to stay. The person that doesn't make it agrees to stay at least 2 years for transition. So both of us are healthy, we love Camden, we love our structure, and and we plan on being here for a while. The question is, and now creating space in the organization, allows our most senior people to get more experience in areas that they, that they may not have as much experience in, which positions us ultimately for transition. So, that transition is going to happen in the future. Is it next year, the year after, or the year after that? I don't know, but it's a well thought-out program, and we fundamentally believe that our next generation of leadership, we have them at Camden now, and we want to make sure that they stay at Camden. And so that's one of the reasons for the, sort of the opening up of the space in the titles.
Karin Ford: Okay. That sounds good. And then my second question is at NAREIT you called out Washington D.C. as performing better than planned. It ended up decelerating 90 basis points in the second quarter and now you're saying everybody is in line with plan. So has D.C. fallen off at all? And are you starting to see any demand impact there from HQ2 yet?
Keith Oden: So for the second quarter, D.C. was at 3.8% revenue growth, which would place it as the fifth-highest in our in our portfolio. So I called out the top four, the next one would have been would have been D.C. Metro. So out of 15 markets, it would be fifth, which it's been a long time and our, in Camden's world since D.C. Metro have been in the top five. So, I'm not -- I don't know about the NAREIT, the comparison to the NAREIT. But in, in our world 3.8% in D.C. Metro for the quarter is a really good quarter. And I would tell you that the commentary from our D.C. Metro operating staff on our, on the call that we do quarterly with our, to get an update on market conditions, is the most positive and constructive tone that I've heard out of our D.C. Metro operations team in probably three or four years. So all that to me bodes well for continued good performance in our DC Metro portfolio, which over the last two to three years has outperformed most of our peer group, and a lot of that just has to do with our geography in the D.C. Metro area versus a lot of our peers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to kind of wrap together a bunch of different questions, I guess, that were already asked and just talk about capital allocation and how you guys kind of think through it. You guys have talked about the acquisition environment being really aggressive and hard to stay disciplined if you want to win deals. You were also filling in your pre-development pipeline. Is the option here to build more? What is your starts outlook like longer term, but specifically in 2020? And how do you think about the incremental dollar invested today and what to do with it?
Ric Campo: Well, the incremental dollar, if we can't -- if given the spread between acquisition pricing and development, if we could make the development, just wave a wand and make the development pipeline larger, we would, we would be -- we would definitely err on the development side. So next year, we have -- between sort of late this year and next year, we have $210 million of that would be the Phoenix project and the Charlotte project too, those are $210 million. And then the late starts this year with our, with two projects in, one in Atlanta, one -- and I'm sorry, one in Florida, and one in California, it's $180 million. So when you add those two together, that's $370 million that could start or should start between the end of '19 and through '20. But again, we would definitely be a -- more development-oriented than acquisition-oriented, even though I think the challenge that we have with development is getting projects that actually cancel. So that's why we'll do a combination of the two, and try to find those, those sort of diamonds in the rough that we can drive the earnings growth over a couple of years in this environment up pretty dramatically, so we can get them up into fives.
Hardik Goel: Thanks so much for that detailed response. Just a quick follow-up, when do you think about development in the markets, is it very case-by-case and project-specific? Or are there a few markets where construction costs are less of a burden or they're increasing less? We hear from your peers that construction is really difficult in some markets, where that can be easier in others. Which are the markets that you're kind of focused on today?
Ric Campo: I think that all markets are definitely the same in terms of construction cost and time. It takes longer to build today because of lack of construction workers. But I think each market is definitely unique, and we're trying to find those sort of projects in the markets we operate in that we can make those numbers work. And there, I don't think there's any easy market or, but, there -- or a market where you can't find something. That's probably more difficult in California, because all of the California issues, than it is in some of the other markets. The California project that I talked about for a start at the end of this year or early next year, that we've been working on it for three or four years, or longer. And so generally speaking, I think you hit the nail on the head, that it's hard to build everywhere. And if we could expand the pipeline, we would if we could get reasonable yields and that's where we're constrained, is the discipline on making sure that we're not investing that, that incremental capital at a return that isn't in our core guidelines.
Keith Oden: I'm guessing that when you're hearing from our peers about hard and easy to build in, they're probably referring to the entitlement process, not the cost pressures. Because cost pressures are significant relative to what underwritten yield you're trying to achieve that makes sense. There's -- hard in Houston, Texas, as it is, and Southern California. On the other hand, the actual regulatory regime and the entitlement process is a different animal in California versus Houston. So, it's, you would just have to -- you would have to put them on an array, but the array of hard to easy, or relatively easy entitlement process, would start with California and probably end with some of our Texas markets. And then the others would be spread along the way. But there the cost pressures are significant and real across all 15 markets that we're trying to operate in.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Hey, thanks, hopefully I'm the last question. But when I was reading Keith's bio, I I have to say, you guys are remarkably spry for the amount of time that you've been doing this, and so credit to you. And I was going to ask the question, what's the end game as you guys start to consider closing out your career succession, go private, or some sort of combination? It sounds like the answer, if I were to answer for you, would be succession which is great. But when you -- are things like levering up, and going private, or some sort of reverse merger, since you would ultimately financially have to be a buyer in a public-to-public type thing, but where your portfolio would improve another, where the reverse would not be true in your eyes, I'm assuming? Are those two other alternatives completely off the table for Camden at this point? Or -- I just wondered if you could comment on that.
Keith Oden: I think they are totally unrelated to succession, right?
Rich Anderson: Yes, that's fair.
Keith Oden: Yes, because to me the issue of what you do with Camden -- as an entity, or assets, or how you drive total shareholder return, and how you compete in the marketplace -- is one issue. And then I would never connect a succession issue to a financial transaction that is either good or bad or indifferent for Camden shareholders. So I think that -- and when I think about Camden as a, the CEO-Chairman and large shareholder, I think about maximizing the ability of the Company to be -- to have longevity, and to compete in the marketplace effectively in the top quartile of returns. And so if there was a private transaction, or a public transaction, or any transaction where we could drive that objective, then we would do it. I think each kind of, each transaction that you mentioned has their own issues and own risks and things. But they're definitely not related to Keith and my longevity or spryness or succession plans. And so ultimately I think a great long-term business -- this is a great long-term business. We've been doing it for 26 years, almost, going on 27 now and have had great returns and created a lot of value for shareholders over the years. I think it will continue. How, but ultimately the the question about what we do I think be unrelated to what Camden does or what we do as a company, from that perspective.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Great. Well, I appreciate the time today, and the consideration. Have a great rest of your summer and we'll see you on the circuit in September. So take care, thanks.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome to the Camden Property Trust First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Kim Callahan, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2019 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will be brief in our prepared remarks and try to complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim, and good morning. Our pre-conference music today featured Keith Urban, who is recently named Country Music Entertainer of the Year. That's not why we chose him for our conference call music. That story is too long to tell and I'll let you call Kim for that story later. But to all of you Camden associates, it needs no explanation whatsoever. I want to give a big thank you to our Camden team for the hard work and focus that produced another solid quarter for Camden. You have clearly shown how you improved the lives of our team members, our customers and our shareholders one strength at a time this quarter. The first quarter operating performance was better than we expected. And as a result, we increased the same-store revenue and net operating guidance for the year. 2019 looks to be another strong year for Camden in the multifamily business. Apartment demand continues to be strong, driven by healthy job growth in our markets that continue to exceed the national average. In-migration continues to drive population and household growth in most of our markets. Recently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 5-year American Community Survey covering 2012 through 2017, identified the top regional magnets for young adults, ages 25 to 34, who are our largest customer group. This might surprise some of you but Houston led the country for millennial migration followed by Denver, Dallas and Austin. Seattle was the only West Coast market in the top 5. Our markets attracted over 245,000 millennials during this time frame. The migration was driven by strong job growth, low cost of living and the high quality of life offered in our markets. 2019 apartment completions are consistent with the levels in 2017 and 2018 and should be absorbed without much trouble. Our development business continues to create value for our shareholders. Recent developments have been leasing up in line with our budgets. We are continuing to add to the development pipeline for future deliveries. We have completed $217 million in acquisitions in 2019 with a full year budget of $300 million. While the acquisition market remains competitive, I'm confident that our teams will hit or exceed our 2019 target. I'll turn the call over to Keith Oden for some observations on the markets.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Our first quarter revenue results were a little bit better than planned, which is certainly a good sign for the balance of 2019. Overall, same-store revenues were up 3.7% for the quarter and 0.8% sequentially. First quarter of 2019 revenue growth was 4% or better in six of our markets with Denver at 5.5%; L.A. Orange County 5.2%; D.C. Metro 4.7%; Phoenix up 4.6%; Atlanta up 4.2%; and Orlando at 4% even. Contributing to our revenue outperformance for the quarter were D.C. Metro, L.A. Orange County and Atlanta. And as expected our weakest markets were B-minus rated Austin, Dallas and South Florida. Regarding rents on new leases and renewals, in the first, quarter new leases were up 1.1% and renewals up 5.5% for a blended growth rate of 3.3% that compares favorably to the first quarter 2018 blended rate of 2.8%, and to the prior quarter of 2.4%. As we expected, we're seeing seasonal improvement in new lease rates from January through April. And we anticipate this trend to continue throughout our peak leasing season. April preliminary lease rates are running at 2.9% for new leases and 5.5% for renewals for a blended rate of 4% even. April results combined with our May, June renewals going out at a 5.7% average increase gives us confidence that our leasing momentum should meet our expectations through the summer months. Our qualified traffic continues to support above-trend occupancy levels across our platform. We averaged a strong 95.8% occupancy in the first quarter which matched the 95.8% last quarter, and was above our first quarter 2018 level of 95.4%. April occupancy came in at 96%, compared to 95.7% last April, and the net turnover rate for the quarter fell again to 38% versus 39% last year. Our rent-to-income continues to reflect strength as our average rent as a percentage of household income, remained at 18.6% the same as last quarter and only a fractional increase from the 18.3% last year. Interestingly, our move-outs to purchased homes fell slightly to 14% even versus 14.1% for the first quarter of last year and the full year rate in 2018 of 14.8%. Despite some recent reports of millennial returning to the single family for sale market in greater numbers to the extent that reports are correct, we've yet to see an impact in our markets. Finally for the 12 consecutive year, Camden was included in FORTUNE Magazine's list of the 100 Best Places to Work. We celebrate this honor on behalf of the entire REIT industry as an indication of how much progress we've made collectively in the last 26 years. Camden is a great place to work. It's also a great place to live. Congratulations to our team on achieving our goal of 90%, customer sentiment score in the first quarter. Your commitment to improving lives one experience at a time made this possible. Now I'll turn the call over to, Alex Jessett.
Alex Jessett: Thanks Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance a brief update on our recent real estate activities, during the first quarter of 2019, we purchased for $97 million Camden Old Town Scottsdale a newly constructed, 316-unit community located in Downtown Scottsdale. And subsequent to quarter-end, we purchased for $120 million Camden Rainey Street, a newly constructed, 326-unit, 8-storey building, located in Downtown Austin. During the first quarter of 2019, we stabilized ahead of schedule, our Camden Shady Grove development in Rockville Maryland, generating a 7% stabilized yield. We also completed construction on both the first phase of our Camden North End development in Phoenix, and the second phase of our Camden Grandview development in Charlotte, and began construction on the second phase of Camden North End. And finally, subsequent to quarter-end, we purchased approximately four acres of land in the NoDa neighborhood of Charlotte, for the future development of approximately 400 apartment homes. On the financing side, during the first quarter, we completed a public offering of 3,375,000 shares generating net proceeds of approximately $328 million. We also repaid at par $439 million of secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. $200 million of this debt was repaid on February one with the remaining $239 million repaid on March 1. These secured debt repayments unencumbered 12 Camden communities, valued at approximately $1.3 billion. As a result, 98% of our debt is now unsecured and 99% of our assets are unencumbered. Also during the first quarter we amended and restated our unsecured line of credit extending the maturity dates to March 2023 and increasing the capacity to $900 million. Our balance sheet is strong, with net debt-to-EBITDA at four times and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.9 times. We ended the quarter with $242 million outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit. As of today, after taking into effect our first quarter dividend payments and the purchase of Camden Rainey Street we have $408 million outstanding which we anticipate refinancing with an upcoming, unsecured bond issuance. Turning to financial results, last night we reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2019 of $120.7 million, or $1.22 per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.02. Our $0.02 per share outperformance for the first quarter was primarily due to approximately $0.0075 in higher same-store net operating income resulting from higher occupancy and the timing of repair and maintenance expense approximately $0.005 in better-than-anticipated results from our non-same-store and development communities and approximately $0.0075 in a combination of lower overhead costs and higher fee and joint-venture income. The impact from our first quarter equity offering was offset by lower interest expense from the earlier-than-anticipated repayment of secured debt and lower amounts of debt outstanding. Last night based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we updated and revised our 2019 full year same-store and FFO guidance. As a result of our better-than-expected first quarter same-store occupancy performance, we increased the midpoint of our full year revenue growth from 3.3% to 3.4%. Additionally, we increased the midpoint of our full year expense growth from 3.25% to 3.35%. This expense increase is driven entirely by higher-than-anticipated insurance expense, resulting from a challenging insurance renewal environment. Our increased revenue guidance partially offset by our increased expense guidance resulted in increase of the midpoint of our 2019 same-store NOI guidance from 3.3% to 3.4%. Last night, we also maintained the midpoint of our full year 2019 FFO guidance at $5.07 per share. There are several adjustments to our original guidance including the following increases to FFO. $0.005 from our anticipated 10 basis point increase to our 2019 same-store net operating income approximately $0.01 from our first quarter outperformance not associated with same-store results, $0.02 of additional acquisition NOI resulting from our earlier-than-anticipated Camden Rainey Street acquisition. We are still budgeting, an additional $100 million of acquisitions in the fourth quarter in line with our prior guidance, $0.015 of additional NOI, due to the removal of $100 million of fourth quarter pro forma dispositions at the midpoint of our prior guidance. Due to the capital generated from our recent equity raise, we have removed dispositions from our current 2019 guidance. $0.095 in lower interest expense as a result of proceeds generated from our recent equity offering and our earlier-than-anticipated secured debt repayment partially offset by earlier acquisition spend and lower disposition proceeds. Our revised guidance now assumes, we issue a $400 million 10-year unsecured bond in mid-June, at an all-in rate of approximately 4% after taking into effect in place forward-starting swaps. This $0.145 aggregate increase in our 2019 anticipated FFO per share is offset by the impact of the higher share count resulting from our first quarter equity offering. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2019. We expect FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.24 to $1.28. The midpoint of $1.26 represents a $0.04 per share increase from our $1.22 in the first quarter of 2019. This increase is primarily the result of an approximate 2% or $0.03 per share expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, due to higher expected revenues during our peak leasing periods and property tax refunds anticipated during the second quarter, an approximate $0.025 per share increase in NOI from our recent acquisitions and our communities in lease-up and an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in interest expense resulting from lower amounts of average outstanding debt. This $0.065 per share aggregate improvement in FFO is partially offset by an approximate $0.025 per share decrease in FFO resulting from the impact of a full quarter of additional outstanding shares after our late February equity offering. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt : Hi. Good morning. Just curious the improvement you've seen in blended lease rates appears to have been driven largely by new lease rates. And I was just curious, do you think we could see a scenario where new lease rates nearly achieve the same level as renewals this year?
Keith Oden : Yes. I don't think we're going to see anything like that Austin. But it was -- we did see a pretty decent increase in the April numbers for the new lease rates jumped to about 2.8%. I think it's more likely that the renewal rates will stay about where they are throughout the year in the 5%, 5.5% range. I'd be surprised if the new lease rates got much above where they were for the April number. So I don't think that's likely. I think it's likely that we'll see sort of steady improvement. The 2.8% may not even be repeated for the next two months after that. But for the full plan -- for the full year that should be about the right number for new lease rates. So, on a blended basis you're going to end up still closer to the 3%, 3.5% lease rate gain for the year.
Austin Wurschmidt : Got it. Thanks. And then Ric just curious what gives you the confidence that you think you can meet or exceed your acquisition targets given you have talked about how competitive the transaction environment's been? You clearly had some success early this year. But just curious again what gives you the confidence and then what metros you're focused on? And are the deals that you're seeing from here stabilized transactions or more of the lease-up?
Ric Campo: Sure. So hitting the target's pretty easy since it's only $100 million. Exceeding it would be pretty easy given most transactions that we're looking at today are $100 plus million. So, $100 million doesn't buy as much as it used to in the past. In terms of the metros, we like the markets we're in. There is more value probably in the Sunbelt markets. We are seeing a fair amount of merchant builder product that has gone through its lease-up, but hasn't fully stabilized and really hasn't been managed as a stabilized property yet. So that gives us the ability to create that upside from what the going in cap rate is. So all the properties we bought in the last sort of cycle here all have the same attributes. We're buying them in sort of mid-four range and bring concessions off putting some Camden special service and activities in that should drive those cash flows up into the 5s at the end of the second year. Most of them have been --I think all of them have been substantial discounts for replacement cost anywhere from 10% to 17%, 18%. The Rainey Street project we bought is at least a 17% discount to what it would cost us to build it today. But that's sort of what we're looking for and where we're looking.
Austin Wurschmidt : Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Griffin: Hi. This is Michael Griffin on for Nick. So it seems that you've run at lower leverage levels recently, especially given the equity raise. How should we think about leverage levels going forward for the remainder of the year? And then sort of have your long-term leverage targets changed at all?
Ric Campo: Sure. Our leverage we've talked about this in 2009 that we're bringing our leverage down over a moderate period of time, and it's taken us 10 years to sort of get here. And we want to keep our leverage between four times and five times debt to EBITDA. We don't even use that concept of debt to market cap anymore given it became sort of obsolete during 2008 and 2009. And so we're going to stay in that zone. When you look at what was going on in the first quarter, the bond market was pretty rocky at the end of the first quarter -- or into the fourth quarter and into the sort of mid-part of the first quarter, and then it got obviously improved dramatically along with the stock market and stock prices. And so at the time when we were looking at these fundings, we decided to tap the equity markets as opposed to the bond markets given the volatility in the bond market at that time. So we're going to keep our powder dry to a certain extent, and part of that has to do with just our fundamental belief that we should operate with lower leverage, and we should get a better multiple for -- better stock multiple from investors over a long period of time with that kind of leverage. And then second, we're getting to the point where, I think this is the longest recovery in the history of the U.S. in June. And so, with that said, it's just I think prudent to have lower leverage this late in the cycle. We'd rather be at the lower end of the leverage spectrum versus the higher end of the leverage spectrum. So that, when we do have a cycle we have plenty of dry powder to take powder to acquire properties from folks that don't have that same view. And have higher leverages and have to sell their properties in a down market.
Michael Griffin: Got it thanks, so it’s very helpful, one other quick question on the, Camden Rainey Street. You'd mentioned previously that Austin is one of your lower-growth markets. I'm just curious is this more an asset-specific play kind of to get more exposure to the market maybe. Sort of a little color kind of on that would be nice.
Ric Campo: Sure. It's definitely an asset-specific play. We've been monitoring this property for a couple of years. It is in the downtown area. And it's on the east side of Austin and not in the sort of core downtown which makes it more affordable. The rents are -- when you look at Austin I mean the rents are $3 a foot plus in the downtown core. But they're less on the sort of east side of Austin. So, we like the idea behind being in downtown. You are two miles from UT. Google just broke ground on a property where we work across the street. So it just balances our portfolio really well in Austin brings our NOI contribution up a bit as well which is important, and it gives us that balance between sort of high-end urban downtown product, versus our suburban product as well. And we like that balance between urban and suburban, so that when the market -- when you do have sort of cycles at the market will obviously have over time, we have that good balance from a diversification perspective.
Michael Griffin: Got you, that’s it for me.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO. Please go ahead with your question.
Q – John Kim: Thank you. On your acquisition pace being ahead of last year and ahead of guidance, are you more optimistic with your underwriting as far as rental growth assumptions? Or is this mainly a function of your cost of capital improving?
A – Ric Campo: I think it's both. We have seen rental growth tick up a bit in some of these markets. And given that we're late cycle in terms of just it's been good for so long. You saw a little -- we saw an uptick in revenue growth. And I think it's sort of gives us a little bit of confidence that this could go on for a longer period of time than most people think. And that does definitely give us a little more confidence. The fact that we have our debt where we want it in this really low zone, gives us a little bit more capacity to be a little more bullish. And buy more properties than we would have otherwise.
Q – John Kim: And then, you quoted a, 18.6% rent-income ratio. That's lower than many of your peers. But it's even lower than your main Sunbelt peer. I think they quoted 20% yesterday. Can you just remind us the parameters of how you calculate this figure?
A – Ric Campo: Yes. That's household income divided by total monthly rental expense.
Q – John Kim: No. Average not, median in household?
A – Ric Campo: No. It's the average.
Q – John Kim: Okay. Thank you.
A – Ric Campo: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trent Trujillo from Scotiabank. Please go ahead with your question.
Q – Trent Trujillo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good quarter and new start to the year. So, occupancy was up pretty materially in Atlanta, Dallas and Charlotte on a year-over-year basis each by about 100 basis points. These are also markets noted for having elevated supply. So can you talk about, how you're able to achieve these occupancy levels? And how you're thinking about maximizing revenue in these markets during peak leasing season?
A – Keith Oden: Yeah. Our entire portfolio right now at 95.8% is that's really strong for us historically. We sort of targeted the mid-95s as an occupancy rate for a long time. In the markets where -- it really just a story of where the supply is. Yes it's true there's a fair amount of supply in Charlotte, in Dallas, in Atlanta. It really just depends on what your footprint is. And in the Atlanta market we are not -- there's a fair amount of activity around the Buckhead submarket but a lot of other communities in Atlanta are not just in the footprint where there's been a new development. It's also true in Dallas. Less true in Charlotte, and the story in Charlotte continues to be just decent -- good enough job growth to continually get -- make the absorption numbers work. The other thing is that I think in Ric's opening remarks, the fact that we are getting domestic in-migration to almost all of our core markets where job growth has happened in addition to the job growth, it's got to be a factor that's continuing to give us the ability to absorb the number of – all those new supply that based on historical numbers of job growth and supply would otherwise be a head-scratcher. But I'm fairly convinced that a decent percentage of that story is the in-migration into our markets domestically. And by and large, I mean a large proportion of those are on our prime rental cohort. The millennials in the 25 to 34-year range that have a higher propensity to rent. So when you look at across our portfolio in total, every market that we're in has a 95-plus occupancy rate and that's a really good place to be.
Trent Trujillo: Thank you for that detail. And you touched on Charlotte and you made that land purchase this past quarter very recently. Can you talk about the opportunity that you see there and what kind of stabilized yield you're anticipating that to go maybe how that compares to cap rates? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So it's NoDa neighborhood in just outside of Downtown Charlotte. It's about 400 units, total cost is going to be about $100 million and we are anticipating the yield of about 6.5%. So very healthy spread to what you can get on a new acquisition.
Trent Trujillo: Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, morning down there. How are you? Just a few questions on your markets. Some of the stuff that jumped out L.A./Orange County was your strongest revenue growth market and some of your peers had commented on their calls recent weakness. So curious, is this just specific because of where your assets are located versus maybe no Downtown L.A. or what have you that maybe you guys were better off based on where your assets are located? Or have you seen some subsequent close quarter weakness in your L.A./Orange County assets?
Ric Campo: No. We're still tracking about -- it's same as we did in the first quarter, which is really strong but it's not -- our outperformance relative to our plan in L.A., Orange County was $150,000 on revenues. So it was not like it was a big surprise to us. The change in L.A., Orange County, a pretty decent part of that pick up was that one community it's our -- the Camden Community in Hollywood, and some of which is burning off concessions from the prior year in addition, to which we've got a one-time -- our signage income, which came in, in the first quarter, which is more of a timing issue from the prior year. But of the total outperformance of $150,000, a pretty good chunk of that was at the Camden but again not unanticipated for us. Our footprint is a little bit different than many of our competitors in L.A., Orange County. But this is -- our performance is really pretty much on track with where we expected it to be for the year.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is on rent control. Colorado, the legislature voted down the overturn of the 40-year ban state-wide there. We'll leave California aside because that's been enough discussed. Do you feel that your other markets would go more the way of Colorado where politicians would understand that invoking rent control is counter to housing? Or are you getting a sense in some of the other Sunbelt markets where you are that maybe what is a coastal phenomenon may creep in to some of your markets?
Keith Oden: I don't think that's going to be the case. We have a couple of positive things in most of these markets. And when you think about -- when we think about why we're in the markets we're in, it's about pro-business, it's about population growth and employment growth and that drives job growth. And at the end of the day these markets are affordable markets from a cost of living perspective. So even if you -- the rent sort of shock that you're getting in some of these other large markets, where you have the same balance between supply and demand that really drives the price of housing up, you just don't have that as much in these other markets, because we can build and we can create that supply for the demand that's there. So there aren't any major markets that we are in that are considering rent control the way -- or that -- I mean there's always discussion about it, because at the lower ends when you start thinking about teachers and fire fighters and folks like that, they are getting pushed out into the suburbs. They can't live in the downtown or urban areas in any market including Houston or Dallas or Austin. But as you go out into the suburban areas, the price of housing drops pretty dramatically and it becomes affordable. The argument of whether you should be able to live in a downtown high-rise at $3 a foot is an interesting argument, but people aren't trying to control that rent, because they can go out of the suburbs and get properties at $1.20 or $1.30 a foot.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you, Rick.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeff Spector: Thank you, good morning. I'm not sure if you discussed this already, so I apologize if you did. But could you talk about your thoughts on 2020 supply in your markets, especially in the southeast where clearly demand is stronger than expected?
Alexander Jessett: Yes. So for 2019 for the entire year looking at completions, looking at Ron Witten's work, it looks like we get about 137,000 apartments across Camden's footprint in all of 2019. And just for comparison last year in 2018, we got 138,000. So it's virtually identical in terms of the supply. Now it's the location it moves around a little bit from market to market, but in the aggregate, it's almost identical in terms of the completions. The flip side of that coin though is job growth and in Witten's numbers in Camden's footprint for 2019 actually had a pretty sizable increase from last year. He had total employment growth of 557,000 across Camden's portfolio last year and he's got that number going up to 630,000 this year. I don't know what today's job's number is going to do to his forecast, but it certainly couldn't hurt what his forecast is. And the interesting thing within that is that, if you look at the total U.S. employment growth and again this is not reflective of this morning's number, but total U.S. Witten has job growth coming down from 2.7 million nationally in 2018 to two million even in 2019. So a drop of 700,000 jobs nationally is his forecast and yet Camden across our portfolio we're picking up about 80,000 jobs more than last year, which is -- it just reflects our thesis all along which is we are in and want to continue to be in markets that grow employment and population that's better than the national average. And clearly, we're seeing that in a pretty big way between 2018 and 2019.
Jeff Spector: Thank you. That's helpful. And are you able to comment on 2020 at this point?
Richard Campo: It's coming, isn't it? No matter what you do, but we're not going to talk about 2020 and how we think the markets going to be.
Jeff Spector: That's fine. That’s all. I was only talking about…
Keith Oden: If you leave it to completions and employment growth, Witten's forecast sure. I mean, he's got the supply in Camden's markets ticking up in 2020, although there is -- I can tell -- it goes up to about 150,000 from 137,000. However, I would caution you that for the last three or four years every forecast for completions has been moved out further, because it takes longer and because the labor shortages on getting these communities turned, some of its product type, you got more high-rise, so it just takes longer to construct and longer to lease up. So every forecast that we've seen for the last four, five years on year out deliveries some of those deliveries are going to slip. But in the aggregate, yes, it's somewhere around 150,000 apartments unless -- subject to the slippage that we know occurs. So not a huge increase across Camden's portfolio.
Jeff Spector: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then my second question if you could just talk about Lincoln Square the parking structure there that you can convert to apartments. We thought that was very interesting. What other ideas are -- you think or thinking about, especially when you're thinking about future disruption?
Ric Campo: Well, the good news is that's really hard to disrupt a place to sleep. You can't digitize that. You need a place to sleep you generally need a bathroom you don't necessarily need a kitchen anymore. But that's the good news for apartment. So, we don't think disruption is going to be a major issue for our business. But we do think that that clearly transportation's going to be disrupted and the use of real estate overall is going to be disrupted. If you look at parking as a percentage of the built environment, it's a little over 50% of the built environment in America today, right? So, when you start thinking about autonomous cars, and Rideshare, and things like that most projections show that the amount of cars and their requirement for parking is going to be reduced over a reasonably short period of time, like 10 years. So, what we've been doing is making sure that when we build our garages like the -- you're probably talking about a NAREIT story that was up there about our property in Denver. So, what we're doing is we're designing them in a way where we usually -- primarily, use poured-in-place concrete as opposed to sort of Tinkertoy sort of concrete. In that way the structures are more sound. They're always sound, but for sure they're easier to convert on flat floor plates. We try to keep the circulation on the ends and make sure that we have plenty of chassis for electrical and plumbing so that we can put those in and don't have to kind of break out concrete in the future. So, we're probably spending a little bit more in terms of future adaptation of those spaces, but it's not enough to move the needle on our returns. They're still reasonable from that perspective. I think there's going to be a lot of interesting changes in the future and everything is going to mobile and it's already on mobile and we're working on a lot of mobile solutions for -- to help our residents with their lifestyle from the ultimate package issue that's out there still that everyone's wrestling with. Ultimately, we think there'll be a mobile solution that allow packages to be put directly into the apartments via an app. I think that's going to be really a win for us not only on the revenue side because we think there's revenue opportunity there but also on the expense saving side when you start thinking about not having to deal with a lot of those issues in the office where our folks had actually deal with more customer service issues as opposed to those kind of issues.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Drew Babin: Hey good morning.
Ric Campo: Morning.
Drew Babin: Question on -- sort of extending on Alex's question about Southern California. Can you maybe talk about D.C. where your revenue growth is also significantly outperformed what peers are seeing? Is that sort of a footprint issue as well? And are you seeing anything that's materially different going from 1Q into April there?
Keith Oden: Yes. When we look at it's a footprint issue. It really is. And we just have a higher percentage of our assets that are more suburban. They're great assets. We have a very young portfolio in D.C. We just completed two new construction projects in D.C. Both of them leased up incredibly well at better than pro forma rents. So, it's -- but you're talking about the differences instead of -- in the downtown space in NoMa, it's $3 a square foot. In NoDa and Shady Grove, it's $2 a square foot. So, it's just -- it's primarily a price point issue and a mix -- an asset mix issue. We did outperform in D.C. relative to our plan. We did about $160,000 better on the revenue side than what we thought we would do in the first quarter. And that's continue -- it looks like that's continuing into April as well. But I would say it's more -- the biggest difference from us and the peer group would be the footprint.
Ric Campo: I'm going to add one other comment on that and that's the third level which really is -- it gets down to where the rubber meets the road and those are the people that are working on these properties every single day. And when Keith mentions that Camden's been on this Great Place to Work list for 12 years, it does matter when people are smiling and hitting customer service rates at 90%. We have an awesome team there and they're able to squeeze out a little bit more revenue. I believe in our competitors and manage expenses a little bit better as well just because they have that attitude and that culture.
Drew Babin: Okay. Thanks for that. That's helpful. And then, just one more question from me on the pipeline. If you look at the five projects that are currently in bond and lease-up and under development. What are you looking at now in terms of stabilized yields on those? And, I guess, that comment probably could extend to the lease-ups as well. Are there any projects that are maybe falling short or meaningful exceeding original expectations?
Keith Oden: Well, the projects that are in lease-up are meeting our expectations and they tend to be -- if you look at those projects, they're more suburban projects less urban. And we then move on to the ones under construction. These are seriously urban projects. So when you look at the downtown project Lake Eola and also Buckhead, these are high-rise concrete construction projects, which are going to trend lower in terms of yield than the more suburban wood-frame projects. So our yields are going to be in the 6% range, plus or minus for the development communities and they're probably more like the 6.5% to 7% in the completed communities under lease-up.
Drew Babin: Okay. And, I guess -- so just on the lease-up communities. McGowen Station is a little different in that, it's a little more urban and vertical. Is that one where you're kind of hitting your ultimate goals? I know there has been some -- you have decent supply in Downtown Houston.
Ric Campo: Yes. We are. And the lease-up velocity is pretty much on track. We're on track on our budgets. And it's going to be a great project. Houston has had a -- the downtown area and midtown, that's where all the supply has been concentrated. It's starting to move out into the suburbs now. But we're excited about that project and it's going to be a great long-term asset for Camden.
Drew Babin: Good to hear. That’s all for me. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead with your question.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. And, Ric, very interesting, 2020 is coming. Could you say the same thing about 2021? I mean, that would be interesting to know.
Ric Campo: I could, absolutely. It's coming too.
Rich Anderson: Thanks for the -- 
Ric Campo: You're obviously a Game of Thrones fan right?
Rich Anderson: Not at all, actually. Don't want to be. Okay. So I have a question about a topic that came up last quarter on D.C. and specifically the government shutdown. And you guys had some -- you called a handful of folks that came back to you looking for a rent relief or some sort of help in the midst of all of that. And it made me think that, perhaps, people or -- the credit in terms of behind these rents is very month-to-month specific and missing out on a paycheck for 30 days was enough to get people nervous. So, first of all, tell me I'm wrong, hopefully. And second, why would it be so tight if you guys are underwriting your tenants so carefully, so that it's not such a paycheck-to-paycheck type of scenario when it comes to your rents?
Ric Campo: Sure. So number one, our credit quality has not suffered at all. I mean, you can -- when you think about credit quality, if we had a credit quality issue you would see bad debts tick up. Our bad debts have been very consistent for a long period of time. I think -- I do think though, however, that people generally have issues when they're not getting their paycheck. And so whether their credit is still good, but most people are not saving a lot and they're -- and it's a complicated dance. Well, if you look at our 18.6% rent income that tells us that they're spending money elsewhere. And a lot of them have other expenses that that they have to deal with as well. So -- and I think part of it too is that, you hear in the media where the people are reaching out to the government workers who haven’t -- they aren't getting paid and so they sort of think they can get something for free to a certain extent. Now we didn't waive rent. What we did was waived deposit -- waive the late fees and worked with them to get the rent paid and they actually all paid the rent. So it's more of a timing issue than anything else. And, like I said, it was a handful. And the interesting thing, it wasn't just D.C., because the government workers were all over the country. And we had some people in California, we had people in Colorado. And I don't think that they're -- that if they miss one month of income, they're in trouble. But I think that several months would hurt most people.
Rich Anderson: Yes. Fair enough. But I mean, maybe you're just kind of responding to a human nature response to the situation. Is that a fair way to put it?
Keith Oden: Absolutely. We want to make sure that we take care of our residents and customer service is a big issue. So if somebody comes in and says, look I can't pay my rent this week. I don't want a late fee and I'm a government worker, you'd say fine. And we sent that out as – actually, we were proactive on that and then our teams sent out guidance to everyone across the platform and said if somebody has an issue take care of them.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Second question is sort of big picture. Do you guys have sort of a vision into being included in the S&P 500? I know you're not going to guide your strategy around that. But is that something that is on your radar screen that you care about significantly?
Keith Oden: Well, it'd be interesting and nice I guess. But we don't have any control over that. And so I don't really worry about things I can't control.
Rich Anderson: Okay. 
Ric Campo: Yeah. I think it's something that we would all love to be a part of the S&P, but it's not like you go audition for it. So we'd love to be. I mean, it would be an important thing and it's a positive. There's no question about it particularly in this world of index funds. It's just – it would be a good thing. So if anybody from S&P's on the line listening we're available.
Rich Anderson: Outstanding. Thank you very much. That's all for me.
Ric Campo: Good to have you back.
Rich Anderson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Derek Johnston: Hey, everyone. How are you doing? Are you still targeting around $300 million in annual development starts and has that thinking shifted at all with the lower-for-longer rates this stellar job and wage growth and the probability of this being more of a super cycle versus end of cycle?
Keith Oden: We are continuing to target $300 million a year. The challenge that we have today is that construction costs continue to rise, land prices continue to rise and finding transactions that can – where we could ramp up that is real difficult. And we are very, very focused on getting the right returns and disciplined in how we allocate the capital. I do think that even lower – sort of the economy going longer and rents doing well and all that is great. But we are still in late cycle and we don't feel like that it makes sense to ramp it up dramatically. And we really, can't because of the constraints that we put on our return requirements. I guess, if we decided to lower our hurdle rates and just sort of put the pedal to metal we could but that's just something that over the years we just don't do.
Derek Johnston: All right. Now that makes. And then just – I don't know, if someone asked this and I apologize if I missed it. But expense growth driven by property taxes and payroll did seem to continue this quarter. And we're just looking to get your thoughts on when you see this elevated trend on expense is softening?
Alex Jessett: Yeah. No, absolutely. So if you look at for the first quarter property taxes were up 7.7%. We think for the full year, it'll be up actually 4%. The big difference between the two is that, we're expecting about $2 million of refund slip between the second quarter and the third quarter. If you look at salaries, salaries were up about 6%. That's actually sort of the in line with what we're expecting for the full year. If you recall in 2018, we had a really good year for employee health care costs, which were very low. And when we started this year, I sort of guided to the fact that we didn't think that would continue and so that's what you're seeing. And then the last item on there is property insurance, which we talked about in the first quarter was a little bit higher than we expect for the full year at about 24%. We actually think the full year is going to be closer to about 16%. But that's entirely driven by two factors. Number one, this is just a really tough renewal environment, when you look at all of the hurricanes that have happened in the last two years and you think about wildfires in California, you think about floods in the Midwest those all equally impact insurance providers. And ultimately, when things like that occur they start to rise – they start to raise premiums. And then the second thing is that we did have some hailstorms in the first quarter in Dallas that sort of dragged on these numbers a little bit too. But when we look at our full year we feel really comfortable with our revised guidance for our full year expenses.
Derek Johnston: Okay. Thanks. See you in June.
Operator: And our next question comes from Karin Ford from MUFG Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Q – Karin Ford: Hello, good morning. I was wondering if the ramp on occupancy and new lease rent growth from the first quarter into April was better than seasonal trend or just in line with what you normally see.
A – Alex Jessett: Little bit better than seasonal trends. We're 1% -- little better than 1% for the quarter and that jumped up to 2.8%. I think that will moderate. I think that for the full year, you're going to -- it will be somewhere in the 5% to 5.5% on renewals and somewhere in the 2% plus or minus on new leases over the platform. It gets us to somewhere around the 3.5% for the full year on lease growth. But I think the April numbers that's probably going to end up moderating some as we go forward.
Q – Karin Ford: Got it. Thanks.
A – Alex Jessett: You bet.
Q – Karin Ford: And then just to follow up on the parking question. Ric, any sense for how much value could be hidden in your parking structures and your land, if there does end up being a drastic reduction in parking needs in the future?
A – Ric Campo: Well it could be substantial for sure because today, while we're charging some parking, we're getting basically pretty much zero revenue from that investment other than normal rent, right? So if you're going to actually convert a property from say a 300-unit apartment to a 500-unit apartment by adapting those parking garages and you're going to make call it a 6% or 7% return on that investment, it's pretty substantial in the portfolio when you think about half of our real estate is probably parking.
Q – Karin Ford: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. And sir, it is possible your line is on mute. And at this time, ensuring no additional questions, I would like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Great. Well thanks so much. We'll see you at NAREIT coming up. Appreciate the opportunity to be with you today. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2018 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will be brief in our prepared remarks and try to complete the call within 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard Campo: Good morning. As our holding music artist Queen suggests, our Camden team members surely are the champions of the world -- well, maybe not the world but at least, their markets, by outperforming their competition and driving customer sentiment scores to new highs. I'd like to give my entire Camden team a shout out for a great 2018. They, in a major way, supported Camden's purpose as a company, which is to improve the lives of our employees, our customers and our shareholders one experience at a time. 2018 was another solid year for Camden. We ended the year above our original guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. Revenues were slightly better than we projected, and we outperformed our expense guidance, primarily as a result of our attack-the-run-rate initiative along with lower health care costs and an adept property management -- property tax team that really worked hard in 2018. 2019 should be a lot like 2018, with slightly increasing revenue growth and increasing operating expenses a bit, ultimately keeping our net operating income growth at similar levels to 2018. We begin the year with the strongest balance sheet in the multifamily sector. Our development pipeline continues to provide increasing FFO and NAV contribution. New supply of apartments in our markets is relatively the same as 2018, while demand continues to be strong enough to absorb that supply while continuing to allow us to produce same-store revenue growth. We'll continue to pursue our development acquisition opportunities in a very competitive environment. We appreciate your continued support, and I'll now turn the call over to Keith Oden to give us an update on markets.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Consistent with prior years, I'm going to use my time on today's call to review all the market conditions we expect to encounter in Camden's markets during 2019. I'll address the markets in the order of best to worst by assigning a letter grade to each one as well as our view on whether we believe that market is likely to be improving, stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview, I'll provide additional details on our fourth quarter operations and our 2019 same property guidance. We anticipate some property revenue growth -- same property revenue growth will be between 2% and 5% this year in each of our markets, with a weighted average growth rate of 3.3% at the midpoint of our guidance range, and all of our markets received a grade of B- or higher this year. As Ric said, 2019 should look very similar to 2018 for Camden, and that's reflected in how little movement we have in comparing our 2018 revenue growth to our projected 2019 revenue growth among our 13 markets. Only 2 markets moved more than 2 spots in the rankings this year. Orlando moved from #1 to #5 and Southern California moved from #6 to #3. And no market moved from top half to bottom half or vice versa. Further, 10 of our 13 markets are rated as stable for 2019. All this is pretty unusual for Camden's portfolio. So here we go. Our top ranking for 2019 goes to Denver, which we rate an A with a stable outlook. Our Denver portfolio has been a strong performer, averaging 5% annual same property revenue growth over the last 3 years. Approximately 40,000 new jobs are expected during 2019, and supply remains steady with 13,000 new units scheduled for delivery this year. We expect our Denver assets will meet or exceed the 4.2% revenue growth that we achieved in 2018. Phoenix also earned an A rating with a stable outlook. Supply and demand metrics for 2019 look strong with estimates calling for nearly 50,000 jobs with 9,000 new units coming online this year. We give Southern California an A- rating with an improving outlook. Our portfolio there spans from Hollywood down to San Diego. And in the aggregate, our California markets face healthy operating conditions with balanced supply and demand metrics. Job growth should be around 120,000 over this region with completions of 24,000 units expected in 2019. Orlando and Raleigh each received an A- rating with stable outlooks again this year. Orlando was our #1 performer in 2019. 2018 was 4.9% same property revenue growth, and it should be on our top 5 again this year. Another 40,000 new jobs are expected during 2019 with only 6,000 completions. In Raleigh, new developments have been coming online steadily with 6,000 new units delivered last year, 5,000 more expected this year. Job growth has also been stable and over 20,000 new jobs are projected for 2019, in line with employment growth levels in 2017 and 2018. Up next is Atlanta, which we have ranked as a B+ with a stable outlook since 2016. Job growth has been strong in Atlanta and approximately 60,000 new jobs projected for 2019. Completions also remained steady with 9,000 new apartments scheduled for delivery this year. Houston keeps its rating of B and improving again this year after negative same property results in 2016 and '17. Our Houston portfolio rebounded in 2018 to achieve a 2.7% revenue growth. We expect to see slightly better results in 2019 as projected completions remain around 7,000 and job growth estimates are roughly 10x that with over 70,000 new jobs anticipated in Houston this year. In Tampa and Washington, D.C., conditions are currently B with stable outlooks. Tampa's new supply should come down slightly to around 4,000 new units this year with 25,000 new jobs projected, taking the jobs-to-completion ratio at a healthy level of 6x. We expect 2019 to look a lot like 2018 with regards to same property growth in our D.C. portfolio. Last year, we achieved 2.8% revenue growth in D.C. Metro, and our projections for 2019 reflect a slight improvement from there. Supply and demand metrics reflect estimated completions of 13,000 units with 40,000 new jobs projected this year. Conditions in Charlotte seem to have firmed up a bit and currently we rate a B- with an improving outlook. New supply has been persistent in Charlotte, and another 9,000 units are anticipated this year. Job growth should remain slightly above 30,000 this year, and we expect our portfolio's revenue growth to improve from the sub-2% level achieved in 2018. Our last three markets, Dallas, Southeast Florida and Austin, all earned a B- rating with stable outlook. In Dallas, job growth has been solid with over 70,000 jobs created last year and a similar amount expected during 2019. But with over 20,000 completions last year and nearly 20,000 more units coming online this year, the Dallas apartment market will remain challenging in 2019. Southeast Florida has more new apartments coming online and faces additional competition from resale and rental condominiums. With projections of 35,000 new jobs and 10,000 new units in 2019, we expect pricing power and revenue growth to remain limited for our portfolio this year. In Austin, we expect to see limited revenue growth again this year. New supply should start to decline in 2019 but remains at a very high level. Approximately 10,000 new units are anticipated this year with around 37,000 new jobs, leaving little room for pricing power in the Austin market. Overall, our portfolio rating is a B+ again this year with most of our markets expected to see similar to slightly better results than in 2018. And as I mentioned earlier, all of our markets should achieve between 2% and 5% revenue growth. And we expect our 2019 total portfolio same property revenue growth to be 3.3% at the midpoint of our guidance range. This compares to same property revenue growth of 3.2% for 2018. Now a few details on our 2018 operating results. Same property revenue growth was 3%, even for the fourth quarter and 3.2% for full year 2018. Our top performers for the quarter were Denver at 5.4%, Phoenix at 4.3%, Orlando at 4.2%, D.C. Metro at an improved 4.1% and San Diego/Inland Empire at 4%. As expected, fourth quarter revenue growth was under 2% in some our supply-challenged markets, including Dallas, Charlotte, Southeast Florida and also in Houston where we faced a 200 basis point negative comparison on occupancy this quarter versus our fourth quarter '17 post-Hurricane Harvey occupancy of 97%. With occupancy currently over 95% in Houston, we expect minimal impact from negative occupancy comps going forward in 2019. Rental rate trends for the fourth quarter were as expected with new leases flat and renewals up 5% for a blended growth rate of roughly 2.4%. And our preliminary January results are in the similar range. February and March renewal offers are being sent out in the 5% range. Occupancy averaged 95.8% during the fourth quarter compared to 95.7% last year. January occupancy has averaged 95.8% compared to 95.4% in 2018, so we're off to a good start this year. Annual net turnover for 2018 was 200 basis points lower than 2017, at an all-time low of 44% versus 46% last year. Move-outs to purchased homes were 14 -- 15.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018, 14.8% for the full year and both of those are down 40 basis points from the 2017 full year levels. All in all, good execution in 2018 and looks like we have a great game plan laid out with our teams to accomplish for 2019. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate and financing activities. During the fourth quarter, we reached stabilization at Camden NoMa Phase 2 in Washington, D.C. This $109 million development is expected to deliver a stabilized yield of approximately 8.25%, creating over $80 million of value for our shareholders. Also during the quarter, we completed construction at Camden Washingtonian, an $87 million development in Gaithersburg, Maryland; and Camden McGowen Station, a $91 million development in Houston. In 2018, we completed $300 million of acquisitions and started $280 million of new development, with no community dispositions for $580 million of net real estate transactions. Turning to our fourth quarter financing activities. On October 1, we repaid at par $380 million of secured debt, consisting of $175 million of 2.86% floating rate debt and $205 million of 5.77% fixed rate debt for a blended average interest rate of approximately 4.4%. The repayment of this secured debt unencumbered 17 communities valued at approximately $1.1 billion. We repaid the secured debt using proceeds from a $400 million 10-year unsecured bond offering, which we completed on October 4. The effective interest rate on this new unsecured issuance is approximately 3.74% after giving effect to the settlement of in-place interest rate swaps and deducting underwriter discounts and other estimated expenses of the offering. After taking into effect these transactions, at year-end, 79% of our debt was unsecured and 89% of our assets were unencumbered. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 4.1x and a total fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.5x. We ended the quarter with no balances outstanding on our $645 million of unsecured lines of credit. Our current line of credit balance after the January 2019 payment of our fourth quarter dividend, the payment of property taxes, which are disproportionately due in January and the repayment today of $200 million of secured debt with an interest rate of 5.2% is approximately $270 million. We have $239 million of additional secured debt due early in the second quarter with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. This debt can currently be repaid at par. We have $613 million of development currently under construction, with $335 million remaining to fund over the next 2 years. Moving on to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2018 of $119.4 million or $1.23 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.01. This $0.01 outperformance resulted almost entirely from lower same-store operating expenses due to lower turnover costs, lower amounts of self-insured health care costs and continued cost control measures. Turning to 2019 earnings guidance. You can refer to Page 27 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2019 financial outlook. We expect our 2019 FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $4.97 to $5.17 with a midpoint of $5.07, representing a $0.30 per share or 6.3% increase from our 2018 results. The major assumptions and components of this $0.30 per share increase in FFO at the midpoint of our guidance range are as follows: An approximate $0.18 per share increase in FFO related to the performance of our 42,972 unit same-store portfolio. We are expecting same store net operating income growth of 2.3% to 4.3% driven by revenue growth of 2.8% to 3.8% and expense growth of 2.75% to 3.75%. Each 1% increase in same-store NOI is approximately $0.055 per share in FFO. An approximate $0.19 per share increase in FFO related to net operating income from our nonsame store properties resulting primarily from the incremental contribution from our development communities in lease-up during 2018 and 2019; our recently stabilized Camden NoMa Phase 2 development and our 3 acquisitions completed in 2018; and finally, an approximate $0.06 per share increase in FFO due to an assumed $300 million of pro forma acquisitions spread throughout the year and an assumed year 1 yield of 4.1%. This $0.43 cumulative increase in FFO per share is partially offset by: an approximate $0.02 per share decrease in FFO due to an assumed $100 million of pro forma dispositions in the latter part of the year; an approximate $0.05 per share decrease in FFO resulting from the combination of lower interest income from lower cash balances; an approximate 2% increase in combined corporate general and administrative and property management expenses; and higher corporate depreciation and amortization due to the implementation of a new cloud-based accounting and human resources system; and an approximate $0.06 per share decrease in FFO due to higher net interest expense, resulting primarily from actual and projected 2018 and 2019 net acquisition and development activity, partially offset by the accretive refinancing of maturing secured debt. We currently anticipate borrowing approximately $700 million of new unsecured debt in 2019 spread between early and midyear at an all-in rate of approximately 4%. These proceeds will be used to refinance maturing secured debt and fund both net acquisition and development activities. In addition, we anticipate recasting and upsizing our existing unsecured line of credit in the early part of 2019. Our same-store expense growth range of 2.75% to 3.75% for 2019 is primarily due to expected increases in salaries and benefits and property taxes. Salaries and benefits represent just over 20% of our total operating expenses and are anticipated to increase by 5%. As discussed on prior calls, in 2018, we were responsive to the effects of general labor tightening and made market-driven wage adjustments where appropriate. Despite these salary increases, in 2018, we experienced unusually low amounts of self-insured health care expenses, resulting in our 2018 increase in salaries and benefits to be approximately 3%, well below our original 6.5% estimate. We are not anticipating that these low amounts of health care expenses will be repeated in 2019. Property taxes represent 1/3 of our total operating expenses and are projected to increase approximately 4% in 2019, primarily driven by Charlotte and Denver. Charlotte only revals for property tax purposes every 8 years, and 2019 is the year. And 2019 is an every other revaluation year for Denver. Our 2019 property tax assumptions are based upon us successfully protesting and litigating, if necessary, the 2018 previously discussed outsized property tax valuations in Atlanta. Excluding salaries and benefits and taxes, the remainder of our property-level expenses are anticipated to increase at less than 2% in the aggregate. Page 27 of our supplemental package also details other assumptions I've not previously mentioned, including the plan for $200 million to $300 million of on balance sheet development starts spread throughout the year. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2019. We expect FFO per share for the first quarter to be within the range of $1.18 to $1.22. The midpoint of $1.20 represents a $0.03 per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2018, which is primarily the result of an approximate $0.02 decrease in sequential same-store net operating income. Of this amount, $0.015 is due to sequential increases in property taxes resulting from the reset of our annual property tax accrual on January 1 of each year. The remaining $0.005 of the sequential decrease in same-store NOI is due to other expense increases, primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends, including the timing of on-site salary increases, partially offset by slight increase in same-store operating revenues; and an approximately $0.01 per share decrease in FFO due to a combination of lower interest income, resulting from lower cash balances and higher overhead expenses due to timing of salary increases and certain other corporate expenditures. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Trent Trujillo of Scotiabank.
Trent Trujillo: So guidance calls for you to be a net acquirer, which makes sense with your low leverage. But can you talk about the deal flow that you've seen and maybe talk about the pricing and buyer pool competition for the assets and how you expect to find attractive deals?
Richard Campo: Sure. So we just got back from National Multi Housing Council meeting in San Diego. They had a record attendance of, I believe, over 7,000 people and which sort of indicates the sort of popularity of multifamily with investors today. So it remains a very competitive environment, there's no question about that. And I think so what's happening sort of right now is that there's sort of a standoff between buyers and sellers. And buyers understand that it's -- that you have sort of a kind of a normal revenue growth as opposed to white-hot revenue growth. So you have this kind of spread between bid and ask at this point. And so there really hasn't been a lot of transactions between sort of the last part -- last half -- or last month or two in '18. And then clearly, there hasn't been enough data points to really understand what's going on out there now. What we think is going happen, though, is that there will be a movement sort of towards the center of that bid-ask spread gap today because sellers need to sell and buyers will need to buy. I think it's going to continue to be competitive. If you look at the last 4 -- 3 or 4 properties that we bought, we're looking for below replacement cost transactions that are in the sort of mid-4s to low 4s cap rate that -- where we believe we can -- through improved operations and sort of Camden-izing the property, we can move that cap rate up pretty quickly over a couple of years to 5, 5 plus or minus. So we think there will be opportunities. The guidance obviously of $200 million to $400 million is today pretty much everything. It's $100 million or more. So you end up with -- so we're talking about 3 or 4 transactions perhaps. And we think that, given the backdrop for sellers coming towards the buyers, are actually going to happen. The key for us, though, is finding that kind of needle in the haystack where we think it's very undermanaged and where we can come in and move the NOI up, not by hoping the market goes up, but by knowing that we can operate the properties better.
Trent Trujillo: Great, that's very helpful. And just a follow-up, can you perhaps talk about the concessionary environment in some of your largest markets that are facing high supply? I mean, we've looked at Atlanta and Dallas, and you touched on those markets in your prepared remarks. But are you seeing supply pressures easing there and pricing power coming back in 2019? But basically, what's the concessionary environment?
Richard Campo: So in the development business, the concessionary environment varies depending on submarket and market. So you can't just say, okay, it's 2 months free or 1 month free or three months free. So it really definitely varies by submarkets and developers who are leasing projects up. When you have a vacant building that just opens, sort of free rent doesn't really matter to them because they're just trying to get to a stabilized occupancy. And so the more aggressive the market, you have three months free, and generally you don't go over that. And the more moderate markets are 1 to 2. Just for an example, in Houston, prior to sort of the Harvey event 1.5 years ago-ish, there was 3 months free in downtown. Today, it's more like 2 to 1.5, and yet the market is starting to sort of turnover in a sense. If you have a 350-unit apartment and you're at 75%, 80% occupied and it's taking you a year or so to get there, you now start having renewals and the question will be whether those concessions are having to be given to the renewals. But generally speaking, markets like that are very, very competitive in Dallas, are 2 to 3 months free, which should be in the sort of the uptown area. Charlotte was pretty concessionary. But I think we've seen some of the concessions sort of moderate as properties are leasing up. But the good news is, for us, is that when you have a 95% occupied property that is stabilized and you think about the number of leases you need to capture in order to keep that stabilized 95%, it's pretty small actually. So the fact that a new property is giving significant concessions doesn't mean that existing properties have to. And so that sort of supports our same-store revenue growth because we have a very stabilized portfolio and you just don't have to give those kinds of concessions to capture market share in the stabilized properties. So on the one hand, you have concessions in the development side of the equation; and on the other hand, you don't have concessions in the operating portfolio. What you have is just the moderate ability to increase your revenues 2% to 3% or 4% depending on the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi.
Nicholas Joseph: On Houston, does the 70,000 job growth assumption contemplate oil prices at their current level? Do you need to see job growth in the energy sector? Or do you think you can get enough job growth in medical and petrochemical sectors that will drive enough demand?
Keith Oden: Yes. So the 70,000 job growth in Houston does not contemplate any large contribution from the oil companies. There -- still, the recency effect is pretty strong among the Houston oil companies from 3 years ago when they were still kind of downsizing and laying people off. So when you come from that as your backdrop, there's a great deal of reluctance to add staff even in an environment where volumes are increasing, which they clearly are. So $55 -- $54 to $55 a barrel is probably a steady-state in terms of total activity. Activity has increased pretty significantly in the field from where it was 2 years ago. But most of what goes on here is the back office and support operations, and the oil companies are still pretty reluctant to be adding staff. But there'll come a point where they've stretched to the limit and they will continue to -- start to add jobs, but that's not a 2019 event. The 70,000 jobs are primarily in areas -- in the medical center and just distributed across Harris County. So I think the 70,000 is probably very doable for 2019. The most important part of the Houston picture is the 7,000 completions that we're going to get in 2019. That's almost a 10:1 ratio, and that's very healthy for where we are in Houston right now.
Nicholas Joseph: And then on the Phoenix and San Diego future development projects, what's driving the estimated cost increases? Is it a change in scope or market construction cost pressures?
Richard Campo: No, it's both. But the San Diego project, we have reconfigured it and made it more efficient and trying to maximize the views of the -- that we have from that elevated site. And so generally, we had to have scope changes in both of those projects, but also cost continues to be an issue in every market.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Keith, on your market outlook for the year, I think that's based primarily on same-store revenue. But if you were to look at it on same-store NOI, would there be any markets that differ in your outlook?
Keith Oden: Well, you get swings in the NOI primarily based on things like property tax, kind of one-offs like the situation that Alex described that we're going to have in Charlotte this year where you have an 8-year revaluation event going on. So when I look at these results, I tend to focus on -- primarily on same-store revenue growth year-over-year but also look back over a 3-year trend. And then the second piece of that, that's really critical is looking at the jobs-to-completions ratio market-by-market because it's -- even though if you look at it in total across Camden's platform, for 2019, we're going to get -- on estimates, we're going to -- we should get about 135,000 jobs, and that is -- or excuse me, 642,000 jobs. We're going to get about 135,000 new apartments. And that's a 4.7x ratio. We've always talked about 5 ratio, 5.0 being equilibrium. And that's interesting. But if you look -- you've got to dig into that data because at the low end of that ratio range, you have a Denver that's a 3.0 and then you have D.C. at 3.1. And at the high end of that range, you have Houston at over 10 and you've got Atlanta at a 7. So those are the biggest indicators to me about the directionality of the market. But again, you get back to the -- our overall portfolio rankings, we've got 13 -- 10 of our 13 markets rated as stable. So there's not a lot of swings that we're anticipating in the portfolio.
John Kim: And then also, external growth is a component of your FFO guidance that might be a little bit unique in the sector. Earlier today, your stock hit a 5-year high. If you hit your acquisition target for the year, what is your appetite to raise common equity again versus utilizing perhaps your ATM or dispositions or maybe raising your leverage level?
Richard Campo: Well, clearly, we have the luxury of having the best balance sheet in the sector. So we have capacity on the debt site. And when we look at raising capital via either debt or common stock or dispositions or other mechanisms kind of in between, it's always a balance about keeping a strong balance sheet, but understanding that if you're growing externally, you have to have capital. And we just sort of look at each of those capital levers, if you will, and decide what is the most appropriate and efficient at the time. So we're excited about our stock hitting an all-time high. But on the other hand, debt levels are low and interest rates are low as well. And so it's just a balance between trying to figure out what the best fit is for the capital.
John Kim: But was there anything with the last raise that you did as far as not deploying the capital as quickly as you anticipated that you would think of it differently this time around?
Richard Campo: I think you take all facts into consideration whenever you're thinking about capital transactions and try to balance them together. We did -- when we did the equity in 2017, we did think that 2018 was going to be where the buyers are going to have more leverage than the sellers and that there would be more opportunity, and there just wasn't. I mean, we had '18's sales for multifamily increased over what '17 was. The good news for us, though, even though we only -- we didn't hit our acquisition guidance last year, we did increase development. So on the one hand, you can't deploy all your capital when you start a development because it takes 18 to 24 months to actually get that capital out. So the way we looked at that equity raise was we could do acquisitions and/or development. And when you add the acquisitions and development, we actually exceeded our development projections but underachieved our acquisitions. So even though people think that we didn't deploy, we actually did. It just takes time to deploy the development.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: Just curious if the peak deliveries in Houston from 2017 have been absorbed at this point. And then could you just provide what your supply outlook for Houston is for 2020?
Keith Oden: Yes. The deliveries in '17, I think the ones that started at the beginning of the year have probably all been absorbed. Those that started at the -- delivered at the end of '17 are probably still in the process, depends on how many -- what the size of the project was. The deliveries in -- so I would say, substantially, the '17 stuff has been absorbed. But the -- we had huge deliveries in 2018 that are still an overhang on the market. And the markets -- the submarkets that got most of the activity, which were downtown, midtown and the uptown area -- in Galleria, they still have, since that was -- those were the locations that attracted the most capital and most new deals, they're still in the -- fighting -- plugging it out, hand-to-hand combat. And as Ric mentioned earlier, we're still in the 1.5 to 2-month concession range in those submarkets. So if you -- when you move beyond those 3 areas that got most of the new supply in 2018, it's a totally different picture. And our footprint in Houston has some exposure in those impacted markets, but we have a lot of exposure that's not impacted by new supply. And that's why we've been able to produce the results that we did last year in Houston and why it forms the basis for our optimism for 2019. In terms of deliveries for -- so in Houston for -- I think we mentioned earlier, we've got about 7,000 apartments this year with -- and has deliveries in 2020 up to 13,000. So on a -- from a supply standpoint, that's not -- still not a terribly troubling number for Houston as long as we get what we normally get in terms of job growth. So the progression would be 7,000 in '19 and, call it, 13,000 in 2020.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then you guys have referenced a few times having the best balance sheet in the sector. I guess, what's your appetite to increase leverage from current levels?
Richard Campo: We have talked about keeping our debt-to-EBITDA in the 4x to 5x range. And right now we're at the low end of that range.
Austin Wurschmidt: Where do you expect to end the year in '19?
Alexander Jessett: At year-end, we'll be somewhere around 4.4x.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shirley Wu of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Shirley Wu: So currently, you're guiding to 2.8% to 3.8% in terms of revenue growth. What do you think it will take in order to get to the high or low end of that range?
Keith Oden: A lot better than expected job growth or a lot worse than expected job growth, I think that's the single biggest variable when we look out on -- when we look out at performance, the supply is pretty easy to predict because it's -- for whatever that's coming in 2019 is known and knowable. The wildcard is jobs. You've got to like the trend this morning at over 300,000 new jobs. I think our Wheaton's numbers for projected job growth for national 2019 is right at 1.9 million. And obviously, you're not going to get a bunch of -- you may not get a bunch of 300s, but it doesn't take -- so we've got 300,000 of the 1.9 million in our estimates. So I like our odds of getting over the 1.9 million total that we're using in our forecast.
Shirley Wu: Got it. And on development, a lot of your competitors have noted that there have been delays due to tight labor markets. But I noticed that your Camden North End I is actually delivering a quarter early. What do you think you're doing differently? And even going forward, do you anticipate labor to affect your future deliveries?
Richard Campo: Labor is definitely an issue, and that's what's caused most delays in construction. And I think in Camden -- in the case of Camden North End, we just have a great team out there that executed amazingly. And all of our development teams, I applaud because they're definitely doing what they can to beat their competitors to market and to be very efficient. I think -- if you think about the delays, we've been talking about delays for the last 3 years. And so one of the things that I think we did as a team is try to really anticipate the delays in our construction budgets. And so you have a little kind of erring on the side, when you think of your schedule, okay, we know we're going to have issues, let's kind of stretch it out. So when the team executes amazingly well, you end up bringing it in faster than you thought and at a lower cost than you thought. Because if you're bringing it faster, you're general conditions and your other costs that are associated with time go down. And so we were very fortunate in Arizona, and we're trying to achieve that in other projects, too.
Operator: Your next question comes from Drew Babin of Baird.
Andrew Babin: I wanted to talk about D.C. a little bit. Obviously, your price point is more on kind of the value-oriented side of the spectrum there. And I guess, how do you feel about where you're positioned there relative to where new supply is pricing, where you are geographically around D.C. Metro? And also, kind of are you hearing anything about -- from your properties about waived late fees or anything like that with regard to the government shutdown?
Keith Oden: Yes. So for 2019, we've got D.C. at a B stable, which is exactly what we had it rated last year -- for 2018. That still feels about right. 40,000 new jobs in the D.C. Metro area, roughly 13,000 completions, so that's -- you would think of that as adding to pressure, and I think that's right. The difference is it just depends on the geography of your footprint. The most supply impacted markets have been D.C. proper and then the Crystal City area. We have a very different footprint than a lot of our competitors do. And so our Northern Virginia, Southern Maryland assets have continued to really put really good results. I think it really just depends. I think we -- our forecast for D.C. has revenue -- total revenue growing at about 3%, that's up from 2.8% last year. And that seems about right to me. In terms of the impact from the shutdown, we literally have had a handful of folks that have indicated that they needed relief. And we indicated to all of our folks that are impacted that we would work with them on late fees and the like. And so the good news is that -- I guess, by today, most people would have gotten their backpay. And if they've made it this long without -- being under financial duress, they're probably okay until the next shutdown.
Richard Campo: Yes. I think it's interesting when you think about the shutdown and how it affected people because given that we have had all kinds of different things over the years from hurricanes to snowstorms to all kinds of different things that caused residents to be dislocated and not be able to pay, in this situation, when the shutdown started, our teams put together a program for anyone that was government related. And not just government employees because what happened is a lot of contractors get laid off -- or not laid off but furloughed as well, so it's private companies that are working on government projects. And so I was really excited and happy that our teams were way in front of that and sent out information. It's not just D.C., it's all over the country, right? So we were prepared to deal with the issues. And as good corporate citizens, understanding our customers are having trouble making their rent when they don't get paid by the government, our teams were way in advance of that, and we hadn't missed a step on helping our customers.
Andrew Babin: Great, that's helpful. And then quickly transitioning to Southern California. I think it's a similar dynamic where kind of your positioning, your price point may differ from some of your peers; and like D.C., the supply is kind of coming in pockets where you're either sort of affected by it or not. I guess, can you talk about your broad Southern California exposure where there might be pockets of supply you're exposed to, but also just who's adding jobs in the Inland Empire, Orange County, San Diego and then kind of your main focused markets there?
Keith Oden: Sure. Our portfolio is a very different footprint. I mean, when we're aggregating these numbers, we're giving you results that go all the way from San Diego up to Hollywood. There's -- I would say there's not any place other than directly adjacent to or near Irvine where there -- where I would say that there is --'s we have a supply concern. We just don't. I mean, it's just so difficult, takes so long and the planning and delivery process for apartments is just really difficult all over Southern California. So you're looking at 23,000 deliveries over that entire footprint, 118,000 new jobs projected for that Southern California footprint. That's a 5, 0. So as long as you don't have immediately in your market impact area, as long as you don't have 2 or 3 deals trying to get leased up at the same time, that's just a very healthy situation for our operators. And so again, footprint's a little bit different than some folks, but Southern California sure feels like a place that's going to have -- that's set up to have the next couple of years be really strong. We've got it rated as an A- but improving. Last year, we had it as an A and stable. So I think we're really well positioned in Southern California. There's not a single one of our assets that I have any particular concern about as it relates to exposure to new supply.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Just first question is on Houston. Just there were some recent commentary just speaking to folks down there that suggested that late in the year, there was softness in the market that the jobs expectations had been revised down. But from your comments, it doesn't sound like anything unusual going on in Houston. So was there just some -- maybe it was just tough year-over-year comps? Or was there, in fact, some momentary pause in the market that caused a little bit of concern for some folks?
Keith Oden: I can give you my hypothesis. So let's answer the numbers question first. We didn't see that other than the normal seasonal -- fourth quarter is always a little bit weaker in Houston than the other 3 quarters. That's just the way it is. But if you put that aside, we didn't see anything in our numbers that would indicate that there was any cause for concern or resetting of the ability to raise rents or get renewals. So that's just what our experience is. My hypothesis on the noise, and obviously, we heard that, too, because we get some of the same phone calls you get. If you come to Houston and you have -- if you go on a sort of guided tour and you go to the areas that I've already described as being the most impacted with new supply, that would be downtown, midtown and the Galleria area, and if you're having a conversation with someone who happens to be a merchant builder, which, by the way, 99.2% of all the product in Houston that's being built right now is merchant builders because Camden's the only non -- only public company that has any exposure to new construction in Houston. So that's the preponderance of all of the assets that are being leased up right now. If you talk to a merchant builder who currently is in a lease-up in either downtown, midtown or the Galleria area, I promise you, they feel like they are getting their brains beat in because they're in the second or third year of 2 months-plus fee rent. And so that's certainly not what they anticipated. They're probably way off on their pro forma numbers. They're under stress because they wanted -- would have ideally already had an exit at a better rent roll than they currently have. So there's just a lot of doom and gloom if you talk to those guys. But if you go anywhere other than in the Houston Metropolitan area, those -- the 3 areas I just described, you'll hear people like more -- that have a more of tone of what you would hear from us, which is, yes, some of our projects, our communities that are impacted by supply. We've been dealing with that for a while. We'll get through it. We always do. But by and large, our portfolio is really performing and outperforming most of our competitors. I just think it's sort of a selection bias on who you're talking to. But -- and then that becomes the report, right? And so the report sounds like -- if that's the 3 areas you visited, sounds like there's a lot of weakness and maybe something that was unanticipated that you're about to have another slip back, but we don't see that.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. So it's really just localized oversupply, not anything market-wide?
Keith Oden: Absolutely.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is on the expense control, especially on wages. Alex mentioned that last year came in really low on the self-insurance, don't expect that to repeat. But can you talk a bit about what you're seeing for payroll? And just given how low unemployment has been and how strong the labor market has been, rising minimum wage, it does seem like this is a pressure point. So just sort of curious to your thoughts or whether this is a blessing if, in fact, it means that your residents are getting higher income. So if you have to pay your leasing folks and maintenance people more, your residents are having more income, so the rent increase offsets that. If you can provide some color.
Richard Campo: Sure. I think it's interesting when you think about wage pressure, right? Because when people consider the company that they work for, wages are not the #1 reason why they stay at a company. It has to do with culture and it has to do with a feel of belonging and a feel of trust and their job is important and it's more than a job. So on the one hand, we -- as Alex mentioned, we did make some adjustments for folks that were clearly under-market because of wage pressure and low unemployment and all that. But we don't have people just leaving because of wages. I think part of the equation is making sure that our wages and what we pay our employees are fair and in the market. I'll give you an example of that. I know a lot of our competitors, for example, their lowest paid employees would be sort of groundskeepers and folks like that, and they're paying maybe minimum wage, maybe slightly higher than minimum wage. Our base pay for the lowest common denominator person would be $13.50 an hour.  And so we have always sort of pushed that up, that cost or that wage up, so they -- the folks were not at the sort of bare minimum, minimum wage kind of thing. And so I would think that companies that haven't been proactive in trying to take care of their employees and create great culture and make sure their salary levels are competitive in the marketplace probably have more wage pressure than we do. So we have it sort of built into our run rate already. And I do agree that higher wages, generally speaking, are better for our customers. And if you look at, our customers have changed pretty dramatically over the last 5 or 6 years. We went from -- at the beginning of sort of the uptick in the market, we went from 60,000 and change median household income and now we're like 90,000. So we have -- not as many people used to make 60,000, now they make 90,000. But a lot of them -- a lot of people have moved into these properties that have higher wages and higher incomes.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. But it does sound like higher wages are something that's going to be consistent with us for at least the foreseeable future.
Richard Campo: Absolutely, no question about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney.
Robert Stevenson: What's the expected stabilized yield of the 6 developments currently under construction? And how does that compare with expectations for the $200 million to $300 million that you expect to start this year?
Richard Campo: So our yields are in the 6% to 6.5% range for the developments we have right now. The challenge of the future portfolio is it probably comes -- they probably come in on the lower end of that range just because of cost pressure. Costs have gone up faster than rents. And so -- but when you think about the current market today for an acquisition, it's 4.25 plus or minus kind of across America. So we're still getting a nice 150 -- or 250 to 200 basis point positive spread to our development pipeline, even though the properties that we built 2 or 3 years ago, we're getting 7%, 7.5%. And now we're 6%, 6.5%.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then in the guidance, you guys provided some detailed guidance for both the revenue-enhancing CapEx and repositions as well as wholesale redevelopments. How many units are roughly in each of these buckets? And what are the expected stabilized returns of each?
Alexander Jessett: Yes. So for repositions, you've got approximately 2,000 units, and we're sort of looking at still right around a 10% return. When you go to redevelopments, you've got three projects that are in there, so you're talking about approximately 900 to 1,000 units. And those yields are closer to development-type yields.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then in terms of that, I mean, what's the opportunity set for you guys over the next couple of years? And are you sort of limited in terms of the amount of internal Camden people and availability of external Camden people to be able to do this? I mean, if you had additional capacity, would you do more on an annual basis? Or is this basically what needs to be done this year in the portfolio and there really wouldn't be a lot of extra units to do even if you had capacity?
Keith Oden: Yes. We have capacity to do more, substantially more than we're doing right now. I think at the peak, we were doing close to 6,000, 7,000 units annually when we first started the process. The governor and the limitation on it is, assets that are in a condition, both from an age standpoint and the submarket that they serve such that we can underwrite them to get an incremental increase on our dollars of somewhere in the 8% to 10% range. So that's kind of our -- that's kind of the bucket that we're looking for. The best-case scenario are deals that are still in great submarkets, maybe even submarkets where there's new development that's occurring. But they're 12 to 15 years old. Externally, they're cared for in a way -- architecturally they present themselves that to the uninitiated consumer, once you do a reposition and you've done the -- completely redone the interiors up to what today's market apartments' delivered new construction look like, the average consumer can't tell the difference between our asset and our competitors' asset that happens to be brand new. So maybe you're not going to get the full 100% rental rate on the new construction, but you'll get something pretty close to it. So if you can underwrite those types of assets, and on incremental investments, somewhere in the 8% to 10% range, that's the opportunity set. And so we go through a process that starts pretty organically at the district level and we look at recommendations, and the teams make their case and then we vet the numbers. And if it passes muster with everybody around here, then we go forward. But yes, we don't -- I wish we had another 5,000 in reposition right now because it's still the best bet on the table from Camden's perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.
Wesley Golladay: Looking at wage growth, I'm just wondering when does wage growth become a bigger part of the equation for rent growth? Is this something we have to wait for supply to slow?
Richard Campo: Yes, I think so. We're absorbing enough in every market to absorb the supply that's coming online. But that supply does have an impact on being able to raise existing rents in existing portfolios. If you didn't have the supply, obviously, you'd have more -- and you have the same demand, you could raise your rents a whole lot more. And when you look at sort of the progression of revenue growth from, say, 2010 to 2016, it was kind of straight up into the right and primarily because you didn't have a lot of supply. And now the supply has been pretty stable for the last couple of years and the demand has still been there, but that supply just takes your ability to raise rents beyond 2% or 3% or 4% off the table.
Wesley Golladay: And how is rent to income trending maybe at year-end '18 versus year-end '17? Is it materially improved?
Keith Oden: We're still about 18x rent to income, which we've been in that range for the last 2 or 3 years, which tells me that our -- on average, our residents are getting wage increases as a group that have mirrored pretty much what our rental increases have been. And that's been -- we've been running 4%, 5% now for almost 6 years. So the good news is that our resident population is managing to keep up from an income standpoint with what the underlying rental increases are. 18% of disposable income, I don't even think we would see any impact until that number got closer to 20%.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates.
Hardik Goel: Just a couple of clarifying questions. On the development yields, you mentioned 6% to 6.5%. What would that number be if it was unlevered cash flow, so including some allocation for property management expense and ongoing maintenance CapEx?
Richard Campo: Generally, those are 50 basis points plus or minus in terms of costs if you included those numbers.
Hardik Goel: Got it, got it. Just one more. On the labor delays you mentioned, if you had to split those up by market, which markets are seeing more labor delays versus others? And as you think about your starts and you look at your predevelopment pipeline, are you factoring that in to which developments you'd choose to start? Because you have, I think, 600 in predevelopment and roughly $200 million to $300 million of starts on guidance?
Richard Campo: We definitely are factoring in what we think the real development time frame is and when we do a pro forma. So our -- if you compare it to, say, maybe 4 years ago when we didn't have this kind of issue, our developments on sort of stick-built would have -- we probably extended those times by 4 to 6 months. And then on high rise, probably anywhere from -- maybe a 12-month period where we extended that construction period because of labor. Labor, it's pretty -- I think most markets are pretty much sustained. There's some maybe that -- Charlotte was a tough, tough market. We don't have anything really under construction there at this point. Just because they had so much at the same time, so the labor pool there was more difficult. But I think generally speaking, it's a -- there's not like one market that doesn't have a labor shortage. They all sort of do. And depending upon where they are -- at peak in their cycle is when you have the most sort of acute situation. And it depends also on the size of the market. But we are definitely including what we think real, achievable construction periods and lease-up periods are in all of our new developments. And that has been part of what's caused the sort of the decline in projected yields.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: So Ric, I guess, I'm curious, how much pressure are you seeing specifically in your Texas and South Florida markets from homebuying? We've heard from the homebuilders that homebuying trends seem to be fairly strong in those regions, especially amongst the entry-level price points.
Richard Campo: Well, yes, overall, the home -- moving out to buy homes has been 15% of our portfolio. And in specific markets like Houston and South Florida, I don't think it's any higher or lower than it has been. And when you think about -- the challenge with the whole idea where people can afford a home in Houston because the median price is so much lower than other places, but if you go into urban core in Houston, the average home is the same price as San Diego, right? And the challenge is, is that affordable home is 45 minutes to 1.5 hours out of the central city. And then the other thing that I think -- that you need to -- that people need to understand is that when you buy a home -- buying a home is not a financial decision. It's a demographic decision, right? So we know that our millennials are getting married later in life, having kids later in life and making those kind of demographic things that drive them to want an ownership situation. A lot of the millennials want optionality. They want to be able to move around and not be burdened by a specific location or a mortgage. And so I think that's one of the things that's kind of driving the fact that homeownership rate hasn't spiked up in spite of low interest rates and what have you.
Keith Oden: Just a note on that, in the fourth quarter of '18, in Houston, we had about 17% of our move-outs indicated it was to purchase a home. That's probably a 1 or 2 percentage points higher than it's been in the last 5 years on average. So Houston had a great year for new home sales. It set a record in terms of total units. So despite that, the multifamily market in Houston and our relevance stayed in the 94%, 95% occupied, and we never drop below 95%. So it's pretty robust. You're right, what you're hearing from the builders is correct. They're selling a lot of homes in Houston, particularly starter homes in Houston. Southeast Florida is a different story. There were only 8.5% of our residents that moved out to purchase homes in the fourth quarter of '18. And that, again, is probably 1 or 2 percentage points below the long-term trend. So probably not a big part of the story in either market, and part of it in Houston is we got 120,000 jobs trailing 12 months and probably 25,000, 30,000 in South Florida.
Haendel St. Juste: That's helpful. Would you say -- actually, could you quantify what percentage of your Houston rents come from the three markets with heavier supply and maybe what the rent growth differential between those areas are versus your other Houston submarkets?
Richard Campo: So I don't have the exact of those three submarkets, but I can give it to you broadly because we look at it between urban and suburban in all of our markets. So all three of those submarkets would identify in our urban category bucket for Houston. And the differential for the last year was clearly in favor of suburban products, and the differential was about 1.2% on revenue growth. So it's not nothing. It's a meaningful number in terms of -- if you're in the urban area, that would be those three submarkets that are impacted versus suburban.
Haendel St. Juste: Great. And then lastly, I'm not sure if I missed it or not. But what was the blended rent in January? And how does that compare to January of last year?
Richard Campo: It's about 2.4% this year, and I don't think we gave the blended from last year. But I can get that to you if you call me later. So it's roughly flat on new leases and about -- up 5% on renewals. And if you do the math, that's about 2.4%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein of Capital One.
Daniel Bernstein: I was also at the NMHC and heard the bid-ask spread comments there. And just wanted to ask you your thoughts on where maybe those bid-ask spreads are widening out, A, assets; B, suburban, urban. Just trying to understand where you think the opportunities are going to be for you on the acquisition side better.
Richard Campo: Sure. So the most overbid properties are valued-add. Now that's a really crowded space. And so I think that the value-add space is definitely a space we're not involved -- we're not interested in as much because what we want -- what we are trying to get -- we think the sweet spot is the bid-ask spread differential between merchant builders who have owned their property now for a year or 2, it's stabilized. They're not making their original returns, but they're definitely able to sell above what the original cost was. And so given that they have generally IRR hurdles for them to make their promote, every day they wait, they get eroded from the profit on their promote. So what we're looking for -- and I think the bid-ask spread in that type of product because it's less traveled, if you will, because you're buying newer properties, and they're sort of -- you don't have a great story on the new properties. Gee, I'm going to take this older property, value add, I'm going to buy it for a really low cap rate. But I put 10,000 to 20,000 in it, and then all of a sudden, I can convince myself perhaps that there's a story on being able to get a better yield there. And that's -- like I said, we're not in that space. But we want to buy them below replacement cost and from specific merchant builders that don't manage their own properties and they're managed by third-party property managers, which tend to be sort of managing to the middle as opposed to trying to maximize the utility of what their property really is because they just have so many. So I think that spread will compress and the buyers will come towards the sellers of it. But I think that the sellers because there's so many properties that have to trade are going to have to come to the buyers a little bit closer as opposed to just sort of meeting in the middle, if you will.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard Campo: Well, thanks, everybody, for being on the call. And I'm sure we're going to see a lot of you over the next month or two in the various conferences. So take care, and we'll talk to you when we see you. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Camden Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this call is being recorded. And now, I would like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinion and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete third quarter 2018 earnings release is available in the Investor Section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will be brief in our prepared remarks and try to complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim and good morning. I'd like to start with to give a shot at John Kim of BMO Capital Markets for providing this quarter's honorable music. John got the honor by winning our Name That Music contest last quarter. John's theme for the song -- John's theme for the call were songs from 2009 the year the Great Recession ended. Some of you the songs may have sounded recent, to others they may have sounded ancient, probably depends on how you're personally impacted by the recession. John didn't say this but I'd be willing to bet there are few more -- there are more than a few of you on the call today who are still in school in 2009. Time flies when you're having fun and speaking of fun, Camden's third quarter results would qualify as fun. Our onsite teams and our support teams performed better than we had expected with solid revenue growth and great expense control driven by our attacked run rate initiative. Apartment fundamentals remained strong despite high levels of supply in most of our markets. Strong job growth and migration from high cost and high regulatory states has continued to support high apartment demand in Camden's markets. For the year, we have completed $600 million of combined acquisitions and development starts, which is in line with our original guidance. The mix has changed however. Our development starts were $100 million more than our guidance and our acquisitions are $100 million less than our guidance. We effectively traded lower yielding acquisitions for higher yielding developments albeit the timing will be different on those, on producing those yields. With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Last quarter was Camden's 100th quarterly earnings call. So this quarter begins the next 100. Honestly, I gladly take another 99 just like this one as our results were solid and slightly better than we expected for both the quarter and year-to-date. Same-store revenue growth was 3.1% for the third quarter, 3.2% year-to-date, and up 1.1% sequentially. Our top markets for revenue growth for the quarter were Denver at 4.3%, Orlando at 4.1%, Houston and Phoenix both at 3.8%, and San Diego, Inland Empire 3.6%. Our weakest three markets again this quarter with less than 2.5% growth were Dallas, Austin, and Charlotte, the most heavily supply challenged markets in our portfolio. Overall rents on new leases and renewals are slightly better than planned year-to-date and look encouraging relative to our fourth quarter plan. In the third quarter, new leases were up 3.1%, renewals up 5.5% providing a blended growth rate of 4.2% versus 2.8% in the third quarter of last year. So far in October new leases are basically flat, with renewals up 5% for a blended increase of 1.8%. October occupancy is running at 95.8% versus 96% last October. However just a reminder that last year's October occupancy rate was influenced by the Hurricane Harvey occupancy effect which drove Houston's occupancy rate up to 97.5%. The Harvey effect will have a measurable impact on our Q4 comparisons to last year. Our third quarter net turnover rate fell again to 54% from 55% last year and remains below last year's 49% turnover rate at 47% through the first three quarters. In the quarter move-outs to purchase homes dipped to 14.3% versus 14.6% last year leaving us at 14.7% year-to-date and that compares to 15.2% last year. It appears that the gradual upward trend over the last several years in this metric may have stalled in 2018 at a level well below the historical norm and bears watching in coming quarters. I'd like to thank all of our Camden associates for an outstanding quarter, let's finish strong to close out 2018. I'd like to turn the call now over to Alex Jessett, Camden's CFO.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. And before I move onto our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate and financing activities. At the end of the third quarter, we purchased Camden Thornton Park, a recently constructed 299 unit nine storey community in the Thornton Park neighborhood of Orlando for approximately $90 million. This community is directly adjacent to our existing Camden Lake Eola development providing the opportunity for further operating efficiencies. Also at the end of the quarter, we sold a 14 acre outparcel adjacent to our development sites in Phoenix for $11.5 million. During the third quarter 2018, we began construction on Camden Buckhead in Atlanta. This $160 million, 365 unit development will be the second phase of our existing Camden phase community and will consist of one-eighth and one-ninth storey concrete building. Subsequent to quarter end, lease up was completed at Camden NoMa Phase II in Washington D.C. This $108 million development is expected to deliver a stabilized yield of approximately 8.25% creating over $80 million of value for our shareholders. For 2018, we have now completed $300 million of acquisitions and started $280 million of new development. We are not anticipating any additional acquisitions or dispositions in 2018. Turning to our recent financing activities, on October 1st, we repaid at par $380 million of secured debt consisting of $175 million of 2.86% fully rate debt and $205 million of 5.77% fixed rate debt for a blended average interest rate of approximately 4.4%. The repayment of this secured debt unencumbered 17 communities valued at approximately $1.1 billion. We repaid the secured debt using proceeds from a $400 million 10-year unsecured bond offering which we completed on October 4th. The effective interest rate on this new unsecured issuance is approximately 3.74% after giving effect to settlement of in-place interest rate swaps and deducting underwriter's discounts and other estimated expenses of the offering. After taking into effect these transactions, 79% of our debt is now unsecured and 90% of our assets are now unencumbered. Turning to financial results, last night we reported funds from operations for the third quarter 2018 of $117.1 million or $1.20 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.01. This $0.01 outperformance resulted primarily from approximately $0.005 in lower same-store operating expenses due to lower turnover costs, lower amounts of self-insured health care cost, and continued cost control measures, and $0.005 in higher non-same-store net operating income resulting from better than expected results from both our previously completed acquisitions and our current development communities. We have updated and revised our 2018 full-year same-store expense, net operating income, and FFO guidance based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. As a result of actual and anticipated future expense savings, we have reduced the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance by 45 basis points from 3.5% to 3.05% and increased the midpoint of our same-store net operating income guidance from 3% to 3.2%. Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full-year 2018 FFO guidance by $0.02 from $4.74 to $4.76 per share. This $0.02 per share increase is the result of our anticipated 20 basis point or $0.01 per share increase in 2018 same-store operating results, approximately $0.005 of this increase incurred in the third quarter, with the remainder anticipated in the fourth quarter, and $0.01 of additional non-same store outperformance from our previously completed acquisitions and our current development communities, approximately $0.005 of this increase also occurred in the third quarter, with the remainder anticipated in the fourth quarter. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.20 to $1.24. The midpoint of a $1.22 represents a $0.02 per share increase from our $1.20 reported in the third quarter of 2018. This increase is primarily the result of a $0.01 per share or approximate 1% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI driven primarily by a normal third to fourth quarter seasonal declines in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover, and personnel expenses, a $0.01 per share increase in NOI from our development communities and lease-up, and a $0.01 per share increase in NOI from our recent acquisition of Camden Thornton Park. This $0.03 per share cumulative net increase in FFO will be partially offset by a $0.01 per share decrease in FFO resulting from a combination of higher overhead cost due to timing of certain corporate related expenditures and slightly higher interest expense as the fourth quarter interest savings from our recent debt refinancing will be offset by higher amounts of debt outstanding and lower amounts of capitalized interest at several of our developments near construction completion. Our balance sheet is strong, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 4.1 times, and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.5 times. We have $793 million of development currently under construction with $380 million remaining to fund over the next three years. As of October 25th, we have no amount outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit and $30 million of cash on hand. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Just on Houston, you faced some difficult occupancy comp in 4Q, so hurricanes is trending from a newer lease perspectives and then as you face more normalized occupancy comps next year and I know it's pro forma guidance, but how is Houston looking in 2019?
Ric Campo: Well, it’s -- we are in the process of putting together our bottom-up budgets, so we look at all kinds of different data providers and if you look at what Ron Witten has in his outlook for 2019 in Houston he has got revenues going up somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. We'll see where ours come out, clearly the comp is a tough one because of occupancy in the fourth quarter but that normalizes pretty quickly in the first part of next year on occupancy, we trended back down to about 95% as we expected we would by the second quarter. So I don't think there will be much of that noise in the numbers. Houston continues to do to recover nicely. I think last month we got a report that showed that the trailing 12 month job growth in Houston, Texas was 128,000 jobs. So that's enough to move the needle even on a metropolitan area like Houston. So things continue to recover very nicely. The nice thing is that recent -- up until recently the job growth had been coming pretty much without participation by the integrated oil companies and within the last two quarters that's we've really seen a shift in that, they've begun to hire again their full capacity. So I think that bodes well for Houston's job growth in 2019, obviously we have a very constructive supply scenario for Houston next year around 8,000 apartments that are going to be delivered into the Houston Metropolitan area which is sort of a rounding error in terms of total supply. So if we get another really good job growth here in 2019 which is kind of what's projected in most people's numbers 8,000 new apartments so that's really good math for our business.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And just on the balance sheet, after repaying the secured debt earlier this month it looks like the only remaining secured debt is coming due next year, how do you think about the use of secured debt as part of the overall capital stack going forward?
Alex Jessett: Yes, we fundamentally believe that we should be an unsecured borrower. So we've got $439 million of secured debt that's coming due in the first quarter of 2019 and our intention is to not take that out with additional secured debt.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.
Shirley Wu: Hi guys, this is Shirley Wu calling in for Juan Sanabria. Congrats on a great quarter, so I think moving to 2019 outside of Houston which market do you believe are set to reaccelerate or decelerate from 2018 that is actually in your higher side markets like Dallas?
Ric Campo: Yes, so again we're in the process of putting together our game plan in all of our markets and obviously we can look at aggregated data from data providers. I think the one that we rely on most on is Ron Witten's numbers and if you look at what Ron Witten has modeled for Camden's markets in 2018 to 2019, he has got total revenue growth for 2018 at somewhere around little over 3.2% and if you look at into 2019 that number goes up to about 3.7% in his high level aggregated number. So clearly Ron is looking for an improvement across the board, a slight improvement about 50 basis points in our entire portfolio. What that means for every each of our individual markets we’ll have to wait and see until we get our -- get the final results and review process for our 2019 revenues we will give you some guidance on in the first part of 2019. But overall, as you just kind of think about the drivers in our business, if you look at employment growth and supply, there's really not a huge difference between the outlook of what's happening in 2018 and what the outlook is for 2019, job growth comes down a little bit across our platform, new completion stay relatively flat, but the change in the ratio of new jobs to completions doesn't really move that much, we're a little bit above five times for 2018 that drops to a little bit below five times for 2019. So overall just looking at the macro data and not drilling down to each individual market which is the whole purpose of our budget process, you would just look at the macro data and say 2019 this should look a lot like 2018 maybe some slight improvements. So we'll have to see how it plays out.
Shirley Wu: That's great. Are there any markets in particular that you might be concerned about in terms of like maybe supply and rent just not in there?
Ric Campo: Well the supply challenged markets that we have right now the three weakest markets that we operate in are Austin, Dallas, and Charlotte, and if you look out at the supply numbers for 2019 there is very little relief coming in any of those three markets, Dallas gets a little bit better, Austin actually gets a little bit worse on supply, and Charlotte is about the same. So I think you can look for us to continue to be swimming upstream on those three markets just because of the headwinds of supply.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital.
John Kim: Thanks again for allowing me to be your host music DJ.
Ric Campo: Absolutely, well done.
John Kim: On your turnover rate of 47%, can you comment on any markets that are meaningfully higher or lower than your portfolio average?
Ric Campo: From a historical standpoint, when you look out on, and I don't know have the details of each one but when you look out on year-over-year, you always have markets that have higher versus lower turnover rates but historically if you look at them by comparison, there's nothing that stand out in our portfolio. So we've had 2% difference in the turnover rate from last year and that would be -- that would be consistent across the platform but within that set of data, you've got turnover rates that vary by as much as 7% or 8% up and down from the average in our portfolio, we can give you that data offline if you like.
Keith Oden: And one of the things, I think is interesting when you think about turnover is sort of just the migration patterns of sort of Americans and what's happened over the years and how that's changed. There's really been a secular change in sort of people sort of making moves and wanting to make moves and it's primarily I think because of number one the Millennials are just kind of a different breed of cat compared to the original -- sort of baby boomers and they were always willing to move to a new city to get a job, get a better job than what have you. But today with unemployment rate is low as it is and the competition in the job market it's a lot more difficult to relocate people from their market when they have a home and kids and things like that than it has been. Now you clearly still have out migration from California and some of the other East Coast cities that that's been going on for a long time. But generally speaking people are staying put longer in their homes and in their apartments and they're not moving as fast as they did in the past and I think it’s that sort of secular change in just the way people kind of do everything including taking or getting married a lot later in life or maybe not getting married at all and then also having children later, it sort of moved into the system and now our traditional turnover rates are just not what they were in the past because of that.
John Kim: Thanks for that. Alex, on the senior notes looks like impressive move to lock into 10 year early to reduce the effective interest rate. But can I ask how longer the swap agreements duration for?
Alex Jessett: Yes, so they're 10 years and so we first start entering to them at the end of 2017 and we finished them through the early part of 2018 and so it’s for a 10-year period. So the way it works is net settlement and a net settlement clearly in our favor and then we'll amortize that net settlement against interest expense over the full 10 years.
John Kim: So that 3.7% is for the full?
Alex Jessett: That's correct, yes, so 3.7%, 4% for the full 10 years.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning. First question so the outset of the year you were projecting DC to be a 3% revenue growth market I believe and you're tracking a little bit below that up into this point and there's been some recent comments from one of your peers, I guess concerning CBD fundamentals in particular, so I was curious without giving 2019 guidance, what's sort of your outlook or optimism for your suburban markets Northern Virginia and Maryland over the next six to 12 months?
Ric Campo: Yes, so DC Metro at the beginning of the year we rated it as the B market and stable which is pretty consistent with where we think we're operating. If you think about the third quarter of this year, our average revenue growth in our portfolio is 3.1%, DC metro was 3.1%. So this is the first time in a while that DC Metro has been in the top half of our revenue numbers, so that's a good sign. For the third quarter, Houston was 3.8%, so you think about our two largest markets DC Metro and Houston are both in the top half of our portfolio and again that hasn't happened in some time. So we're reasonably optimistic about our DC portfolio not only through the end of the year but into 2019. As you all know we have very different footprint than a lot of our other competitors have in the DC market lot of suburban exposure and I think that's served us well for the last couple of years relative to the concept. Obviously we're in a -- we're sort of in a transition in a lot of these markets where a ton of the supply has been more in the urban core. And where we have more exposure in urban areas that's been a negative and our suburban markets have been a positive. My guess is that at some point there -- it’s just based on the decline in new supply that's inevitable and starts that are inevitable in the next couple of years, that that will benefit the urban areas more so than the suburban areas. So overall we're pretty optimistic about where we're situated in DC in 2019 and I look forward to seeing some of that reflected in our DC budgets when we roll them up.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks for that. And then as far as development you mentioned the pipelines around $700 million at this point and you've got some projects that will wrap up here in the early part of 2019, what's the appetite to backfill these projects at the right level of development, we should be thinking about for you moving forward?
Ric Campo: We're very comfortable in the $200 million to $300 million development start annually going forward into 2019 and 2020. We have that pipeline of land or transactions that are in progress right now to be able to start those projects between now in 2019 and 2020.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then could you quickly just give the yield on the Buckhead development?
Ric Campo: On the development that we started?
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, correct.
Ric Campo: Yes, so we started it's trending at around a six plus or minus. The interesting thing is when you think about the development cycle, we first started building or doing 10s, 10 cash on cash you can imagine that in Houston and Tampa back in 2010, 2011, and 2012 and over time as a result of increased construction cost and just the time it takes to build and the pressure in the market, the yields have compressed. But when you look at building to a six in the market today on an acquisition basis is still a 4, 4.25 just still making a very nice, nice spread over what we could get on an acquisition for the development risk and we get to build what we want as opposed to buying somebody else's building that wasn't necessary built by us for us.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.
Rich Hightower: So I guess just a quick follow-up on the development question there, do you see that spread between market cap rates and yields compressing given the increase in the base rates combined with just this unabated cost acquisition on the construction side?
Ric Campo: Well, I think the issue becomes I think, yes, absolutely spreads have tightened compared to where they were in the past, right they were really, really wide and people are making wider spreads and they've ever made in my business career and so that it's gotten to the point where it's more normal, normalized 150, 200 basis points positive spread between acquisition and development on the development side. But I think and I think part of the issue is that -- it's really hard to get find transactions like that, that's why we're at $200 million to $300 million and not $500 million. And so it is more difficult to get deals done and to make the numbers work from that perspective. The thing that's interesting when you think about the 10-year treasuries obviously has gone up from the beginning of the year and people think about why haven't cap rates gone up as fast as the 10-year. And therefore thinking that prices have to come down and cap rates have to go up. But there is a massive wall of capital today that continues to flow into real estate and multifamily specifically sort of the darlings are multifamily and industrial with Amazon effect with industrial. We had a board meeting this week and we had HFF come in and update our board on current market conditions and they had a slide that showed $182 billion of unfunded real estate capital that needed to find a home and when you start thinking about apartments, when you think about cap rates, the 10-year is probably the last thing that influences cap rates, the first thing is liquidity and that's how much money is in the market trades and deals, the second is market fundamentals or operating fundamentals, supply and demand, the third is inflation expectations, and the fourth is 10-years. And when you look at the relationship of cap rates today, we have massive liquidity, we have pretty decent supply fundamentals and demand fundamentals and if the Fed is raising rates because they're worried about the economy getting overheated and inflation coming back will have multifamily plus defensive assets from that perspective, because you can really mark pretty much 8% to 10% of our leases to market every single month. So it’s a very sought after asset class unless there's going to be a massive change in liquidity or operating fundamentals or expectations or inflation, I don't see cap rates to anything but stand really sticky and prices doing nothing but going up because cash flows are increasing.
Rich Hightower: Okay. That's helpful and I think the wall of capital argument is it's an interesting one and if we -- let me ask this question, if we apply that to Houston clearly supply is going down next year and that's a very favorable set up but just given the quickness of the supply response in a market like Houston and given Camden's long standing experience, I mean how do you sort of expect that picture to evolve as we get further into 2019, I mean do you see permits accelerating again given that wall of capital that would presumably still be interested in multifamily in a market that's generating 80,000, 90,000 jobs a year or something like that and just given the fundamental dynamics there?
Ric Campo: Yes, Houston clearly has the best story in America right now, lowering supply, increased job growth a very dynamic market and so we do absolutely expect starts to increase and permit to increase in 2019 and 2020. The good news is that you can't build your project fast enough to really negatively impact probably 2019 and part of 2020. When you get down to it, the market is very transparent and I think that -- I think that's really interesting thought when you start thinking about supply and how you can turn it on and turn it off. In the past people thought of these markets like the sort of non-barrier to entry markets as always vulnerable to overbuilding. Well because of the transparency today in the marketplace, people who are making capital decisions on the equity and debt side of this business are -- they see everything that's out there and they know, they know what's coming, they know what the supply and demand dynamics are, when the supply and demand dynamics get out of whack they stop just like Houston from 20,000 units to 7,000 or 8,000 units this year. So I think that Houston will ramp up because it's the story but the question is how many can get done given the cost environment and given the return requirement issues.
Alex Jessett: Yes, just to put some numbers around that, that's all correct and Witten's got completions in Houston at 6,000 this year and I think that's -- that's going to be correct as it turns out, his projection for next year is 7,000 completions and he has that ramping up to 13,000 completions in 2020. So yes absolutely it's going to go up but 13,000 completions in a metropolitan area like Houston is wanted to get okay job growth is not going to be disruptive at all, that's below the long-term trend. So yes there is no question there's Houston is the best story out there right now and there's certainly a lot of activity right now predevelopment activity going on in Houston.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning down there and echoing John's comment, Alex, congrats on your timing on that debt issuance.
Alex Jessett: Thanks.
Alexander Goldfarb: So two questions here, the first just going back to DC the common market sentiment is that Amazon is going to pick Crystal City for HQ2. So just curious your thoughts on one the impact to your portfolio and then two just longer-term DC seems to be a great developers market not a great operators market, so your view is that Amazon announces it and suddenly all the developers do is ramp up and therefore the landlords really don't get the benefit or you think there may be some longer-term benefit for the landlords?
Ric Campo: Yes, so my take first of all I hope that would be perfectly -- hope you're right on, they are right and the prognosticators are right on Amazon that would be, that would be a great, great benefit to us and a lot of other people. We have a decent size footprint that would be impacted by that location decision no question about it. And as to the point on DC Metro it really hasn't been as much a supply challenge in DC Metro over the last couple of years, it just has been weaker job growth. I mean if you look at what's coming this year and we got about 10,000 completions in DC Metro in 2018 that looks like that ramps up a little bit to around 12,000 next year and then back down to 2020. So 100,13,010 [ph] in the entire DC Metro area that's not historically that wouldn't be real troublesome on the supply side. The challenge has been that if you look at job growth it looks like 2019 is on Witten's numbers is about 39,000 and yes that dropped to 22,000 in 2020. Now obviously Amazon is a game changer for all of that but unlike many of our other markets, it's really not high for supply in DC that's been limiting the ability to push rents there at the pace of the rest of our portfolio it's primarily been on the job side.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is your comments on preference for development versus acquisition seem to be sort of consistent with what's been going on in practicality but you guys went raised money over a year ago to go out and buy a bunch of stuff, that's proven more difficult, do you think that the jump in rate will spur some of these merchant guys who want to sell quicker just given how rising rates could impact their IRRs and maybe it's made their decision advance their decision or your sense is that the rise in interest rates will not change the pace that the merchant guys sell their product?
Ric Campo: Last year, we thought that might -- that would happen in 2018 and obviously it didn't. If you look at about the stats on sales in 2017 there was the number of multifamily sales was down from 2016 and we thought it was going to be down again for 2018 and turned out to be way up for 2018, so that could happen. I think there is definitely more merchant builder stress out there just from the standpoint of they've got product they need to sell to be able to reload their balance sheet because in the past like if you go back to sort of pre-Great Recession, the most merchant builders just keep building no matter what because they could guarantee debt with no tangible assets on their balance sheet and the banks will let them do it. Today the banks won't let them do it, so they do have to clear the asset in order to be able to reload their pipelines. So that is one difference that could impact and have the ability to get merchant builders at least more constructive on the selling at prices that we want to buy at. On the other hand we thought that that was going to happen in 2018 and didn’t what's happening what we're also seeing though is sort of instead of selling people refinancing and you could refinance a merchant builder deal with a high margin basically take all of your cash out including your equity and be sitting with a sort of more higher leverage transaction without any equity in it, so a fair number of them are doing that as well it's just holding the assets and putting them in a sort of a longer holding pattern. So I think that ultimately the merchant builders do have to sell. The question is are there going to be enough buyers to take up that inventory and I think right now there are. So that's why we decided to lower our acquisitions guidance and increase our development and when you think about our -- when we raise that capital, we talked about $500 million of acquisitions, so we just changed the mix a bit even though that does change the timing of when we are able to enjoy those yields but I think that might be the case in 2019 as well just given the capital, well the capital issue.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney.
Rob Stevenson: All right. Good morning guys. Alex how much of the same-store expense savings are moving down from your 3.5% down to about 3% guidance for the year it’s the timing issue versus stuff that you expect to be sustainable into 2019 and beyond?
Alex Jessett: Yes, I mean, none of it is timing at all. It's as I said on a couple of past calls, you've got a couple of things that are occurring, number one people are just not getting sick as often which is really good news for all of us. But the second thing is, is that we're becoming very efficient on our R&M and our unit turnover cost and there is no reason to believe that that should not be easily replicated in future years.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. So like none of the savings here is from property taxes that could wind up spiking back up in 2019?
Alex Jessett: No. And in fact if you think about where we are, we started the year with a 4% same-store expense growth and we had assumed that property taxes will be 4.2%. We now assume property tax is going to be 6% and yet we're at 3.05% same-store growth, so property taxes were worse than we expected but all other categories were far better than we expected overcoming this unexpected increase in Atlanta property taxes.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then, Keith, of your better performing markets which have the smallest gap between new lease and renewal growth rates, I mean which are the ones that are closest to an inflection point there of meeting or possibly crossing in the future?
Keith Oden: So I would of our better performing markets the gap on new leases and renewals is falls up, every one of them falls in favor of renewals versus new leases. So and it's been that way for a number of quarters. If you kind of look out to, at our 2018 numbers, I think I gave you in my opening commentary were 5.5% on renewals and 3.1% on new leases. So I'm looking at the detail and I don't see a single one where we're upside down one way or the other on renewals versus there may be one or two markets but the preponderance of our markets continue to have renewals above new leases and my guess is that that probably tightens in 2019 but I'd be surprised to see if you had a shift in many of our markets between new leases and renewals.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank.
Trent Trujillo: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one of your peers indicated that some of its markets haven't yet started the normal seasonal decline in rent growth that usually comes in the fourth quarter, so are you seeing this in a noticeable way across any of your markets in your portfolio and if so what would you attribute that to?
Ric Campo: Yes. And I think ours looks like it has historically and in fact I think you -- just you look at the data that that we have so far in October we're basically flat on new leases and 5% on renewals. So I think that that's typical and that's what we would expect and if you look at our -- kind of look at our budget what -- how we would have budgeted for the fourth quarter, that's pretty much in line with where we would expect to be. So no big revisions from our original forecast in our portfolio, so I'm not sure who that is maybe they have a very different footprint than we do, but we're seeing what we historically see in the fourth quarter.
Trent Trujillo: Okay, that's fair. And turning back to Houston just specific to the McGowan development, can you remind us where concession stand on that asset and what merchant builders are offering competitively in that area?
Ric Campo: Sure. The developments today in Downtown and Midtown and probably the Galleria are so offering one to two months free plus or minus it depends on the unit type and what have you that's very typical in the market still. And it’s interesting because that sometimes people will say well wait a minute, how are you growing your same-store portfolio revenue when there's too much free in the development market and it’s interesting because on the one hand, the people would expect that to translate into the marketplace but when you think about the number of units you have to actually lease and maintain your 95% plus or minus occupancy, it's not that many units. So you don't have a big pressure to give concessions in an existing portfolio when a development is say 50% occupied and every day it goes by without increasing that occupancy that revenue from that unit is lost, sort of like an airplane seat when it takes off. So merchant builders are very quick to the trigger on giving concessions and filling them up as soon as they can.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Alan [indiscernible] of Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey good morning. When we look at your lease spreads it seems to imply that same-store should be accelerating, the guides implies that 4Q is slowing, I'm not asking for a 2019 guide but are leasing spreads telling us the right thing or is it possible that occupancy or other factors that same-store can flow in 2019 while leasing spreads accelerate?
Ric Campo: Yes, again I'm going to refer back to the overall guidance that Witten has in his numbers if you look at overall U.S. he has rates going up about 50 basis points, you look at Camden's portfolios specific in our 15 markets, the same 50 basis point acceleration into 2019. So I think at the aggregate level and obviously you are going to have ups and downs and variances among based on the supply conditions in each of those -- each of our markets. But overall his judgment is, is that rents will be up our revenues are going to be up about 50 basis points in 2019 over 2018. We will know -- I will know better in a month or two how well our numbers are correlated with or not correlated with Ron's, but that's kind of his forecasting and he's we do back testing on all the stuff that he does and he's been pretty good over the years in terms of his forecast for revenue growth. So as we sit here today, that's kind of the best evidence that we have that looks like are in the Camden portfolio we should see -- we could in fact see a reacceleration in revenues in 2019.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFG.
Karin Ford: Hi, good morning. Ric, I think you mentioned in your opening comments in migration into your markets from higher cost in tax regions, do you see any evidence of that and can you just talk about how you think that could contribute to demand?
Ric Campo: Sure the evidence is clear. If you look at just pull the last census numbers for the last 10 years, you'll see that domestic and migration -- domestic out migration of California is negative. I mean it’s just the whole -- you have people leaving California going to Phoenix going to Austin, Texas, and other places and you -- even though population has not declined in California for example obviously California is a good example because it’s so big. And it's easy to talk about; you've had increases in population in California primarily driven by immigration and births and taken down by out migration. And so those numbers are readily available via the Census Bureau and then when we just anecdotally when we talk to our Phoenix folks for example that will be a good example, we have a lot of folks that are running apartments that are from California. And if you look at another one, another interesting stat would be the cost of U-Haul, it's cheap to get to rent U-Haul from Phoenix to go to California but more expensive from California to Phoenix because they end up with all these excess U-Haul trucks in these markets and so it's definitely something that's going on and it's supporting our demand in our markets.
Karin Ford: Have you seen? I'm sorry, go ahead.
Alex Jessett: Yes, just some numbers around the migration because it is something that we track pretty carefully because it's been -- it has been a huge part of our story in terms of the 15 markets we operate in. So for 2019 across Camden's 15 markets its projected that we're going to get an overall in migration of 447,000 people into Camden's 15 markets. Now within that, the thing is interesting is we have two cities where it's projected to be negative and one is L.A. at an outmigration of 54,000, the other is Orange County with an outmigration of about 7,000. So those are -- that's included in the 447 positive, so we have two markets that without migration both in California, the other one is just Ric's point about Phoenix, so in 2019 L.A. is projected to have 54,000 outmigration, Phoenix is projected to have 54,000 in migration in 2019. So this is really an important part of the overall movement of people and to in large part to lower cost areas and less regulation and then I think that these numbers probably don't get to the impact of the overall -- the salt limitations on these high property in state tax states. So it will be interesting to see.
Karin Ford: That's great color. And then just my last question you mentioned that you improved your efficiency on turnover that's reflected in expenses but if you returned back to more normalized and average turnover levels, do you have any sense for how much that could impact expense growth?
Alex Jessett: So we've been at this level of turnover now for a couple of years, we have to do some math around if there was some sort of dramatic increase in move-outs than what the impact would be. But I would tell you this point if sort of looking at trends, the trend seems to be that we're going to have lower turnover for longer based on what we've seen last couple of years.
Ric Campo: And part of our expense control has been, as I mentioned in my beginning my comments was our attack to run rate initiative. And that’s about -- it's about focusing on small ticket items onsite and in our corporate office. That sort of just gets done because we've been doing it for a long time and it's really focusing in on and making decisions on a lot of small stuff that adds up to actually have pretty nice, nice number. And that focus even though we are focused on our operating expenses all the time this is sort of a intense focus on making sure that that every dollar that's going out the door is either a revenue enhancing dollar or marketing dollar or one that can be justified from a business perspective and that's had a really big impact and our teams have done a great job sort of embracing that concept. And I think often times when times are good, you get a little bit, it's just a little easier to have expenses that kind of creep on and we're now at the point where our teams have really embraced this attack to run rate and the idea is it's the run rate right, it's not let's just save money this quarter or let's just save money this year, let's make sure that it's permanent and that it's in the run rate, so that 2019 benefits from it as well.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho.
Rich Anderson: So, Ric or anyone when you think people are trying to get 2019, let me see if I can get 2020 guidance out of you? So --
Ric Campo: At least that's novel.
Rich Anderson: So what do you think about supply obviously Millennials demand at least changing as they get older, weakish single family home market and of course interest rates. When you look further out is 2018 let's pass 2019 and go into 2020 and 2021, do you see the business basically better three or four years from now than it is today or is it sort of sideways moving because it's our sense that the days of high-single-digit growth at the multifamily REITs even in the best of times is probably over and it's more like a CPI plus type of business, wondering how you feel about kind of all these longer-term observations?
Ric Campo: I feel pretty good about our business long-term or mid-term; you can't go out more than 2020 or 2021. But if you think about the business, the fundamentals of the business, we're not getting disintermediated by Amazon, we're not -- we don't have issues like that single family homes still are hard to get, the average near median price of home is up, incomes are not as high are not growing as much and you have interest rates popping up, so it's made that homeownership more difficult even though from a demographic perspective we know that it's not so much the money as it is the demographic position of people. They’re waiting longer to have to have kids and get married and form households that would create demand for homes. So with that said, I think our business is going to be reasonably good for the next two or three or four years and barring any major calamity or recession or whatever, I think also that the pressure on merchant builders and development continues to be -- to be there and I think that ultimately that you will see a peak in the supply and then the supply sort of coming down in 2020, 2021, 2022 unless we have -- let's just 3.5% GDP continues and job growth continues and we have more legs up. So I feel pretty good about our business.
Rich Anderson: So 2020 better than 2018?
Ric Campo: You know, it's a hard thing to say today but I would when people ask me about how I feel about our business over the next three to five years, I feel really good about it now if we have a recession between now and then all bets are off and if something changes dramatically there but if you sort of how -- if you told me that 2018 you have the same sort of supply and demand economics, the same job growth with interest rates maybe up a bit, I would say that those year is going to be good for multi-family.
Keith Oden: So Rich, I would just add to one of the points that you raised which was the weakness in home sales which continues to be really puzzling or at least puzzling to a lot of the people to that on the homebuilder side of things. But I think that it shows up in our numbers in the move-out to purchase homes and you know conventional wisdom six or seven years ago was that the Great Recession was a cyclical event and that home ownership rate collapsed as a result of the housing bust in the Great Recession and that most people prognosticators, I think at the time really believed that the homeownership rate would drift back up but eventually it would get back up to the 18% or 19% in our portfolio that we historically saw before 2007. And it started, and it did, it bottoms home ownership move-out to purchase homes bottoms at about 9.7% in our portfolio which was crazy low and then it started to drift back up. But just if you look at the numbers in our portfolio over the last year, it looks like we're getting kind of compish on the move-out number and we're back down to 14.3%, we got as high as in the low 15s. But we're still so far away from what you wouldn't think as a normal move-out to purchase homes rate in our portfolio that I think you just got to start rethinking the cyclical versus secular argument in homeownership rate. And if this is where we're going to be, then the metrics that we need going forward in terms of what the new supply, how much new supply could be dealt with, how many new jobs it's going to take to maintain the demand for multi-family in the traditional range, you get to rethink all of those. I'm not telling you that, it's almost never different this time but it's been really different this time for a long time in home ownership move-outs to purchase homes and it looks right now in the data, it started to drift back down and it’s supported by the fact that I think a week ago or so, they announced one of the lowest new home sales or home sale numbers in a decade. So it’s just -- it’s an interesting time and I think that Ric's right, if you have to be on one side or other of that argument, I would prefer to be on our side of the argument.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Yes, thanks for your comments on the reasonable cadence of development starts is $300 million in acquisition volume in next year a fair betting line?
Alex Jessett: We haven't really gotten to that point yet. We've sold a lot of properties and really turned the portfolio over a big time in last three to five years. So we don't have a lot of low hanging fruit in terms of dispositions. So it really just depends on what kind of market we have next year but I don't see it being a robust acquisition here given what we're hearing and what we're seeing right now. But we haven't really summed in our guidance yet.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Some of the really competitive markets think of the Phoenixes of the world where cap rates, I don’t know if you agree or perhaps you rationally low right now, would you ever do something tactical and not a full market exit but take another truant to dispositions to sell into that competitive bid and perhaps reposition into a market outside your current footprint that you think is less or more undepreciated?
Ric Campo: Well, ultimately we have exited markets in the past right. We exited Las Vegas kind of at a time where we thought and we knew it was accelerating but because of the portfolio of quality, it was really important for us to move-out of that market. We like the markets we’re in for all the right reasons and the issue with tactical, it sort of hurts my head a little on the one hand you can take advantage of low prices but then what you do with the capital and the risk associated with the transaction, just reinvestment risk issues. If I really like the property long-term, it's hard for me to replace that property long-term, I'm taking risk of -- execution risk between getting that done, so we have lots of scenarios that go through well should we sell our lowest cap rate deals or highest cap rate deals and how does that affect us long-term and when it makes sense to do, we do given that we've sold $3 billion of properties in the last five years and done couple of billion at development and a billion of acquisitions. But so we look at that and clearly it’s sometimes it's interesting and sometimes it's not, I'm not sure what we're going to be doing over the next year or two in that regard though.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Company.
Hardik Goel: Just wanted to get more detail on the expense side, so when you look at taxes, has there been some sort of appeal success or something of that nature that's lowered the taxes as you would have expected them at the beginning of the year and what's kind of your sense of how that's going to trend?
Ric Campo: Yes. I mean once again we started the year thinking that property taxes are going to be up 4.2%, we now think they are going to be up 6%, that delta is entirely driven by higher than expected tax values in Fulton County in Atlanta. And so that sort of we're having with property taxes. I think if you're looking at year-to-date property taxes and you're trying to understand how we get to the 6%, you can't forget that in the fourth quarter of 2017, we had about a 1.05 million of property tax refunds almost entirely in Houston and that is not going to be replicated. So that’s the delta, if you’re looking at our year-to-date and you're comparing that to full-year which once again we think is still 6%.
Hardik Goel: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And just one more question on your comments regarding supply, you guys talked about better visibility and you have the ability to see further now than ever before as you look out where do you see supply really peaking, where you can say it's going to peak and then decelerate steadily is it 2020, is it 2021 where does supply go down meaningfully from?
Keith Oden: We had numbers out through 2020 and these are Witten numbers, he has got the completions in 2020 across Camden's portfolio basically flat with 2019 which is only slightly down from 2018. So if you're thinking big picture Camden’s platform, 138,000, 136, 138 is the progression of Witten through 2020. I think 2021 and 2022 would be the first years where you could have a shot at meaningfully less deliveries. And that is function of all the push and pull and pressures that Ric has described that the merchant builders are dealing with. But you know they're persistent and they're crafty and if there is a deal that can get done, they will figure out a way to do it, I just think that the math is getting so difficult and as Ric mentioned, they’re pretty stretched in terms of their total capacity to hold what they have and then start a new round even if they can get the numbers to pencil. So I think it’s possible in 2021 and 2022 you would see a meaningful pullback in supply for the first time in years.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.
Daniel Bernstein: Just don’t want to get too academic but wanted to follow-up on conversation you had with Rich, are you seeing any change in the average age of people living in your buildings and maybe the average age of people are moving out to home ownership?
Ric Campo: Well, first of all we are hearing -- seeing anecdotally more sort of baby boomer, boomers moving in and these are people that lived in suburbs whose kids are gone, they live in a big house, traffic is still pretty awful across America. So they are moving into the city and into the urban core. And we have some properties for example in Houston in the Galleria that where the average age is probably 10 years older than our average age in our portfolio primarily because the rents are much higher and you have to have somebody in their 50s who are -- who has more income to be able to pay for that high rent property. And I think one of the things that's driving that to a certain extent it's not just the traffic and the desire for people to be more walkable and more closer to amenities like the arch and things like that. But one of the things over the last 10 years that's really happened in the cycle of development is that the properties are not your 80s, 90s versions of apartments. And when those baby boomers walk in it's like a hotel all the amenities are just, really high end, the finishes are as high end as any for sale condo and so the product is more appealing to folks like that today than it was in the past, so it's a definitely a migration. If you look at the statistics too on the propensity to rent, propensity to rent is always very high up until the mid 30s and then it starts falling off and then you have a propensity to own. And over the last seven or eight years the propensity to rent is increased for people over 50 and into their 60s and that is the -- that is a change. Fannie Mae actually just did a study that you can find on the NHMC website or Fannie Mae website that shows that increased propensity to rent for older people. And I think that is that's definitely a positive for our business there is no question about that. In terms of average age I think it's pretty much hasn’t really changed dramatically maybe a year or so here and there. And then in terms of people moving out to buy houses that because it's so low today. The age is definitely increased for people to buy houses, because they have student debt they have to pay off and issues like that have limited their ability to buy a house.
Daniel Bernstein: Yes, I didn't know how much you track that specifically relative to the current situation, so just asking about that. The other question I had was involves the -- you had a conversation on the gold cap rates and I agree with everything you said the interest rates are kind of the last thing are going to move the cap rates. Have you seen increase in leverage that buyers -- that world private equity is using to get their IRRs and I mean easy to track the GSTs, it's easy to track the banks it's not as easy to track though actual LTVs that are in the non-bank financials out there, I don't know if you had any thoughts on whether leverage is increasing, LTV's are increasing for those private equity buyers.
Ric Campo: I think the answer is no. I think that the leverage is non increasing, people aren’t using more leverage to get yields as a matter of fact there's a whole lot of very low leverage and no leverage buyers in the marketplace, where they're not putting any debt on the property. So I do think as far as when they do leverage more than half of all the loans that are getting done in multifamily are floating rate loans and when you look at the at the forward curve on LIBOR for example you can buy really achieve caps, so people are on a relative basis so people are floating more than they're fixing and their leverage levels are not as high as they -- as you would normally expect.
Daniel Bernstein: Yes, now just think you would be going up at this point in the cycle and get more cap rates are that's good color. I appreciate it. I'll hop off.
Operator: Thank you. And there are no more questions at the present time. So I'd like to return the call to Ric Campo for any closing comments.
Ric Campo: Great, we appreciate you being on the call today and we will be at NAREIT in the next couple of weeks and I'm sure see a lot of you there. So thank you very much and see you at NAREIT.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Ric Campo: Thanks Kim, and good morning. Today's on hold music was selected by Austin Wurschmidt and his team at KeyBanc who won our contest on last quarter's call. Austin picked up on the accelerated pace of M&A activity in the REIT Industry in 2018 with eight deals totaling $56 billion in equity valuation either closed or pending. That's a lot of collaboration which led to his theme of famous collaborations of musical variety. Thank you Austin and your team. And for this quarter's contest be the first e-mail Kim Callahan 4 artists and/or bands featured on today's on hold music, and you'll have the honor of selecting our music for our next earnings call. Camden team members delivered solid earning results this quarter. We continue to create value through our development business and will be at the high end of our 2018 starts guidance. The acquisition environment is challenging with high demand driving higher prices and lower cap rates more than we anticipated in the beginning of the year. Rising interest rates and modest growth rates have not had any effect on buyer demand in the multifamily business. We've held our acquisition guidance at $500 million for the year, but have moved $300 million into the fourth quarter. We still believe we'll hit our acquisition targets while maintaining our discipline by the end of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks Ric. Today marks Camden's 100th quarterly earnings call and Ric and I've had the privilege to be on every one of them. A lot has changed in the REIT world over the last 25 years, but one thing that has always been true is that good numbers make for good earnings calls. I'd like to acknowledge and thank our Camden team members for producing another quarter of good numbers for us to discuss on our call today. We are indeed pleased with results this quarter, which were better than our expectations for both the quarter and year-to-date. Overall conditions remain healthy across our across our entire portfolio. Sequential revenue growth was up 1.8% led by Corpus Christi at 6.4%. And importantly, in second place was DC Metro of 2.6%. Every other market posted a positive sequential result. This was a very routine quarter for Camden and with this in mind and the fact that we're at the end of earnings season, I'll keep my remarks brief to allow for more time to discuss what interest you all about the quarter. Starting with same store results. Revenue growth was 3.2% for the quarter and 3.3% year-to-date. Second quarter revenue growth was led by Corpus at 4.54%, Orlando by 5.2%, Phoenix 4.7%, Tampa at 4.5%, Raleigh at 4.3% and Houston at 3.7%. As we expected, our two largest markets posted better revenue growth compared to the first quarter with Houston up 3.7%, DC Metro up 2.5%. Rents on new leases and renewals continue to look encouraging versus our original guidance. In the second quarter, new leases were up 3.3% and renewals were up 5.9% that produced a blended growth rate of 4.5% versus 3.3% in second quarter of 2017 and 2.7% for last quarter. July prelims are running at 4.8 % for new leases, 5.6% for renewals for a blended rate of 5.2%. As we expected, new lease pricing has seen good improvement during our peak leasing season. August, September renewal offers are going out on at about a 6.1% increase. Our occupancy rate averaged 95.8% in the second quarter versus 95.4% in the first quarter and was above 95.3% from the second quarter of last year. Our July occupancy rate actually reached 96% slightly better than our 95.71% last July. Our net turnover rate continues to see all-time lows at 49% for the second quarter, and 44% year-to-date. The lower turnover rate in tandem with our historically low number of move outs to purchase homes continues to contribute to our strong and somewhat better than expected operating results. I'll turn the call now over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks Keith. And before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the second quarter of 2018, we began construction on Camden Lake Eola, a $120 million 360 unit story 13 storey building in a Lake Eola sub market of Orlando, Florida. During the second quarter, we also began leasing at our Camden McGowan station development in Houston. Our Camden North End development in Phoenix and our Camden Washingtonian development in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  In the third quarter, we began construction on Camden Buckhead in Atlanta. This $160 million, 365 unit developments will be the second phase of our existing Camden Paces community and will consist of one 8 and 9 storey concrete building. Previous cost estimates and our supplement for this development were based upon the construction of one four-story wood frame wrap building. Due to these projects irreplaceable location in the heart of Buckhead and the success of our Camden - of our phase one Camden phases high-rise, we've made the decision to significantly enhance this development including moving to two type one concrete high-rise structures. Turning to financial results. Last night we reported Funds From Operations for the second quarter of 2018 of a $116.1 million, or $1.19 per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.01 per share. Our $0.01 per share outperformance for the second quarter resulted primarily from approximately $0.05 in higher same-store revenue and a $0.05 in higher non same-store net operating income which was primarily driven by better than expected results from both our recent acquisitions, and our development communities. In the aggregate, our same-store operating expenses were in line with expectations, although property taxes were $1 million higher than anticipated entirely due to Atlanta property tax valuations. This negative tax variance was entirely offset by lower than anticipated expenses in almost all other categories, particularly lower repair and maintenance expense and lower levels of self insured employee health care costs. Turning to property taxes. Fulton County, Georgia which includes Atlanta significantly raised their valuations for residential assets. The valuation increase for our entire Atlanta Metro portfolio was approximately 28% with a 41% increase for Fulton County communities. This Atlanta valuation increase was not anticipated and will result in $2 million of additional property tax expense in 2018. As is our policy, we accrued six months of this increase or $1 million in the second quarter to catch up. The remaining $1 million will be booked over the rest of 2018. We have already filed appeals on these valuation increases. However, due to the amount of property owners in Atlanta that will be contesting their valuations this year, it is unlikely we will get any settlements before the end of 2018. If we are successful with our appeals, we'll book the refunds as an offset the property tax expense at the time in which the refund is received. We are now anticipating full-year property taxes for our same-store portfolio to increase approximately 6%. We believe that this unexpected property tax increase in Atlanta will be entirely offset by actual and future anticipated cost savings in our other operating expense categories and have therefore left the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance unchanged at 3.5%. We've updated and revised our 2018 full year same store revenue, and FFO guidance based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our same store revenue performance has been better than expected for the first six months of the year, driven primarily by higher levels of occupancy. Based upon our trends and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing the midpoint of our full-year revenue growth from 3% to 3.15%. This increased revenue guidance and the maintenance of our expense guidance results in increase to our 2018 same-store NOI guidance from 2.7% to 3%. Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2018 FFO guidance by $0.02 from $4.72 to $4.74 per share. This $0.02 per share increase is the result of our anticipated 30 basis points or $0.015 increase in 2018 same store operating results. $0.05 of this increase occurred in the second quarter with the remainder anticipated over the third and fourth quarters. And $.015 of additional non same store outperformance. $0.05 of this increase also occurred in the second quarter with the remainder anticipated over the third and fourth quarters.  This $0.03 aggregate increase is partially offset by $0.01 from delayed acquisition timing. Our current guidance now assumes approximately $300 million of additional acquisitions all in the fourth quarter. If we do not complete any future acquisitions in 2018, the net result would be a further $0.01 per share reduction. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2018. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.17 to $1.21. The midpoint of $1.19 is in line with our second quarter results as expected sequential increases in revenue are offset by the typical seasonality of our operating expenses. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt to EBITDA 4x, a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.5x, secured debt to gross real estate assets at 10%, 81% of our assets unencumbered and 93% of our debt at fixed rates. We ended the quarter with no balances outstanding on unsecured lines of credit and $64 million of cash on hand. We have $633 million of developments currently under construction with $283 million remaining to fund over the next two years. Later in 2018, we will repay at maturity $175 million of secured floating rate debt with a current interest rate of 2.9% and will repay at par $205 million a secured fixed rate debt with an interest rate of approximately 5.8%. We currently anticipate issuing four $400 million of unsecured debt late in 2018 at a rate of approximately 3.8%. In anticipation of offering, we entered into $400 million a forward starting swap effectively locking in the 10-year treasury at approximately 2.6%. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Keith Oden: Yes. Before we take our first question, we do have a winner in the contest. John Kim of BMO Capital Markets was the first to get four correct artists. We look forward to working with you John on next quarter's music. Now we'll open it up for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Griffin: Hi, there. This is a Michael Griffin in for Nick. First question on Houston for the merchant build product. Are you still seeing concessions or has vacancy dissipated in the leasing environment meaningfully improved?
Ric Campo : On the merchant build product, we have --we continue to see concessions, and it's just very typical in this kind of environment. It's interesting because the market is very bifurcated from that perspective. So just to give you an example on our Camden McGowan station project, we are 30% leased after opening up in the first quarter so our velocity is very good, but the concession environment is basically two months free in that product. The --when you think about the operating portfolio overall, 9,000 apartments that we have plus or minus in Houston, our operating portfolio is doing really well from a revenue growth perspective. But merchants builders are very typical in when they start out with an empty building, they focus on pushing the occupancy as fast and as hard as they can, and their view is that free rent gets you there and it's a very typical thing that is used in the marketplace. So it hasn't negatively impact the overall market. It just the development market and once the once the project's released up obviously the concessions are hoped to burn off given the supply situation the fact that there's only 7,000 units being delivered this year. And then less next year, we expect that the free rent will basically dissipate by probably end of this year maybe middle of next year in the new development properties.
Michael Griffin: Great, thanks. And one other question I see here that the estimated cost of the Buckhead deal on the development pipeline increased by $35 million. What's driving that and how does it impact the expected stabilized yield and when would you expect that to start?
Alex Jessett: So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the previous cost estimates for that development was based upon a four story wood frame wrap building, and due to its location Buckhead and the success of our adjacent Camden Paces high-rise, we made the decision to significantly enhance that development including moving to two type one concrete high-rise structures.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shirley Wu: Hi, this is actually Shirley Wu on for Sanabria. So I want to touch on Houston a little bit more. For the back half of 2018, what do you think will be the trajectory or the path for occupancy comp this year? And also what's the range of your occupancy losses built into guidance for second half?
Keith Oden : I didn't get the second part of that question, Shirley. So let me address the first part first which is the on Houston and sort of the trajectory. We will have some very difficult occupancy comps in Houston in the fourth quarter as you -- some of you may recall, we actually at one point last year as a result of the aftermath of the hurricane Harvey, we actually hit 99% occupied in the fourth quarter. And obviously we'll be nowhere close to that. So we had -- while we continue to make good gains, our new leases have picked up since the beginning of the year. And we're basically up about 1% in the second quarter. Our renewals --we're getting running 5% to 6% on renewals in Houston. We do expect to see that new lease rate continue to tick up throughout the end --from now through the end of the year, but offsetting that will be the fact that we'll be nowhere near 99% occupied. I think we close out closed out July at about 95.5% occupied in Houston, which is that's more typical, a more typical occupancy rate. So we're likely to see something more akin to that as we roll out through the end of the year. And then we'll continue to get better results on the new leases and renewals. And I didn't hear this -- I'm sorry didn't hear the second part of your questions.
Shirley Wu: So I was just wondering in terms of occupancy losses is that built into your guidance and as I mostly focus on 4Q like you were saying or is it like a bit in 3Q as well?
Keith Oden: Well it's not occupancy losses but occupancy relative to our same store results last year. It's obviously going to be much less probably about 350 basis points plus or minus less than what our occupancy was at this time than the fourth quarter of last year, but we're not projecting occupancy losses from where we are today throughout the end of the year. It's just that we're going to have a really tough comp in the fourth quarter, late third and into the fourth quarter of 2018.
Shirley Wu: Got it, thanks for the color, also one more question for a new and renewal. Could I get the 2Q numbers for your portfolio across your different markets?
Keith Oden: So for second quarter new leases 3.3%, renewals 5.9%, the blended rates 4.5%.
Shirley Wu: Okay. Do you have a market breakup?
Keith Oden: Yes. But we operate in 15 markets if you would -- we'll give you that offline but going through those it take me --we don't - I don't need - we don't even get in that level of detail on the call, but they are available and you can get them offline.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning. I was just curious if you could give a sense on how 2019 supply outlook is shaping up as one of your peers had indicated supply grows will be down in the high teens next year. And I was curious if you were seeing similar decline.
Keith Oden : So our two data providers are Wheaton and RealPage that we have, we look at completions for 2018-2019 and honestly that there's not a nickels worth a difference in their forecast between 2018 and 2019. Wheaton is basically at 138,000 deliveries and I'm talking only in Camden's market, it's not nationally but only in Camden's markets. And he's got that drop into 136 in 2018. RealPage numbers a little bit less than that at 142 in 2018 and drops to 140. So you're less than 1% difference between the two data providers that we have on what we think completions will be between 2018 and 2019. So I think that both of them at least in our conversations within they have attempted to capture what it would has been a phenomenon that's been going on for two years now, which is the delay in getting completions to the finish line, but they think they've made their best guess that things that may shift between --projected 2018 completions that roll over into 2019. So we'll see how good they were able to forecast that but it's certainly been a trend for the last two years. My guess is it's going to continue and they tell us that they've made their best guess factoring in delays of 2018 and 2019.  But I think for our purposes from the standpoint of our planning, we're assuming 2018 and 2019 are roughly equivalent across our platform.
Ric Campo : With the exception of Houston obviously. That's just a different animal given the nature of Houston when supply is just falling off the edge of the earth in 2018 and 2019.
Keith Oden: Yes. They're basically that we've got Wheaton --it got 2018 at 7,000 apartments so that drops to about 6,000 in 2019 for Houston.
Ric Campo : So in historically those are crazy low numbers for Houston.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, appreciate the detail there. And then separately, you talked about the competitiveness in the acquisition in the transaction market, but it sounds like you're pretty comfortable with your acquisition guidance. So we're just curious what gives you that level of confidence and you have anything under contract today?
Ric Campo : Well what gives us the confidence is that we're working on lots of transactions, and while we don't really talk about what we have under contract or not at this point level in the game. We feel that we'll be able to hit that target by the end of the year. It is -- it was somewhat surprising to us that with the 10 year hitting 3% and markets prices being where they are that there wasn't a little less sort of frothiness in the market, but like I said in my beginning -- in my comments that hasn't been the case. And people are either lowering their terminal IRR numbers to get to where they're going, but our specific the box that we're looking for is newer construction with below replacement cost with some imbedded concessions. So that we can grow those cash flows going forward, And it's just harder to find. There's still a massive bid for value-add and --good news for us is that we're not really looking at value add. We're looking for that sort of a different product, but there is still a huge bid out there for any multifamily. I think part of it stems from the whole issue of this is the 10years it's three 3% or 3.5% because we have great growth going on in the country. And you have inflation sort of picking up some -- the idea that multifamily re-prices pretty much every day their product and the leases roll over on average of 8% to 10% of the whole portfolio rolls every month. Some investors are banking on higher inflation and therefore cash flow is growing faster than cap rates rising. If you do have longer-term interest rates rise. So that's just getting them over the hump on multifamily sides hotels, it's the best inflation hedge as long as you're growing the economy and not having sort of stagflation which doesn't look like that's on horizon.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning down there. Just two questions. First Ric or Keith on California just given it's about 8% of your portfolio. Do you have any sense in your markets there, the municipalities what their sense is for if Costa Hawkins is repealed, if you think that any of your markets will face rent control measures or you feel pretty good with where your communities are right now and understanding the issues especially as it revolves around vacancy decontrol?
Keith Oden : Yes. So, Alex the two things, the two comments. One would be they are sort of the state level initiative that there's a lot of attention on right now. And we certainly are participating in the fighting the good fight on the repeal effort at the state level. I'm sort of -- if you put a gun at my head I'm probably thinking that the state level initiative may actually get through, but that's not really where the game is won or lost on this issue, it's going at municipal level which you're correct to point out. Obviously, you have --you got a different dynamic in San Diego, Orange County, and Inland Empire than you do in Northern California and then LA County. So there was a piece done by one of the good analyst firms and I'm not going to mention the name, but it's pretty well done and it stratifies all of the REIT holdings in California by municipality and sort of assigns a high risk to low risk value to those and in our portfolio only about 10% of Camden's assets fell into what would be called a high risk bucket or a municipal level adoption of some kind of rent control measure. So now 10% of our --11% of our NOI and roughly 10% of that's in the high-risk bucket. So I think our specific exposure is pretty limited to the Costa Hawkins thing. But obviously it's a huge thing. There's a lot of attention. We're participating with all the other REITs and NAREIT and MHC but there's a lot of energy on both sides of this issue in California. And it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. I guess it makes you happy that you're Texas based. And then the second question is Denver. Suddenly it's become everyone's popular market. You guys have been there a long time you never left, but I recently haven't seen as much on the investment side there. So what are your thoughts on Denver? And then overall I think your footprint is much broader than just Denver property you guys extend out. So are you thinking about the market any differently and how you invest there? Meaning maybe concentrate at more infill or you like the market as a broad market to invest in.
Ric Campo : We like the market as a broad market to invest in. If you look at what we've been doing with our developments, our developments have been have been transit- oriented development. We currently have a development underway in RiNo which is the River North Area which is right adjacent to downtown. The challenge that we've seen in the -- and trying to get more urban in Denver is that it is sort of hurts my head paying sub for cap rates for new development there, and that's what they're tricking at today. So we like where we are in Denver, and our properties-- so we have a nice balance between new transit-oriented development, some urban and then suburban. So that when you do have a correction in the Denver market some day we have a balance between A and B properties and suburban and urban properties, but generally Denver is definitely on everybody's a list of getting into, and if you liked for long time for lots of reasons and continues to be a good market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Beyond the Buckhead development, how many of the other pipeline communities are you planning to start in the second half of this year? And where are at this point you think stabilize returns are for the current pipeline and then on stuff that you would start sure?
Ric Campo : So the starts that we've announced including the bucket is we might start one more, but it would be right at the end of the year maybe beginning of next year. And so our pipeline with the ones we've announced were at $280 million plus or minus and just really close towards $300 million guidance. In terms of yields, clearly development yields have come down from some pretty lofty levels that they were at. And our yields today instead of sort of seven and some change there are six and some change. And so construction costs continue to rise 4% to 8% maybe 10% in some markets, and rents are going up 3%. So that definitely has compressed those yields. On the other hand, we have still 150 to 200 basis point positive spread between our going in yields versus what we can buy going in yields from an acquisition perspective. So you still have a nice spread for taking a development risk.
Rob Stevenson: Okay and then, Alex, given your comments about property taxes, you talked about how successful Camden's been over the last three years or so in terms of winning property tax appeals. I mean you guys contest everything and so therefore your appeal win rate is low. Are you guys making just sort of conscious efforts to appeal the egregious ones and sort of when you do appeal what you're sort of winning percentage there?
Alex Jessett : Yes, absolutely. So we don't appeal every single thing but we do appeal a lot. And actually in getting some form of reduction we were typically about 70% effective. So it's a pretty good winning rate.
Rob Stevenson: And then in that 70% I mean what's the magnitude. I mean is its just getting a little bit. I mean is it a lot I mean how significant does it --is that negotiation or is that sort of movement between what you get assessed at and what you end up wind up paying on an annual basis.
Alex Jessett : Yes. So we set target rates for every single community that we own. And when we say 70% we're shooting to get to that target rate, obviously, it's never perfect but we get pretty close to it.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: I'm still riding the emotional high winning your contest. Thank you so much. 
Ric Campo : Oh you'll get over it.
John Kim: It's made my week for sure. The 4.5% blended rate you got in the second quarter, it's trending higher in July. Do you think that 5.2% is something that you can achieve the rest of the quarter? And what are you assuming as far as rental lease growth to achieve the midpoint of your same store revenue guidance?
Keith Oden: Yes. The July numbers are probably end up being in the high-water mark for the year because you've got-- you got markets like Dallas, Austin and South Florida that are trailing away as we go through the year. And then you've got Houston which is going to be a real interesting comp in the --into the third and fourth quarter. So my guess is the 5.2% in July probably ends up being the high-water mark, and our guidance right now for the year is 3.15 on revenues, so where we think any of you -- the implication of that is that we're about 3% plus or minus in the back half the year, and that's all seems about right to me.
John Kim: Okay and then Alex mentioned the $400 million of unsecured debt that you expect to raise. It sounds like part of that is to repay the debt maturing next year, but as far as the remaining $644 million expiring, how do you expect to refinance that?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So we've got a lot of options to how we're going to do that. Obviously, we're looking at the unsecured market and looking at various tenures, and then we always have the ability to do dispositions if it's appropriate as well. So we're still working through our strategy on exactly how we intend to refinance the rest of that debt.
John Kim: Could you give pricing levels on secured debt versus the unsecured?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So unsecured versus secured, so the easiest way to think about it is on a -- if you don't walk in your rates which we already have the spread for us on a ten-year unsecured is somewhere right around 110 basis points. And if you went to Fannie Mae for instance, Fannie Mae is going to be sort of that in the 200 basis point spread. LifeCos today are actually your very best option out there. LifeCos are trying to try to build business and you can probably get a LifeCos deal done about 120 over.
John Kim: Great, thank you.
Ric Campo : One thing I will mention though is we --even though you can get some secured debt we are an unsecured borrower, and generally we will --unless there's something really wacky going on in the unsecured market we're going to stay an unsecured borrower, and one of the things that happens with this refinance is that we get rid of a lot of secured debt that we put in place during the financial crisis. If you remember how we did that secured debt, we went out and borrowed money from Fannie and Freddie and bought our unsecured bonds back at a discount. And now with where we are in the cycle we're going to recycle that capital with new unsecured debt that will take our credit metrics even better by getting rid of a lot of unsecured debt that we have on - or secured debt that we have on our balance sheet at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin of Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Hey, good morning, I wanted to touch on Southern California briefly. It looked like while revenue growth is still strong there, it looks like it decelerated a bit sequentially in both, the LA Orange County, San Diego, Inland Empire markets. And I was just curious is that the result of pockets of supply? Is a result of sort of a tangential effect of more urban supply? What are the dynamics driving that?
Keith Oden: Yes. So in LA for example and I'll give you LA and Orange County; in LA, it looks like 2018 we're going to end up getting around 60,000 jobs this year. And that's against about 14,000 new apartments. So that's relatively in line, a little bit of pressure implied. If you go out into 2019 in LA, the drop -- jobs are forecast to drop to about 40,000 but unfortunately the supply maintains pretty constant at about 14,000 additional apartments. So it's just the ramp of supply that's finally getting to the marketplace in LA.  Similar story in Orange County, in 2018 it looks like we'll get about 30,0000 jobs and we will have to absorb about 7,000 apartments in 2018 and the math is pretty similar in 2019. So from my perspective our portfolio is actually doing pretty well, and we're pleased with the performance. It's actually outperforming what our original plan was. And some of that has to do with our location is just not nearly as impacted by the high levels of deliveries that are going on across the Southern California platform.
Drew Babin: Great, that helps. And then one more maybe more conceptual question on the concept of replacement cost. I think bull would say replacement --you're buying assets in a discount to replacement cost, replacement cost is probably only going to trend up with tear ups and just more inflation in materials, labor cost things like that. A bear might say that replacement cost is sort of artificially elevated right now kind of fluctuates over time maybe even more volatile than rents over a long period of time. And I guess I'm --if you could kind of give both sides of the argument and kind of why you look at that with regard to acquisition average opportunities as a benchmark since it is a bit of a moving target.
Ric Campo : Right. I agree with what you just said for sure. But the way we sort of look at it in this prism and that is since we have a robust development business, if I can build it and build it today at a cost that is higher than what I can buy it at then today -- we look at it that way saying, okay, we know what it will cost us to build and if I can buy it at a lower price of what it can cost me to build then that makes a lot of sense to me. On the flip side, if you buy it at above replacement cost and I look at that and, say, gee, in Atlanta, I know exactly what it's costing us to build our second phase of Buckhead. Why would I buy a property across the street from one I can build when I can build it at a cheaper price per door and per square foot than the one people are buying across the street? So to me it's more about our ability to develop and understand those costs. And I get why at some point you argument on the bull or the bear side will rule the day, but from our perspective if we're going to commit capital I want to commit capital. I'd rather develop my own properties than buy properties that are high --that are more costly than ones I can develop.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. 
Rich Anderson: Thanks, good morning. For over 20 years and I haven't won squat. So I don't know what's going on here. So but one thing I do remember way back when there was a signal of a healthy multifamily market was when multiple --when new rents exceed --new rent growth exceeded renewal rent growth. That hasn't really happened in a while and I'm wondering if there is a systemic reason why it won't happen again or do you think that there's a chance that you could see your new rent growth cross with your renewals at some point in the next couple of years.
Keith Oden: Rich I think it's certainly possible. Some of it has to do with when you look at new and renewal rents. The question, a big part of it is what happened at the last 12 months ago when that person signed a lease. And if you're in an increasing market that's constantly increasing upwardly in rents then it doesn't surprise me greatly that you would continue to see renewals --renewal rents above new leases. The weird part or the odd part about where we have been for the last seven or eight years is you've been in a constantly increasing rent market, although the second derivative has moved around a little bit on the rate of growth, but the fact is rents have been growing for eight -straight eight or nine straight years which is unusual. So when you have -- you think about what the experience that we had in Houston with the downturn in the oil markets and rents actually going negative. There's no question that we were renewing rents in many cases at below what we were offering new rents at. And part of the part had to do with at some point you're just trying to maintain occupancy. So it depends a little bit on where you are in the cycle, but I would expect that as things continue to get as this cycle unfolds and moves into the next cycle, yes, I my guess is you'll see that happen again. 
Rich Anderson: But I am remembering correctly right that is a fair way to look at it. And then secondly on the topic of Denver, I heard what you said Ric but it's interesting that suddenly many of your peers are suddenly very optimistic about a market that's not currently maybe great today. Is there something incremental that is a common knit to all these views that are coming from people like EQR and AvalonBay taking a look at Denver or is it just the basic fundamental stuff that you described.
Ric Campo : Well I can't really get inside their investment thesis other than the broad one where companies have been pounding the table forever that coastal is where everything is right and rents never go down in San Francisco, New York. And we've always argued that we want to be in high-growth markets both population and job growth. And that over the long term will allow rents to grow and the market to grow and what happens as a byproduct of that growth is that they allow -- the municipalities allow development and then the argument is that markets overshoot from a development perspective, and the supply constraint markets don't, right. Well, we know that just isn't true anymore or at least it's more evidence today that it's not as true as it has been. And so I think if I were something that had those kinds of market dynamics, I'd look for growth and I'd look for markets that have really good long-term dynamics. And I think Denver has that. I mean it's a real-- when you think about cities that are classified as really high propensity for Millennials to go there and Denver has a lot of those really high value propositions, it's got recreation and the mountains, there's a lot of good things going on in Denver that's not --then those things are not going to change given the sort of dynamic of our renter base. So it doesn't-- I mean look at that market and say if I'm going to buy a non-coastal market it might Denver, it might be South Florida and it sort of holds to their -- they don't have to totally abandon the coastal low supply thesis with those -- with a couple of markets.
Rich Anderson: So not rolling the dice on HQ2 you're saying.
Ric Campo : I don't think you're rolling dice, HQ2 is a wild card and I don't think we can throw the dice on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel. Please go ahead. 
John Guinee: Great, thank you. Just a curiosity question Camden Buckhead, you have the total development cost last quarter as a wrap product at about a 277 a unit. And then going with type one vertical you're up to about a 438 a unit. Is there really a $160,000 a unit increase when you go from wrap to concrete?
Ric Campo : Well, there's two pieces. So the answer is yes. There's a big differential between a wrap and a concrete, no question about it. And then second when you do go to a concrete product and a high-rise product you start --you improve the interior quality of the property and the amenity space as well. So if you're trying to get a premium rent you're going to have to put in premium finishes, more than you would do --then you were doing in a wrap product. So part of it is just the differential between wrap and high-rise. Then the amenity packages and the finishes and then third between both of those that was sort of the wrap product was a placeholder and since --so it's probably not a great comp because construction costs have continued to rise and we have not tried to tweak our sort of future development numbers very much. So that number that was put in for the wrap product was put in a couple years ago. And as you've definitely had some construction price creep in that number. So that base number was probably [lowest part].
John Guinee: And then second, do you control land via options et cetera and can you get people a sense for what you might have that doesn't show up on the supplemental?
Ric Campo : We try to control land for a long period of time but it's very hard to do in this current environment. And at this point, we're working on transactions but what you see is what you get on our supplemental information right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Yes, good morning, everyone. Can we go back to the Fulton County tax increase? Were you entering this year well below your target rate? Do they overshoot or is it just a case where a municipality is trying to plug their budget using commercial real estate?
Alex Jessett: Wes, there's actually a lot of really interesting articles online where you can read about this, but effectively what happened is the State of Georgia has sued Fulton County alleging that their valuations are under market, and so this is Fulton County's way of responding to it. I will tell you this is not a Camden unique issue. In fact, a last count there is over 40,000 appeals of property tax valuations in Fulton County, that's over 8% of all property owners. And in fact, there's actually an 8% threshold where if you go over 8% of appeals, the county actually has to get the courts to certify their tax register. So this is a sort of across the board Fulton County issue. I will tell you that clearly we believe they've clearly overshot. We've filed all of our appeals, but once again if you have 40,000 appeals that they have to work through, I think it's going to be highly unlikely that we're going to get any resolution until 2019. 
Wes Golladay: Okay and then looking at the acquisition guidance be pushed to the fourth quarter. Is that just a function of developments taking longer to build maybe getting a little bit of a delivery delay pushing that the timing of a lease up acquisition later? Or is it just trying to figure out which one you want to buy?
Ric Campo : It's more trying to figure out which one we want to buy. There are too many-- we're going through more and more transactions trying to find the right one. And it's not so much a delay in deliveries. 
Wes Golladay: Okay, a real quick follow-up to that. And how many people do you run into for competition when you're trying to buy a lease? I would say I get that value add, and core may have a lot of competition but when you look at the lease such as it just a bit-ask spread or is it just a lot of people chasing these?
Ric Campo : I think it's both. You have --you clearly have --so on a value add you may have 20-30 bidders in a sort of core below for replacement cost type of asset and we might have 10 or 12 , 10 or 15, but you still have --trust me there's still a lot of competition. It is just less competition in that space, and there is in value-adds.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks. 
Ric Campo : Right. We appreciate your time today. And have a great rest of your summer. And we'll speak to you on the fall. Thank you. 
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim, and good morning. Our operating results for the first quarter were slightly better than expected. Apartment demand continues to be driven by solid job growth in our markets that exceed the national average. Supply pressure in many markets continues to be a headwind. Houston is our most improved market. Revenues are accelerating, with occupancy normalizing, as a result of Hurricane Harvey residents moving out and returning to their homes as expected. We’re happy to be able to have helped our neighbors in this difficult time for their families after the hurricane. We are now back to more normal apartment market in Houston, with an expanding economy and limited new supply coming online over the next couple of years. I am proud of our teams from all over the country that came to help get apartments ready at record speeds for people in need of housing after Harvey. Our team displayed the true spirit of Houston Strong and help communities can come together when their help is needed. We acquired two properties during the quarter, that Alex will give you more detail on in his remarks. Our guidance for the rest of the year is another $200 million to $400 million in acquisitions. The acquisition environment, however, has become a lot more competitive since the beginning of the year, with cap rates dropping at least 25% – I’m sorry, 25 basis points in our markets, driven by significant buyer interest and strong multifamily fundamentals. Our development business is continue to create significant long-term value. We plan to start the $100 million to $300 million new projects through the rest of this year. After the end of the quarter, we acquired a shovel-ready, high-rise development site in Downtown Orlando from a developer that couldn’t get their financing completed. We plan to start construction on this project this summer. Construction costs increases, continue to exceed rental rate increases in all of our markets and continue to put pressure on future development returns. All of our current projects under development are substantially brought out and are not subject to the major risk of cost increases. We maintain the strongest balance sheet in the sector, which gives us maximum financial flexibility in this part of the real estate cycle. And we have a strong Camden team that delivers an amazing customer service to our residents at create long-term shareholder value. I appreciate what our teams do every single day with our residents, and I want to thank them on this call. I’ll now turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Our first quarter revenue results were right in line with our plan and that bodes well for the balance of 2018. Overall, same-store revenues were up 3.3% and 0.3%, sequentially. Most of our markets performed as expected with 50 basis points or less variance from our first quarter budgets. Two exceptions would be Orlando and South Florida, which had a positive variance of greater than 50 basis points to the original budget, and that was good news, particularly in South Florida, we see some improvement there. The outperformance in Orlando placed it at the top of the revenue growth in the quarter at 6.2%. Tampa, Raleigh and San Diego/Inland Empire each had 5.2% growth, followed by Atlanta at 4.8% and Phoenix at 4.5%. As we expected, revenue growth was slightly below 2% in three markets, with Houston at 1.9% and Washington D.C. and D.C. Metro and Austin both at 1.6% growth. We expect better results in Houston and D.C. over the next few quarters and anticipate getting to our full year outlook of roughly 3% growth in each market. The supply pressure in Austin will continue to be a big headwind throughout 2018, and we’ll likely limit our full year growth to roughly the same as the 1.6% we achieved this quarter. Regarding rents on new leases and renewals, in the first quarter, new leases were up 1.5% and renewals were up 5.5% for a blended growth rate of 2.7% versus 1.9% in the first quarter of 2017 and 2.3% last quarter. For April, prelims look to be up 2% on new leases, 5.5% on renewals for a blended 3.5% growth. As we expected, we are seeing steady improvement from January through April on new lease pricing, and we expect this trend to continue through our peak leasing season. A good indicator of continued improvement is that our May-June renewals were sent out at an average of 6% increase. Our qualified traffic continues to support above trend occupancy levels across our platform. We averaged 95.4% occupancy in the first quarter versus 94.7% in the first quarter of 2017 and 95.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. April 2018 occupancy is trending upward to 95.7% versus 95% last year. Net turnover for the quarter continued at historically low levels of 39% versus 40% last year. Move-outs to purchased homes fell to 14.1% versus 14.9% for all of last year. That bears watching to see if it’s an outlier or a reversal of the modest upward trend that we’ve seen lately. The financial health of our residents continues to be strong as our average rent as a percentage of household income was 18.4% for the quarter, and that’s consistent with 2017 levels. Finally, we recently received notice that to the 11th consecutive year, Camden was included in FORTUNE Magazine’s list of 100 Best Places to Work. We plan this on our own behalf of the entire REIT industry as a benchmark of just how far we collectively have come in the last 25 years. I’d like to thank every Camden team member for making this possible. Your commitment to improving lives one experience at a time is why this is possible. Now I’ll turn the call over to Alex Jessett.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the first quarter of 2018, we purchased Camden Pier District, a newly constructed 358-unit 18-storey building in St. Petersburg, Florida, for approximately $127 million and Camden North Quarter, a newly constructed 333-unit, 9-storey building in Orlando, Florida, for approximately $81 million. At the time of acquisition both communities were in the process of completing lease-up, and today Camden Pier District is 93% occupied and Camden North Quarter is 88% occupied. Subsequent to quarter end, we purchased an approximate two-acre land parcel in the Lake Yale of submarket of Orlando, Florida for $11.4 million for the future development of a wholly-owned $120 million, 360-unit, 13-storey building. We anticipate starting construction this summer. Including this developing, we are anticipating $100 million to $300 million of on-balance sheet development starts spread throughout 2018. Turning to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2018 of $111.4 million or $0.15 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.02 per share. Our $0.02 per share outperformance for the first quarter was primarily due to approximately $0.015 in lower same-store operating expenses, resulting from the combination of lower than anticipated repair and maintenance expense and lower than anticipated levels of self-insured employee health care costs. Of these lower operating expenses, approximately $0.005 of repair and maintenance expense savings is timing-related, with the expenses now expected to occur later in the year. And approximately $0.005 in higher acquisition net operating income resulting primarily from the timing of our Camden North Quarter acquisition. We completed this acquisition in mid-February, as compared to our budget of mid-March. As a result of the non-timing related same-store expense savings of approximately $0.01, we have reduced the midpoint of our full year same-store expense guidance from 4% to 3.5%, and increased our 2018 same-store NOI guidance by 20 basis points at the midpoint to 2.7%. We also reaffirmed our prior 2018 FFO guidance of $4.62 to $4.82, with a midpoint of $4.72. We anticipate that the $0.015 first quarter outperformance, which is not associated with the timing of certain property level expenses, will be entirely offset by $0.005 decrease in NOI from communities in lease-up due to a delay in opening our Camden McGowen Station development in Houston, and a $0.01 per share decrease in NOI due to forecasted timing of future pro forma acquisitions. Our current guidance anticipates $300 million of additional acquisitions in the second half of 2018. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2018. We expect FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.16 to $1.20. The midpoint of $1.18 represents a $0.03 per share increase from our $1.15 in the first quarter 2018. This increase is primarily the result of an approximate 2% or $0.03 per share expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, as we both move into our peak leasing periods and receive anticipated property tax refunds, and an approximate $0.01 per share increase in NOI from our recent acquisitions and our communities in lease-up. This $0.04 per share aggregate improvement in FFO is partially offset by an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO, resulting from a lower interest income due to lower cash balances, lower fee and asset management income due to lower amounts of third-party construction income and higher overhead due to timing of certain corporate expenses. Our balance sheet is strong, with net debt-to-EBITDA at four times, a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.4 times, secured debt to gross real estate assets at 11%, 81% of our assets unencumbered and 92% of our debt at fixed rates. We ended the quarter with no balances outstanding on our unsecured line of credit and $100 million of cash on hand. We have $513 million of development currently under construction, with $229 million remaining to fund over the next two years. Late in 2018, we anticipate repaying that maturity, $175 million of secured floating rate debt with an anticipated interest rate of 2.5%. And repaying at par $205 million of secured fixed rate debt with an interest rate of approximately 5.8%. Our current guidance does not anticipate any early debt prepayments and any resulting penalties. We currently anticipate issuing $400 million of unsecured debt late in 2018 at a rate of approximately 3.8%. In anticipation of this offering, we have entered into $400 million of forward starting swaps, effectively locking in the 10-year treasury at 2.65%. And finally, some of you may have noticed in the footnotes to our income statement that we haveadopted the new revenue recognition standard effective January 1, 2018. As a result, we are now presenting those rental revenues, certain revenue items totaling approximately $5.6 million, which would have historically been included as a component of other property revenues. The major components of this reclassification include rental revenues associated with reletting, parking, storage and pets. This adoption does not change the sum of our total property revenues. This new presentation has been applied prospectively, and therefore, adjustments would need to be made to prior year periods for comparison purposes. At this time, we’ll open the call up to questions, and first turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Alex. While we have a winner for the hold music contest, and that would be Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc, and Austin identified that the on-hold music was the most popular songs released in 1993, and that 2018 was Camden’s 25th anniversary as a public company. Clearly, 1993 wasn’t the best year for new music, but 1993 turned out to be a great year for multifamily companies to go public. Collectively, we have been at the forefront of innovation and operational excellence in the multifamily business for the past 25 years. And it’s interesting to note that the only 25% of public companies make it to their 25th anniversary. So thanks, Austin, and we appreciate you getting that right. So we’ll now turn the call over to questions and answers from the folks on the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to touch on Houston a bit and get an update there as it relates to operating trends you’re seeing in the market and where occupancy sits today.
Keith Oden: Yes. So we’re currently running in the 95% range, occupancy-wise, just above that, as we indicated in our original guidance meeting, I think we really started talking about this in the third quarter call last year, which is the spike that we saw in occupancy as a result of the Hurricane Harvey. We knew that, at one point, we got almost to 98% occupied in our entire portfolio, which is never sustainable over a long period of time. But the big uncertainty for us, as we look at 2018 plan, was how fast does that unwind happen? And there was a lot of uncertainty regarding how long is it going to take people to get their homes back together, and those that were moved in as a result of the floods? So we had – we’ve laid out a plan where we felt comfortable that over some period of time, we would get back to kind of a more normal operating environment, which, for us, is around the 95% occupancy level. So it looks like we’re there. And you saw our results for the first quarter. We’re about 1.9% revenue growth. And our plan for the year indicates that we’ll end the year somewhere around 3% revenue growth in Houston, which will be great, given where we were at this point last year. If somebody said, “You’re going to do 3% revenue growth in Houston in 2018,” I would’ve kind of looked at it him real funny. But life is funny, and it looks like we’re on track to do that. So things are returning to normal in Houston, and it looks like we’re going to end up having a pretty decent year here.
Austin Wurschmidt: And how has new and renewal lease rates trended from the first quarter and into the second quarter? And is there a disproportionate impact being driven by short-term lease renewals that’s driving that number? Or are these just kind of your typical 12-month leases that are renewing?
Keith Oden: Yes. We’re down – we think we’re down to less than 1% of residents who have any connection to delays resulting from – or the flood. I mean, it’s just a very small number. So if you look at our short-term leases versus kind of long-term trends, then you wouldn’t see any difference today in our rent role from where we have been. So it’s business as usual, 12- and 15-month leases across our entire platform, which is what – again, that’s what we wanted to get back to as quickly as we could.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then as far as new and renewal lease rates?
Keith Oden: Yes. So new lease rates were running about 0%; renewals, about 5%.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks for that. And then as it relates to the timing of acquisitions, you mentioned that negatively impacted guidance. What exactly are you seeing in the market? Is there a lack of deals or is it just the number of bidders out there today? And would you consider allocating a larger portion of those proceeds tagged to acquisitions towards development?
Ric Campo: Well, the key – yes, the key issue there is that there’s plenty of properties in the marketplace, but there are more buyers than our properties for sure. And there’s – as I said on the – beginning of the call that the pressure on pricing, given everything where we are in the market, right, most people think we’re late cycle. You’ve got – 10-year treasury rose. REIT stock price is adjusted, but the private market hasn’t adjusted at all. As a matter of fact, the private market has gotten more competitive, and it’s harder for us to sort of thread the needle in the type of properties we want. The issue on – the challenge you have on both sides of the equation, which is acquisitions and development, is that on the development side, new developments that haven’t – where we haven’t locked in our cost at this point, are hard to underwrite as well, because you have sort of rising construction costs in an environment where rental rates are not rising as fast as the construction costs. So it’s a complicated place in the market, given the competitive ends on both acquisition and development.
Austin Wurschmidt: And can you remind us what the – how much accretion you had assumed in the numbers? I know you assumed a lot of non-stabilized deals. But how much accretion is left in the guide from acquisitions?
Keith Oden: So the best way to think about it is just what would happen if we weren’t – if we didn’t do any future acquisitions. And that would probably reduce our midpoint by about $0.02 a share.
Operator: And the next question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: I just wanted to stick on the acquisition side. You talked about a 25 basis point contraction in cap rates. Could you just conceptualize the time frame for that decrease? And what markets, in particular, if any, are driving that? Is it more on the homes? Or is it more Sunbelt?
Ric Campo: It’s interesting because the $208 million that we acquired in the first quarter were all – those transactions were all done in the latter part of 2017. And during that time frame, you had folks just sort of – that the last quarter was an interesting quarter because there wasn’t as much pressure on the buy side. So buyers were sort of kind of hanging back and waiting to see what was going to happen in the first quarter. And when we were at National Multi Housing Council, for example, in January, it was like a flood of folks entering the market. The NMHC had, I think, a record attendance of over 5,000 people, I believe, and they used to have something like 2,000 or 3,000 people. And so every person we talk to had $100 million here or $200 million there or $500 million there of equity that they wanted to put into apartments. And so, generally, what happens in the cycle is that properties come – sellers sort of started NMHC in January, and then they started bringing product to the market in the first quarter and through the second quarter and try to get their deals done in the summer or in the third quarter. And so there’s a lot of properties that are out there. And that came out, but they were met with a major wall of equity capital that wanted to get placed. And that’s driven – so when we talk about 25 basis points reduction in cap rates, it’s in all of our markets. And there’s not a lot of differentiation in markets today. It’s just that if there’s a high quality multifamily development deal that is being sold, it has multiple bidders, and the prices have definitely been driven up and cap rates down in about a 60- to 90-day time frame between the beginning of the year and where we are today. And I think the interesting part of it is that’s in the backdrop of the 10-year going up 60 basis points. And most people are saying, “Well, gee if the tenure goes up, then private real estate values have to drop.” And we’ve been saying all along that that’s just not the case. The situation is that people look at relative returns to other assets. And multifamily with – even with headwinds from new development across the country is still a very, very high sought-after asset class that has a lot of positive attributes from an investment perspective.
Keith Oden: Yes. Juan, just to follow up on that, with regard to acquisitions and the opportunity set, as Ric mentioned, it was – there wasn’t a ton of stuff that was being traded in the fourth quarter of last year, and that’s changed pretty dramatically. And across our – our acquisition folks right now are in various stages of kind of preliminary underwriting of about 19 transactions that represent, if you total them all up, that at asking price would be about $1.8 billion. And these are just across Camden’s relevant markets and high-quality brand, relatively new assets and locations that we would want to own. So the ability to get to another $200 million to $400 million in acquisitions, the good news is there’s tons of product out there. The bad news is, it’s all incredibly priced to perfection from our perspective. So we just have to be very patient. And as we did with the Tampa and the Orlando assets, we think we made incredible great value for those acquisitions. And it’s hard to find. And in all of the 19 that we’re currently looking at, maybe we’ll get one. But on the other hand, maybe we won’t. But the good news is, it looks like there’s going to be a ton of product in the market to choose from. We just have to find our spots. We are looking for discount to replacement costs and some – on an asset that we think Camden’s platform can add value to and get us to a first year or a stabilized return that makes sense for our allocation of capital. So that’s where we are.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks for that color. Just on Washington, D.C. within first quarter was almost soft, but you were confident in your prepared remarks of any – up, I think, around 3%. What gives you that confidence? And can you share with us kind of maybe the new lease trends on – and I guess, the anticipated or the acceleration you’re seeing there just underlying that confidence?
Keith Oden: Yes. I mean, if you look at where we are in the first quarter, from an occupancy standpoint, we’re in really good shape. The post end-of-the-quarter momentum has continued to be really good in our Washington, D.C. portfolio. And on our all management call last week, our Washington, D.C. folks, our IROC group, continue to be very comfortable with our full year forecast for D.C. And that rolls up to around 3%. So yes, it’s going to get better. There’s probably not going to be much in occupancy. It’s going to be rental rate game from– gain from this point forward. The key in D.C. is that you’ve got – you really have two sets of factors. One is the D.C. proper, and those communities are continuing to be under pressure from new supply. Fortunately, for Camden, our footprint has some D.C. proper, but it’s substantially D.C. Metro. And so my guess is that when you look at our results or forecast relative to some of our peers, it’s going to look a little stronger, but it’s primarily the mix of assets. And when you get into the suburban scenario, your – the results are pretty much dictated by whether or not you have new supply that’s directly competitive with our offerings. And in most cases, we don’t have much new supply that’s directly competitive. So I think we’re comfortable that we’re going to get to the 3% by the end of the year.
Juan Sanabria: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: I’ll ask prerequisite two questions. So first is if you kind of knew that things are trending better, as you kind of alluded to, would you – as kind of still maintaining the expectations of The Street perhaps looking to get through leasing fees and before you kind of…
Keith Oden: Rich, the last – I got nothing for the last 20 seconds of your question. It’s real garbled.
Rich Anderson: Is that better?
Keith Oden: That is better. Let’s start over completely.
Rich Anderson: Okay, good, because it was a really bad question.
Ric Campo: It’s never a bad question, come on.
Rich Anderson: So if you guys had the expectation that things were getting better, and you kind of alluded to that in this quarter, as the – of maintaining expectations for The Streets would you be inclined to wait to get through some of the leasing fees in first before allowing yourself to get in front of yourself a little bit from your guidance?
Ric Campo: I would say that we would – if we were – it’s hard – it’s definitely hard to predict the next three quarters, right? I mean, so when you get through a good first quarter, you tend to feel really good about it. Our teams feel really good about entering a strong leasing season. But at the end of the day, you don’t want to get ahead of your skis either, right? And so, yes, I would say that that’s probably a rationale thing to think about.
Rich Anderson: Okay. That’s all I need for that. And then second, Ric, you, or Keith or anyone really. Given what you just described about cap rate going down and Wall Street maybe perhaps valuing you guys, and everyone else in that facility agree you should be valued, is that a recipe for recognizing so many – seven of you, guys, in terms of the mainstream multifamily REIT. The clearest path outside of value creation is maybe through a full on sale. I’m not saying it’s you, but doesn’t that – wouldn’t you agree that, that is a reasonable recipe for M&A, considering all the inputs?
Ric Campo: Well, I guess, the – since we’ve been around for 25 years, we’ve heard that a few times, right? And what would happen – what generally happens is – so is that the – when you think about when valuations are out of favor, if you want to call it that on Wall Street, then the first thing – some folks say as well, “You all maximize value by monetizing, by selling to a private company and unlocking that value.” So – and if you think about a private buyer, a private buyer is not going to buy Camden or anybody else without having a return expectation that is pretty robust, right? So the question becomes, is the disconnect between the value of the stock and the NAV today, is that a permanent issue? Is that a value trap? Is that a – is it – is disconnect because the company is doing something wrong or is management not trusted or they’re making bad capital allocation to their decisions or things like that. And if we saw, that’s why the valuation was – there was a disconnect, then we would sell the company. Because we wouldn’t create a long-term value trap for shareholders, given that we’re all big shareholders. But if it’s just a dislocation in the marketplace, like we’ve had many times over the last 25 years, then the question is, why would I want to sell to a private company when I could – and they’re going to make their returns on those assets when I can ultimately create those returns for the shareholders that own the company today? And so that’s kind of my view of the dislocation today, is if it’s a value trap, and people don’t have confidence in the companies that are trying to create those values, then, yes, sell it and move on. But if it’s just a market dislocation, then we’re just going to create value for our shareholders
Rich Anderson: Fair enough. Thanks for the color.
Operator: And the next question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Hi, good morning everyone.
Ric Campo: Good morning.
Keith Oden: Good morning.
Rich Hightower: I wanted to ask about your – any changes to your job forecast across markets since the beginning of the year now that we’ve had a little bit of time for tax reform to season? We’ve gotten some good data on net migration patterns recently. It’s been in the headlines. And the forecast that you guys are using, have they changed at all since the beginning of the year? And then how has that been factored in the guidance, if at all, at this point?
Keith Oden: Yes. So the answer is they haven’t changed materially to – from our – what we were using when we put out our guidance in the first quarter. I think the wild card, and it’s probably not of this year item, but it’s probably over the next several years, is the impact of the tax reform on and the acceleration of migration patterns that have been going on for a long time. There were some good research that was reported in The Wall Street Journal, I think about a week ago, that indicated that over the next couple of years, as many as 800,000 people incrementally, as a result of the tax, of this state and local tax deductions being limited, would come from the states of just California and New York. So in addition to the out-migration that has been going on for almost a decade in both of those states, the forecast was that an additional 800,000 people would leave due to the tax policy. So the biggest beneficiary states that were listed for the 800,000 migration were Texas, Florida, Colorado and Phoenix. And so – and that list were probably a net beneficiary. Obviously, we’ve got some California exposure, but not in New York. And we had exposure in all of the other markets, where these people, I think, are – or at least the study indicates they’re going to end up. So I think there probably is a thesis that’s a little bit longer term around the impact of tax reform. But I think from an unemployment standpoint, I don’t think we’ve seen – in the migration standpoint, we haven’t seen that yet. But it’s – there’s probably some of that out there that needs to be looked at over the next couple of years.
Rich Hightower: Okay. That’s helpful color, Keith. And then just to follow up on sort of the cap rate question, capital allocation, et cetera. When you look at the convergence of cap rates, it sounds like it’s reaching across markets, across submarkets, across asset types, vis-a-vis relative quality and all of those different metrics. How do those changes since the beginning of the year make you think about selling additional assets that maybe weren’t penciled as such in the original guidance or whatever? Just to take it up the market we’re in?
Ric Campo: Sure. When you look at our – at the last couple of years, we sold over $1.3 billion of assets and into very strong markets, right? And so I think the – whenever you have major changes in the market, you have to think about it, and say, “Okay, if I can’t buy, what do I do?” And oftentimes, I’d tell our people, when we have a strategy, and you say, “Okay. Here’s what we’re supposed to be doing.” But let’s make sure we look at the market and say, “Okay. We can do anything.” We can buy. We can sell. We can build. We can do nothing, right? And so we can buy stock back. And we’ll see how the hand plays through the rest of the year. But those kinds of discussions are happening every day, given the current environment we’re in. We have a board meeting next week. We’re going to talk a lot about where we are and where the cycle is and where the best place to put capital is.
Rich Hightower: All right. Great, thanks, Ric.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to turn back to Houston. And I’m trying to reconcile the 0% new lease growth that you cited for Houston for your portfolio versus if we look at the AXIOMetrics data that’s showing over 4% market rent growth for all of Houston in the first quarter. What is the gap there? Is it that your portfolio is still facing some supply pressure in some pockets? Or is there a lag effect here, where even if you’re at flat rent growth now on a new lease basis here, you’re going to be getting closer to 4% in the spring here? And so that would be an improvement for you guys? Can you just maybe reconcile that for me? 
Keith Oden: Yes. So our guidance for the year, for the full year on revenue growth in Houston is 3%, right? And we’re running 5%, plus or minus, on renewals as we speak. So in order to close that gap, to get to our 3%, we need roughly contribution of 0.5% from new leases. We’re flat year-to-date, but we do believe that, that will trend up. And as far as where – what AXIO has in their numbers, I think at this time or maybe in the fourth quarter of last year, I’m not sure if it was AXIO, but one of the data providers, I think, Wheaton had Houston penciled as revenue growth or rent growth in 2018 at 8% at one point. So I mean, it just – some of it’s just a misunderstanding of how rent rolls, how the changes have rolled through the rent roll over time. But again, I would say that if you go back to where we were last year and kind of roll forward and say we’ll be flat year-over-year on leases, I would have been thrilled with that. And I think…
Ric Campo: Right. And the other thing I would add to that is that we are constantly monitoring via performance analytics, what our properties are doing relative to their submarkets. And we are exceeding the submarket numbers both on occupancy and new renewal rates. So we’re monitoring that. I think the problem with broader numbers like AXIO or Wheaton is that it’s – Houston’s big market, so you can’t just say it’s on average this, right? And so we’re making sure that we are capturing every dollar we can through our revenue management teams, and we feel pretty good about it.
Nick Yulico: Okay. No, that’s helpful. I guess the point here was that, it feels like Houston is the market is really improving and the supply outlook is also improving, the job growth outlook is improving. And so you have some acceleration in new rent growth baked into your Houston guidance for the year. But to some degree, it feels like it’s maybe a little bit conservative. And so that’s what I was just trying to figure out, I mean, in terms of like how much better Houston could actually improve this year, or if it’s just some – you’re still facing may be some lingering supply pocket pressure that’s going to actually just keep you at that 3% revenue growth.
Ric Campo: Nick, also, we had – if you recall in 2017 and the year that we had pretty muted job growth, there were 21,000 apartments delivered in Houston, Texas. And many of those are still going through their lease up process. So it’s very competitive, a lot of its dependent on the geographical footprint or where your assets are located and a lot of that new supply that was built is, in fact, competitive with some of Camden’s larger assets. So it’s just I think it’s all of the above, but the good news is that if you would roll back again to middle of last year and all of the data forecasters that we use, including Wheaton, they would have been calling for total rent growth in Houston in 2018 to be down another 4%. It means 4% negative versus what we think we’re going to end up as 3% positive. So it’s a pretty remarkable turnaround. So some of what you’re saying is true, Houston has gotten dramatically better in the last, I will call it, nine months. But dramatically better from a minus 4% kind of scenario to the plus 3%.
Nick Yulico: Right. And I gets a trends hold up at this, I mean, it feels like in 2019 perhaps is a better year than 2018. Is that fair at this point do you think?
Ric Campo: Yes. I think just based on supply numbers, I mean, we delivered 21,000 apartments last year, we’re kind of working our way through that. My guess is that by the end of this year, we’ll be through the worst of that. Good news is we only have about 6,000 completions slated for this year, and the market besides the Houston, that’s – again, that’s a blip and very manageable in the scheme of things. So I would expect that all things being equal, Houston and other decent year job growth this year and looking out to 2019, yes, I think so. Certainly, more constructive.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: And the next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. It seem like everyone wants to be Denver, and it’s now your sixth largest market. Do you have an internal goal of making Denver at top five-market for Camden? And could you just talk about the acquisition environment in the market?
Keith Oden: Yes, I think that Denver, the Denver story has been one that we’ve been a big fan of for many years going back all the way to our entry into that market in 1998. So it’s caught a lot of other people’s attention and some of our peers also in recent months and years. We don’t really, as far as internal targets on percentage of assets in any individual market, we look at that, we think about it and we think about it as, or we overweight our position or underweight, and I would say that we continue to believe that our Denver exposure is underweight relatively to where we’d like it to be. The challenge is, as you say, that everybody, it seems, kind of wants to be there at one time, which does bad things to pricing, which does – affects greatly our appetite for expanding at this part of the cycle. So yes, long term, Denver needs to be – we’re certainly underweight where we would like to be. But we’re not – it’s just not something that we’re going to force, given where we think we are in the cycle.
Ric Campo: And there are a couple of Denver properties that are in the number that Keith threw out, the $1.8 billion of acquisitions that we’re looking at, at this point. But because of the – I think Denver is a little more competitive than most places because it is sort of the hotspot right now.
John Kim: Okay. And can I clarify – on your statement of the 25 basis point cap rate compression, I understand that’s across all of your markets. But is that specifically for newly built projects that you’re targeting? Or is that also including B and core plus assets?
Ric Campo: I think it’s B and core plus assets as well. I mean, the thing that’s interesting about the sort of value-add market, it is – still is white hot. And the value-add continues to compress as well. And so it’s across the board. It’s not just for specific types of assets.
John Kim: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Sure. Good morning. Two questions for me. First, you guys seem to be more bullish on the development activity. But it seems like, especially from recent – speaking to private developers, including some large ones that having subs, keeping subs on the job without them walking off is getting to be a harder and harder issue. I appreciate the scale of your platform, but still how do you guys keep people on the job site versus walking off to better-paying jobs?
Ric Campo: Well, first, you have to be sort of a best-in-class developer and owner. And the way you do that is you – they say fast pay makes fast friends, right? So you make sure that you continue to – that you have very well organized jobs. So that when a sub comes on the job, the sub gets their work done, and they don’t have to wait for somebody to get something else done or have to go back and redo it. So a lot of it has to do with the platform and just the way that our construction teams operate, that you want to be the company that the sub wants to go work for because they can get their work done, and they get paid quickly. And so I think that’s – that relationship that has developed over a period of time with subs creates this sort of team effect, where they just don’t walk off the job to get another 2% or 3%. And that’s – I think we’ve been doing that for a long time, and our construction departments and our development people understand that you’ve got to take care of your subs. Now from time-to-time, a sub will get upside down, and you’ll have to take them out and hire another sub. And that’s where you have risk. But generally speaking, because we’ve been in this business for so long, we don’t have a lot of that, that happens.
Alexander Goldfarb: So the delay in that one Houston project, we shouldn’t take that as a read-through, that we should expect more of this for you?
Ric Campo: No, the – I think the delays, if you look at every – even with the best subs, we still have labor issues. The subs, instead of bringing 200 people on a job, they’re bringing 150 or 100. And so it’s just taking longer. And then getting to the finish line when you – the last sort of 3% or 4% of a job is the hardest to get done because you’re sort of getting those fine-tuning things done. And in the case of our Houston project, McGowen Station, I mean, the big issue was really about sidewalks in the front and ability to get people in the front door. And unfortunately, there was some weather, and then other kind of random things that happened that caused that. But I think every project that we’ve developed, and I think this is just universal to all companies, not just Camden, is that you have to add three to six months every job because of just labor shortages, and not so much.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, that’s helpful. And then the second question is, on the lending side, I was talking to Freddie Mac recently, and they said they’re being outbid by banks. Fannie Mae activity in the first quarter was down dramatically. So what’s your take on what’s going on in the commercial lending? And are you seeing an impact in property transactions? Or it’s just that the banks and LifeCos are stepping up, so that the property market isn’t impacted – the transaction volume isn’t impacted, it’s just more a shift in lenders?
Ric Campo: Well, there’s definitely been a shift in lenders because Fannie and Freddie were getting, as you’ve pointed out, price out of the markets with LifeCos and banks. And so I don’t think there’s any real shortage of capital or anything like that. That’s what’s driving cap rate compression. Last year, you did have banks. I mean, this is primarily construction financing, where banks – where it had increased your spreads pretty dramatically and were cutting back proceeds. And that’s sort of what happened to the developer in Orlando. And what was happening then was – so their cost of capital is going up. The additional capital requirements on banks were being volatile. Commercial real estate, construction loans was putting pressure on banks. Today, however, with the sort of the kind of new lower regulation administration, construction lenders are actually back in the market. And their spreads have contracted some. Instead of 300 and over, now it’s 225 to 250 over the curve. And they’re getting more constructive about making construction loans today than they were in the past. And I think that’s sort of the regulatory tilt that you’re seeing from the Trump administration. And so there is no shortage of capital. But the challenge people were having is on the development side, as I said earlier, was making their numbers work on the construction side and the cost side. And Freddie and Fannie have actually dropped their spreads, and are more aggressive in the market trying to take back market share.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Good morning, everyone. Just on the pipeline, the $1.8 billion and just the overall capital plan, it sounds like both sides, development and acquisitions, are somewhat challenging. I was just curious, someone asked if you’d be interested in stepping up your development side. I guess, if neither of those two avenues proves to be particularly attractive from a return perspective, I guess, what’s the next best option for deployment.
Ric Campo: Well, that’s a complicated issue, right? If you can’t build and you can’t buy, then what do you do? And I think Keith hit the nail in the head earlier when he said, “You just have to be patient.” And so at sometimes, you just have to say, “Look, I’m not going to play at this price.” And what you do then is you just keep your powder dry until you see something that makes sense or something changes in the marketplace. And we’re ready, willing and able to be patient. And I think that’s the key, is making sure that we aren’t just – we don’t have a gun at our head to go out and buy properties. Now yes, we have $0.02, as Alex – Alex pointed out earlier $0.02 of embedded accretion from that in our guidance. But that doesn’t mean that we’re going to go out and do a transaction that we, in our gut, think is wrong just to make $0.02 of accretion. So we’ll just sit on cash, and we’ll see what happens. If you think about where we are in the cycle, we’re in – and I think what most people believe is the latter parts of a really long cycle. Now how long does this cycle continue? I don’t know. It’s the second largest – or the second longest expansion – economic expansion that we’ve had in my business career. And yes, it’s been slow growth, and you haven’t had rocket job growth and all that, but you sort of have to be careful at this point in the market. And so we’re happy to – it will make transactions work if they work, but we’re not going to press the edge of the envelope if they don’t.
Vincent Chao: Okay. That sounds rational. I guess, just a question on Dallas. You don’t talk about a lot of markets. Dallas is still doing okay, but it seems like you saw some pretty big deceleration on the same-store revenue growth side this quarter. I know it’s likes a B+ market, I think, when you gave your initial outlook. I was just curious how that market is trending versus your expectations, and if you could remind us what you think Dallas will end up for the year?
Keith Oden: Yes. So on our report card that we did last quarter, I had Dallas at – or we had Dallas at B and declining. And I think that’s still about right. I mean, we definitely have – took an occupancy hit in the quarter. Dallas is dealing right now in terms of 2018 deliveries with about what Houston dealt with last year. I think we’re around 20,000, plus or minus, 22,000 deliveries in 2000 – and 13,000 deliveries coming on top of about 10,000 last year. So it’s going to be a challenge in Dallas just based on the amount of new supply that needs to be absorbed. The positive in Dallas is it’s been a little bit better job growth story for the last couple of years than Houston has been. But almost irrespective of your ratio of jobs to new deliveries, if – when you got 22,000 apartments that need to be absorbed in some fashion, if you happen to be in those submarkets or attended to those submarkets, you’re going to get smacked. And so we laid out a plan for Dallas for 2018 that we think properly anticipated the new supply that’s going to come online. And I mean, I think as we sit here today, I think we’re still on track with where we thought we would be in Dallas for 2018. It’s going to be – Dallas and Austin and Charlotte are our three – the three most supply-impacted markets for Camden, and we think we’ve properly anticipated that for 2018.
Vincent Chao: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And the next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Guinee: Great. John Guinee here. More of a curiosity question. You bought the St. Petersburg deal from Granvil Tracy at American Land, who by the way was very, very impressed with the level of your due diligence. I think it was a little bit of a unique product, and that maybe the average unit size was bigger to target a different – the more older tenant. And I think you bought it for about $355,000 a unit. Can you talk about the uniqueness of that asset? And also is $355,000 more or less than replacement costs these days?
Ric Campo: It definitely is a unique product. So it’s 1.5 blocks from the water. It is a larger average unit size. It sort of caters to two different groups. You do have smaller unit sizes that cater to millennials, but also larger unit sizes that cater to sort of an older crowd. And I think the average age there is like 46 years old. Our average age in our portfolio is like 30s – low 30s. So it is a unique asset. We think the replacement costs, it’s about 12% below replacement costs, and it was in the sort of the final stages of lease-up. And we think it’s a great buy, given its location in St. Pete – or my initial reaction on St. Pete, even though we’ve been close to it for a long time, was that it was sort of a sleepy kind of town, but it’s really become a hotspot with downtown renovations and a lot of new hip restaurants and what have you. So – and the big public investments in the Pier District that are – that have been made and are coming. So it’s a real happening place in the Tampa, St. Pete area.
John Guinee: Then the second question, you’ve paid about 32,000 units for a little less than two acres in Orlando. Incredibly high density, 200 units per acre, by the way. But what do you think the total project cost would be for an asset like that?
Ric Campo: Our project cost is $120 million on that project. It is a high-rise, so it’s a block-and-plank construction, which is basically a concrete product. And it’s 1.5 blocks or 2 blocks from like Eola, which is a really great spot in Orlando and very walkable neighborhood. And we’re really excited about that project.
John Guinee: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Lumb from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Ryan Lumb: Great. Thank you. With regard to the property tax assessments outside of just typical catch-up between the assessed values and market values, are you seeing any sort of change from municipalities or cities that kind of goes beyond just the changes in recent market values that is driven more so by physically strained local or state budgets?
Alex Jessett: So what I would tell you is when you look at our property tax valuations, what typically happens is there’s a little bit of a lag. So the increases that we saw last year, I don’t think, were really driven by sort of funding issues. I mean, it’s not – I think it was more an issue of they were trying to catch up with valuation increases that has happened in past years. So at one point, there were some discussions around Houston, and whether the property taxes were going to be outsized based upon funding issues in Houston, but we seem to have moved past that.
Ryan Lumb: Sure. That’s helpful, thanks. And just one last one. The – just for kind of the outlook for redevelopment over the next, say, three to five years. Do you think it stays somewhere in this $25 million range? Or does it grow meaningfully from here?
Keith Oden: Yes. I don’t think that – I think it shrinks from here. And the reason for that is that we were getting pretty close to the end of the group of assets that on a catch-up basis are suitable for redevelopment. So it takes – you need to be able to get a substantial pickup in rent to make these things work. And so there’s sort of a natural breakpoint for assets somewhere around the 10 to 12-year mark, where great location, but clearly last cycle product. And if you can go in and make last-cycle product look and feel to the consumer like current-cycle product, and most people are – to the untrained eye, they wouldn’t even notice that it was a 10 to 12-year old product. And then you can reprice that home that’s basically pricing off of the new deliveries and new construction. So we’re getting pretty close to the stuff that was kind of pent-up in our portfolio that was – did have the right attributes. And so I think going forward, it’s going to be more of as things hit that magic mark in age, location and quality that we add redevelopments.
Ryan Lumb: Great. That’s helpful for me. Thanks
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like turn the call back to Mr. Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Great. Thanks. I appreciate your time today on the call, and we look forward to seeing you at NAREIT in June. Thanks.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today’s call represent management’s current opinions and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden’s complete fourth quarter 2017 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will be brief in our prepared remarks and try to complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Good morning. By now, you understand today is Groundhog Day. And this day always reminds me of the classic Bill Murray movie in which he relives Groundhog Day over and over and over again. For the thousands of our Houston area neighbors whose homes were flooded by Harvey and have not yet moved back into their homes, every day feels like Groundhog Day. So much progress has been made and yet so much work remains to be done in the Houston area. Fortunately, for 98% of the people that live in the area that were not flooded, life has returned to normal within a few days of the flood. All Camden’s communities are as good as new including Camden Spring Creek which had homes flooded. The recent uptick in oil prices and the Astros’ great win in the World Series have lifted Houston’s spirits and economic activity. Harvey’s initial positive impact on the multifamily business has carried over into 2018, as Keith will share with you in his market-by-market report card. Houston’s rating improved from last year’s D and declining to these year’s B and improving, amazing what a year will do to the market rating sometimes. I want to thank our Camden team members that stepped up and really showed what neighbors helping neighbors really meant for the Hurricane Harvey and Irma relief efforts that we did as a Company. During 2018 will mark Camden’s 25th year as a public company. Few high points of where we have come from I think are in order. We started in three Texas cities and now are in 15 diversified growing markets throughout the country. We began providing 6,000 homes to customers and now provide 56,000 homes to customers, improving the lives of our customers, one experience at a time. We began with a $194 million market cap and have grown to over $11 billion, providing shareholders with solid returns, growing dividends and increasing stock prices from the beginning. In the beginning, the multifamily industry was really a slow adapter to technology. Today, we embrace cutting edge technologies to help our employees, perform better and take care of our customers better, and also have provided customers with cutting edge technologies that they really appreciate. And more importantly, we started a workforce that started out at about 250 people and provided jobs and now provide jobs to nearly 2,000 fulltime employees and 5,000 construction workers, creating an amazing customer and shareholder focused culture that has been recognized in consecutive years on the Fortune 100 best companies to work for list with six top-10 finishes. We look forward to the next 25 years and really embrace the opportunity to continue improving the lives of our employees, our customers and our shareholders one experience at a time.  I’ll turn the call over to Keith for his market-to-market update now, thanks.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Consistent with our prior years, I’m going to use my time on today’s call to review the market conditions that we expect to encounter in Camden’s markets during 2018. I’ll address the markets in the order of best to worst by assigning a letter grade to each one, as well as our view on whether we believe the market is likely to be improving, stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview, I’ll provide additional details on our fourth quarter operations and our 2018 same property guidance. We anticipate same property revenue growth will be between 2 and 5% this year in majority of our markets with the weighted average growth rate of 3% at the midpoint of our guidance range. The markets budgeted in the 2% to 5% growth range represent nearly 90% of our same property pool and 11, of our 13 markets received the letter grade of B or higher this year. Our top ranking for 2018 goes to Southern California, which we rate as an A with a stable outlook. Our Southern California portfolio has been a strong performer, averaging 5.5% annual same property revenue growth over the last three years. Approximately 25,000 new apartments are expected to open this year with 120,000 new jobs created, putting the jobs-to-completions ratio at a manageable 4.8 times. Denver also earned an A rating but with the declining outlook. Denver has been one of our top markets for the past several years and we expect another strong year there in 2018. Approximately 40,000 new jobs are expected during 2018. But supply will remain elevated with 13,000 new units schedule for delivery this year, likely tempering the pace of revenue growth from the 5.3% level we achieved last year. Raleigh, Orlando and Phoenix each get an A minus rating with stable outlooks. All of these markets face healthy operating conditions with balanced supply and demand metrics. In Raleigh, new developments have been coming on line steadily over the past few years with 5,000 to 6,000 new units delivered each year. Job growth has been stable and 22,000 new jobs are projected for 2018. Orlando is expected to have over 40,000 new jobs in 2018 with only 7,000 completions and estimates in Phoenix call for 50,000 jobs with 9,500 new units coming on line this year. Up next are Atlanta and Tampa, both receiving B plus ratings with stable outlooks. Job growth has been strong in Atlanta and 55,000 new jobs are projected in 2018. Completions also remain steady with another 11,000 to 12,000 new apartments scheduled for delivery this year. In Tampa, supply and demand metrics for 2018 look very similar to last year with 30,000 new job versus 5,500 or so new apartments being completed. Jumping up five spots in the rankings this year is Houston, which improved from a rating of D and declining in 2017 to a B and improving this year. After back-to-back years with negative same property results, our Houston portfolio is expected to achieve 3% revenue growth for 2018. Job growth went from under 20,000 in 2016 to around 50,000 last year and is currently projected to be at 80,000 for 2018. New supply has been heavy the last couple of years with an average of 20,000 new units delivered. 2018 should bring a significant drop off in supply with less than 3,000 completions expected this year. Washington DC receives a B rating again this year with a stable outlook. Revenue growth for our DC portfolio averaged less than 1% from 2014 to 2016, then rebounded to 3.2% last year. We expect 2018 to look a lot like 2017 in the DC area with regards to same property growth. Supply and demand metrics should also remain consistent with another 10,000 to 12,000 completions this year and 40,000 new jobs projected. Dallas earns a B as well but with a declining outlook, given the continued wave of new supply being delivered in that market. Job growth has been solid with nearly 70,000 jobs created last year and a similar amount expected to be created in 2018. But with over 20,000 completions last year and another 20,000 units coming on line this year, the Dallas apartment market will remain challenging in 2018 and our pricing power may be limited. We gave Austin a B rating with a declining outlook this year. A level of new supply in the Austin market should finally start to come down in 2018 but only slightly with 8,000 new units anticipated this year versus 9,000 last year. Job growth was mediocre in 2017 with around 30,000 new jobs created and estimates call for a slightly weaker year in 2018 with employment growth of 22,000. Given the current supply and demand metrics, our 2018 outlook for Austin is below average with revenue growth of 1% to 2% expected for our portfolio this year. Conditions in Charlotte seem to have firmed up a bit and are currently at B -- were at a B minus with an improving outlook. New supply has been persistent in Charlotte with 6,000 to 7,000 units delivered in both ‘16 and ‘17 and a similar amount anticipated this year. Job growth should accelerate in 2018 with over 30,000 new jobs projected. So, we expect our portfolio’s revenue growth will be slightly higher than the 1.9% we achieved last year. And our last market, South Florida, ranks as a C plus with a stable outlook. We began to see weakness in our South Florida portfolio during 2017 and the economic outlook for 2018 calls for deceleration in job growth this year. Deliveries of new apartments should remain steady but our communities will continue to compete with additional supply from for-sale and rental condominiums. As a result, we expect limited revenue growth for our South Florida portfolio this year with a range of 1% to 2%. Overall, our portfolio rating is a B plus this year, up slightly from last year’s B rating, primarily due to the improvement we’ve seen recently in Houston after hurricane Harvey. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of our markets should achieve 2% to 5% revenue growth this year with the outliers being South Florida and Austin, both in the 1% to 2% range. As a result, we expect our 2018 total portfolio same property revenue growth to be 3% at the midpoint of our guidance range, and this compares to our actual revenue growth last year of 2.9% with again most of the year-over-year improvement driven by Houston. Now, few details on our 2017 operating results. Same property revenue growth was 3% for the fourth quarter and 2.9% for full year 2017. We saw strong performance during the fourth quarter ‘17 with most of our markets recording 3% to 6% revenue growth. Our top performers for the quarter were Tampa at 5.6%, Orlando at 5.4%, Raleigh at 4.6%, and Atlanta, Phoenix, San Diego -- and the San Diego/Inland Empire each 4.4%. Rental rate trends for the fourth quarter were as expected with new leases down one tenth of a percent, and renewals up 4.9% for a blended rate of 2.3% growth, and our preliminary January results are in a similar range. February and March renewals are being sent out at just over 5%. Occupancy averaged 95.7% during the fourth quarter compared to 94.8% last year. January occupancy has averaged 95.4% compared to 94.7% in January of 2017. Annual net turnover for 2017 was 200 basis points lower than 2016 at 46% versus 48%, and that’s always good to see. Move-outs to purchase homes were 15 -- were at 15.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 15.2% for the year, down slightly from 2016 levels. At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, I’ll provide a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the fourth quarter, we reached stabilization at Camden Lincoln Station, a $56 million development in Denver, and began construction on Camden Downtown Phase I, a $132 million development in Downtown Houston. Additionally, late in the quarter, we completed the $78 million disposition of our only student housing community Camden Miramar, which is located in Corpus Christi, Texas. We built and owned Camden Miramar since 1994. And over the past 23 years, this was a very successful investment for Camden and our shareholders, generating a 16.5% unleveraged internal rate of return. We made the strategic decision to sell this asset given its age, use, and its location on a ground lease with just over 20 years remaining. At the sale’s price, this disposition represents an AFFO yield of 8.5% and an FFO yield of 10.5%. This disposition FFO yield was driven in large part by the short remaining duration of the ground lease and the capital-intensive nature of this asset due to its age, use and location directly on the Gulf Coast. Subsequent to quarter-end, we purchased Camden Pier District in St. Petersburg, Florida, for approximately $127 million. This newly constructed 358-unit 18-storey concrete building was purchased at a year one yield of just under 5%. We ended the quarter with no balances outstanding on our unsecured line of credit, $370 million of cash on hand and no debt maturing until October of 2018. Our current cash balance after purchasing Camden Pier District, the January 2018 payment of our fourth quarter dividend and the payment of property taxes which are disproportionally due in January, is approximately $160 million. Moving on to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 of a $114.6 million or $1.18 per share, in line with the midpoint of our prior guidance range of a $1.16 to a $1.20 per share. Contained within the $1.18 per share of FFO was approximately $0.005 in higher same store insurance expense as result of estimated freeze damages at our Georgia, North Carolina and DC area communities, offset by approximately $0.005 in higher non-same store net operating income, driven by the slightly delayed sale of our Camden Miramar student housing community. This sale occurred on December the 12th as compared to our forecast for December the 1st. Moving on to 2018 earnings guidance. You can refer to page 26 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2018 financial outlook. We expect our 2018 FFO per diluted share to be within the range of $4.62 to $4.82 with a midpoint of $4.72 representing a $0.19 per share increase from our 2017 results. The major assumptions and components of this $0.19 per share increase in FFO at the midpoint of our guidance range are as follows. An approximate $0.13 per share increase in FFO related to the performance of a 41,968 unit same store portfolio. We are expecting same store net operating income growth of 1.5% to 3.5% driven by revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and expense growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. Each 1% increase in same store NOI is approximately $0.05 per share in FFO. An approximate $0.15 per share increase in FFO related to net operating income from our non-same store properties resulting primarily from the incremental contribution from our development communities and lease-up during 2017 and 2018, the four development communities which stabilized in 2017, and our one stabilized acquisition completed in June of 2017. An approximate $0.06 per share increase in FFO related to the net operating income from our January 2018 acquisition of Camden Pier District, an approximately $0.08 per share increase in FFO due to assumed additional $380 million of pro forma acquisitions spread throughout the year, and an assumed year one yield of 4.5% and an approximately $0.05 per share increase in FFO due to the nonrecurring nature of our 2017 hurricane related charges. This $0.47 cumulative increase in FFO per share is partially offset by an approximate $0.16 per share reduction in FFO, resulting from additional shares outstanding as a result of our September 2017 equity offering, an approximate $0.08 per share decrease in FFO related to loss NOI from the disposition of our Camden Miramar community, an approximate for $0.04 per share decrease in FFO resulting from the combination of lower third-party construction fees, lower interest income resulting from lower cash balances, and higher corporate depreciation and amortization due to the implementation of a new back office system expected to come on line in the third quarter 2018. We are anticipating overhead expenses to be flat in 2018, resulting from a combination of general cost control measures and the impact of a construction-related settlement in which we will receive a reimbursement of legal fees expense in prior periods. We’re also anticipating interest expense to be flat in 2018 as the repayment of debt in 2017 is offset by 2018 higher borrowings under our unsecured line of credit combined with lower amounts of capitalized interest resulting from the completion of construction of three developments in 2017 and three developments in 2018. The interest rate for our line of credit floats at LIBOR plus 85 basis points and we anticipate draws under our line of credit beginning in June. Additionally, we anticipate repayment maturity, $175 million of secured floating rate debt with an anticipated interest rate of 2.3% in the second half of the year, and we anticipate repaying at $205 million of secured fixed rate debt with an interest rate of approximately 5.7% late in 2018. Our current guidance does not anticipate any early debt prepayments and any resulting penalties. We currently anticipate issuing $400 million of unsecured debt late in 2018 at an all-in rate of approximately 3.75%. In anticipation of this offering, we have entered into $200 million of forward starting swaps, partially locking in the 10-year treasury at 2.34%. On the same store -- our same store expense growth range of 3.5% to 4.5% for 2018 is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits and taxes. Salaries and benefits represent 20% of our total operating expenses and are anticipated to increase by 6.5%. This increase is a result of two factors. First, our benefit related expenses in 2017 were unusually low, trading at tough comparison. In 2017, we experienced unusually low amounts of self-insured healthcare expenses resulting in our 2017 increase in salaries and benefits to be less than 1%. I’ve discussed this trend on past calls and said at the time that I did not believe this trend could continue. And second, we are being responsive to the effects of general labor tightening and are making market-driven wage adjustments where appropriate. The two-year average increase in salaries and benefits averaging 2017 and 2018 is 3.7%. Property taxes represent a third of our total operating expenses and are projected to be up just over 4% in 2018. 3.5% of the expected growth is core, the result of anticipated increases in assessment for our properties. The remaining increase is due to a year-over-year reduction in anticipated refunds from prior year tax protests. We had success in 2017 with our prior year tax protests and current year appeals. As a result 2017’s full year property tax expense increased by 4.1% as compared to our original budget of 5.5%. Although we do anticipate further tax refunds in 2018, we do not anticipate reaching the levels received in 2017. Excluding salaries and benefits and taxes, the remainder of our property level expenses are anticipated to increase at less than 3% in the aggregate. Page 26 of our supplemental package also details other assumptions I’ve not previously mentioned. We’re anticipating at the midpoint $100 million in dispositions late in the year with no significant impact to our guidance, and we’re anticipating $100 million to $300 million of on-balance sheet development starts spread throughout the year. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect FFO per share for the first quarter to be within the range of $1.11 to $1.15. The midpoint of $1.13 represents a $0.05 per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017, which is primarily the result of an approximate $0.035 decrease in sequential same-store net operating income. Of this amount, $0.02 is due to sequential increases in property taxes, resulting from both higher fourth quarter 2017 tax refunds and the reset of our annual property tax accrual on January the 1st of each year. The remaining $0.015 of the sequential decrease in same-store NOI is due to other expense increases, primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends including the timing of onsite salary increases. These increases in same-store operating expenses are partially offset by slight increase in same-store operating revenues, an approximate $0.025 per share decrease in FFO due to disposition of our previously mentioned student housing community. As a reminder, occupancy and NOI at this community were strong during the school term but declined significantly during the summer months and an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO due to a combination of lower third-party construction fees and lower interest income resulting from lower cash balances. This $0.07 aggregate decrease in FFO is anticipated to be partially offset by an approximate $0.015 per share increase in acquisition NOI, and an approximate $0.005 decrease in combined overhead expenses, resulting from the previously mentioned reimbursement of legal fees, expense in prior periods, partially offset by the normal beginning of the year compensation increases and the timing of certain corporate events. And finally, our balance sheet is strong with net debt to EBITDA at 3.5 times and fixed charge expense coverage ratio at 5.5 times, secured debt to gross real assets at 11%, 80% of our assets unencumbered, and 92% of our debt at fixed rates. We have $736 million of developments coming under construction or in lease-up with $280 million left to fund. At this time, we’ll open the call up to questions.
Operator: We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just starting with Houston. Could you give us the underlying assumptions for that 3% revenue growth in terms of new and renewal pricing and occupancy? And then, just generally, how dependent are you on kind of that 80,000 job growth assumption number, just given that you’re coming into the year with such high occupancy?
Keith Oden: Yes. We’re still running at 97%, little better than that occupancy in Houston. And obviously, in our plan, we do expect that to moderate over the course of the year. So, we would expect to end the year at something closer to what would look like normal in Houston, 94 to 95%. So, definitely, we do believe that it will come down over time as the people who were displaced from their homes, who still are in a rental apartment kind of slog through the long process of getting their primary residence back in order. And one of the things we talked about in our last call and we were very cautious in terms of giving people guidance that were coming in and inquiring about three-month lease terms, very short-term lease terms as we felt like the magnitude of this event was going to be such that three months was just a -- it was really not doable in most cases, and that’s turned out to be true. I think what’s actually -- what we’re going to actually see is that we thought was not three but probably six, in many cases, it’s going to turn into as many as nine months to a year, unfortunately, for a lot of folks. So, we’ve tried to anticipate when that shift will happen but we’re in pretty uncharted waters here in terms of a market, the size of Houston with the degree of impact that -- and displacement that we’ve seen. But, we did our best to try to put a fence around it. So, we think we’ll trend back down closer to 94.5 to 95%. In terms of the overall lease and renewals, right now, we’re doing new leases at basically flat and then we’re doing renewals at somewhere around 4% for Houston. So, that’s 2%. We think, we’ll stay somewhere in that range throughout the year. I think, our guesstimate for Houston same store revenue growth next year is in the 3% range for the full year. So that’s where we think we’re going to end up. But I will tell you that it was one of the more challenging revenue forecasting tasks that our teams have ever been faced with just trying to anticipate all the moving parts. As far as dependency on the 80,000 jobs, I mean, clearly, we’re probably less exposed to a little bit -- to the variability in that number than we have been in the past, primarily because we’ve got a lot of the overhang and supply has been taken care of currently. We think again some of that’s going to unwind over time. But, the good news for Houston is that in 2018 we expect to see only about 7,000 apartments completed and delivered and that compares to roughly 20,000, 22,000 we’ve had for each of the last three years. So, a lot of relief on the supply front, a lot more optimism about the 80,000 jobs. Those forecasts that we’ve seen were before even the most recent uptick in the price of oil, and there just seems to be a lot more vibrancy and optimism in the overall Houston economy. So, I think overall, we’ve got a good plan for Houston for 2018.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then, just, what was the final impact of the tech package rollout on 2017’s same store revenue expense and NOI, and then, what’s assumed the impact in 2018?
Alex Jessett: Sure. So, for 2017, numbers came in, revenue was about 65 basis points, expenses was right around 130; and NOI was right around 20. For 2018 revenue is right around 10 basis points, expenses is actually -- it’s a positive 20 basis points because we have redone some of our contracts, and that gets us to an NOI positive about 20 basis points.
Operator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Just hoping you could talk a little bit about the acquisition environment, kind of the pipeline you have today. I think, you said you expect the acquisition to be evenly spread out. But, any color on what you’re seeing? You guys raised equity in the fall and it’s been slow to allocate that. But, just what you are seeing in the pricing and what markets you are looking at?
Ric Campo: Sure. The acquisition market is very competitive, continues to be very competitive. We just got back from the National Multi Housing Council meeting in Orlando and it was the biggest meeting they’ve ever had . When I was Chairman of NMHC, we I think peaked at like 2,600 people; and there were 5,800 people in Orlando in the multifamily space. So, I mean, there is a -- it’s a very interesting time because you have -- there is still a lot of capital that is investing in multifamily that’s significant. The really interesting part of it however is that the capital because of slowing rent growth around the country and slowing NOIs in most markets, the capital has, in the last sort of year or so have been focused on value add. And the idea of buying older property and fixing it up and then creating that value add proposition, it’s been value add driven primarily because of the lower cap rates on core and then slowing growth rates on core has been tough for people to hit their sort of unlevered IRR numbers. I think that you are going to have a continued competitive environment this year. We have looked at lots and lots of properties. The challenge that we have is that we’re not just going to go out and acquire properties because we have capital. We want to make sure that they fit into our strategy. And our strategy has been buying below replacement cost in lease-up scenarios, like in ST. Pete property we bought, and the one we bought last year in Atlanta where we could buy it below replacement cost, come in at a lower yield because there are generally embedded concessions, they are now fully leased up yet. And then, once we go and finish the lease-up, start bringing the concessions off and then putting some Camden sort of customer focus, we move those lower cap rates up to where we are more comfortable. I think, what’s happening now is that people are positioning in terms of sale assets and sort of investors are all kind of queuing up to see what happens to the sale market. We think, there’s going to be probably 15% to 20% more assets in the market this year to sell than there was last year given where we are in the cycle. So, we will get our fair share. The markets we want to be in or markets where we are underrepresented where we think long-term the growth prospects for the regions are good, and most of our markets fit that category. And so, we are really agnostic about where we buy within our markets as well as we can hit that sort of sweet spot of below replacement cost, lease-up and then driving the yields up higher over the next 12 to 24 months.
Juan Sanabria: And then, just on -- in Dallas and Atlanta, I was hoping you could talk about kind of the trajectory you expect for same-store revenues across those markets and what you’re seeing on the new leases kind of recently in those two markets as well?
Keith Oden: So, I’m sorry, Juan. Was it Dallas and Atlanta?
Juan Sanabria: Yes, sir.
Keith Oden: Okay. So, we have Dallas on our rating as B and declining, and that’s just strictly a result of the new supplier that’s going to be delivered this year, going to see another really strong year of employment growth but there’s just too many apartments that need to be absorbed. So, we ended last year, revenue growth in Dallas, at about 4.4% and we’ll be around 3% this year. So, still overall a good year for Dallas, just certainly, we think it’s decelerating from the strength that we’ve seen in the last two years. Atlanta, we have as a B plus and a stable market. And again, if you’re just comparing to last year, Atlanta was -- revenue almost 5% for the full year, and we’ve got that a little bit over between 3% and 3.5% for 2018. So, again, good year, solid, a little bit of biased towards too many apartments relative to the 5 to 1 ratio long-term, but still okay in terms of the overall results in both those markets.
Operator: The next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Just curious in terms of how you’re thinking about returns today given the recent move in the base rate. And then, you also mentioned you’re focused on market share underrepresented. Can you share what markets those are? Not sure if I missed anything there.
Ric Campo: Sure. If you look at our biggest markets we have, we have high concentrations in Washington DC and in Houston. But, if you look at markets like Tampa, Orlando where we’ve like 4% or 5% of our NOI comes out of those markets; Phoenix, we’re under represented in. If you just look at the supplement and you see the percentage of NOIs, it’s just -- we just try to kind of fill in where we have little less market exposure. And, first part of your question was?
Austin Wurschmidt: Just how you’re thinking about returns today with the recent move in the base rate?
Ric Campo: Sure. The thing that’s really interesting is that people I think make a mistake when they think that the 10-year treasury is what drives cap rates. The 10-year treasury is probably the fourth most important thing that drives cap rates; it’s not the number one. And because a lot of people are funding with floating rate debt anyway, so they think about the treasure -- the 10-year, and even though fairly the curve is flattening which increasing the cost of floating rate debt as well. But, when you think about cap rates, cap rates remain very sticky, and the reason they do is because the number one driver of price of any asset is the liquidity in the marketplace that is there to be able to fund that asset, that acquisition. And today, the market is very deep in liquidity, there’s still -- you’ve got still lots of financial institutions who want to make loans on apartments, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae including life companies. And life companies now are actually cheaper on a financing side than Freddie and Fannie. And you have a wall of equity capital that continues to need to make investment. So, it’s liquidity in the marketplace that drives cap rates. The next thing is supply and demand fundamentals. And we know that even though we’re in the latter part of this cycle, since we’ve been going now eight years into the recovery cycle, you still have reasonable supply and demand economics. You don’t have markets that are all trending negative and you’re not in a recessionary environment. So, supply and demand looks reasonably well. And if you look out into ‘19 and ‘20, lots of folks believe that you’re going to have a reduction in new development because of the pressure on land prices and costs and what have you. So, there’s that hope that and I think view that supply is going to be going down over the next few years and demand continues to look really good with millennials, with -- when you look at every cohort of group, whether it be millennials or baby boomers, we have an increase in propensity to rent apartments across the board. As a matter of fact, between 2014 to today, the increase in demand for people 55 and older for market rate apartments is about the same in terms of market share as for millennials. And you have this really interesting thing going on which is, millennials have very high propensity to rent, the 55 and olders have a lower propensity but there’s a whole lot of those. So, if you have an uptick in how -- in capture rate for those, which we’ve been having for the last 10 or 15 years, having an increase in propensity to rent for those people, you have this really nice increase in demand model that you can really look forward to the next three or four years. So supply and demand are good. The next big issue is inflation, inflation that drives cap rates. And what’s driving the 10-year today is incredibly low unemployment and wage pressure which we’re feeling and all of our competitors are feeling. And so, I think people are not thinking it’s deflationary, I think they’re thinking that we’re maybe getting back to an inflationary environment, which supports short-term leases and the ability to raise rents on those short-term leases. So, then, you hit the 10-year, right, which is the last piece of the equation, the 10-year even at what it is today is still very low relative to long-term interest rate. So, I don’t think pricing is going to change at all. If anything, it’s going to get more competitive because when you start putting the inflation equation on the table for investors, they’re like well, maybe I should go to an inflation protected asset like a multifamily asset. So, all that said, I don’t see price -- I don’t see cap rates moving much given the 10-year tenure and it’s going to be a competitive environment unless something dramatically changes on the supply and demand side or something that we don’t know is out there from an economic shock perspective.
Austin Wurschmidt: I appreciate the detailed response there. And to the first point, as a follow-up, given depths, I guess -- the liquidity in the market today, the fact that we’re through the wall of CMBS maturities, do you think there’s a potential we see more portfolio deals this year and is that something that you’d be interested in?
Ric Campo: I think, we’re interested in portfolio deals and one-offs. The challenge you have with portfolio deals generally is that there’s always a -- you have to sort of take the whole thing and often times you have to choose whether you want everything, and sometimes that’s not ideal. But, on the other hand, we’re looking at all these different activities. I think that -- I think, there is definitely going to be an increase in sales this year because when we think about the merchant builder model which is how properties get built, the merchant builders are having trouble reloading their balance sheets because they are holding assets longer than usually do. And primarily, because it took longer to build and you have had -- had a sort of feathering in of the inventory, which is serving good on the market side because you haven’t flooded the market as fast as it could have been, given the delay in construction that everybody has had across the country because of lack of labor. So, with that said though, merchant builders are full. In order for them to reload to do their next few deals, they do have to sell. And you also have the equity side of that equation that is in play, which they have equity in there and they have funds, and the funds are unwinding with other properties, what have you. And so, they don’t want to hold assets too long too because their sort of levered IRR start going down, longer they hold, assuming that prices are sort of not going dramatically up. And so, I think that’s driving the market to more sales, probably more portfolio sales, and we are going to look at it all.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Your average monthly rental rent increased this quarter sequentially and that goes against the grain of pretty much all of your peers. Can you just explain that dynamic? Did you purposely focus on pushing the rates versus occupancy?
Keith Oden: So, John, the biggest change in our portfolio was just the flip-flopping what was going on in Houston from third to fourth quarter. We were -- even as late as the second quarter call, we were still thinking that Houston could be down 4% for the year on rental revenues. And obviously, we had a reversal of that in the third quarter and a pretty decent sequential increase in Houston and it’s 12% of our footprint. So, it’s always enough to move the needle when we get that kind of a shift. That’s the only market that I can point to where other than sort of what’s normal things that happen seasonally in our portfolio in some of our markets, Phoenix et cetera that do benefit from the fourth quarter generally over the third. But, everything else looks kind of what you would typically see in our portfolio with the exception in Houston, and that was a big shift.
John Kim: It seems like it was pretty strong across the board but you’re basically saying you didn’t change anything as far as the rate versus occupancy trade this quarter?
Keith Oden: No, we didn’t. Again, look at the occupancy rates across the board in our platform, and we normally try to operate somewhere around 95% occupied, and we have got a -- most of our markets are operating north of that. And in that environment, you still from a revenue management standpoint, the model is still going to want to push rents.
John Kim: Okay. And the second question is on your redevelopment guidance, which seemed like it was new this year of about $30 million. Can you just remind us how this compares to 2017 because it’s not on your CapEx schedule?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So, the redevelopments are new. So, in the past, we have been doing repositions. Redevelopments is a new concept, introduced in 2018. What we are going to do is combine a traditional reposition program with extensive exterior upgrades, and we are taking assets that will be redeveloped out of same-store. And we currently have three assets that are in that bucket, two in South Florida and one in Arlington. And total spend for those for 2018 is going to be somewhere around $25 million to $30 million.
John Kim: The redevelopments you are taking out of same store pool, repositions and revenue enhancing are kept in the same store?
Alex Jessett: That’s correct.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Two market questions for you. First, just going back to Houston, Keith, in your response to one of the earlier questions, I didn’t know if you were saying that you expected Houston to end at 94% versus the 97% now. So, I didn’t know if I misunderstood that. And then, second is, when do you think that we’ll see a return of development in Houston, just given the dramatic drop off that we’ve had north to 60%? How long do you guys think before people start putting 2 by 4s in the ground again and we get supply coming back?
Keith Oden: Alex, I think, I said 94 to 95, which is what I was trying to be specific on that, other than just say back to a more normal situation. Obviously, 97.5% occupied is just not normal. It’s not normal for Houston, it’s not normal for any of our markets. I expect to get back to normal but in so doing, we’re going to have to -- at some point, we’ll be bleeding off 250 basis points of occupancy, which I expect to happen over the course of 2018. In terms of new construction, I think that you’re -- you’ve got people right now that are just sort of -- got bailed out in some cases of their last round of new developments by the Harvey effect. There’s discussion, there’s always conversations about potential new starts. But, I think, the reality of the world that we live in today with how long it takes to get through the planning and permitting process even in Houston, it’s just -- restarting of the development pipeline, meaningful -- to have a meaningful impact in 2019 and 2020 I just think is not likely to happen. We obviously started our Downtown community in the fourth quarter at the end of last year. That’s a community that we bought land on years ago, it’s been part of our legacy land portfolio. We just did that opportunistically, because we look out on the horizon, 7,000 completions this year in 2018; I don’t have -- let’s see, in terms of completions or projected completions in Houston for 2019, about 5,000 apartments are projected to be completions in the entire Houston metropolitan area, which is an extraordinarily low number. Our building Downtown is the type 1 high rise construction, and we won’t even be delivering units there until probably the first part of -- or late ‘19, early 2020. So, I think...
Ric Campo: I think, the other thing that’s really interesting that’s going on when we talk about Harvey, I was at Urban Land Institute event this week in Houston, and one of the engineers who is working on the city’s new response to detention, mitigation and raising the elevations of new construction, there’s a major move that could significantly negatively impact the ability of people to build as a result of these new rules. And these new rules actually are coming into play. Harris County put in new rules just recently and it just makes it more expensive, takes up more land, takes -- requires more infill dirt [ph] and what have you. So, the cost side equation is being driven up by new Harvey regulations. And it’s classic government though when you think about it, to a certain extent because they’re pushing the new developers to spend a whole lot more money and creating -- making it more difficult, which is sort of good for the incumbents, right? And the city I think in mid February has a very restrictive program that actually takes the -- requires developers to go above the 500-year floodplain by I think 12 inches or something like that. And that -- all those things are kind of impediments that heretofore were never really impediments in Houston. So, you’re having a little bit more regulatory constraint that’s going to constrain people. The other thing is also, lenders are not rushing back into Houston to make loans there at this point. They’re sort of waiting, and there’s a lot of wait and see. So, the equity capital and the debt capital are not like blasting in there saying let’s go build, and you still have in markets like -- in pockets that didn’t get flooded, fair amount of concessions that are still going on in those lease-ups. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, the second one is on Orlando, which for Axiometrics seems to be benefiting from the Caribbean influx. So, could you just give a little more detail what you expect for Orlando, both rent -- your occupancy there is it 97, so obviously what you expect there, and then as far as the supply picture as we look out into ‘18?
Keith Oden: Yes. Sure, Alex. We have Orlando as an A minus and stable. I mean, we expect it to be one of our best performers this year. We’re going to be probably in the 3 to 3.5 to 4% on top line revenue growth, which is down from last year, but last year it was in the top 3 or 4 in our entire portfolio. And yes, it is true that there has been a very significant influx. People from Puerto Rico that are -- we’ve done a lot of homework on this and it is true that the port of entry or the place of destination of a lot of the people from Puerto Rico is Orlando. So, they’re going to get the normal job growth that we would have seen in Orlando but we’re also going to see a big influx of other potential residents. So, Orlando, we have it as the third or fourth best market in our portfolio this year, so looking for another really good strong year in Orlando.
Ric Campo: Orlando, just to give you a sense of this Puerto Rican connection. So, the number one city in America with Puerto Rican heritage is New York City, number two is Orlando. And so, we’re getting at least 5 to 10 Puerto Rico sort of effects in our properties there. Right now, it’s sort of anecdotal but as long as Puerto Rico continues to be challenged, more people are flowing out.
Operator: The next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. What’s the expected stabilized yield on the current development pipeline? And what have you guys been achieving on the stuff that’s completed and are stabilized in the last year or so?
Ric Campo: So, our overall portfolio yield’s around 6.25, 6.5 something like that. The high rises are lower and the mid rises are higher. And the trend on development yields is down unfortunately, obviously because you’re later in the cycle and comps are higher, and it takes longer to build today. Our yields sort of on the last maybe batch of -- that were fully stabilized were probably in the 7 range and now we’re down into the low-6 kind of zone at this point.
Rob Stevenson: And for the stuff that you guys expect to start in ‘18, where are you on that, are you basically cherry picking the best returns, are you sort of targeting specific markets on that?
Ric Campo: We are obviously -- we are absolutely driven by long-term, unlevered IRRs that have a spread against our long-term weighted average cost of capital. So, while we -- markets are important for -- in terms of driving the decision, the key is making sure that the numbers work going in. And a good example would be, we’ve owned land in South Florida that we’ve been trying to figure out how to build on for a long time and we just hadn’t been able to make the numbers work. I remember our Boca deal, I think we owned the land maybe eight years before it started working. And then, we -- and it made sense, and it’s a right yield now. So, it’s more driven by return that we can -- long-term unlevered IRRs that we can earn, not necessary markets. We do developments today because of land cost and construction cost. You can’t look at -- you look at a market like Charlotte for example and we’ve built three properties in Charlotte. And the construction cost from those three properties is probably on average up 30% today for what we booked them for in the last three years. And the rents are not 30% obviously. So, you know what that does to yields.
Rob Stevenson: Alex, what do you guys renew on your insurance and what are you expecting there, and you guys plan to do more self insurances if rates go up meaningfully?
Alex Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So, we are actually in the market right now working on a renewal. It’s with the May 1st effective date. What we’re being told on the property side is to expect premiums up 10% to 20%, and that’s what we have rolling through. But when you actually take property and you combine it with general liability and all of other insurance lines, and then pull in our self-insured retention component, we’ve got property insurance for calendar year 2018 that’s about 5%. And there’s no doubt this is going to be a very tough renewal process.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: I just want to follow up on Rob’s question there. So, on the 2018 starts, what is the stabilized yield and spread to prevailing cap rate assumptions?
Ric Campo: So, the yields, assuming that we get these yields because we haven’t started them obviously, are going to be in the sort of low sixes, and the spread to cap rates in those markets today is probably 150 basis points.
John Pawlowski: So, Ric or Keith, you were able to raise equity at what in hindsight is a pretty attractive price, given the selloff here in REITs. And so, five months later, you are left with a different opportunity set, and deploying that capital, to your comments, acquisition and developments are really getting more competitive. So, you can buy stabilized yields at mid to high 4, you could build at a 6, which carries some risk. But now suddenly you can buy the stock back at a mid 5 and implied yield with no risk. So, has this discount probably you’ll reevaluate your plan at all? If not, what discount will it take for you to change your plans?
Ric Campo: So, obviously the stock price selloff for all the multifamily companies is obviously new in a sense it’s about, what, a three or four-week deal. And we put together our plans through the end of the year. And I think, you always have to reevaluate where you are based on current market conditions. And we have been -- we haven’t been in this period long enough to sort of abandon our program for this year and say okay, let’s go buy the stock back at this point. Just historically, we’ve always said that -- obviously buying your stock back at a significant discount is an opportunity that doesn’t happen that often. And when we bought back 16% of our Company at roughly at 20% discount during the sort of tech days in 1998, ‘99 and 2000, we had a persistent discount. And we were able to then sell an asset and buy the stock back and it was very methodical and perfunctory at the time to do it and it was the right thing to do. And if the stock stays at a significant discount and we have a -- as persistent we’re able to get size in the buyback, then we do it. So, we’re evaluating that now and we’ll continue to evaluate it. If you look at the last maybe four or five years, I mean, it’s been really interesting. The volatility of these stocks has been huge. I mean, starting back when -- I think we were trading at maybe 15% to 16% discount at the beginning of 2014 or maybe 2013 and we had lots of conversations around the -- our senior management table and our Board table saying, you know what, this is silly, we’ve got to go buy the stock. And then, the stock is up $20 a share in a month. And so, we didn’t have the opportunity to buy at that point. So, it has to be persistent and it has to be -- and it has to be a significant discount for us to sort of change our long-term strategy of owning and operating apartments and driving cash flow.
John Pawlowski: So, at today’s current levels, obviously nothing stays static but at current levels, if it doesn’t make you -- if it persisted today, it would make you reconsider?
Ric Campo: Well, I think the key is, if you think about what we did the last time, it was 20% discount and it was persistent. I mean, the challenge you have in terms of trying to buy the stock back is that to make a difference in your -- in getting sized, it’s hard to do, it takes a while to do it. And so, we’re going to evaluate it. And we’re just going to put the capital allocation priorities on the table and say alright, here’s what you get from development, here’s what you get from acquisitions, here’s what you get from buying stock, how can you do this and how can you do something that makes sense, in the short term, knowing that this is a long-term business. So, we’re going to look at it, obviously. And if we get an opportunity to create a lot of value that drives cash flow and drives cash flow per share growth and we can do that with little execution risk, then, we’re going to do it.
Operator: Our next question is from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Question on Washington DC, kind of your forgotten largest market. Going out to 2018, it seems like outside of maybe defense, government and government related employment should be pretty weak, combining that with new supply. I guess, I am just curious, how you view your relative portfolio positioning in the market? And whether -- is there any kind of new strategy for this year in terms of managing for occupancy versus rate or anything like that that you’re doing that’s proactive.
Ric Campo: Well, first, the thing to me that your comment that it’s driven by government workers, I would disagree with that. It’s -- definitely, government is significant part of the economy. But, if you think about the DC metro area, one of the highest education profiles for MBAs and master degrees, one of the richest, highest paid workforces, lots of technology, very economically driven by the overall economy. And I would say given the tax cuts and given the sort of kind of animal spirits perhaps that the administration is kind of creating on the business side, you could pick up additional economy growth that would help DC. I’m not worried so much about the government and what their workers are doing.
Keith Oden: So, just from the standpoint of where the numbers shake out, I mean, our DC portfolio, we have a very different footprint than a lot of our competitors do. It’s not heavily oriented towards DC proper. But last year, on total revenue, DC produced top line revenue growth of about 3.2%. I think, we’re looking at something closer to 3%, so a slight decline from the prior year but 2018 to me, unless you get any external shocks and government shutdowns and other madness that comes and goes from time to time in DC, it just seems like almost a repeat of 2017. We’re going to get probably another 10,000 apartments delivered in 2018, but we should get about 40,000 new jobs. And that’s okay, that’s enough to keep us kind of in a steady state at about 3% top line revenue growth.
Drew Babin: Would it be fair to say that on supply side, I mean, the vast majority of the supply that’s going to impact the MSA is kind of located down, maybe in the ballpark area Southwest DC, maybe few other pockets. I guess, are there any pockets in Camden’s portfolio where there might just be kind of an outsized impact from anything delivering in ‘18?
Keith Oden: So, in 2018, it was like -- I’ve mentioned 10,000 completions. I don’t think -- I think the two -- the area down by the ballpark that you mentioned is definitely going to be -- there’s a competitive set there that’s going to impact us. Outside of that, we’ve been pretty fortunate with our footprint in the DC area to have missed a good portion of this cycle of new development, and I think that probably -- and that certainly has been baked into our 3% growth plan for next year.
Operator: Our next question is from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: First question just has to do with the storm-impacted markets, which I guess really are considered to be Houston, Orlando and Tampa all collectively. If we think about 2017, the final revenue number came in 2.9 I think versus the 2.8 midpoint that you started the year. Any sense how much the storms benefited that number and assuming that’s material where were the offsets relative to initial expectations?
Keith Oden: Yes. So, in Houston, the impact would be meaningful. I mean, it’s pretty easy to do the math. We had a top line revenue decline that was factored in for the year of 4% for the full year and I think we ended up at about 2% for the full year; it’s 12% of our income, so it was 48 basis points in over half a year. It was a meaningful impact from Houston on the overall portfolio. Orlando and Tampa, I would say, it’s approaching zero. I mean, literally, we’ve got very fortunate on the path of the storm and other than a few nicks and bruises and down trees in those two markets, we really didn’t see any impact, either on the operating expense side of things, outside of the just some normal cleanup or on the rental side of things. Just to put it in perspective, we had in Houston, from Harvey, we had about 53 employees who were impacted to one degree -- to some degree from the storm, about 23 of which got literally displaced from their homes by the flood. We did not have a single employee in our Florida footprint, in Miami or South Florida, Tampa or in Orlando who got displaced by the storm event in Florida. So, I would say, it is zero, approaches zero in Florida and was probably pretty meaningful in Houston.
Dennis McGill: I wasn’t thinking of existing residence in Florida but as you talked about earlier, the inflow of demand from outside of Florida.
Keith Oden: Yes. That really didn’t start until almost towards the end of the year where people sort of started throwing up their hands and saying this is way longer of an event than anybody thought it was going to be in Puerto Rico. Maybe we will have some impact in 2018 and that could be helping us with our occupancy rate in Orlando right now, but we will just have to see how that plays out.
Dennis McGill: And then, second question, as you look at the guidance this year, the 3% revenue midpoint. Can you break that down into rent and occupancy? And then, beyond the modest benefit from the cable package that you still expect in ‘18, is there any other ancillary income that would impact that number?
Keith Oden: I would say no on ancillary income. We are 95.7% occupied right now. Our plan for the year would be at about 95 -- little bit north of 95 for the full year. So, very slight impact from occupancy decline, maybe call it 20, 30 basis points. And then, on the rental side, so that would be slightly more than what the three would imply. So, maybe 20 basis points on rent versus the giveback on occupancy.
Dennis McGill: And then, last question, just bigger picture. You talked a lot about wall of capital coming at the space and some of the demographic factors that you would look as being very positive as you look at a couple of years, and a story that’s very similar to what’s driven a lot of the development in the space for the last couple of years. So, trying to just square that with why supply would pull back if those in the industry have those two pillars to stand on and have some optimism for the next couple of years, especially if the belief is other people are pulling back, then would now be a good time to start and so it becomes a little bit self-fulfilling.
Ric Campo: Sure. Well, if developers can get capital, they will start period, right? And because -- and that’s a merchant builder mantra. And so, what’s causing the developers not to start are that rising land costs, rising construction costs, labor shortages in every market have driven construction costs and or just total project costs up higher than rental rate growth. And therefore, the returns that the private equity wants to get on their equity and has just been really hard to get, and so those numbers are -- that’s what’s really driving the slowdown. It’s not that they don’t -- people look at the market and say yes, demand looks good over the next couple of years. And that doesn’t mean you are not going to have construction start on any units but it’s just not going to be at peak levels, it’s going to drop dramatically because you have a lot of deals you just won’t pencil today, and the capital -- if you can’t convince the capital that you are going to make your numbers, then the capital is not going to play. If you look at banks and just the lending environment, it continues to fall in terms of lenders’ appetite to finance multifamily and finance real estate in general. They sort of think it’s late in the cycle. And because of the Basel agreements, I think it’s Basel III or IV that creates this, the category of highly volatile commercial real estate, the lenders have all pulled back. And so, the capital stack for the merchant builders has changed pretty dramatically. In early cycle timeframe, you’re able to get 70% construction loan, recourse burns off after you deliver, and then you do 30% equity and maybe even get higher than 70%. Today, it’s 50%, 55% underlying construction loan, developers are having to go out and put mezz pieces in between the sort of 50%, 55%, 60% if you’re -- best case, and then they put a mezz piece on top of that and then equity on top of that. And so, their cost of capital has gone up in addition to the cost of everything else. And rents have moderated having going up enough to make the numbers work. So, that’s why supply is going down, not that they don’t want to do it, they just aren’t able to make the numbers work.
Dennis McGill: That’s a helpful perspective. So, maybe, one way to think of it is, it’s a wall of capital that won’t get placed?
Ric Campo: Well, the wall of capital that I was talking about is acquisitions, because when you look at acquisitions, that’s a different animal, right? Because most of that acquisition is going at the same way going -- wait a minute now, construction costs are going to go up, 5% to 10 -- 5%, let’s just on average 5% a year for the next five years. And I am a institutional investor and I look out there and say, rents are moderating but they’re still good, there’s still positive NOI and get 2.5%, 3% NOI growth. And if I buy an asset today, no one is going to build against me in the future if it’s going to cost 25% more to build that asset. So, I am going to buy my -- I am going to buy today and knowing that -- or having the belief that I have a growing cash flow that’s inflation-protected in theory and some sort of replacement cost protection, if you will, in the future as well. So, I think that capital gets placed and that’s the sort of the toughest part of the equation is, is competing with that wall of capital. Now in terms of wall of -- there’s not a wall of capital for development because it’s just not as easy of a sale, right, Oh, I have really high…
Dennis McGill: If the wall of capital -- sorry. If the wall of capital drives down, for the acquisitions and drives down cap rate, doesn’t that lower the required return necessary on the development side?
Ric Campo: No, because the problem is, is that -- I don’t think cap rates are going to be driven down, actually, they’re going to stay in the kind of low to mid-4s. And when you start looking at -- the challenge you’re having -- when we’re looking at a project, for example, we just priced in Charlotte, I mean, we can’t get it out of the high-4s from a yield perspective, when it stabilized. And that’s assuming that rents continue to rise in Charlotte at 2% to 3%, and it’s because construction costs went up 30%. So, if I can’t even get my pro forma to get into a 5, then, how do I make that work even if the cap rates today are 4.5 or 4.25 in Charlotte, and I am building to a 4.75, I don’t have enough spread and a merchant builder is not going to get that deal financed. I am not going to do it, even though I don’t have the same capital constraints that they do.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: I appreciate your time today. And we look forward to having more detailed discussions when we start the meeting cycle in March. So, take care and thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, good morning and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call, represent management's current opinions and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete third quarter 2017 earnings release is available in the Investor section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will be brief with our prepared remarks and try to complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. Between hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Camden communities in nine of our 15 markets sustained some damage. For four days of Harvey, we're were riding out the storm in Texas and wondering who'll stop the rain. Just when we could say, I made it through the rain, Irma came along to Rocky like a hurricane reminding us that when it comes to mother nature, we are all just riders on the storm. I want to thank all of our Camden team members who helped our customers, coworkers and neighbors make it through the storms. Our commitment to improving the lives of our customers, team members and shareholders one experience at a time was on full display during and after the storm. Despite the vast destruction of homes in Houston, the storm brought our community together. Camden and other apartment operators had apartment homes ready for displaced people to move into. Many apartment owners followed our lead by freezing rents to pre Harvey levels, leaving moving fees and other expenses. Occupancy levels at our Houston communities increased from 93.5% before the storm to 97.6% today. These occupancy levels should be maintained throughout the fourth quarter and into next year. Apartment fundamentals continued to be good across our markets. Demand is strong driven by job growth and growing demographics at favorable rental markets. Revenue continues to slow as supplies absorbed. We expect supply to peak this year in most of our markets. During the quarter, we finished the lease up on Camden Victory Park in Dallas, we completed construction on Camden Lincoln Station and started construction in Camden RiNo both in Denver. Our development pipeline continues to add significant long term value to Camden. We took advantage of the strong market conditions and issued 445 million in equity during the quarter. The equity offering was all about growth. Last year we saw 1.2 billion of non-core properties at attractive prices, which improved the quality of our portfolio. We're going to use the equity to fund our developments and acquire properties while seeking to keep our balance sheet strong. At this point in the real estate cycle, we expect to see attractive acquisition opportunities as merchant builders move to sell their completed development. I'll turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks Ric. We're really pleased with our third quarter results, despite all the disruption caused by the two storms, our teams managed to get back to business as usual more quickly than we thought possible. They focused on helping each other, our residents and our neighbors returned to normal. Alex is going to walk you through the details of the financial impact of the hurricane on our results. It's perfect to say that from our perspective when you adjust our results for the impact of the storms, we had a very solid third quarter, which should carry over into the fourth quarter. In terms of our same-store performance, revenue growth was 2.5% for the third quarter and 1.1% sequentially. Year-to-date the third quarter was 2.8% and we expect full year 2017 to be around 2.9%, primarily due to the recent occupancy gains in Houston. Most of our markets had revenue growths in the 3% to 5% range in this quarter, led by Atlanta at 5.1%, Orange County at 4.8%, Denver at 4.7%, San Diego at 4.6% and Orlando at 4.5%. As expected and as we discussed on our last conference call, we saw relatively weaker revenue growth this quarter in Austin at 2.1%, Charlotte, at 2% even and South Florida at 1.3%. Houston remained negative, with a 3.1% decline for the quarter, but we expect to see significant improvement in the fourth quarter in Houston, as occupancy has been trending over 97% for the month of October. During the third quarter, new leases were up 1.3% and renewals up 4.8% for a blending growth rate of 2.7 and so far in October it is trending three tenths of a percent up for new leases and up 4.6% on renewals, which is slightly better than what we achieved last October. November and December, renewal offers were sent out at an average increase of 5%. Occupancy averaged 95.9% in the third quarter of '17, versus 95.8% in the third quarter of last year and 95.4% in the second quarter of this year. So far occupancy is trending at 96% versus 95% last October. Net turnover rates remain slightly below the levels that we saw last year with third quarter '17 net turnover rates of 55% versus 57% last year and year-to-date 49% versus 51% last year. Move-outs to home purchases were 14.6% in the third quarter versus 15.6% last quarter and 14.7% in the third quarter of '16. The top reason for residents moving out remains re-location, that is moving out of the city or state or across submarkets at 35%. Obviously, Houston has been on no one's radar screen this year, particularly after the impact of Hurricane Harvey. As mentioned earlier, we saw a significant increase on occupancy rates going from 93.5% pre-hurricane to over 97% now, and we expect occupancy to remain elevated during the fourth quarter and into 2018. New leases in Houston started the year at a negative 8% in the first quarter that improved to negative 4% to 5% during our peak leasing season. As Rick mentioned, we rose pricing for the month of September, but are now seeing leases signed in the negative down 1% to 2% range with renewals up in the up 1% to 2% range. We currently have a very limited inventory of apartments available to lease, and we're entering the traditionally slower time of the year per traffic, so the main driver of same-store revenue growth this quarter should be occupancy rather than rates. We will provide more color on our 2018 Houston outlook in conjunction with our fourth quarter 2017 earnings release and 2018 guidance release schedule for early February. At this time I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander Jessett: Thanks, Keith, before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the third quarter, we reached stabilization at Camden Victory Park an $85 million development in Dallas, completed construction at Camden Lincoln Station, a $56 million development, and started construction at Camden RiNo, a $75 million development both in Denver. Additionally, as a result of Hurricane Harvey, we extended the anticipated sales date for Camden Miramar, our only student housing community from October 1to December 1. Closing of this sale is not guaranteed and is subject to among other items the satisfactory due diligence and financing by the purchaser. As I will discuss later, we have included the impact of this delayed sale in the midpoint of our revised earnings guidance. On the financing side, during the third quarter, we completed a public offering of 4.750 million shares at a net price of $93.18, generating net proceeds of $443 million and issued approximately $2 million of additional shares through our ATM program. We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including financing for acquisitions and funding for development activities. Our current 660 million-development pipeline has approximately $200 million remaining to be spent over the next two and a half years, and we are projecting another $125 million of development to begin construction before year end. We anticipate being more active on the acquisition front targeting recently developed, well located assets in our existing markets. We ended the quarter with no balances outstanding on our unsecured line of credit, $350 million of cash on hand, and no debt maturing until October of 2018. Our current cash balance is approximately $300 million. As a result of our equity issuance, the midpoint of our current earnings guidance no longer assumes an unsecured bond transaction in the fourth quarter of 2017. Moving on to financial results, last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2017 of a $103 million or a $1.11 per share. Included in these results, were approximately $5 million or $5.5 of hurricane related expenses as a result of Hurricane Harvey and Irma. In August 2017, hurricane Harvey impacted certain multifamily communities within our Texas portfolio. In September 2017, hurricane Irma impacted our multifamily communities throughout the State of Florida and in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Charlotte, North Carolina areas. Our wholly-owned multifamily communities impacted by these hurricanes incurred approximately $3.9 million of expenses with no insurance recoveries anticipated. Accordingly, our operating results for the third quarter included a corresponding charge in property operating and maintenance expense to reflect these hurricane damages. These expenses have been excluded from our same-store results. We also incurred approximately $700,000 in other storm related expenses related to these hurricanes, which are recorded in general administrative expenses. Additionally, we recognized our ownership interest of hurricane-related expenses incurred by the multifamily communities of consolidated joint ventures of approximately $400,000 which is recorded in equity and income and joint ventures. Excluding these non-recurring storm-related charges, our third quarter of 2017 FFO per share would have been $1.16 in line with the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $1.14 to $1.18 per share. Contained within the $1.16 per share of FFO, which excludes storm-related expenses were $0.005 and higher than anticipated net operating income from our development and non-same-store communities resulting primarily from each of our development communities leasing ahead of schedule and $0.005 from a combination of lower than anticipated overhead cost due to the timing of certain corporate-related expenditures, higher interest income on investment cash balances, and lower interest expense to the lower line of credit balances. This $0.01 improvement was entirely offset by the impact of a higher than anticipated share count as a result of our 4.750 million share equity offering which closed on September 14. Our same-store operating results were in line with expectations for the third quarter as the increased occupancy in Houston did not occur until late in the quarter. We've updated and revised our 2017 full-year same-store and FFO guidance based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. Entirely as a result of increased levels of occupancies throughout our Houston portfolio, we've increased the midpoint of our full-year revenue growth by 10 basis points from 2.8% to 2.9% and tightened the range from 2.8% to 3%. As Keith mentioned, we are currently over 97% occupied in Houston, up from 92.3% for the fourth quarter of last year. As a result of anticipated general expense savings for the fourth quarter, we have reduced the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance by 5 basis points from 4.1% to 4.05% and tightened the range to 3.95% to 4.15%. As a result of our revenue and expense guidance adjustments, we've increased our 2017 same-store NOI guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint to 2.25% and tightened the range to 2.1% to 2.4%. Last night, we also adjusted and tightened the range for a full-year 2017 FFO per share. Our new range is $4.51 to $4.55 with a midpoint of $4.53. This new midpoint represents a $0.04 per share reduction from our prior midpoint of $4.57; this $0.04 per share reduction is the result of the $0.055 of hurricane related expenses recognized in the third quarter and a $0.06 per share full-year impact from additional shares outstanding as a result of our recent equity offering. This $0.115 combined reduction is partially offset by a $0.015 per share increase from our 25 basis-point increase in same-store net operating income, a $0.02 per share increase from the previously mentioned delayed disposition of our Camden Miramar Student Housing Project in Corpus Christi, Texas, a $0.025 per share increase due to lower interest expense, primarily as a result of the removal of the planned $300 million bond transaction originally planned for late October, combined with lower line of credit balances as a result of the equity offering, a $0.01 per share increased primarily due to higher interest income earned on invested cash balances as a result of the equity offering and a $0.005 in higher net operating income from our development in non same-store communities which we recognized in the third quarter. Last night, we also provided earning's guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.16 to $1.20. The midpoint of $1.18 represents $0.07 per share increase for our $1.11 report in the third quarter of 2017. This increase is primarily the result of $0.055 share decrease in hurricane-related expenses, $0.04 per share or approximate 3% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, driven primarily by our normal third to fourth quarter seasonal decline in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover, and personnel expenses, and the timing of certain property tax refunds. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate approximately $1 million of prior-year property tax refunds resulting from our successful property tax appeals, primarily in Houston,$0.015 per share increase from our non-same-store and development communities, primarily driven by the normal third quarter to fourth quarter seasonal increase in revenue from our Camden Miramar Student Housing Community, partially offset by the planned December 1 disposition of this community and an approximately $0.01 per share increase from a combination of lower interest expense and higher interest income as a result of lower debt outstanding and higher cash balances. This $0.12 per share net increase of FFO will be partially offset by sequential $0.05 fourth quarter impact from the 4.750 million shares issued late in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes no acquisitions are closed by year-end. At this time, we will open the call to questions
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Our first question today comes from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. You mentioned to be more active on acquisitions using the proceeds from the equity deal, so in both markets, you have seen most opportunities today and how are cap rates trending?
Ric Campo: Sure. So, we definitely are focused on acquisitions with the current strength of our balance sheet for sure. Most of the markets that we operate in have pretty good opportunities; what we are really looking for are Merchant Builders products where we can buy at a discount to replacement cost. Cap rates are definitely very sticky on the low end; to give you an example, in June, we bought Camden Buckhead Square; it was a 12% discount with current replacement cost, and it was about 4.5% cap rate in the sort of a four to 12month period. We don't see cap rates moving at all if not they're going down, not up; you just have a significant amount of capital that still is trying to be - find a home in multifamily.
Nick Joseph: And if these deals started to materialize, or are you expecting them to going forward?
Keith Oden: Absolutely, I think that when you think about the Merchant Builder model, they have a meter on the equity, and in order to internally to return hurdles, they need to sell their assets. In addition, in order to reload their capacity to do new transactions, they need to sell those assets as well, so I think we will have a healthy Merchant Builder pipeline. We have seen some already this year but I think next year is going to be a big increase in that pipeline.
Nick Joseph: Thank you. Do you want to use all of your own capital for that or would you partner the biggest question is how big is the pipeline, how big is this opportunity, how much is in the hopper today, and are you going to use all of your own capital, or if the opportunities are so significant, do you use joint venture capital to do it.
Ric Campo: Sure. We tend to avoid use our own capital. We do have a remaining balance from the fund with Texas Teachers, so bottom line is we have a capacity if you keep a moderate debt EBIDTA number of over a billion dollars to acquire, so we will not do any additional joint ventures other than our current relationship with Texas Teachers; we just think it makes more sense to own a 100% of the assets or in the joint venture that we have already but not create any new joint ventures at all. We found during the last downturn that deep pocket joint venture partners don't always dip into your pocket during tough times and so we want to keep her balance sheet clean and very simple to understand, so with that said, our capital in Texas Teachers
Keith Oden: Nick we're focused also on market where's there's been where we know we have an oversupply condition that's either ongoing right now or it's already coming into focus or we expect to see it in 2018 and obviously those markets are the Charlotte's and at some point Houston, Dallas, Austin, and Orlando, and so it's really a matter of looking at individual submarkets, and to Ric's point about the capacity and the use of our own capital. Obviously, some of those markets I just mentioned, Houston being a good example, we're at a point from a from Camden's overall exposure in the Houston market, long-term, we would want to add a bunch of net exposure in Houston so the opportunity would be finding really attractive assets that we could partner with on an 80/20 basis with Texas Teachers not increasing our exposure a bunch but taking advantage of the investment opportunities that we think are coming.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question
Rich Hightower: Good afternoon, guys. First question on Houston can you give us a sense of the composition of new leases signed after the hurricane how many of those were short duration leases versus sort of a traditional, year-long lease, and then, where do you see market rents today versus where your portfolio is positioned, just so we sort of have an idea of what's left in the tank so to speak.
Keith Oden: Yeah, so we obviously had a pretty big component in the weeks and days immediately after the storm; we did accommodate short-term leases. The reality is that we just didn't have all that many apartments to lease because we're going into the storm in the 94% occupied range, so we did accommodate that although we were cautious and we were warning people and trying to get them to understand that the magnitude of this storm if you had flood damage in your home that three months is just not realistic, and as it turns out, our advice was sound and well-reasoned because I think most people have had water damage in their homes and having to go through the process of approvals and then ultimately finding a contractor and getting the work done. I think they're coming to the realization now that it's going to be more likely six to nine months before they can actually get everything put back together and get back in their home and have the work be completed, so we did these in some short-term leases. It didn't have a huge impact on our overall the length of our lease term in Houston, we've accommodated the people who did the original short-term leases, and we have allowed them to re-extend if they want to on a three- or six-month lease, but most people now that are coming in were not impacted by the storm; those people already found a permanent housing solution, it's really not a big issue within our portfolios, it is a pretty small number. So the second part of your question which is where are we on market rents as Ric mentioned we froze rents at pre Harvey prices, and we did that throughout the month of September and we are gradually getting back to what we would think of is regular order. The only thing that we're doing right now is that we do have a cap on renewal increases in Houston of 5% and we expect to move that cap to 10% on renewal increases by November 15, and just a point of reference, 10% renewal cap is what we use in all of our other markets, so it's sort of our standard operating procedure, so we will get back to regular order here pretty quickly. We do have the ability, it seems like it would be a simple thing to do to turn off revenue management, but as it turns out, it's really not, so what we ended up doing is sort of running parallel with our revenue management system and then doing manual pricing for the apartments that were released in the period where we had frozen rental rates. We think that if you kind of look at where our market averages are or market comps relative to our rental rates we're still below market rental comps and that number is somewhere in the 2% range we think across our platform, so we do think there will be additional rental increases as we go back to regular order. One of the things that will certainly happen as we roll in to 2018 and we are fully back on our revenue pricing model and pricing according to just normal supply and demand dynamics is that the model will work really hard to get the occupancy back down to 95% to 96% and the only leverage point that you have to do that is through adjusting price, so over some period of time, I would expect to see a trade-off between a lower occupancy rate 97.7 is pretty close to being minus frictional move in move out; that's pretty close to being a 100% occupied if the model doesn't like that condition, so the only way to remedy that is to is to deal with pricing so I would expect that over time some period of time in 2018, you're going to see our occupancy rate trend back down but the offset to that will be higher run rates.
Rich Hightower: Keith, that's great color. Thanks for that. My second question here since I've got two. I wanted to go back to Ric's prepared comments on supply peaking in 2017 in Camden's market I think it depends on the source one consults for this sort of thing, but we sort of see it as an '18 event in many of the Sundown markets and I'm just it that a commentary on submarket specifically or is there something else, just different data sources in your view.
Ric Campo: The different data sources we used two different data sources for the multifamily completions. If you look at Witten's numbers, he has supply peaking in 2017 at about 139,000 apartments over or 140,000 apartments Camden's footprint, and he has 2018 at about 137,000, so, yes, it's peaking but on his metrics, there is still a lot of supply that is coming in 2018 and I think the wild card there on the data providers is how much of that - do we still determined yet how much of the '17 originally scheduled completions get rolled over into 2018 because if people are just having trouble getting their jobs completed with all the labor shortages, so there's a question if you look at Axiometrics' numbers, they have a much clearer view of a peek - in 2017, they have 162,000 apartments being delivered and if you roll that over in to 2018, their numbers 136,000, and if you go out to '19, their number falls under a 100,000, so Witten's number looks like it's a little more smooth than Axiometrics. I think the difference is probably in how they're handling the shifting of projected deliveries between '17 and '18.
Rich Hightower: Thanks for the color, Ric.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from Bank of America / Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for your time. Just following up on Richard's question on Supply, hoping you could give your views on may be the top five or six markets you see maybe not Houston we know that LA, Atlanta, South Florida, Dallas, where you expect supply to be '18 verse '17.
Keith Oden: Sure. The Dallas '17 completions, we have at 22,000 apartments rolling over to 19000 in 2018; Houston, we have at 15,000 apartments in '17 and that drops to about 6,000 apartments in '18; LA 14,000 apartments in '17, stay pretty flat in '18; and another 14,000 apartments between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, you add those together and what we call our Southeast Florida Market, that's 10,000 apartments this year and that rolls down to about 6,000 next year. By the way, I'm giving you Witten's number, not Axiometrics numbers which is the one that the data provider that we put a little bit more emphasis on what are the market - Washington DC 9000 apartments, it goes to about 10,000 apartments in 2018.
Unidentified Analyst: May be, Atlanta.
Keith Oden: Atlanta, 11,400 apartments , going to 11,200 in '18, so basically flat year-over-year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then just on maybe Dallas and Atlanta, both kind of higher supply markets what are you seeing on the concession front, any spike; one of your peers talked about particularly in the Uptown Dallas some higher concession levels recently, if you could just give it to your sense of what you're experiencing in your specifics of markets.
Keith Oden: I think when you think about concessions, merchant builders are very rational players; when they have empty buildings, they rushed to the door to get as much free rent as they can to grab market share. The worst thing you can do is a merchant builder during a concessionary period is to be the last one to get to the biggest concession, and so in certain submarkets you are seeing a month to two months free we haven't seen three, but generally it's a month to two months and some of the markets that are leasing up substantial number of units. In Dallas, we are fairly insulated with some of our properties because we have fair amount of sort of last cycle BB plus properties as opposed to direct competition with new development. Yes, on Dallas, I don't speak to anybody else's the results, but in Dallas and Atlanta, we certainly see a small amount of deceleration between third quarter and fourth quarter but it's - you're talking you know 30 basis points plus or minus between those two markets, we're not seeing that kind of impact and it could be supply and could be submarket-driven, as to where somebody else's assets are located, but we clearly have not seen that so far this year and we're not forecasting that in the 4th quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to touch the supply a little bit again and when you look at some of these markets that are a little bit of flatter in terms of supply, any of that you think that could be a risk of turning negative in 2018.
Ric Campo: No. I think that when you think about the markets that have the supplies, they are also the markets that have the jobs, and if the supply in most of these markets are - and Dallas is just knocking the ball out of the park in terms of job growth, Atlanta the same thing. Are you saying you think you're going to have negative revenue growth in '18 in these markets?
Austin Wurschmidt: Any specific markets, like in Austin or Dallas.
Ric Campo: No. We don't think so, but we are obviously not prepared to give guidance at this point.
Keith Oden: So we are not enough sharp we haven't gotten there yet, but I can tell you based on Ron Witten's work for the 2018 forecast across Camden's platform, he's actually got revenues reaccelerating in to 2018 relative to 2017 and I'm just glancing over the numbers I don't [indiscernible] see anything below 2.5% revenue number on Witten's numbers and that's not are our numbers but that's just a data point for you, he actually has taking into consideration - of a big chunk of that is - in our portfolio is the turnaround in Houston from a negative number in '17 to probably what would be a solid positive number in 2018, so we don't see it and certainly Ron Witten does not see it in the work that he does.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yeah, that's helpful. Thanks for the color, Keith, and then second question just was hoping that you could just give us your thinking on getting more offensive on the front on the investment side at this point in the cycle and then maybe a little bit more color as to may be the number of units that your underwriting today are they mostly one off's or are you saying some portfolio opportunities out there.
Keith Oden: So, the reason that we're getting more constructive about buying today is because the type of property that's out there in the marketplace is merchant-builder very high quality property, really hasn't been around much in terms of being able to buy those properties. If you look at the investor appetite, today, value-add properties have the highest bid, 20-plus bidders on every property and we start getting into merchant-builder product, that is definitely being impacted by supply, free rent embedded in the portfolios; there are just fewer buyers for those, and so we like to play in that space. There's no question about that. We have a long list of pipeline. I mean, you were always looking at even when we're not major on offense acquisition wise. We always have a list of several billion dollars' worth of property that we are underwriting. In terms of portfolios, there are few portfolios out there and we look at those as well the challenge there is generally a portfolio may have kind of cats and dogs and we are more oriented in taking specific rifle shots for submarkets that we really like, and if there's a portfolio that has more of what we like and less of what we don't like, then we'll definitely take a look at that. We clearly have done portfolios in the past and they've worked out pretty well, but I think there's a combination of one offs and portfolios out there and there's no shortage of product.
Austin Wurschmidt: So just small enough, so is it fair to assume they have given the quality of product in some of these newer development or even lease-up deals, the initial accretion could be limited out of the gate.
Keith Oden: Yeah, absolutely, I think if you look at what we did at Camden Buckhead Square, you know the 12-month forward cap rate we think is 4.5 but that means you start out probably slightly less than that, and you have to then move it up by brand concessions off, but when you think about being able to buy at other replacement cost in all high quality markets with embedded concessions, you're starting out at a lower number than you would otherwise like, but that's part of the underwriting mechanism you need to do. Now, over time, your unleveraged IR is really good, but you do have to sot of suffer through a lower cash flow return initially.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning down there. Two questions first, I think it was something like 46,000 Bacon apartments or something of that sort before the storm. Can you just give us an update sort of where the broader Houston market stands right now; you guys spoke where your occupancy is, but as far as the competitive set, can you just give us some color there.
Keith Oden: Sure, so the market just to put in perspective for folks is 638,000 apartments in Houston. It's a very, very big market and the region, by the way, is 1700 square miles, so it's not like ones across the street from another right. There was about 16,000 units plus or minus that we were actually taken out of the inventory, so that increased the occupancy rate of a little bit, and the occupancy rate, if you take the entire market, it was somewhere in the high 80s percent and it went up to the low 90s, maybe a 150 to 200 basis points up, but I think we have to be very careful with these broad numbers because when you take sort of the A,B,C, D level properties, if the A properties that are under construction probably have the most vacancy and then there's a lot of older properties that probably have pretty little bit low occupancies as well. If you go to the pockets where there was disruption for the single-family homes, there's about five or six areas where the homes were really affected, and in those areas, the occupancy have gone from low 90s to high 90s. There's really no inventory in those markets and where you see the vacancy, it tends to be in the urban core interestingly enough the downtown area, River Oaks, West University did not flood as much from a residential perspective. This flood was a residential flood; it wasn't a commercial flood, and so all the businesses have got back to business really quickly and dislocation of those - they went to places that were close to their home and close to their work and not necessarily towards - say new downtown properties, and even though they all got a lift, the Westside, Eastside, Northside got a bigger lift than the areas that didn't flood.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay so, and then just going to the - you said that all of the home repair people the people are flooded out of their home, that traffic all came and now the tenants that you're seeing are more regular tenants, but you're saying that the portfolio should do well or Ron Witten is saying the portfolio should do well next year, so is the demand for apartments are now being driven by people coming to Houston to help rebuild or why is the overall market suddenly going to do better if the immediate demand for displaced people has already been satisfied?
Ric Campo: So, Alex, if you see look at Witten's work, he has total job growth in 2018 in Houston at that about 79,000 jobs, and then he has deliveries of new apartments in Houston at about 7000 so that's the better than 10:1 ratio of jobs. Now he has a lower number for 2017 job growth than what we've been using, s there may again these different data sources giving you different results, but directionally, he's got a much bigger job growth number than what the Greater Houston partnership is carrying, and I think some of it is just as for the mismatch between '17 and '18 growth, but even if you put the two together we are looking at pretty decent job growth next year for Houston, a real rebound, and in terms of new deliveries, it's going to be pretty limited and we have about run the course on these apartments, so happened in the flood event is that you pull forward a tonne of demands that probably would have naturally occurred over 2018, you pulled it forward into the third and fourth quarters of 2017, and I think it's the other people who we were here or in apartments because they were affected by the flood, it's going to be longer rather than they may imagined and so you're probably going to get a continued effect of the carryover of the flood victims, but you're also going to get a fair amount of new job growth in Houston next year.
Keith Oden: I think the key is to make sure when you think about the flood folks that thought initially they be able to get their house fixed in three months, it's more likely to be six or nine, but those are folks that have means those are folks that have insurance; and 80% of the people that were flooded didn't have insurance. When you look at the overall impact of a storm like Harvey is going to last not 9 months or 6 months but really two years or three years of pressure on housing because of all the complicated piece of the equation how much government funds come in and what they do to deal with some of the flood mitigation issues and that might I think most people think it's going to boost job growth above what normally would have been by at least 5000 or 10,000 jobs just because of the fixing of the infrastructure and the homes over the next couple years, so you really did pull the man forward but you also added the man to what was already thought to be a recovery market in 2018.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Bill [ph] from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, just turning to DC, just have a question on same-store revenue growth if you can comment on that by submarket
Keith Oden: We can we can get you our submarket stats and we will send them to you offline.
Unidentified Analyst: Is there any submarkets or you're kind of still worried about supply in to '18.
Keith Oden: We are worried about supply generally in DC because we have got probably another 10,000 apartments that are going to be delivered next year which is roughly what we got this year, so it's not like we're going to get a big relief on the supply side of things, but we do forecast next year job growth, and about what it was this year; it was somewhere around 50,000 to 60,000 jobs, so as long as those numbers are okay, if 10,000 of the apartments get 50,000 jobs, that's pretty close to equilibrium. The real question for operators is where is that supply being delivered, and so far, the footprint of our portfolio has fared better than most and as we talked about last call, we think that has to do with our geography within the DC Metro, Northern Virginia has held up really well, Maryland's held up really well. We are just about to complete a lease up in the DC Metro area, if not in the district and it's gone extremely well for us, so first and second quarter in DC were actually a better than our original expectations. We think that for the year we end up somewhere around 3% revenue growth in DC, and if you go back to what our originally guidance was we had DC rated B-rated market and improving and that's kind of what we've gotten this year. So, I think it can roll forward 2018; it looks a lot like 2017; if we get the job growth as projected and we absorb another 10,000 apartments and then again where the pressure comes is where those 10,000 apartments are being delivered.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks and just my second question on Houston, your Camden downtown project what conditions do you need to start construction there and when could that potentially happen?
Ric Campo: What was interesting about that project is we announced it before Harvey and we are going down the trial trying to start it by the end of the year, and we think it's going to be a great timing in terms of being able to deliver product in to the market that doesn't have a lot of supply.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Drew Babin: Thanks for taking my question; a quick question circling back to DC, I may be phrasing it a little differently I was curious what the gap is between What Camden's rents are and the effective rents on the supplies being delivered, and what that gap looks like.
Keith Oden: Well, it depends - so when you think new products being delivered, it's all the way from sub urban, Walkup Garden apartments to high rises in the districts and the spread on that would be anywhere between, so the low end of that range, the surface part apartments in the Meshfalton area, you probably in the $65 to $70 range for high rise products in the district. You note that $3 is quite afford, it's just, to answer that question I'll have to kind of know, what area counter we're talking about and then what advantage of product. But in Camden's we are all at the tie end of that, about $3 plus would be our new lease up in the district. Our normal product in the average method is roughly $27, 000 a door and average to that will be our entire portfolio, across the districts about $19, 000 ramp. So, again unit mix matters a lot, depending on how large the units are, but broadly speaking $3 plus in the district, call it $60, $70 in the suburbs would be the lowest end of the rounds per square.
Drew Babin: Okay that helps. And then the question at Miami, were exactly further I would say, quite a bit of deceleration in the quarter. Was there any top line in the ways from Irma? Been impacted the numbers or not, and then there goes my question is, kind of a supply timing is this for the most part, when I better deviate?
Keith Oden: Yeah, so the easy part of that question is, the knowledge from Irma and it turns out, there's no really no knowledge from, in our portfolio. We had relatively minor damage in the steamer things, we have one of our high risers that get some water from the storm surge, it's but honestly, we had all units available, all working units that were available to be least within three days of that , we are back available Ivy, so there's really no impact of that. It's got to be photos one of those three markets that we talked about on our last call. I specifically kind of called out Austin, Charlotte and Southeast Florida as places where the supply in the competitive is really, we are really starting to feel it in those three markets. So, we are deceleration in Southeast Florida, it's likely they continue into the fourth quarter. You know you got some different things that are going on I Southeast Florida, one of which is this incredible glut and air large of new condominium projects. Many of which are struggling to do, you know, take up your sales numbers and ultimately as we all know, at some point the condominium permanent home ownership during becomes a rental, a rental scenario. And there is no questions that are two biggest inner light and contributors which will contribute in [indiscernible], are going to be impacted by that.
Ric Campo: I think the wild card for Florida in general, this will include Orlando and Southeast Florida, and this is not Irma but Maria. If you look there's been about 75, 000 Puerto Ricans that have been helped, come to Florida already. And, they rather Miami, when you look at the concentration of Puerto Rican's where they live in Florida, Orlando, is actually the largest market for Puerto Ricans. There seems some increase in demand from what's going on in Puerto Rico and I think that given the scale, of the disruption there and the time it's been taken to, give that back on line Florida could have an increase in demand that we don't expect, that we haven't expected, as a result of you know Puerto Rican's trying to find a place with electricity.
Drew Babin: That's very helpful thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lewis from SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Lewis: Hi, thank you, my first question is on your new strength, I guess, I realize there's some Governor's in place, but I might have expected the rent squares to be a little higher already. And, I was wondering if you could put some numbers around, market rents there? Do you think, next year it could go up 10% or more than that or less than that? If it's helpful, what is the management sort though, the revenue management sort will tell you to do today, it's that kind of nonsensical I know, you know in an environment like this?
Keith Oden: Sure, if you the revenue manger system, if it were, if it wouldn't permit this, the direct recommendations initially, it will be looking at our cost at, we think there's probably about 2%, 2% to 2.5% gap that resulted from us, kind of saying we are not going to freeze pricing prior on that. Again we are back, by November 15, perform new release in renewals, we'll be completely back to regular order and whatever the pricing is, the pricing is. At some time, we have to find a market clearing price for these ramps, which we will do. And so I think, as you think about, is we think about and look forward into 2018. And just kind of estimate the impact. Again we are not, anywhere close to the point where we are prepared to talk about individual markets, or individual rent levels. But, I think it's instructive to look again at what our data providers are telling us, and if you are looking where Ron Witten's numbers were for rents, the delta between rents in 2018 from the pre Harvey and post Harvey, what is now I am still saying is, there's about a 5% higher in what he was forecasting pre Harvey. So, I think that's those are constructive in the sense of the magnitude, now just keep in mind, that he always what he forecast or that effective run rates, and that doesn't, you got to separate that from revenue growth. Because, our portfolio rolls over on average 8% of it per month over the course of the year, so even if the rains strike at the beginning of the year, you've got leases in place that are not going to be affected, till that lease comes up. So, you have to be careful with using the difference between rental rates and revenue growth. But, I think regardless you pass it, 2018 is going to be substantially different than what it would have without Harvey. Now, I can't give you the exact our forecast around there, but will certainly provide that to you as part of our guidance for 2018.
Michael Lewis: And just to give you a chance you wouldn't have Susan ad the number one market for growth in America next year? My second question, the sales survey guidance, but if I look outside the Houston and Florida, which are most effected by hurricanes, every market except their land, or same store revenues or decelerate in front of you. You know, my question is, when you high point from the storm, almost nine years from the Florida market trending ahead or behind of what you're previous expectations were?
Keith Oden: They are trending to Ryan accordance of what our budgets are. When you think about deceleration, I mean, our markets and I think generally the markets across the country have been decelerating for last two or three years. And it's a function of you have plenty of demand; you know we have the same job broke issues; we are leisure, the issue in the supply. That's why we point out the supply, appears to be peaking the show next year and so, it's really that the pressure that the market is getting because of the new supply list in the market place. So, the markets are performing exactly the way we thought they would.
Michael Lewis: That's brilliant thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS, please go ahead with your question.
Nick Yulico: Oh thanks, just one question, I think last quarter you talked about some new initiatives you are looking at for ancillary revenue growth since the tech package is rolling off. Any update on these initiatives and you know what type of same-store revenue benefit you might be able to get next year from those since the tech package is rolling off?
Keith Oden: Yeah, I'm not, haven't really come up with what we talked about last quarter but I can tell you this, there's not anything that we can share with you right now, that would be meaningful material to achieve 2018 results. We are looking at all kinds of things around the home of the future, and there's Amazon is doing all kinds of interesting things but form a revenue impact standpoint in 2018 nothing specific.
Nick Yulico: Okay and the tech package fully rolls off this year that benefit.
Ric Campo: Yeah, this is the year where you'll see really the last incremental major impact.
Nick Yulico: Okay got it, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Polaski from Green Street Advisors. Please go with your question.
John Polaski: Thanks, our question on pricing barrier seem that existing panel, outside Houston there is a low growth accelerate in any market in third quarter, or is it currently accelerating early fourth quarter? First of the year is okay.
Keith Oden: Yeah, I don't have that stat in front of me John, and I'd be glad to send it to you offline, when we do pass that by markets, I just don't have it in front of me.
John Polaski: Yeah, that's fine. And one last one on the acquisition opportunity, hypothetically if you would buy a $1 billion in product next year, and you can opine on that number probably realistic it could be, if you held today's market pricing personal resources of funds how would you be , how would you find that $1 billion in acquisitions in terms of disc decisions exactly and that?
Keith Oden: So, we would when you think about that, we use part of our fund which is about $400 million plus and minus. And then we would use the equity offering, obviously the cash from that and give him where our debt to EBITDA ratio, having a combination of borrowing and then probably somewhere in the $100 million dispositions to fund that as well. And we also have roughly 350 million in cash, our balance sheet today so that would obviously be part of that. In addition to that, we have to fund our development pipeline, to spend on our development pipeline, which is a couple of 100 million next year.
John Polaski: Okay thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.
Wes Golladay: Hello everyone, we are looking at the pipe pressure as the competitive said, how do you see that progressing into 2018, while still remain Charlotte in the South east Florida where with the other markets?
Keith Oden: I think the supply pressure in, will continue to be with us, in Charlotte, and Houston, if you just look at job growth verses projected deliveries in both of those markets, it's hard to say that things are going to get much better from the supply standpoint. I think that you are likely to see, just going based on projected job growth in the number of deliveries that you have to run to the system, probably spreads some of the supplies user, probably already affecting parts of Dallas. That makes it probably more widespread and in 2018, you probably have, you are starting to see, the early stages of supply pressure in Denver and gain in based in 2018 numbers that probably gets a little bit more pronounced in 2018. Those would be the markets that will continue to be on the right offspring for supply. Pressure all the rest of our markets, you know, roughly equilibrium based on the supply and projected job growth next year, some better than others, but those would be the worry spots for 2018.
Wes Golladay: Okay and then looking at job growth, irrespective, lot of people want to hire, but it's really hard to find the correct laborer and skill match, you are taking any more conservative underrating when you look at job broken markets when you're buying.
Ric Campo: When you look at, I think that's definitely a big concern right? How can the economy grow, if you encourage jobs as you can't find people who sell those jobs? I mean, if you look at, if you go out, I don't think that effects '18 much, but when you start going out into '19 and '20, you'll start getting into what do you see, most economists are showing job growth falling pretty substantially and in '19 and '20. So we definitely look at those metrics when we are deciding which sub-markets and which markets we want to buy them.
Keith Oden: Yeah, just to put some numbers around that, again Witten's forecast in this company, you can even talk there's sometime, which is just a little straight in the labor market, that you are at 4.2% unemployment now. And that's likely to go drip a little bit lower, but, so we at 2018, total employment growth coming down from 2.1 this year in '17 drops to 1.9 the following year, and it's dropping to 1.5 in 2019, the Ric's point. So, we are not forecasting your session in that, he's just saying, that's his view of the constraint that we are going to be up against. Fortunately, since Camden's markets produce jobs at a higher, in population growth at higher markets than the national average, we don't see as bigger than impact from the follow off, we got total jobs in our, across our canvas platform. In 2017, it's 610, 000, he has that actually going up to 641 in 2018. And then, he's gotten coming back down to 560, 000 in 2019. So, yes, that's a real, I mean we think it's a real thing and our data providers are giving us data input that's a real thing.
Wes Golladay: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Vincent Chao: Hey, I know you talked Houston a lot here on the call, but I just curious to obviously put some freezers in place immediately following the hurricane, I don't want to in to be perceived to be gauging the market, I'm just curious as we think that 28, do you think that the optics will come in to play at all., if we get to a certain level of rentals, would you just cap and or you would say that the renewables would be kept at 10? Can I just take you to the market average for the rest of the country, but is there any other thought on how you'll manage the optics of rent growth.
Keith Oden: Yeah, I think that we have been gone above and beyond being good neighbors and we continue to do that. I guess, we sort of taken this in three steps to get back to market rate pricing, but ultimately, it doesn't serve anybody's interest and I have market killing pricing on little housing. And so, we need to be, we do need to get back to regular order and we will do that. We also have to put this in context that you take the entire Houston market because of the oversupply in the oil, plus that we've experienced for last three years, we had negative, our rental declined. For two and a half years going into the Harvey, so the focus we are paying rent at market rates, is somewhere around a team motive of 7% or 8% down on top line rents going in the Harvey so, we got 8% rent growth day one, we are back to rent that people were paying two and a half to three years ago. So, we don't think that there's going to be optical question, which does not, you are charging market rate runs for the apartments that you are renting. I think just to put it in the context; we were at 3.1% down on top line revenues in Houston in the third quarter. And, in order to get to the a lot of pick up that we are going to see, we are going to see higher going from 2.8 for the three quarters and the portfolio to 2.9. So somewhere it has to be positive, pretty positive math, and the plug is really Houston. And so we think, we're going to see, and our portfolio alone a shift from a negative 3.1 in the third quarter to plus 2.4 up in the fourth quarter. And that's the sort of magnitude of the sheer, so I don't - by the time that your income comes along; we will be back to market rates pricing, relative to our comp set and will probably be rent will be up 5% plus/minus form where they were in the second quarter. And my guess that extend into 2018, and in our case it has to, because we've got a, we have to get a market including price to get our, to get equilibrium back in our inventory and burn it at 97.7% occupied is nowhere to run an airline.
Vincent Chao: Right, okay, thanks for your perceptive and just another answer question on DC. I want to make sure how the numbers ride, I think you said, expectations for 2017 are about 3%, which seems to suggest another deceleration in the fourth quarter, is that the way to be thinking about that particular market.
Keith Oden: Yeah, I think that's right, I think that's right. And gain we have performed pretty handily all that concept in the first and second quarter, my guess is that the supplies shifts around when the deliveries are coming, that's going to impact us a little bit more on the third and fourth quarter and we are all set out for 3% of the right number for the year and aging if you had asked me in the December of last year, based on all of our bottom up analysis, I would say you know, 3% top line sounds about right for the saying.
Vincent Chaookay: This sounds like the specific of some market deliveries that's driving the up forms earlier verses back up.
Keith Oden: Yes, but you also, I mean third quarter, third, fourth quarter seasonally is always lower analysis in 9 or 10 years of lower third to fourth quarter in our growth. So, that's you know, you probably get 50 basis points and our entire portfolio historically between third and fourth quarter gross rate.
Vincent Chaookay: Okay and thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys thanks for taking the time, just on Houston little quick, separating your assets out there, what are inside the lop and what's outside the loop, it seems like you guys, games more occupancy on the assets that were inside the loop, and you know it's less comparatively on those outside loops. Could you see - how did that work? Was there any tension that kind of pre- events in one place and kind of boost occupancy over rent frozen across the board, in you know every asset that you have in Houston? Can you just talk about how the dynamics are worked?
Keith Oden: Yeah I could see, when I am across the board, to your question that's freezing, runs with frozen lines everywhere, so we didn't make any distinction, we are talking inside and outside, high rise, low rise. They were frozen for the same period of time and at the same pre Harvey rates across our entire platform. So if you think about where the weakness was prior and the greatest that we had in our portfolio would have been our down town and mid town inside the loop apartments where new rents were down 8% to 10% across those assets. So it makes sense that now necessarily the occupancy because we always had pretty high occupancy in those units, but we had adjusted our pricing to maintain that. So it makes sense to me that the recovery in the rents - in the top line would happen this disproportionally inside the loop and that's what happened. We had asset that through this third quarter in some of our suburban assets that still were 1% negative, 1.5% negative year-to-date but we also had assets that were 8% to 9% negatives and so in those assets makes sense to me that we would see more recovery and that's what happened.
Unknown Analyst: I see and that makes sense. Just one more question to Ric on your equity issuance. Was there did the overall allotment get for the exercise I didn't catch that I didn't see in the supplements and also you guys capture ATM. Can we expect more equities since going forward and just a little I am trying to figure out how you guys view your different sources of capitals today with this your debt is pretty much at all time low level if you look at net debt to EBITDA and yet you are choosing to issue equity. How would you think about that?
Keith Oden: Sure, so we issued 4.750 million of shares that was the full issuance of the equity. Prior to that we did a very small amount on the ATM and where you can expect going forward the reason we did that many and we raised roughly 445 million was we didn't want to be in the market all the time and the challenge we have with an ATM program is that you are subject to block out and you are subject sort of dribbling that out over a long period of time and so we chose to take advantage of the market conditions, strengthen our balance sheets so we could go in the offensive from an acquisition perspective. So you won't see us until we get to the point where we spend this cash on our balance sheet you won't see us very active in the equity markets.
Ric Campo: And on your question regarding the issue, the underwriters elected not to take up their option under the [indiscernible].
Unknown Analyst: Got it and just a last follow up from me, is there anything in particular that you guys have in the pipeline in term of the acquisitions that this capital could be deployed towards or is that as you said just an opportunistic issuance because you know there is going to be things you want to do with it.
Keith Oden: As I said earlier, we are constantly looking at properties and we don't have anything specific to discuss today about that.
Unknown Analyst: Alright, thanks a lot guys. That's all from me.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen with that we will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the comments call back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Great, thanks for your time today and we will see a lot of you in Dallas in the next couple of weeks, so thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note that today’s event is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Kim Callahan. Ma’am, please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today’s call, represent management’s current opinions and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden’s complete second quarter 2017 earnings release is available in the Investor section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will try to be brief in our prepared remarks and try to complete the call within one hour, as we are the first of three back-to-back multifamily calls today. We ask that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thank you, Kim, and good morning. Our music today was provided by recording star Ed Sheeran. As recently as 2013, Sheeran was best known in the U.S. as an opening act for Taylor Swift’s North American tour. This year, Sheeran became the first recording artist to have two songs debut in the top 10 in the U.S. charts in the same week and had notable guest appearance on Game of Thrones. Sheeran’s story is a reminder of both how quickly things can accelerate, if you’re talented and are working in the right environment and that the pace of change in all areas of our residents’ life is faster than ever and will likely continue to accelerate. Our residents are increasingly choosing to live in communities that understand and adapt to their evolving life style choices. As Malcolm Stewart, Camden’s Chief Operating Officer often reminds us, you don’t have to be young, you just have to think young. Our operations teams continued to produce solid results for Camden during the second quarter and for the year. I appreciate their dedication to improving the lives of our customers one experience at that time. Apartment demand continues to be strong, driven by positive demographics and a secular shift to rental housing as part of the sharing economy. Millennials are driving the sharing economy and are more interested in experiential activities as opposed to acquiring things including single family homes. On the other end of the spectrum, from a demographic perspective, empty nesters are leaving their suburban homes for rentals in urban locations to take advantage of left commute time and more robust entertainment options. New supply competition is currently a factor in many of our markets. However, delivery should peak this year. We continued our capital recycling program this quarter with the acquisition of Camden Buckhead Square in Atlanta. This is our first acquisition in nearly three years. Last year, we sold $1.2 billion of non-core older properties. The proceeds we used to fund our development pipeline, pay down debt, pay a special dividend and now to fund Camden Buckhead Square. Camden Buckhead Square was acquired at below replacement cost with a 5% FFO yield. Given the inventory of merchant builder product in the market combined with rising land costs and construction costs, we believe that other acquisition opportunities will be available going forward. Subsequent to quarter-end, we entered into an agreement to sell Camden Miramar, our only student housing property. the Houston apartment market is still challenging with new deliveries exceeding demand. We expect the market to stabilize next year. New construction starts peaked in 2014 at 24,000 and have steadily declined with 8,000 in 2016 and 6,000 starts expected each year in 2017 and 2018. While new deliveries have been delayed in some cases due to labor shortages. Excess inventory should clear during 2018 and set Houston up for rent growth again. Houston has had a long history of strong recoveries following market weakness. Based on our view that there will be limited completions and competition from new developments in 2019 and 2020, we’ve decided to go forward with the construction of our Downtown Houston project, Camden Downtown. Construction will begin in the fourth quarter of this year with lease-up beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 and stabilization expected in 2020. Camden Downtown represents a counter-cyclical opportunity to lock in construction costs at a time when it’s difficult for developers to get equity or construction financing. We’re looking forward to finishing the year strong and our management team and our operations teams are focused on that. And at this point, I’ll turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks Ric. We’re very pleased with our results which were in line with our expectations for both the quarter and year-to-date. Overall conditions remained healthy across our platform. Sequential revenue growth was 1.8% with every market posting a positive sequential increase, yes, even Houston. Other than the transactions which Ric’s covered, from our prospective, this was a very return quarter. So, I’ll be brief with my remarks to allow more time for what’s on our mind. Turning to same-store results, revenue growth, which was 3.1% for the quarter and is up 3% year-to-date. Most of our markets had revenue growth between 3% and 6% for the quarter, led by San Diego/Inland Empire at 6.1%; Denver at 5.8%; LA/Orange County, 5.6%; Dallas at 4.9%; Atlanta at 4.8%. Expenses fell sequentially by 0.5% in the second quarter with a number of puts and takes, which Alex address, leaving us with same-store NOI of up 3.2% sequentially and up 4.1% for the second quarter. Houston revenues fell 3.7% compared to second quarter of 2016. Year-to-date revenues were down 3.5%, which keeps us on the track to meet our full year forecast of roughly 4% revenue decline for the year. We expect continuously weak conditions in Houston as new supply continues to pressure merchant built communities who continue to offer two to three months free rent as a lease-up concession. In D.C. Metro, our revenue growth out performed our overall portfolio with results up 4.2% for the second quarter and 4.0% growth year-to-date. We continue to be encouraged by the trends in our D.C. Metro portfolio. As we look at our markets and how we expect them to perform in the second half of the year versus our original plan, we see relatively minor variances. The top four outperforming markets relative to plan are projected to be Denver, Southern California, Dallas and Orlando. This outperformance relative to plan is being offset by lower than planned revenues in Austin, Charlotte and Southeast Florida due to direct competition from pockets of new supply. Rents on new leases and renewals continue to look good for achieving our outlook for the full year’s results. Second quarter new leases were up 1.6% and renewals were up 4.9% for a blended rate of 3%. July new leases and renewals are in line with the second quarter numbers. We’re sending out August and September renewal offers at an average increase of 5.5%. Additional operating stats for the quarter continue to support our full year outlook. Same-store occupancy in the second quarter averaged 95.4% versus 94.8% in the first quarter and 95.4% in the second quarter of last year. July occupancy was 95.6%, 95.7% for the same period last year. Net turnover rate for the quarter was basically flat at 52% versus 51% for the prior year and 46% versus 47% year-to-date. Move-outs to home purchases were 15.6% for the quarter, with an as expected seasonal increase from the 14.9% we saw in the first quarter. 2017 move-outs to purchase homes are in line with 2016 levels but still well below the long-term trend. At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer. 
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results and guidance, a brief update on our recent real estate activities. During the second quarter, we reached stabilization at Camden Gallery, a $59 million development in Charlotte, which is currently 97% occupied and is expected to achieve a 7.75% stabilized yield. Also during the quarter, we completed construction at Camden NoMa phase II in Washington D.C. and began construction at Camden Grandview phase II in Charlotte. Additionally, during the quarter we acquired for $20 million, an 8.2-acre land site in San Diego for future development and acquired on June the 1st, for $58 million, Camden Buckhead Square, a 250-unit stabilized operating community in the Buckhead submarket of Atlanta. We purchased this 2015 built community at an approximate 12% discount to replacement cost and expected to generate an approximate 5% yield. And finally, subsequent to quarter-end, we entered into a contract to sell Camden Miramar, our only student housing community, which is located in Corpus Christi, Texas, for approximately $78 million. Closing of this sale is not guaranteed and is subject to among other items, the satisfactory due-diligence and financing by the purchaser. However, as I will discuss later, we have included the impact of this sale in the midpoint of our revised earnings guidance. We have $670 million of developments currently under construction or in lease-up with a $170 million left of funds over the next two years. We anticipate upto $300 million of additional on-balance sheet development starts, later in 2017. Our balance sheet remains one of the best in REIT world with net debt to EBITDA at 4.5 times, a fixed charge expense coverage ratio at 5.7 times, secured debt to gross real estate assets at 11%, 80% of our assets unencumbered and 88% of our debt at fixed rate. Turning to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the second quarter of 2017 of $106 million or $1.15 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.02 per share. Our $0.02 per share outperformance for the second quarter was primarily due to $0.01 per share and higher same-store NOI, resulting from a combination of higher than anticipated occupancy and both lower than anticipated repair and maintenance costs due to general cost control measures and lower employee benefit costs as we continue to experience better than anticipated levels of health insurance and workers’ compensation claims, 0.5% in higher net operating income from our development and non-same-store communities, resulting primarily from each of our development communities leasing ahead of schedule, a quarter of a cent from the previously mentioned Atlanta acquisition and a quarter of a cent from a combination of higher interest income and lower overhead costs. We have updated and revised our 2017 full year same-store and FFO guidance based upon our year-to-date operating performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our same-store revenue performance has been slightly better than expected for the first six months of the year, driven primarily by higher levels of occupancy. We are encouraged by this trend. However, it is still too early to tell how pockets of supply will affect the few of our markets for the remainder of 2017. And therefore, we are maintaining the midpoint of our same-store revenue growth guidance at 2.8%, but are tightening the range to 2.55% to 3.05%. We have reduced the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance from 4.5% to 4.1% and tightened the range to 3.85% to 4.35%. As a result of actual and anticipated lower expenses related to health insurance and workers’ compensation and successful property tax appeals, primarily in Houston. We now expect our full year 2017 property tax increase to be 4.75%, as compared to our original budget of 5.5%. As a result of reducing our full year expense guidance, we have increased our 2017 same-store NOI guidance by 20 basis points at the midpoint to 2% and tightened the range to 1.5% to 2.5%. Last night, we also reaffirmed and tighten the range for our full year 2017 FFO per share. Our new range is $4.51 to $4.63 with the midpoint of $4.57. Although, the midpoint is unchanged, there have been some changes to the underlying assumptions. As compared to our prior guidance, our new guidance assumes an additional $0.01 per share from our 20 basis-point increase in same-store NOI, $0.015 per share from the acquisition of Camden Buckhead Square late in the second quarter and $0.005 per share in additional contributions from the accelerated leasing of our development communities, partially offset by lower levels of interest capitalization. This $0.03 of aggregate improvement is entirely offset by the anticipated disposition of our Camden Miramar student housing community in the beginning of the fourth quarter. W built and have owned Camden Miramar since 1994. Over the past 23 years, this has been a very successful investment for Camden and our shareholders. Upon disposition, we anticipate this investment will have generated a 16.5% unleveraged internal rate of return over its 23-year hold period. We believe this is an appropriate time to make the strategic disposition, given this asset is located on the ground lease with just over 20 years remaining. At the contract price, this disposition represents an AFFO yield of 8.75%. This disposition will have a meaningful impact to our fourth quarter NOI as the community will be occupied for the full semester. As a reminder, occupancy and NOI at this community are strong during the school term but decline significantly during summer months. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2017. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of a $1.14 to a $1.18. The midpoint of $1.16 represents a $0.01 per share increase from a $1.15 reported in the second quarter of 2017. This increase is primarily the result of an approximate three quarters of a cent per share increase in NOI from our development and non-same-store communities, an approximate $0.005 per share increase in FFO related to our completed Atlanta acquisition, and an approximate $0.005 per share increase in FFO due to lower interest expense as the interest savings from repaying our 5.83% to $247 million unsecured bond and maturity on May 15th is partially offset by borrowings on our line of credit, higher rates on our secured floating rate debt and lower levels of capitalized interest. As a reminder, we still anticipate issuing a $300 million unsecured bond later this year. This one and three quarter cent per share aggregate improvement in FFO is partially offset by an approximate $0.005 per share increase in income tax expense due to a non-recurring Texas margin tax refund resulting from a prior year reduction in rates which we recognized in the second quarter. Our sequential NOI is anticipated to be relatively flat as revenue growth from higher rental and fee income in our peak leasing periods is offset by our expected increase in property expenses due to normal seasonal summer increases in utilities and repair and maintenance costs, and the timing of certain property tax refunds recognized in the second quarter. At this time, we’ll open the call up to questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Our first question today comes from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I just want to start on Houston. You mentioned a potential stabilization next year, just curious if that’s more of a flat unit rental rate growth at least year-over-year or if you think there could be actually a slight acceleration or if it’s just less of a fall than what you’ve seen this year?
Ric Campo: Yes. So, without getting into forward-looking NOI growth projections for Houston, when we think about stabilization, we’re thinking in terms of absorbing the excess -- the hangover of supply that’s got to get through the system and find a resident. Once that happens, then I think you can start to think in terms of getting back to more of a normalized full-occupancy rate. And then beyond that you start thinking about rental increases. So, if you think -- if you roll forward to our numbers that we have for Houston for 2018, we know we’ve got excess inventory now; it’s in the process of being aggressively, maybe very aggressively marketed by the merchant builders who put it in place. Lease concessions of two to three months are common in the leased up communities. So, they’re trying to find the market and they will, and they’re making good progress. And I think we’re going to continue to see good absorption. But if you roll forward to 2018, we think if things stay as they are currently projected, we think we’re only going to see another 6,000 or so apartments drop to the market. And if you take a sort of the midpoint between the Wheaton and Axiometrics job growth for Houston for next year, it’s somewhere in the 45,000 range, which is -- that’s more than sufficient to not only put stabilization in place but to repair occupancy rates and then beyond that look for rental rate increases. But, we’ve said previously Nick that we thought that 2017 at our minus 4 down topline revenues would be the bottom in the cycle and we still believe that.
Nick Joseph: And then just in terms of development, you mentioned starting a new projects in Charlotte and buying the land in San Diego and starting in Houston later this year. So, what are the expected yields on those developments and how do those compare to the developments currently in progress?
Ric Campo: Current development yield’s around 7, depending on average and really higher ones versus the lower ones in California. So in California, the San Diego type transactions, those are going to be in the 5.5 to 6 kind of stabilized range. The Houston transactions need to be higher than that because they’re Houston. So, generally, in the sort of center of the country, we’re looking at stabilized yields of 6.5 plus or minus today. And yields are definitely down from some of the ones that we’re able to get. For example our Camden NoMa is an 8% yield and that’s hard to do today. We just happen to hit, a, we bought the land at a good price a while and b, we were able to hit the market properly, really well with a dip in the construction environment there and lease-up is going really well. Today with land cost where it is and with construction cost rising in every market with labor shortage, it’s just tougher to make those -- to get to those numbers. So, we’re probably 50 basis points down on our development yields than we were a year ago if we were to start it probably.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Just to clarify, those on in place rents or on trended rents?
Ric Campo: Those are generally -- in Houston, it would be trended rents because you really can’t take three months free in a new development and then apply that to your development model make it work. Generally, they tend to be on trended rents.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Just curious, you guys saw some good acceleration in Houston’s occupancy this quarter. I’m wondering if you think that that’s no longer going to be a drag on same-store revenue growth going forward and if that first quarter number 92.3 could end up being a bottom in occupancy in that market?
Ric Campo: Yes. So, we were pleased that we were able to make some progress in the second quarter. We ended the -- averaged for the quarter at about 93.1%. And relative to our overall portfolio, that’s almost 2.5% below where we are on a average throughout the rest of our platform. So, clearly, it’s a laggard. In terms of is 92.3 is a low watermark. Based on prelease right now, if you look at -- we’re looking out 60, 90 days on where we are with our preleased occupancy. I think we are in pretty good shape to make some additional progress on occupancy in the third quarter. And consistent with our views, 2017’s probably the low watermark in terms of the 4% rental decline, or top line revenue decline. I would say that it’s a decent proposition that the 92.3% is a low watermark. But we’re not -- we’re in no way satisfied with the 93.1% and we’re working our tails off to get that back to a more normalized looking rate because until you get that number back to the 95% range, you’re not going to make any revenue -- headway on the leases. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for the detail there. And then, there has been some strength in the Houston housing market here more recently. I’m just curious about your thoughts on what the impact that can have to the rental market and whether or not you think that that will take share from rentals?
Ric Campo: The interesting thing about Houston is of course in the last 24 months or 36 months, we’ve spent a lot of time talking about energy and what was going to happen to the Houston market overall. If you look at certain segments of the market, if you’re in the office building business, it’s kind of a tough market obviously. Multi-family is tough but not like office. When you look at industrial, retail and single family, the market hasn’t missed a beat. Houston has a shortage of quality single family homes and the markets have been very, very good and robust. I think we -- last month or last quarter, Houston had a record number of sales at the high prices of homes.  So, on one hand, Houston has done really well with single family homes and it hasn’t been a real issue for the economy overall. But, when you get down to the whole issue of rental versus own or people losing market share to homes, we really don’t see a massive change in that scenario. Because when you think about it, people make a decision to either rent or buy not based on money generally, it’s based on the lifestyle and their sort of what age group they’re in. And so, we haven’t seen a tremendous amount.
Keith Oden: Yes. Just to put some stats around that, Ric’s right. Even in the second quarter, which I believe I saw report that June was possibly the highest level of single family home sales in the history of Houston, which is pretty remarkable in itself, but move-out to purchase homes in our portfolio was about 16% in Houston and that compares to 15% to the whole platform. So yes, there is a lot of people buying homes but they’re not -- not in large numbers coming out of our apartments.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then, just as a quick follow-up, how does that 16% compare versus either this time last year or last quarter?
Keith Oden: So, 16.5 in the first quarter of 2017, but if you go back to the fourth quarter, it was 15.9, so in that range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks for the time. I was hoping you could just give a little bit more commentary on Washington D.C. You guys seem to be a little bit more upbeat to some of the other REITs that have commented. I was hoping could you talk about supply generally and kind of where you’re seeing pressures or not relative to the broader MSA?
Ric Campo: Yes, it’s interesting because there has been a fair amount of I think people trying to reconcile where we are and where some of our competitors have announced in the commentary. And we said last quarter that we felt pretty constructive about where we were in Washington D.C. in our portfolio but we also mentioned that we really have a fairly different footprint in the D.C. Metro area than some of our competitors. So, we guessed it. So, I want to put some numbers around that. And we look at it and have kind of dug into our footprint and where the performance is coming from and other people can reconcile this and try to figure out whether it’s in the footprint or something else. But, in our Northern Virginia portfolio for the second quarter, we actually had right at 5% revenue growth, which is better than -- way better than the average of all of our other markets combined. And if you go into our Maryland portfolio, it was about 3.5% revenue growth. The area where I think the differential occurs is in -- what we think that was the D.C. proper sub-market, our growth for the quarter was 2.2%. And that’s a divergence, because up until probably middle of last year, the D.C. proper portfolio that consistently outperformed our Northern Virginia and Maryland portfolios, but obviously that’s flipped and we have a much higher NOI contribution from Northern Virginia [ph] D.C. proper. So, I think a fair amount of it is, just the distribution of our assets versus some of our competitors. In terms of overall supply versus job growth, if you look at the [inaudible] equilibrium for 2017 and then they actually get better in 2018. So, we continue to be pretty constructive on D.C. And my guess is, is that it’s more footprint than anything else.
Juan Sanabria: And then, you kind of hit on it in some of your prepared remarks, but just at this point, could you give us a sense of, particularly at the top-line same-store revenues? Where you feel the most comfortable within the range and points of variability to kind of hit the top or the bottom at this point?
Ric Campo: Yes. I think the range that we have set, I mean, we’ve tightened the range quite a bit, and as to get into the top or the bottom, I think it really turns down to how much of an impact the new supply actually shows up in the second half and how much of an impact we see from that. I mean, there is a fair amount of anecdotal evidence and not only in our own portfolio but just folks that we talk to and conversations and some of our other competitors who reported that there is a lot of slippage in delivery of multi-family units. And so to the extent that that phenomenon is happened to any meaningful degree in Camden’s markets, the apartments that we thought were going to be delivered in the first half that end up rolling over to the second half. So, I think the range from our perspective is more about how much of that supply has slipped, how much of it didn’t show up in the first half and how much of it is going to sort of comeback in the second half of the year. But I mean, I think our range is very appropriate for where we are halfway through the year.
Juan Sanabria: And just if I could, what’s your expected split between the supply deliveries in 2017 first half versus second half and any thoughts on the percentage decline in 2018?
Ric Campo: So, if you -- I’m speaking just to Camden’s market. I can give you national stats, but it’s not something that we spend a lot of time on. But within Camden’s markets for the -- if you look at the full -- take the full year first, completions in 2017 versus completions in 2018. If you take the average of Wheaton and Axiometric numbers and there is a fair amount of difference between the two of those, their two forecasts. So, if we take the average of their two forecasts, we show in Camden’s markets completions of about 150,000 apartments in 2017 drop into about 125,000 in 2018. So a 25,000, 30,000 drop across Camden’s portfolio. So, if you look at just a second half of 2017 versus the first half of -- over into the first half of 2018, we see a drop of roughly 14,000 apartments in Camden’s portfolio. So, there is a fair amount of consistency and the data that we look at that would indicate that what we’ve said all along is 2017 is going to be the high watermark for completions in Camden’s portfolio. Now, obviously, we’ll have to roll it forward and see. There is certainly the possibility that some of that currently projected for the second half of 2017 deliveries bleeds over to 2018. But, I’d be surprised if bled over enough to flip total completions in 2018 to be higher than 2017.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead with your questions.
Rob Stevenson: Thanks. Good morning, afternoon here. Keith, you talked about the D.C. market little bit and you also talked about Dallas being outperformer. Is there any material differences pursuing the various sub markets in Dallas that you guys are operating in?
Keith Oden: Yes. Dallas is having the same experience that Houston is having in the supply-driven submarkets. The Uptown area of Dallas is kind of a wash right now in inventory and we’re certainly feeling that, we’re feeling it in the completion of our lease-up at Victory Park where there is a fair amount of new product that we’re directly competitive with. Our suburban assets in Dallas, they had more of a Houston-like experience, they are outperforming the urban core assets anywhere from a 100 to 200 basis points. So, there is differential, it’s primarily supply driven but the reality is the supply has been the -- preponderance of the supply on a percentage basis has been in the more in the urban core area that’s true in Dallas; it’s also true in Houston. Now, obviously Dallas has not had anything like the experience in Houston. We continue to grow top line rents in our Dallas portfolio and our urban assets are contributing to the growth, they are just not at the top of the market anymore in terms of relative to our suburban assets. But yes, it’s a similar experience. Then the big difference has been that Houston delivered 10,000 or 11,000 jobs in 2016 and Dallas delivered 8,000. So, it’s just a still a real dynamic economy that so far has been able to absorb the new inventory that’s been brought on. But it’s clearly in the sub markets where you’ve got a lot of nice supply, you’re going to get impacted.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then one for Alex. Given your comments about some of the benefit savings et cetera, when you’re looking forward at the same-store portfolio and the expense growth with what you’re continuing to see from property taxes and I imagine like everybody else seeing some inflation in payroll, some of the other line items, is there any reason to believe that same-store expenses aren’t going to grow at the 4% rate for the foreseeable future? Any signs of hope out there.
Alex Jessett: So, the signs of hope that I would point out, especially for our portfolio are two things, number one that although we’ve been successful in 2017 on the property tax side, we still do have property taxes increasing four and three quarters percent. That should revert back to the norm of about 3% very soon. The second sign of hope is that the insurance market still continues to be very favorable for us. And hopefully when we go to our renewal next year, we’ll start to see some benefits from that.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And is that offset by wage pressure or what are you guys seeing there?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So, what’s interesting for Camden specifically is that when you look at our full year salaries, we actually think it’s going to be relatively flat, 2017 as compared to 2016, and that’s driven by lower than expected benefits and lower than expected workers’ comp claims. So, once you strip that out, we’re still working right around the 3% range.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
John Kim: Good morning. You talked about your first acquisition in nearly three years and some opportunities going forward. I’m wondering how much cap rates have moved up for a; new products and also how much you expect to acquire over the next 12 months.
Ric Campo: I don’t think cap rates have moved up much at all for new products, there is still a big demand for product. It was certainly interesting in the first quarter we got a 17% decline in multifamily sales sort of nationwide and it was still down in the second quarter, maybe down 1% but that also included the acquisition of Monogram by Greystar. And so, fundamentally, you know even though the bid is down a bit, cap rates are still very sticky, especially for high quality properties. And I think part of the issue get into with this merchant builder product that needs to clear the market over the next couple of years is that historically the merchant builder margins have been incredibly wide, meaning that instead of 10% to 15%, maybe 20% margin on their costs, which is a good base work for a merchant builder generally, the margins have been more like 50 to 60%. And so, what’s happening now is that even though rents are -- so when you think about NOIs, they are depressed because of the free rent that’s going on in the marketplace. So, when you think about cap rate, the cap rates really haven’t gone up, what’s happened is that NOI has gone down and then you think the juxtaposition of what the asset value is relative to replacement cost. And in the case of the Buckhead Square for example, we bought that the property at $230,000 or $230,000 a door plus or minus, and we think to replace is 260 something a door. So, on the one hand, the cap rate was low, but there is free rent embedded in the market. And yet for us to replace that product in the same place today is 12% above what we bought it for. So, I think that is going to continue to have a dampening effect on cap rates. Then if you move to Houston for example, there are deals trading in Houston -- I know this is going to hurt some people on this call’s head, at sub-4 cap rate. And there is a deal in Downtown for example that is going to trade at 3.6 current cash on cash return. Now it’s brand new, it’s in Downtown, it has embedded 2.5 months free rent in it. And so, people are able to buy that at the low replacement cost, at a low cap rate because they’re buying by the pound and fundamentally people believe and know based on history that the rental rates will go up. You look at Houston for example, I think it’s great example, you take 2002’s downturn. If you look at 2001, revenue growth was 8.2%, 2002 was 0.9 and 2003 was down 4.3. When it stabilized, it took a couple of years to stabilize during that period, we had three years or four years of over 5% growth. Same thing happened in the last downturn. So, people are not going to say well, I’ve to have a higher cap rate and I’m not going to take into account the idea that free rent burns off. So, they’re basically buying by the pound now and therefore cap rates really haven’t gone up.
John Kim: But given this unique dynamic of buying below replacement costs, how big can this acquisition program be?
Ric Campo: Well, in our guidance today, we have -- we generally have net acquisitions versus dispositions. And it’s an evolving market. I think that this could be a big acquisition opportunity over the next 18 months. We’re nibbling at the edges right now. And I think we need to sort of wait. There is going to be a whole lot more products coming out in the next two or three years than there is today. And so, we could easily increase our acquisition appetite to 300 million plus or minus but at this point we’re just sort of wait and see. I mean, we obviously have an incredibly strong balance sheet; we have lots of capacity to acquire. And these are the kinds of properties we’re going to acquire in the future. When you haven’t acquired a lot in the line of three years, we clearly have an appetite to grow. We’re ultimately -- we’ve positioned our portfolio and our balance sheet to be able to grow through development and acquisition we plan on.
John Kim: Okay. I thought I’d ask the question since you’re going to be exiting the business. But given your success in student housing, why have you not invested more historically, is it just too different of a business from multi-family?
Ric Campo: Absolutely. If you think about the food chain in multi-family, I mean you have student housing as a great business, you’re in student housing but the challenge is you have a volatility of cash flow. Camden Miramar is 100% leased today and in the summer it was 40% leased. So, the volatility of the cash flow is one thing. The other issue is a lot of -- for us anyway, the management of that business is just very different than managing market rate housing. You can make the same argument for senior housing. We have a couple of 85 and older properties and it is just a whole different world. You have to have different mindset, different strategy, and it is just -- I think student housing companies do a great job. I think senior housing companies do a great job. But when you mix them together, it becomes more complicated effort. And I’d rather keep our management team’s focus on what they do best, which is market rate housing that they understand really well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O’Neil. Please go ahead with your question.
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes, good afternoon or I guess good morning still down there. So, two questions. First, just going back to the merchant build and the pricing opportunity that you’re seeing. As you guys look, I mean you bought a development site in San Diego but at the same time you’re talking about an increasing opportunity potentially to acquire some of these merchant build developments over the next few years. So, do you see that you may sort of dial back on the development front as more merchant build activity opportunity comes up or your view is that there is a balance between the two and that the IRRs that you’re seeing either on development or on the merchant -- or acquiring merchant assets is pretty similar?
Keith Oden: So, Alex, the opportunity on the merchant-built product is very submarket specific. If you think about our Buckhead acquisition, there was about 2,500 apartments that were delivered merchant-built product literally within about an 18-month window in that submarket. Overall in Atlanta, that’s not a huge deal, the 2,500 new apartments in Buckhead is a huge deal. And so, you just had this supply bubble where merchant builders have to respond to that by meeting the market from a pricing standpoint, they compete, they embed free rent in their rent roll, they get to the end of their natural ownership period where their investors are looking for a repatriation of capital. But they haven’t burned off all the embedded rent concession. So, you just -- you sort of have an impaired rent roll, because of the competition that was that all came on line at roughly the same time. So, it’s a very submarket specific. Now, having said that, there are a number of submarkets that we play in that have this condition either currently or coming. And we know, there is Charlotte, it’s going to have some opportunities; we know about the Houston story. So that side of it is more dependent on the current supply challenge that we have in a number of our markets. Separately from that, the San Diego transaction, we announced the land purchase. The reality is, is that we probably don’t start construction on that product for another 18 months and then from there, you’ve got two years to deliver the final product, so you’re three years out. And it’s in the market or in the submarket in San Diego where there’s been virtually no new construction. So just a different animal. And the answer to your question is we would love to do both. I mean, I think to go back to the question Ric was answering and if we could and had delivered to us or have the opportunity to acquire $400 million, $500 million worth of Camden Buckhead that have exactly those economics and submarkets that we want to -- we’re either in or want to be in, within our existing footprint, we’d buy them. It really [multiple speakers] the balance issue, because when you get down to it, we can make a rate of return, a risk adjustment rate of return on development, we’ll do it. If we can make a risk-adjusted rate of return on the merchant builder product, we’ll do as well.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then, Alex, going back to your real estate tax comments to prior question. You mentioned 4.75 now and hoping that goes back down to three. Would you say that all of your properties have been mark-to-market or your view is that there is still some of your markets where the property taxes haven’t been fully mark to where the tax assessors think they should be?
Alex Jessett: So, the way we really operate on the property tax side is we focus a lot on equal and uniform, which is a concept that regardless of what we believe the value to be of that particular asset, it has to be valued in a similar fashion to other comparable assets. And so, when we’re really looking at our portfolio, what we’re really doing is looking at the value that the assessors have assigned to our assets as compared to similar assets and we’re making -- and we analyze it that way, rather than trying to go through and figure out exactly what the sort of “market value” of the real estate is.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. So, do you feel then, as you guys did that exercise that everything is valued where it should be on a peer related basis or there is still some areas where you think there are gaps and therefore that’s why you still think it’s elevated now and you’re not share when it could be down to the normal 3%?
Alex Jessett: No. We think as compared to the peers, we think we’re appropriately valued.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Pehl from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeffrey Pehl: I just have a couple of questions just on Houston and the revenue growth for the quarter. Thank for all the color so far on the supply and your expectations. I was just wondering if you can break down the revenue growth for the quarter for Midtown assets versus maybe the energy corridor and suburbs?
Ric Campo: I don’t have the detail for those specific assets but I can give you generally. So, the closer you’re into urban core which is where a lot of development is being delivered, that’s the most sort of challenged -- some of the most challenged market. If you take the juxtaposition then to the energy corridor, there is a lot of supply in the energy corridor, a lot of supply in the urban core. And so, both of those markets are getting the same kind of situation with more supply than demand. You then go into the suburbs, so said another way, sort of the high quality urban core assets are getting hit harder than the sort of suburban sort of B plus assets, primarily because there is just not as much competition between the Bs and the As, if you will. Now, I will say also that now Bs -- some Bs are starting to get under pressure because of the A rents coming down to make it more affordable for somebody at the top end of the B markets moving into an A at a lower price than they would otherwise have.
Keith Oden: So, Jeffrey in terms of specific, the numbers around Ric’s commentary on the Downtown and Midtown assets, roughly down 10% and 11% on the Uptown product, suburban assets are flat to up 2%. So, the blend of that gets you to roughly to 3.5% that were down year-to-date in Houston. So, there is a substantial difference of where the supply impact is happening, and if you got merchant-built product, it is given too much free rents, you’re going to have to respond to that from a pricing standpoint. But those are roughly the ranges and numbers that we’re dealing with.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Drew Babin: Quick question on the Southern California that may sound like the D.C. question from earlier. But speaking about Los Angeles and Orange County, it looks like Camden had a pretty big sequential acceleration in revenue growth there. And I was just wondering what sub markets are the strongest, which are the weakest and may be why Camden’s performance seems to look a little different than some of the other companies reporting?
Ric Campo: If you look at asset by asset across our Southern California portfolio, there is not a great variation between the Long Beach market, LA/Orange County that we see. They are all -- the strength is across the board. We’ve got one or two assets that catch more competition from new product that’s coming on line in Irvine, and that’s always a little bit of a headwind for us and our two assets that are -- catch a little bit of the collateral damage from the supply that they bring online. But, outside of that, strength across the board and fact that two of our top five markets, San Diego and LA/Orange County. So, just good strength, very, very limited supply relative to any other market that we operate in and clearly a robust economy that’s on the rebound.
Drew Babin: That’s helpful. And then going back to completions for next year again, obviously completions in Houston are going to be down quite a bit. But in your other markets, are there any other markets in your portfolio where you’re seeing a drop off, not as extreme as Houston but something in that neighborhood?
Ric Campo: So, I’ll give you a couple of the highlights and the one that you mentioned on Houston is going to be the largest; we’ve got a real significant drop off there. But some other ones where we think we see supply coming down pretty meaningfully. Dallas comes down by 4,000 apartments in total supply, Atlanta down by 2,200, Austin down by 2,300, D.C. Metro down by 3,000 and San Diego down by 2,000. So, those would be the top five or six in terms of the declines; that’s a year-over-year decline, completions in 2017 versus 2018.
Drew Babin: I guess following up on that, are there any markets where you do see a pick up next year?
Ric Campo: Not a single one. We got 14 red numbers. I do want to -- I really wanted to mention that earlier when we talked about Houston on the supply side, but we did get a very interesting stat this morning from the U.S. Census Bureau that reported that the total permits issued in Houston, Texas for multifamily apartments for the entire month of June was 90 and that’s we’ve been in -- doing business in Houston for a long, long time, I don’t ever remember seeing a stat like that, even in some of the other really severe contractions, and where it was more job related contractions, we didn’t see numbers like that. So, when we talk about, it’s kind of a theoretical concept, when you talk about new permitting activity and the development pipeline, just completely shutting down. It’s not just the concept, that’s an amazing stat that we got this morning, so like just a little bit color on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
Rich Hightower: Lot of questions answered already but I wanted to hit on a topic that I think has been addressed on calls past and it relates to this sort of jobs, required jobs to creating another unit of apartment demand that ratio that you’ve seen historically in your markets. And I am wondering if some of those ratios are changing, just given the composition of the workforce and other things going on, I’m thinking of markets such as Austin, such as Dallas, maybe some others. If you have any sort of general comments on that, if you’ve noticed any changes?
Ric Campo: Sure. Historically, over the last 20 years, people would sort of take total jobs and it was -- the rule of thumb was five jobs creates one multifamily housing demand. And so, there are lot of ratios, lot of groups still look at that ratio. And I think though that you’re on to something that that ratio is sort of broken now, and it’s broken because -- and I’ll give you a great example of it. In 2016, Houston basically went from 120,000 jobs in 2014, some jobs in 2015 but in 2016, there were basically zero jobs, some people say 10,000, so very limited jobs. In 2016, we have served 15,500 apartment units in Houston. People are like well, how’s that possible? Yet no jobs. Well, what’s happening is two things. One is, there is this pent up demand because people -- we’ve had this housing shortage going on for quite a while, so it’s a pent up demand. You still have over 1 million millennials that are living at home or roommate situations because they haven’t been able to save enough money to either get out of home or to break the roommate scenario. So, there is still a pent up demand from multifamily. And because of this demographic sort of shift, this millennial that’s more experiential, and they don’t want to buy things, they don’t want to be tied down buying house. So, you delay marriages, you delay child’s birth and people having kids. And so all that has really fundamentally changed the demand picture for multifamily vis-à-vis how many jobs you need. And then the other part of that equation is, and I’ll use Houston as an example for this as well. So, the new product that’s being built today is more hotel-like, it’s more amenities, there is conference centers, there is art studios and golf simulation rooms and it’s just bars and all kinds of different things. And so that product did not exist five years ago at all. And so, it’s happened and these empty nester groups are now saying, I can move into the urban corridor, I can lease an apartment at what I was paying for my big house in the suburbs, I don’t have to drive and I’m closer to amenities and closer to kind of the things I want to do. And so that’s driving demand as well. So, I think that the confluence of millennials, the pent up demand and then the empty nesters moving from suburbs to a more urban -- and urban doesn’t mean downtown, urban like Houston means, Sugar Land downtown or Galleria or Woodlands or downtown. So, if there is multiple urban cores. It’s not just a specific downtown. So I do think that it’s having -- those three factors are having change in this whole idea that you need five jobs to create one multi-family demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Alex, you alluded to the upside to occupancy you’re seeing year-to-date. I think for July, you’re 50 bps ahead of original guidance of 94.9%. What’s the current expectations for full year average occupancy?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So, when we look at the second half of the year, we think that occupancy is going to be fairly consistent to what we saw in the second half of last year. So, you’re looking at right around a sort of a 95.3 type range for the second half. So, you can blend that with what we have in the first half and you got a full year number.
John Pawlowski: Okay, great. And then, the Technology Package has been a pretty good success past couple of years. I’m curious what additional revenue growth initiatives you have in the hopper and how it’s going to impact full year 2017 and 2018 revenue growth?
Alex Jessett: So, what we running through our numbers today is everything that you know about which is our Technology Package and we still think that that equates to 65 basis points of additional revenue in the full year 2017. Obviously, we have lots of talented folks and we’re always looking for new initiatives. And when we have something that we’re ready to announce, we’ll certainly let everybody know about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from RBC. Please go ahead with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hello, everyone. Looking at the Buckhead acquisition, how are you looking at supply impact on results of the property next year? It looks like Buckhead will have a decline in supply but Midtown and Downtown a bit of an uptick. Do you think that will impact the results there?
Ric Campo: Yes, obviously we continue to get new supply in Atlanta. The Buckhead submarket is reasonably well contained in a sense that if you’re -- if that’s your first choice, probably you might migrate over to Uptown but more than likely if you’re a Buckhead person, that’s where you’re going to want to lease. So, most of the 2,500 apartments that got started, this was a very tail end of it. We think that the supply in Buckhead, the next thing to come on line in Buckhead is likely to be an extension of our Paces community. But it’s very, very difficult to manufacture sites in the Buckhead area and the land costs are going to only continue to increase. So, I think we’re pretty well insulated in Buckhead. Don’t see -- we feel pretty comfortable that when we get over into next year and there is really no new supply coming on line, we should see a pretty decent bounce back, not just of the 3% or 4% verity in Buckhead because you got depressed rents. And we know from history that when you have a supply issue in an otherwise healthy economy, the rents tend to go back to prior peak pretty quickly, once the supply problem goes away. So, you’re not restating rents from -- we’re going to grow rents at 3% from the bottom, which is a supply impaired number. You’re going to get back to what people -- what the average person is willing to pay to live in that submarket once the supply clears.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then when you look at your supply number, you said it’s going to be down next year for your market. Are you looking that at a submarket level or just a broader market?
Ric Campo: We look at it -- when we’re doing our revenue projections, we do a complete bottom up, which includes lot of new supply that would impact any of our communities in that submarket. So, we look at it in both ways. It’s instructive though to be able to kind of think directionally about is a market produce -- is it going to produce more or fewer units. But ultimately, the game and the story is how many of those completion of those units that are of the completion drop is going to happen that’s adjacent to or impactful to the community that you have been operating.
Operator: And our next question comes from Karin Ford from MUFJ Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Karin Ford: I wanted to ask about the downtown Houston development start. It’s fairly large deal at 125 million. Can you give us your latest thoughts on where you’d like to have your capital allocation to Houston in light of that? Would you consider a JV in that deal or selling some assets in Houston? Where do you want Houston to be as part of the portfolio?
Ric Campo: First of all, we would not consider joint venture. We are very anti-joint ventures. We have one of the cleanest balance sheets in the multifamily sector and we have one big joint venture with Texas Teachers, but it’s blind pool unilateral decision making process with Camden only. So that’s number one. In terms of where, we like Houston long-term. Houston is a dynamic market; it is going through its weak period right now because of supply. It weathered the energy storm very, very well relative to historic energy downturns that we’ve had in the past. We’re at about 10.5%, I think of our net operating income in Houston right now. And if we did nothing else, this would take it up about by 2020 to about 11.25 or something like that. It is a large project, it will be one of our premier assets, it’s high-rise 21 storeys. And we’re moving more towards this kind of concrete constructions just because it holds up better long-term versus they can. I think when you think about where we want to be portfolio wise, I like where we are in Houston because I like the market long-term. Will we continue to recycle capital the way we have in the past? Absolutely, we’ll continue to look at our portfolio on an ongoing basis and decide which assets are going to be slow grow, and then reinvest that capital into higher growth, higher quality assets. So, when we think about this $125 million investment in context of Camden, it’s not that huge growth into our portfolio. But, will we sell other assets to fund it, perhaps. And we will -- capital recycling is not something just do and stop, it’s something that you have to do all the time. If you go back to our history, I think we only own two or three of our original IPO assets, if you can imagine that and we’ve recycled billions and billions of dollars and we’ll continue to do that.
Operator: And our final question today comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Thank you, guys. I know we’re running over, so try to be quick here. First question, just has to do with the balance sheet. If you were to underwrite a scenario similar to today for the next 18 months or so and see some opportunities to take advantage of the acquisitions as you said, where would you be comfortable taking leverage in that scenario to accomplish that?
Alex Jessett: So, if you think about where we’re today, we have the absolute strongest balance sheet in the multifamily space, debt to EBITDA 4.5 times. Would we be comfortable in that increasing a little bit? The answer is yes, but probably not much more than sort of a 5-time type ratio.
Dennis McGill: Okay, perfect. And then on the ancillary income side, I think in the front half of the year, all the ancillary income was about a 100 basis points. How much of that was the technology side?
Alex Jessett: Yes, it was almost entirely. So, if you look at the first half of the year, technology impact was basically 90 bps.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And so, that’s going to roughly 30 bps on the back half?
Alex Jessett: That’s correct.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then, last one, I think you had talked about the supply -- I think you said 150,000 across the markets. How much of that is still yet to come or let’s say second half of the year?
Ric Campo: So, we have -- of the total 150, it’s pretty evenly split in 2017, looks like about 76,000 in the first half and roughly 74,000 in the second half.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Just one follow-up to the Houston development question. Correct me if I am wrong, but didn’t the scope of that project increase $100 million this quarter? And just curious what increased it.
Ric Campo: Sorry, you said $100 million.
John Pawlowski: Yes, from looking at the development pipeline, Camden, what was Camden County last quarter $170 million and now Camden Downtown is the new name, split in two phases but the aggregate cost is $270 million.
Ric Campo: Right. So, that’s a good question. I am not sure that the Camden County was sort of a holding pattern and we were deciding whether we were going to mid-rise stick or high rise. And so, the variation is we decided to do this 21 storey high-rise, which is roughly $125 million. And it’s still -- the jury is still out to what we will do with the second phase. So, I think we’ve just put a holding pattern in and assumed it’d be a twin tower and that’s why the cost went up. But I will tell you that from what we originally priced these projects, cost continues to go up in Houston. We were sort of expecting cost to come down with the energy situation and all the construction starts, that have been -- when you think about multifamily market has started to decline dramatically, but we have not seen cost come down at all. Challenge in Houston is that there’s a lot of petrochemical construction, a lot of schools, medical center and we just haven’t seen any cost coming down. So it’s really been a combination of cost going up but also just a product type changing.
Alex Jessett: And we also added an escalation factor to the second phase for Camden Downtown. So that’s why you’re seeing a higher number for the second phase because they will be started several years later.
John Pawlowski: Okay. But, the best guess on aggregate outlay for these two sites is $270 million right now?
Alex Jessett: That’s correct.
Ric Campo: Assuming we build the second phase as a comparable tower 21 storey high-rise product at phase I is yes. But that decision is way down the road.
John Pawlowski: Thanks, guys.
Ric Campo: We appreciate the call and we will visit with you in the upcoming conference season after Labor Day. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call. We do thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call, represent management's current opinions and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of our subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2017 earnings release is available in the Investor section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will be brief in our prepared remarks and try to complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Richard Campo: Thanks, Kim, and good morning. Our music for today's call was recommended by Dan Smith from KeyBanc, who won our music trivia contest last quarter. Dan said he took a look at the calendar and immediately settled on a Cinco de Mayo theme [indiscernible]. I will keep my comments short since we are the last multi-family company to report and I want to make sure that we have enough time to answer all of your questions about Houston. Our team produced first quarter operating metrics which were right on plan. I know that our team is ready for our peak leasing season and it will continue to improve the lives of our customers, their teammates and our shareholders one experience at a time. I'll turn the call over to Keith now.
D. Keith Oden: Thanks Rick. Our first quarter results were right in line with our expectations, with same store revenue up 2.9% and up 0.3% sequentially. Most of our markets had revenue growth between 3% and 5% just as we had forecast. The revenue growth for our top five markets was Denver at 7.4%, Atlanta 5.1%, Dallas at 5% even, Phoenix at 4.8%, and Austin at 4.5%. As expected, our two weakest markets were Houston with a 3.3% revenue decline, and Charlotte with a 1.3% growth in first quarter. During the first quarter of 2017, our new leases were down 0.4% and renewals were up 4.9% for a blended rental rate increase of 1.9%. In April, our new leases were up 0.3% and renewals up 4.9%, the blended increase of 2.1%. Our May and June renewal offers were sent out with an average of 5.6% increase. Qualified traffic is strong in every market and despite another year of above trend rental rate increases in 2016, our occupancy rate remains high. We averaged 94.8% in the first quarter, and in April it was 95.1% versus 95.2% last year, again all of this in line with our expectations. Most important reason for maintaining our occupancy rate as the low level of net turnover, in Q1 the net turnover in our portfolio was 40%, another record low for our overall portfolio. The financial health of our resident base continues to be strong as our average rent as the percentage of household income was 18.3% for the quarter, and this metric is been on the 17% to 18% range for the last few years. However, the financial health of our residents is still not translating to many more home and buying has moved out to purchase a home in Q1 were 14.9% versus 15.3% for the full year of 2016. We do expect that eventually this stat is going to drift higher, but there is still a long way to go before we get back to the historical rate of 18% move-outs to buy homes. Finally, we recently learned that for the tenth consecutive year Camden was included in Fortune Magazine's list of the 100 best places to work. This is a remarkable honor for our company and a positive reflection on just how far the REIT industry has come since its reinvention almost 25% years ago. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander Jessett: Thanks Keith. On the development front, during the first quarter of 2017, we stabilize the Camden in Hollywood and began leasing at Camden NoMa Phase II in Washington, DC, and Camden Shady Grove in Maryland. Subsequent to quarter end, we stabilized Camden Gallery in Charlotte and acquired an 8.2 acre land site in San Diego for future development. We have $660 million of developments currently under construction or in lease-up, with $200 million left to fund over the next two years. We still anticipate $100 million to $300 million of on balance sheet development starts later in 2017. Our balance sheet remains one of the best in REIT world, and we are one of only six U.S. equity REITs with a senior unsecured credit rating of A3 are better for Moody's. The net debt to EBITDA at 4.6 times, the fixed charge expense coverage ratio at 5.3 times, secured debt to gross real estate assets of 11%, 80% of our assets encumbered and 93% of our debt at fixed rates. Our current ATM or at-the-market equity program has $315 million of remaining availability, and was filed under a shelf which will expire this year. As a matter of corporate practice, we intend to keep an active ATM program on file. Therefore, we plan to roll the current availability under the existing ATM to a new ATM, which we will file in next few weeks in conjunction with the filing of a new shelf. Turning to financial results, last night we reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2017 of $100.4 million or $1.09 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.01 per share. Our $0.01 per share out performance for the first quarter was primarily due to three quarters of a cent in lower same store operating expenses, resulting primarily from lower employee benefit costs. As we experience lower than anticipated levels of health insurance and workers compensation claims. Although, we're encouraged by this trend if the past is any indication of the future, these results might be timing related rather than permanent savings. And three quarters of a cent and higher net operating income from our development and non-same store communities, resulting primarily from each of our development communities leasing ahead of schedule, better than expected results from our stabilized non-same store Camden NoMa Phase I community, and better than anticipated net operating income from Camden Miramar, our student housing community in Corpus Christi, Texas. These positives will partially offset by slightly higher net corporate overhead, and higher than anticipated interest expense as a result of lower levels of capitalized interest. The lower levels of capitalized interest resulted primarily from accelerated construction of our Camden NoMa Phase II development, which we began leasing during the first quarter 2017 ahead of our original forecast for leasing to begin in the second quarter. Last night we also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2017. We expect FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.11 to $1.15. The midpoint of $1.13 represents a $0.04 per share increase from $1.09 in the first quarter 2017. This increase is primarily the result of an approximate 2.5% or $0.035 per share, expected sequential increase in same store NOI as we move into our peak leasing period, an approximate $0.005 per share increase in NOI from our communities in lease-up, and approximate three quarter of a cent per share increase in FFO resulting from lower overhead costs due to the timing of certain corporate event, an approximate $0.01 per share increase in FFO due to lower interest expense, as the interest savings from repaying are maturing 5.83%, $247 million unsecured bond at maturity on May 15, is partially offset by borrowings on our line of credit, higher rates on our secured floating rate debt, and lower levels of capitalized interest. We currently have approximately $180 million of available cash on hand, and will fund the remaining amounts necessary to repay the unsecured maturity, utilizing our line of credit with an assumed interest rate of 1.9%, an approximate $0.05 decreased in income tax expense, due to an anticipated second quarter Texas margins tax refund, resulting from a prior year reduction in rate, and an approximate quarter of a penny increased in FFO due to a non-recurrence of our first quarter loss on early retirement of debt, resulted from acceleration of unamortized loan costs on a $300 million tax exempt bond we retired last quarter. This $0.065 per share aggregate improvement in FFO is partially offset by an approximate $0.025 per share decrease in FFO, resulted from lower occupancy at our non-same store student housing community in Corpus Christi, Texas. Occupancy declined significantly from May through August at this community. As a result of our actual and forecasted development, and non-same store results, we've increased the midpoint of our full year FFO guidance by $0.01. Our new full year 2017 FFO guidance is $4.49 to $4.65 per share, with the midpoint of $4.57 as compared to our prior guidance of $4.46 to $4.66 per share with the midpoint of $4.56. As we've not yet begun our peak leasing season, we have left our 2017 same store guidance intact. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction]. Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Just want to start on Houston. How is it trended relative to your expectations so far this year? And do you still expect same store revenue growth for Houston to be down about 4%?
D. Keith Oden: Yeah. We do Nick. I would say it's really right on top of our expectations, and that would be true of all of our other markets as well. There is not a nickel for the difference between where we ended up the first quarter in where our original guidance was. We did give specific guidance on Houston that we thought 2017 would sort of be the low water mark. We still think that that's most likely to be true and we gave specific guidance of down 4 on revenues. And again, based on everything that we see and that we have seen in the first four months of the year, we think that's still the right place to be for Houston for 2017.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just in terms of same store revenue growth more broadly, and I know made changes and it's before the peak leasing season. But are you maintaining the components as well that you expect 50 basis points I guess lower occupancy this year to about 65 basis point benefits from the bulk internet rollout?
D. Keith Oden: That's correct.
Nick Joseph: So, if you think about trying to get to the midpoint of guidance, it sounds like you need to see that rent growth throughout the year at about 2.7% or so? I think in the first you came slightly below that, just given the amount of supply you're seeing delivered this year. Can you give us some comfort in terms of reaching that midpoint and maintaining the rent growth that saw in the first quarter?
D. Keith Oden: If we thought, we were going to hit the midpoint we would have change the guidance. So we are in pretty good shape. I mean we do a full bottom up reforecast market-by-market. So, we are very detailed in how we approach this. We're fortunate to have a ton of people in these markets that is been doing this for our company for many, many years, and we get great take great comfort from that. So, if you think about big discount, big picture, the deceleration in Houston in our model is basically been offset by the improvement in Washington, D.C. And if you had to do the weighted average of the number of percentage concentration D.C. versus Houston, the math for those two markets is basically a push with where we were last year. And then, beyond that you got a bunch of other markets that we are still continuing to see a really good growth in Dallas, and Denver, and Tampa are growing extremely well in Atlanta. So, we're still seeing a pretty good strain across the platform, and I guess I'll go back to the original guidance that we gave on my letter grip grades, and I wouldn't change a single one of them. We gave at the time we had 10 markets that we graded as stable. One is improving which was Washington, D.C., and then the balance of them we had declining. So, I wouldn't change any of that, and with all that said, I think we still feel like we're in good shape to get to the midpoint of our guidance range for same store NOI.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just first one to touch on DC, and had a little bit of occupancy benefit this quarter. And I was just wondering if we should view this quarter's revenue growth as a trend? Or would you expect that to moderate that given that occupancy benefit? And then just any additional color you can provide on pricing power in that market headed into the peak leasing season will be helpful?
D. Keith Oden: Yeah. We had a really good quarter. Again, in line with our plans, we did slightly better on NOI overall, but really in line with what we expected to see. The strength in occupancy is certainly carried over into April in D.C. We see great traffic. Our folks are more optimistic in there, and their commentary about what's going on in the markets than they have been in three years in D.C. So that's all positive. 3.8% growth in revenue for the quarter is certainly a good start. And I think that that's you likely to see that be part of a trend that carries out throughout 2017. Again, we had D.C. as our only market that I rated is improving, and it looks like that we are in good shape to achieve that.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. And then just wanted to touch on Houston quickly, you guys outlined 25,000 to 30,000 jobs and 10,000 to 12,000 new units in that market, and you compared it to a couple of years in the past. I think 2003 perhaps and 2010 maybe where same store revenue was down 4%. And I was just curious what the jobs to completions ratio look like over those prior two periods that saw a similar revenue growth decline is what you're projecting in guidance?
D. Keith Oden: Well, probably a lot worse. I don't have him in front of me, but we had – because in those two prior periods we had really significant job losses in Houston. So, you know it was a much different scenario than what we are dealing with today. The other thing is that the economy in Houston during those two previous periods was fundamentally weaker than anything that we've seen in this downturn. This downturn was almost exclusively limited to from the standpoint of jobs to the oil business. It didn't really ever spread over into other parts of the Houston economy. And so, what feels like, if you happen to be own apartments in Houston, it doesn't feel like a very good place to be. But absent that, the oil patches in the process of a pretty robust recovery in terms of price of oil and drilling activity across all of the major and mid major companies. So Houston, even though the apartment sector is weak, it's primarily a supply induced weakness that once the market clears and we expect that to happen sometime early in 2018 where you get this glut of apartments that finds – where residents find a home, and market rents have to go through their adjustment to have that happen, which is already in the process of happening. The Houston is really well poised for a recovery in economics, which will immediately spill over into better support for rental rates. So, it's different. I would say that each of those in terms of supply, it was similar, but the jobs were worse. And the economy felt like throughout that those two prior periods that we were in a recession. And I can tell you, it just doesn't feel like we're in close to and we are not in Houston in terms of an overall economic impact, but having said that, we got 22,000 apartments that we have to work our way through in terms of deliveries over the next 15 to 18 months.
Richard Campo: Let me just add a couple of points to the Houston story a bit. So, when you look at just the apartment side of the equation, obviously an office probably is – the office is much worse than apartments, because lease apartments have a – in apartments we have great price elasticity. You lower the price and you can fill up your apartments, because people need a place to live and they don't need a place to work if you don't have a job, if you don't have jobs to people to fill those jobs. But at the end of the day, Houston in last 12 months added 63,000 new residents. 35,000 people came from abroad and 28,000 people came to Houston domestically. When you added that to the natural birth rate, a population increase in the last 12 months of 125,000 people. So, you have this inertia of 6.8 million people living in this region, the starts or actually completions are down 50% from 2016 to 2017. They will be down 50% again from 2017 to 2018. At the same time in the last 12 months, job numbers were somewhere around 30,000 jobs. And when you look at that actually produced more jobs in the first quarter anybody thought would happen, but at the end, you still have to get through the supply issue. But the good news is, is that it's very manageable when you start looking forward.
Austin Wurschmidt: Is it fair to say the big difference is just the level of concessions from new supply?
Richard Campo: Absolutely, if you're in the competitive market from a lease-up perspective, in the energy patch, and in the urban core, its three months free. The worst thing that a merchant builder can do is be the last one to get three months free, right. And so, that's pretty much a cap, they generally don't tend to go much more than that. But you know, when you think about three months free and what it does, it's taking a $2.80 rent down to about $2 or $2.10 or something like that, which increases the ability of the customer to pay. And so, what happens is, it's a boom for people who want to live in high rises and really in great urban locations and that consumers doing really well. Right now, there are lots of options and the prices are great. That three months free doesn't translate to the occupied market though. Because when you look at our down 4% in our projections, we are not in those zero occupied, like a merchant builder who just opens their doors, and so they're willing to cut prices at that level. Also the lot of the products is very high end product and that's where the biggest problem for rental is, is in the high end. Our suburban locations are doing much better than the urban locations, and that's kind of A versus B or urban versus suburban kind of story which is very typical in discount cycle.
D. Keith Oden: So, just to put some numbers around Rick's commentary on the, so three months free is 25% off, rental declined for merchant builders which is where the market – most of the market is right now. But again they're trying to have a very different task, they're trying to get from very low occupancy to something that's stabilized. So in our portfolio, if we end up within our range, which we think we will at somewhere around 4% down revenues for the year, that's the mix of some 8s and 9s and some flat. Believe or not, we still have assets that had positive if our revenue growth in the first quarter, then we're big, but there were slight positive number. So, they get down 25% on asking price from a number that was probably too high, were down 9% on asking price on rents, on our market clearing number. So, I think that's kind of where it ends up, that's where it ended up in the last two down cycles and we'll slug it out. We think we can achieve what we've given guidance to in Houston and better days are ahead, because Houston is a dynamic place and it continues to attract people both domestically and internationally, as well as the embedded growth of the population. So I think we've got a clear 22,000 apartments.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for the comments, and I'll leave the floor.
D. Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Pehl with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jeff Pehl: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you can comment on the new lease versus renewal lease-up growth for 1Q in Houston, and then how it's trending in 2Q?
D. Keith Oden: For the first quarter in Houston, renewals would have been flat. New lease is down 7% plus or minus. That carried over into April. I think that if you're projecting that over the balance of the year, how do you get to something less than 4% down on revenues, it's probably going to be pretty close to that flat, trying to maintain flat on renewals and overall leases come down maybe 6% or 7%, and we end up the year at down 3.5%. So I think that's likely to see what we'll see for the next couple of – for the next quarter for sure. And then, as we get to the back half of the year that may get a little better because we run into a little easier comps, some of the concessions that, you know some of our taking rents down had already occurred in the third and fourth quarters of last year, so the comps get a little bit easier. But directionally, I think that's where we're headed.
Jeff Pehl: Thanks. I was just wondering if you can also comment on the negative revenue growth in Houston for the quarter. If you can maybe break that down between you're midtown's assets verses the assets maybe near the energy corridor in the suburbs?
D. Keith Oden: Yeah. Sure. So, our midtown assets urban core would have been down 8% to 9% on new leases roughly flat on renewals. As you go out into the other markets, your new leases are trending flat to up 1%. So a big spread between suburban assets and in urban core for sure. But we are in a part of the cycle right now where our strategy to be diversified between urban assets and suburban assets is actually helping us quite a bit.
Jeff Pehl: Good. Thanks for the color.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Kind of use that segue on the urban versus suburban, could you just talk about the split between your portfolio as a whole, and the same store rent trends you are seeing between those two? And how supply looks looking forward between those two different segments of your portfolio?
Richard Campo: The supply, I'll start with that. It's a pretty straight forward. I can't give you the number, but I'm going to guess some order of magnitude of three to four times as much supply coming in the urban core as we do in the suburban markets and across our platform. So, it's buying large an urban core problem in terms of supply. You can gather the suburbs or the city of the market like Houston it's so large and spread out that unless somebody happens to be building right next door to you, you just not going to have the kind of impact that you have when you have large aggregations of units being leased. In terms of the spread between what we have think of the suburban versus urban assets. Suburban assets are outperforming by about 1.5% the urban assets and that across Camden's entire universe. So, that's not just Houston, that again the supply challenges where we've got new construction going on in other markets is been predominantly in the urban core. So it shows up in the spread, which is you know – by the way it's been that way for the last two years in terms of that out performance, 1.5% suburban versus urban. But if you go back five years, there were three straight years where the urban was outperforming the suburban. So it's just kind of where we are in the cycle.
Juan Sanabria: And that 1.5% is same store revenues?
Richard Campo: Correct.
Juan Sanabria: And then what's the overall split between urban suburban sites for the whole portfolio?
Richard Campo : We'll get to the number, about two-thirds, one-third suburban to urban, so we'll get the exact number.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And then just on supply, how are you guys thinking about across your portfolio 2018 versus 2017? And are you seeing any slippage on delivery time with frames this year that can look into 2018?
D. Keith Oden: The slippage on delivery time is in every market in every sub-market. There is not a single merchant builder that we talk to our other folks in the REIT world that have not all experienced some degree, and in some cases pretty material delays and we just don't have enough work crews, they just don't have that construction workers to get these jobs all done concurrently. So that is going to continue to be a challenge. I think that I know Ron Witten is one of our two data providers, and he has actually tried to incorporate the longer construction/lease-up period on his forecasting for multi-family completions. How well that's being captured, I think time will tell, but in our portfolio, if you look at the across all of Camden's markets for 2017. Again using Witten's numbers, he's got a completion number across all markets at about 146,000 for this year, and he's got that dropping to 128,000 for his 2018 forecast. So, 10% to 12% decline in total completions, job growth that he has estimated in those – again across our entire portfolio, he's got the job growth in 2017 of 569,000 across Camden's markets, and he's got that kicking up to 579,000 in 2018. That number is roughly in equilibrium on the 2018 completions verses jobs number 2017. We still have too many completions for the job. But I mean, you got really a strong job numbers this morning, and so maybe that's the beginning of a trend. And we know for a fact that Camden's markets attract higher than the national average percentage when we get job growth.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you. Good morning down there.
Richard Campo: Good morning.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, enjoy the music. Just continuing on that supply thing the topic, at a recent conference, you know was talking to few private developers and they were saying that some of the big merchandiser talking down 35% to 50% reduction in starts. But Keith, it sounded like in the supply numbers if I heard, you say it correctly. It didn't sound like 2018 was too different than 2017. So can you just give an update on what you guys are hearing from the merchant developers? And how you think the supply which we all expect to decline, but hasn't, how we should think about that coming in the next few years?
Richard Campo: Sure. The anecdotal information we get from the largest merchant builders, they're all talking the same thing, which is that they're lowering the number of starts and they're lowering the number of starts for a couple of reasons. One of which is the challenge in just getting bank financing given the bank market, and that's part of the issue, not only the stress in the finance. By getting construction loans, you get less of the construction loan in more expensive costs, so their total costs of capital has gone up, requires more equity or some mezz lending to bridge that gap. And so that's part of the issue. The other part of the issue is that because of the delays that they've had in finishing projects, they haven't been able to sell those projects, so you have a certain amount of their cap, because they need to sell projects to do new projects. So, even though we haven't seen these numbers come down, it just feels like they got to be coming down based on the discussions that we've been having with folks.
D. Keith Oden: Hey, Alex. If you look at completions are one thing, but when you're having conversations about with merchant builders about their future book of business, those guys are probably more likely thinking in terms of what they're going to be permitting. And if you look at the permits that are projected from 2017 to 2018, these are axial metrics numbers. It goes from 135 to 104. So, was that 25% almost 30% to sit down in permits across Camden's entire platform. And that starts to get in the range of what you're hearing from the merchant builders that we talked to.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. That's helpful. And then, switching and going out to the West Coast, you guys announced that San Diego land purchase, it's been sort of awhile since you hear much less about San Diego. So, can you just sort of give an update on that market? And two with that purchased just more because of where the yields are relative to where they maybe let's say n LA or is there something that you're seeing in San Diego that makes you want to put some money to work there?
Richard Campo: Well, we of course are in both of those markets and our developments folks have been scouring, the markets trying to get figure out deals of work, and it's been a very difficult process. The project said that most of the merchant builders are doing out there, the yield starts with the five and very low five, and that's a challenge for us, so we just aren't going to go there. And so, the San Diego deal was unique opportunity to do an off market transaction with a seller of a property that was a ruled complicated structure, and so we were very happy to be able to do that. We think that both the L.A. and San Diego markets are doing very well for us, and we've done great in our Camden our Glendale projects leasing them up and creating a lot of value there. So we really like the San Diego market and we really like this site because it was off market. We didn't have to compete with other developers for it which was really good.
Alexander Goldfarb: And versus that low five yield? How does this yield look?
Richard Campo: Well, we think it's a either a high five or low six.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about South Florida and what you're seeing in that market? And how different is your performance between the various sub-markets down there right now?
D. Keith Oden: So overall, our South Florida is on plan with where we thought it would be. We still have – we still got challenges with a lot of high rise product that's being built. And fortunately for us the stuff that is being built the pro forma rents that's been brought in market at/or $3 plus per square foot. We got a couple of high rises there that we are in the midst to repositioning that we think ultimately will be very competitive with the new product. But the bulk of our stuff in South Florida is garden low-rise and mid-rise product, it's just a totally different price points than where most of the new supply is. So that's helped us to a certain extent. We think that in my original guesstimates for the year, we had Miami as being stable. We had Fort Lauderdale as being stable. I still think that's sounds right to me based on our first four months of operation. So I think we're reasonably well positioned to hit our plan this year in both those markets.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then, how about Atlanta? I mean is it continues to be a strength for the multi-family guys that have been there. What do you think there in any material differentiation between the various sub-markets for you guys?
D. Keith Oden: Our portfolio was very spread out in Atlanta and that not unlike our Houston portfolio just smaller. Great first quarter in Atlanta. Again, we had – it was I belief is our second or third highest rated market for 2017 ahead of the B+ and stable. We still think that's right. We're still over 95% occupied and had a great first quarter. So I think, Atlanta is – we did a little over 5% revenue growth in the quarter and that's pretty on track with our plan. We do have some supply that's going to be an issue in Atlanta later this year, in the Buckhead, area there is just a lot of stuff that's being brought to market right now. So we are probably going to have to deal with some of the supply challenges in the Buckhead sub-market. Again, we have a very good mix of Buckhead and then other suburban markets that are service very well in Atlanta.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Good morning.
Richard Campo: Good morning.
Drew Babin: A quick portfolio management question. You talked in the past about on the bottom, probably is 5% to 10% of your portfolio, these candidates are proving in a given year. Do the amount of cash you have on the balance sheet change thinking with regard to whether you sell those assets or maybe thinking about putting some update capital on that?
Richard Campo: No. What we clearly have cash on the balance sheet and we have the best balance sheet in multi-family land right now and we are happy about that given where we are in the cycle, but we are going to continue to manage our portfolio over time. You are not going to see a $1.2 billion of sales like we did last year just because we think we can hit the market right at the perfect time to sell those older assets. But we will continue to play this trade, which is when you think about it, since 2011 we sold 2.1 billion of assets at roughly a little over a 5% AFFO yield. And when you think about that relative to what we've acquired and developed, the negative spread between our acquisitions and our dispositions given that we sold 20 plus year old assets with high CapEx. We've had a negative spread of 27 basis points on those trades. I will tell you that, in my business career, I've not seen that spread as tight as it is today. And so we can continue to do that and we will. So, when you think about acquisitions, we've only done – we did 2.1 billion of dispositions and only $643 million acquisitions, and none in the last three years. And mostly we put our money in development because you can get a much better spread in the development side of the equation, and so you don't have a negative spread there, you actually have a positive spread of probably 160 to 170 basis points on that trade. So, we will continue to prune the portfolio. We've gotten most of our sort of low hanging fruit finished. But one of the things, I think is that we've been sort of watching is that when you think about the supply side and the amount of merchant builder product that has been developed over the last two to three years, and the rise in construction costs that you're seeing. What's happening now we think and what I think is going to happen going forward is that development spread for the profit for the developers has narrowed pretty dramatically, and we're going to be able to acquire properties potentially going forward at below replacement costs in this the merchant builders in order to reload their portfolios are going to have to sell some assets to do that, and we already starting to see a little bit of that come to market. And I think that, so the idea of selling older properties and buying newer properties had a very small sort of negative spread if you will on old versus new is something we're going to continue to do.
Drew Babin: It's helpful and maybe the next here up in your portfolio assets spread, they aren't necessarily sales candidates do you want on the portfolio, might we see a directional pick-up in ROI CapEx by project.
D. Keith Oden: So, we have been repositioning assets pretty aggressively for the last four years. We've got another pool of assets that we're starting to reposition this year. It's not anything at the levels that it was two or three years ago, but we will continue to look for opportunities to put capital back into assets that make – where it make sense for us to use on those long-term holds. My guess is, is that, in our portfolio as Rick mentioned, all the stuff that we wanted to sell, we sold last year and we've exited Las Vegas and then we've sold which is about $600 million and then we've sold another $600 million of assets across our entire platform and they represented the assets that we did not see an upside – sufficient upside to reposition and because of age and CapEx requirements, they just needed to become someone else's – being someone else's portfolio. So, the stuff that we wanted to sell – we got real aggressive and sold it last year. 
Drew Babin: Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Jim Sullivan: Thank you. Good morning. One question from me, regarding Houston, that really your outlook for 2018 in the 4Q call, you characterized your kind of expectations for Houston for 2018 to be perhaps equilibrium although there was perhaps some optimism that it could be started in that. In your comments, you know here with three months on, I think your comment about job growth in Houston, well that's created more jobs than expected and as we look at the – what's happening, everybody expected of course permits to collapse there. But you know they have been very, very low here in the first quarter. So, just make sure we understand it correctly, are you incrementally more positive about that forecast you had for – I won't say forecast, but your sense of where Houston would be in 2018. Are you perhaps a little more optimistic about achieving perhaps equilibrium or equilibrium plus?
Richard Campo: I think that the numbers that have come in, in the first quarter we're definitely better than we expected and starts are definitely following off the edge of the year. And I was very surprised by their migration numbers. Because generally speaking don't move to a market unless they think they can get a job. And you know it's very widely known across America that Houston has its issues with the energy business. Yeah. We still had this great migration. And so, I guess the real question will be for me, so yes, we are more positive about Houston because of that – of the first quarter job numbers and migration numbers. But on the other hand, a quarter doesn't make the year and doesn't make you know the 22,000 units that need to be absorbed here absorbed. So, we're guardedly optimistic probably a little bit more optimistic than we were going into the – with the fourth quarter call, but we still have to see how it all plays out. You know oil prices have – are down. They are down in the last couple of days, even though most of the oil companies are adding jobs a little bit of jobs back, not dramatically. So, I think that it could surprise people on the upside in 2018, but on the other hand you know we're going to wait and see obviously.
D. Keith Oden: I think the overall economy as I've mentioned earlier, it just doesn't feel like there is this big – there has been this big dislocation in the economy in Houston. It is just – it's really kind of then contained to the oil and gas sector and then it's bled over into people who own apartments and people who own office buildings. But the rest of the working public and people, man on the streets going about their daily routines in Houston, Texas seem to be – restaurants are full and traffic everywhere and it feels like it's crazy time in Houston, not bloom times but still very robust and healthy from an overall economic standpoint. I think that Rick's point about the end migration. I mean that's potentially a game changer. You got 63,000 people who showed up. Somehow or other, they are working their way into the economy whether it's showing up in the stats or not, and they got to have a place to live, and more than likely they are going to end – very high percentage of them will end up running something before they make a permanent decision to own anything in Houston. So, I think that's probably the upside. We see that continue and throughout 2017 and into 2018 you've probably got enough, you've probably got enough of people sloughing around that are going to find their way into employment, need an apartment then ultimately we get through the 20,000 plus or minus units by the end of this year or early in 2018. And then you know I think there probably is some upside from there.
Jim Sullivan: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is from Tom Lesnick - Capital One.
Tom Lesnick : So, I'll limit my Houston question. There is just one. I guess as you think about the cadence of year-over-year comps for same store trending through the year. When should we expect – I know you talked about 2017 being the bottom, and potentially 2018 getting better. But as you look at from a quarterly timing perspective, when should we expect the inflection point to occur per se, and I guess I'd say that in the context that you guys actually had a positive same-store NOI comp in Q4 of 2016, so did that just set up and exceedingly hard comp optically for you guys this year?
D. Keith Oden: Yeah, we're not – I'm not picking inflection points in 2017 for Houston, but still we were 3.3 for the quarter. We think that we're still going to be able to keep it under our – or down for the quarter. I think we still feel pretty good about keeping it containing it at the 4% level, but given your readout on the, how that progresses, we'll just have to see. It's – there is a lot of volatility around merchant builders are doing, where our direct comps that happens to be. When the merchant builders get close to a 90% number, three months free becomes one month free overnight. And it's – then it's just a – it's a different war. So, as those people reach those – get to those – get to close to stabilization, your behavior changes pretty dramatically and that's good for the embedded base of our portfolio. But as far as reading out – I think – I wouldn't go any further than to say at this point, I still think down for in 2017 looks like the bottom to be.
Richard Campo: One of the things, I think it's interesting is that, people use this sort of jobs to completion ratio as a guide. I you use the jobs ratio as a guide in 2015 and 2016 Houston had about 16,000 jobs and during those two years, we absorbed 30,000 units. Wait a minute, yeah its 15,000 and we've absorbed 30,000 units. The ratio didn't make any sense obviously. And what was happening during period is in 2014, Houston had over 100,000 jobs for the last three year straight in you now 2012, 2013, 2014. So, what's happening is you had this momentum in this large market that took up a lot of absorption in the market place. So, the question on inflection is – will that continue to happen with this in migration and with better than expected job growth and anybody's guess is to when that's going to happen. It just will happen. We just don't know when.
Tom Lesnick : Got it. I appreciate that color. And then regarding the expense side of the equation, obviously you guys had some expense pressure both sequentially and year-over-year in your comps and they were here just limited to one market. I mean there were several markets that were kind of trending at above long-term levels. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about property tax, utilities, property insurance and you know how you guys see that trending cadence wise through the year?
Alexander Jessett: Yeah. Absolutely. So, on the property tax side, we think the full year is going to end up for us up 5.5%. That what we thought a quarter ago. We still think that's being issued today. Obviously, this was on a sequential basis was a very tough comp, because we got quite a bit of property tax refunds in in the fourth quarter of last year particularly in Houston. When you look at the insurance side, and we talked about this on the last in the first quarter of 2016, we got in refunds of approximately $1.5 million and so and by the way that insurance refunds were allocated across our entire portfolio. So, certainly negatively impacts the comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Utilities for the most part are – any increases there are being driven by the roll-out of our tech package and where we are today on our tech package. If you think about our 42,000 same-store units, we've got about 37,000 of them that have been rolled out. So you should start seeing the impact on the expense side, decline as we go throughout the year.
Tom Lesnick : Got it. That's very helpful. Then my last question, I know this is a very small portion of the portfolio. But for Corpus Christi, could you just remind us what's going on there? I think you said – you have loans to housing asset, kind of what was the genesis of that investment and how do you see that asset long-term in your portfolio?
Richard Campo: Are you asking specifically about the student housing asset? First of all it doesn't show up on our same-store pool
Tom Lesnick : Oh it doesn't, okay.
Richard Campo: No it doesn't. We have two assets in our same-store – three asset – two assets in same store pool, three wholly owned assets in separate from the Miramar, the housing product. So, the student housing product is doing great. We're better than planned so far this year. So, that's not any part of what's showing up in these numbers. The decline in Corpus Christi is primarily because of the hits in the oil pacts that there were definitely affected in the South Texas market and then in particular to an asset we have there Camden Breakers, we're in the process of doing a pretty major exterior renovation and it's just messy and it's hard to get drive the right kind of traffic and close at the percentage that we need. So, small piece but gets the attention it deserves and I think it's a – somewhat it's a market condition, but some of it right now is particular to that one asset. And when you have two assets in the same store pool, it's going to be pretty volatile around quarter-to-quarter.
Tom Lesnick : Understood and thanks for the clarification. Thanks guys.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: The next question is from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hello everyone. Just can you give us your view on development cost inflation over the next few years? Why are you caring about lumber tariffs potentially happening and an infrastructure build is implemented, what will that do for labor cost?
Richard Campo: Yeah, we're very concerned about labor cost and timber cost and lumber cost. You know the challenge you have is that when you think about any kind of infrastructure build that the government is talking about doing and you look at toady the print was 4.4 unemployment rate. It's a tough deal and we are not seeing any benefit from one of the things, when you think about Houston, the construction cost hasn't gone down in Houston even though construction is falling for multifamily because it's been offset by public sector spending and hospital spending and petrochemical spending. And so, I think there is going to be continued pressure, big pressure on labor shortages and on product shortages, especially if the government gets an infrastructure build on this year.
Wes Golladay: Okay and then I want to go back to that comment about the Houston merchant builders getting to 90% lease up and then backing off the concessions. Is there any particular development company or any particular project that is really compressed in the market is a price setter? And once they get leased up, we might see a little relief?
Richard Campo: I don't think so. I think it's across the board like it's – like my tongue and cheek comment earlier that you know the worse thing for a merchant builder is to be the last guy to get the three months free. So, they all immediately go there fast and then the same thing happens once the market stabilizes. There is not one particular – I don't know it's a very dispersed group of merchant builders. You might have the Tramcos of the world that have a lot of projects, but they don't control the market and there is not one group that really does that. It's a pretty broad competitive set.
D. Keith Oden: And it's really sub market specific if you've got – if you've got two new lease ups that are within the one mile radius of the property that you are trying to get leased up and here it's going to be competitive until they get stabilized. But they do, yeah, they will run really hard for the exit and they will kind of smash through the door at the same time. But the good news is that they run really hard for the exit.
Richard Campo: And I think the other good news is, is that price elasticity is great. The consumer in Houston, Texas is having a field day in lease up and lot of the product that was built, and we're talking high rises that never existed in lot of submarkets here and those high rises are as good or better than any for sale condo or product that you can see. So, if not that, they open and all of a sudden they are crickets, no one is walking in the door, there's tons of people walking on the door and they are leasing these up and the consumers are getting great deals on them. One of the only concerns I have is, if you move in at 25% discount, how fast can they move that up for those customers and whether those customers have to be moved out and be able to get to those high levels. One the one hand you know as an investor in Houston and as someone who understand the market, I kind of like that potential problem for those people, because we could easily buy and upgrades to some of our portfolio buying some of these assets below the placement cost and even with – because cost has gone and up and we'll continue to go up, the developer can actually sell their asset and get their money out, maybe with a slight profit and still be able to acquire properties at below replacement cost, but we could go on our existing sites. And that's an opportunity I think is really good.
Wes Golladay: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Sorry to keep it going. And you kind of stole my question – one of my questions there Rick about what happens you know in Phase 2 of these three months concession situations and you know that same customer stays for the 25% rent increase. Maybe you can speak in terms of history, is there going to be an uptick in turnover in the short-term in Houston next year if all things kind of go as planned, or how much does that delay the ultimate recovery in your estimation?
Richard Campo: I think it's all a function of what the economy is doing and what – and whether the job growth is there in migration phase. Right, because, when you look at that in migration for example, 35,000 of the 63,000 people to move to Houston in the last 12 months are from abroad. And we find that the foreign folks are much more used to A, renting and B, are moving into a lot of these high rises as well. And so, if that continues, the good news is there is – in a market that is as big as Houston, 22,000 units or 30,000 units is not a huge amount of inventory. So, it really remains to be seen what happens with that. Clearly if you had a recession that happened at the same time over the next couple of years, that wouldn't be good for recovery in Houston, but if you just have a go along, get along like we're doing now, it probably does fine. I do think that, that the psyche of that merchant builder today and the investors that have invested in these new projects here are – has definitely changed in their view as, is that they are hoping and with reasonable hope to get the capital out with a small profit and we have people approach us for example to buy lease ups here and their discussion is well, I'm not prepared to buy lease up here today, but the idea that the merchant builders are being more realistic in terms of what their pricing might be in the future I think is going to be a good thing for her.
Rich Anderson: And then second question is, this is a dumb one, employment on tequila. But if you look back and what you've done is Washington, D.C. and you had some success with NoMa II. Do you look back and say, gosh, wish we had been maybe a bit more aggressive developing sooner to deliver into a better market? And if that is case, how does that affect your strategy for development in Houston, or is it because it's a supply driven weight right now that maybe you'd be less inclined to add development projects early to deliver in a better market in Houston later?
Richard Campo: I think that's definitely calculus that we are looking at. The question is, as you hold land, it gets more expensive every day and if you think construction cost are not going down, but going up, and you think that you might be able to deliver into a strong market in the future that doesn't have a lot of competition, that's a – you know that's a different, that's an analysis that we are – that we have to make and it's one where – that's we're looking at that for sure. The question ultimately is, can you get the math to work? And then what your – you have to have a view of the market obviously. And we've done well in D.C. and a lot of people pull back from there as some of our competitors did and work why we didn't.
Rich Anderson: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Good afternoon, guys. I'll keep it short with just one here. Just curious in the context of a very low levered balance sheet shares trading certainly below our estimate of NAV to significant extent? So just curious where share repurchases fit into the corporate finance matrix at this point for you guys?
Richard Campo: Well, share repurchases have always been in our forte. We are doing multiple cycles of purchase shares. The real issue becomes that the issue of volatility and can you get any kind of scale, I don't fundamentally believe I don't think our team believes that nibbling at shares, this should say we think it's below our NAV makes a lot of sense. So we can get size and we can sell assets for $1 on Main Street and buy the stock back at a discount on Wall Street. It's a rational trade to do, but it doesn't really do any good unless you can do it in size. And the challenge that we've had over the years is that the stock has been very volatile, and we get to the point where we think it's a really good value, all of a sudden so does the market and they drive the stock price up and we can't buy. So, it's one of those kinds of interesting academic questions, it makes perfect sense to do it. The question is how you execute and can you execute it, is that where it really makes a difference.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisor. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Can you share the average stabilize yield on the A project you have either in lease-up around the development right now?
Richard Campo: Sure. Our stabilize yields on average around 7%.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And that's on today's rents?
Richard Campo: Yes.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. And Keith, you mentioned, you reset your underwriting after each quarter passes. Can you share the occupancy new lease and renewal growth expectations for the last three quarters of the year that get you to the 2.8% midpoint of revenue growth guidance?
D. Keith Oden: No. So, we go through a bottom-up reforecast of every community. And then we take those numbers, and we look at them and say, what is the progression? So he can give you the progression on new lease and renewals that we've already done, which we have provided for you today. But as far as going out into quarter-by-quarter progressions, that's not something that we've ever done or prepared to do. But we're comfortable that we are going to get to the midpoint of our guidance on same store.
John Pawlowski: Okay. With the comments on delivery slipping to the back half of the year, is there any concern you're on track through the first five months of the year because deliveries have been light and then be back waited?
D. Keith Oden: No. I don't think so, because most of the stuff that is forecast to be delivered in 2017 has already – I mentioned earlier that witness has put some pretty good effort around and trying to time, to account for the delay in these projects. Most of the inventory that we know here in Houston, we have very good data on where they are from a construction and completion standpoint and also lease-ups. It's important that we for all the reasons that Rick mentioned earlier, it's important that we know exactly what's going on, on all of this inventory that's out there that at some point needs to find a new home because it's 99.9% that is merchant builder product. And ultimately they're not prepared nor are they position to own these assets long-term. So we tracked them very closely and I am confident that the numbers that we are using for supply are good numbers.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks.
D. Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rick Campo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any remarks.
Richard Campo: Well I appreciate that your time today and we will see you at the upcoming NAREIT meeting. So thanks. Take care.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan; please go ahead. 
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent Management's current opinions and the Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of our subsequent events.  As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2016 earnings release is available in the Investor section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call.  Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer.  We will try to complete the call within one hour today. Since we already have 13 people in the queue this morning, we ask that you limit your questions to two and then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we're unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes.  At this time, I will turn the call over to Rick Campo. 
Rick Campo: Good morning. The on-hold music for our call today was provided by five different artists. The first person to send the correct response to the following question to Kim Callahan will get a shout out on this call and will win the right to help select the music for our next quarterly call. The question is, who are the five artists and what do they have in common?  2016, by any measure, was a great year for Camden. We stayed focused on our game plan and exceeded our ambitious expectations for the season. It was a year of blocking and tackling at its finest by our team. Our offensive game plan stayed conservative, with no acquisitions and a slowing development pipeline. We ran the score up by improving the quality and the geographic makeup of our property portfolio by selling nearly 13% of our properties into a very receptive market that would be difficult to replicate today. We used the sales proceeds to fund development, pay down debt and return capital to our shareholders through a special dividend.  We added new depth to our bench by adding two new Board members, Heather Brunner and Renu Khator. Heather has an impressive background in new technology and social media which is an area that requires quick feet, agility and speed in order to compete. Renu brings a unique knowledge from her perspective of running the University of Houston on what our future customers need, how they live and how to connect with them which will help our teams to design future successful game plans. I want to give a shout out to two of our Hall of Fame Board members, Gardner Parker and Lewis Levey, who will be leaving the Board in May. They have provided sage guidance and support for many years and we will miss them deeply.  2017 looks like another good year for Camden. We will continue to block and tackle with a strong defensive balance sheet and a team that is focused and ready to take advantage of any of our opponents' weaknesses. I have absolutely no idea why my comments today sound like a half-time speech, so I will turn the call over to Keith Oden while I try to figure it out. 
Keith Oden: Thanks, Coach Campo. Consistent with prior years, I'm going to use my time on today's call to review the market conditions that we expect to encounter in Camden's markets during 2017. I will address the markets in the order of best to worst by assigning a letter grade to each one, as well as our view on whether we believe that, that market is likely to be improving, stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview, I will provide additional details on our fourth quarter operations and 2017 same-property guidance.  In 11 of our 13 markets, we anticipate same-property revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range this year, with a weighted average growth rate of just under 4%. These markets represent over 80% of our same-property pool and are all rated a letter grade of B or higher. Our top ranking this year goes to Denver which we rate an A, but with a declining outlook. Denver has been one of our top markets for the past several years, averaging nearly 7% annual same-property revenue growth over the last three years. We expect to see a steady rise in new supply coming online which will likely temper the pace of revenue growth during 2017. Around 10,000 new apartments are expected to open this year, with 30,000 to 40,000 new jobs created, putting Denver's jobs to completions level below equilibrium.  Phoenix rates an A-minus rating with a stable outlook. Phoenix has also been one of our top markets for the past several years and we expect another strong year this year. Over 50,000 new jobs are expected during 2017, with only 7,500 new units scheduled for delivery. This looks like another really good year for our Phoenix market.  Dallas gets an A-minus rating with a declining outlook. Dallas was our number one market for revenue growth last year at 7.7%, but it faces more headwinds this year from new supply. New developments have been coming on steadily, with around 20,000 new units delivered last year and another 20,000 expected to open this year. However, job growth in Dallas has been very strong, with over 90,000 jobs added in 2016 and estimates are great for 2017 with another 70,000 new jobs projected. Overall demand for apartments should continue, given the strength of the Dallas economy, but revenue growth will moderate during 2017 as new supply hits the market.  Our next four markets, Atlanta, Southern California, Raleigh and Orlando, each earned B-plus ratings with a stable outlook. All of these markets faced healthy operating conditions, with a reasonable balance of supply and demand metrics. Overall, new deliveries in these markets should increase slightly during 2017 while job growth moderates a bit, providing growth rates more in line with long term historical levels. In Atlanta, estimates call for 53,000 new jobs in 2017, with 13,000 new apartments scheduled for delivery this year. Southern California is projected to have an aggregate of 110,000 jobs, 28,000 new apartment units in the areas of LA orange County and San Diego, where we operate our portfolio. 2017 should look a lot like 2016 in Raleigh, with job growth of over 20,000, new deliveries of around 5,000 apartments. And Orlando is expected to create 38,000 new jobs and see 8,000 new apartment homes completed.  Up next is Tampa, with a B-plus rating and a declining outlook. Our Tampa portfolio ranked number three for revenue growth in 2016 at over 7%; much better than what we originally anticipated in our budgets. Tampa should see close to 30,000 jobs created this year, with around 6,000 new units delivered, but we expect conditions to moderate a bit during 2017, hence our declining outlook.  Washington, DC moves up a few spots this year to a B rating with an improving outlook. Revenue growth has averaged less than 1% in DC for the last three years, but we saw steady improvement over the course of 2016 and we budgeted a little over 3% growth for 2017. Completions this year should remain in the 10,000 range, but job growth estimates are strong, with over 70,000 new jobs projected in the DC Metro area. We give South Florida a B rating, with a stable outlook again this year. South Florida has been a consistent performer for us over the years and conditions should remain constructive there, with around 10,000 new units being completed against 37,000 new jobs in 2017.  Austin earned a B as well, but with a declining outlook, given the continued wave of new supply there, coupled with slowing economic conditions. Austin has surprised us to the upside the past two years and we think 2017 will be the year where the surge of new apartments finally begins to take its toll. Completions should remain steady in the 8,000 to 10,000 range. But job growth has been slowing over the past year and could result in only 20,000 new jobs created in 2017, resulting in a jobs-to-completions ratio of approximately 2 to 1 and that would be one of the lowest of all Camden markets.  Conditions in Charlotte are currently a B-minus with a stable outlook. Charlotte added around 7,000 units last year and another 7,000 completions that are expected in 2017. Job growth should remain healthy with nearly 30,000 new jobs projected, but our occupancy and pricing power will remain challenged during 2017 as more new communities come online. We're expecting our portfolios in Charlotte's revenue growth to improve slightly during 2017 from the 2.1% growth we achieved last year.  And it should come as no surprise to anyone that Houston ranks last for our portfolio this year, with a rating of D and conditions are expected to decline during 2017. Over the past 24 years of operating in the Houston market, our same-store revenue growth has ranged from a low of minus-4% which actually happened twice during the recession years of 2003 and 2010, to a high of 11% growth in 2012. And our 2017 results will most likely resemble the previous lows. Houston produced only 10,000 or so jobs in 2016 and most estimates for this year are in the 25,000 to 30,000 range for new jobs. New supply has been significant for the past several quarters and will remain elevated for the next few quarters, with 10,000 to 12,000 new apartments expected to open during 2017. While that is still elevated, it does represent a 50% reduction from the 2016 deliveries. Looking out into 2018, completions should drop to around 6,800 apartments. And assuming a modest recovery in employment growth, we could see a return to equilibrium.  Overall, our portfolio rating is a B this year, down from last year's B-plus rating, but a decent starting position for 2017. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of our markets should average 3% to 5% revenue growth this year, with the outliers being Charlotte in the 2% to 3% range and Houston near a 4% decline. As a result, we expect our 2017 total portfolio same-store revenue growth to be 2.8% at the midpoint of our guidance range. This compares to our actual revenue growth last year of 3.9% and roughly half of that decline comes from our weaker outlook for Houston versus last year.  Now a few details on our 2016 operating results, same-store revenue growth was 3.1% for the fourth quarter, 3.9% for the full year of 2016. We saw strong performance during the fourth quarter, with most of our markets recording 4% to 6% revenue growth. Our top performers for the quarter were Dallas at 6.3%, Denver at 6.1% Orlando at 5.9%, Atlanta 5.3% and the San Diego area at 4.9% growth.  Rental rate trends for the fourth quarter were as expected, with new leases down 1.6%, renewals up 4.5%, for a blended rate of 1% growth. And our preliminary January results are in a similar range. February and March renewals are being sent out at around 5% increases. Occupancy averaged 94.8% during the fourth quarter compared to 95.5% last year. January occupancy levels have averaged 94.8% as well which is about 50 basis points below January 2016 levels. Net turnover for 2016 was again a positive 300 basis points lower than 2015, 48% versus 51%. The move out to purchase homes was 16.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 versus 15.4% for the full year and those are both up slightly from 2015.  At this point, I will turn the call over to Alex Jessett. Do we have a winner? 
Rick Campo: We do have a winner, so let's put Alex on hold for a minute. Dan Smith at KeyBanc is the winner. The answer to the question was, the five artists, what they have in common is that they were the five past Super Bowl headline performers. And it started in 2013 with Beyonce, then went to Bruno Mars, then Katy Perry, then Coldplay and of course in 2017, the spider woman, Lady Gaga. So thanks, Dan. We appreciate it and you were 10 seconds faster than the next bidder. And even though we're not going to shout out that 10-second bidder, we will send him an email and thank him.  Alex, go ahead. Thank you. 
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Rick. Before I move to our financial results, I will provide a brief summary of 2016's strategic accomplishments. 2016 was a transformative year for Camden. We completed nearly $1.2 billion of dispositions with an average age of 23 years, nearly twice the average age of our total portfolio, at an average AFFO yield of 5.1%, generating an 11% unleveraged internal rate of return over a 17-year average hold period. We exited the Las Vegas market. We stabilized $425 million of development which created over $100 million of value. We returned $380 million to our shareholders in the form of a special dividend and we received two long term credit rating upgrades, first from Fitch, who upgraded our ratings to A-minus; and second from Moody's, who upgraded our rating to A3. Our balance sheet remained strong, with net debt to EBITDA at 4.3 times, a fixed-charge expense coverage ratio at 5.3 times, secured debt to growth real estate assets at 11%, 78% of our assets unencumbered and 92% of our debt at fixed rates.  Turning to the fourth quarter results, on the development front, we stabilized Camden Chandler in Phoenix, completed construction on The Camden in Hollywood, began leasing at Camden Lincoln Station in Denver and commenced construction on Camden North Bend in Phoenix. We have $850 million of developments currently under construction or in lease-up, with $240 million left to fund. Turning to financial results, last night we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $100.5 million or $1.15 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.01 per share. This $0.01 per-share out-performance was due to lower-than-expected same-store and development operating expenses, partially offset by slightly lower-than-anticipated same-store revenue.  Our Camden technology package with bundled cable and Internet service is rolling out as scheduled and for the fourth quarter, contributed approximately 40 basis points to our NOI growth. For the year, this initiative has added 90 basis points to our same-store revenue growth, 170 basis points to our expense growth and 45 basis points to our NOI growth. We now have approximately 33,000 same-store units signed up for our technology package and the program continues to perform in line with expectations.  Moving on to 2017 earnings guidance. You can refer to page 26 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2017 financial outlook. We expect 2017 FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $4.46 to $4.66, with a midpoint of $4.56 representing an $0.08 per share decline from our 2016 results. The major assumptions and components of this $0.08 per share decrease in FFO at the midpoint of our guidance range are as follows, a $0.10 per share or $9 million increase in FFO related to the performance of our 41,988 unit same-store portfolio. We're expecting same-store net operating income growth of 0.8% to 2.8%, driven by revenue growth of 2.2% to 3.3% and expense growth of 4% to 5%. Each 1% increase in same-store NOI is approximately $0.055 per share in FFO.  A $0.19-per-share or $17 million, increase in FFO related to net operating income from our non-same-store properties, resulting primarily from the incremental contribution from our development communities in lease-up during 2016 and 2017 and the four development communities which stabilized in 2016 and a $0.04 per share increase in FFO due to lower interest expense, as we anticipate repaying a $250 million unsecured bond at its maturity in May and prepaying a $30 million secured floating-rate mortgage in February. We will use our current $250 million of cash on hand and borrowings under our $600 million line of credit to retire this debt.  The interest rate on the maturing unsecured bond is 5.8% and the interest rate on the secured loan is currently 2.2%. The interest rate on our line of credit floats at LIBOR plus 85 basis points. Additionally, we're anticipating a new $300 million,10-year bond issuance late in the year at approximately 4%. These positives are more than offset by a $0.36 per share or $33 million decrease in FFO related to lost NOI from the $1.2 billion of dispositions completed in 2016; a $0.04 per share or $3 million, decrease in FFO, due primarily to increases in net overhead expenses which are budgeted to increase at approximately 3%; and finally, a $0.01 per share or $500,000, decrease in FFO related to the nonrecurring first quarter 2016 gain on sale of land.  Our same-store expense growth range of 4% to 5% for 2017 is primarily due to insurance reimbursements and property tax refunds received in 2016 which we're not anticipating to recur at the same levels in 2017; and the continuation of our bulk internet rollout. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2016, we received an approximate $1.5 million insurance refund from prior-year periods. And throughout 2016, but particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016, we received several property tax refunds from prior-year protests and appeals. We're not anticipating any insurance reimbursements in 2017 and as a result, we're anticipating our property insurance expense to increase by 11% year over year.  Property taxes represent one third of our total operating expenses and are projected to be up 5.5% in 2017. 4% of the expected growth is core, the result of anticipated increases in assessments for our properties. The remaining 150 basis-point increase is due to a year-over-year reduction in anticipated refunds from prior-year tax protests. As I mentioned, we had great success in 2016 with our prior-year tax protest and current year appeals. As a result, 2016's full-year property tax expense increased by 2.8% as compared to our original budget of 6%, for a savings of approximately $3 million. Although we do anticipate some level of tax refunds in 2017, we do not anticipate it will reach the levels received in 2016. This level of success in 2016 creates headwinds for us in 2017, as indicated by the 150 basis-point year-over-year increase tied to prior-year tax protest refunds.  Finally, we're anticipating an 8% increase in property utility expense in 2017 as a result of our continued bulk Internet initiative. Utilities represent 22% of our total operating expenses and this initiative is adding approximately 130 basis points to our 2017 expense growth, 65 basis points to our 2017 estimated same-store revenue growth and 20 basis points to our same-store NOI growth. By the end of 2017, we will be complete with the rollout of our technology package. Excluding taxes, insurance and bulk Internet costs, the remainder of our property-level expenses are anticipated to increase at less than 2% in the aggregate. Overall, the average of our actual 2.2% expense growth in 2016 and our forecasted 4.5% expense growth in 2017 is 3.3% which is in line with our long term historical expense growth rate of approximately 3%.  Page 26 of our supplemental package also details our expected ranges of acquisitions, dispositions and development activities. The midpoint of our 2017 FFO-per-share guidance range assumes the following, $100 million in on-balance-sheet acquisitions and dispositions toward the latter part of the year, with no significant impact to our guidance and $100 million to $300 million of on-balance-sheet development starts.  Last night we also provided earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2017. We expect FFO per share for the first quarter to be within the range of $1.06 to $1.10. The midpoint of $1.08 represents a $0.07 per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016 which is primarily the result of a $0.06 or approximate $5.5 million, decrease in sequential same-store net operating income. Of this amount, $3.5 million is due to sequential increases in property taxes, as most of the previously mentioned 2016 tax refund occurred in the fourth quarter and we reset our annual property tax accruals on January 1 of each year. $2.5 million is due to other expense increases, primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends.  These increases in same-store operating expenses are partially offset by a slight increase in same-store operating revenue, a $0.02 per share decrease in FFO from the combination of lower equity and income of joint ventures due to the reasons outlined previously for our same-store portfolio; and higher overhead costs due to normal beginning-of-the-year compensation increases and the timing of certain corporate events. These decreases in FFO are partially offset by a $0.01 per share increase in NOI from our development communities in lease-up.  At this time, we will open the call up to questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Nick Joseph at Citigroup.
Nick Joseph: Thanks, just wanted to touch a little on Houston. You mentioned the negative 4% in terms of guidance for same-store revenue, but I'm wondering what the range assumes at the high and low end of guidance. How wide are the potential outcomes there? And then also, what are you seeing in terms of concessions today and expected in 2017? 
Keith Oden: So, in terms of our overall same-store guidance that we provide within that range, I think that the 50 basis points on either side on the revenue target would be applicable to a Houston scenario as well.  We tried to -- one of the things that we tried to give people at least some context to is that minus 4, down for on revenues has -- it was the low point in our Houston portfolio over the last 24 years and that's actually happened twice.  This is different. Those were recession times; clearly we're not in recession now. This is more specific to Houston with regard to the employment scenario in the oil business.  We obviously had 15,000 new jobs created last year. It looks like we'll be 20,000 to 25,000 jobs in 2017. But what's very different this time has just been the number of new apartments that are being delivered, have been delivered in 2016 and it looks like we're going to get another 10,000 plus or minus in 2017.  So it's a very different scenario of how you get to the 4%, but I think it's still a number that we think is a range that we built around that. There's always a little bit more volatility in a declining market, a little bit trickier to forecast.  Having said that, we gave guidance in the first quarter of this year for Houston revenues and our guidance was that we thought we would be down 1% year to date when all of the dust settled and we ended the year at down 1.2%. I think our teams did a pretty good job of putting a fence around where we thought we would be in 2016 and I think we've done the same thing for 2017. So Houston is certainly a market where we might have a little bit more volatility, but we think we have captured correctly and appropriately the risks associated with it.  Your question on free rent or concessions, we don't really have free rent or concessions. We do net effective pricing since -- because we're on a revenue management system. So it all gets factored into the net effective rent when we do our quotes.  However, having said that, in the lease-up communities that we -- in markets where we compete with, it is the stated, on the sign outdoor is two months free. But I think the reality is closer to three months free for most of the merchant build properties that are currently undergoing a lease-up. That's the headwind that we face in sub-markets where there's been a lot of this supply.  Merchant builders, they all tend to be herd instincts and the lowest common denominator gets to be the amount of concession that they all will quickly arrive at. And we think it feels like in the last three to four months, towards the end of the year, we may have had some kind of a bottom.  Normally, at three months free rent, you get to a point where it almost becomes uneconomic for merchant builders to put new residents in and that creates the floor. So I think if you're talking merchant build communities in Houston, two to three months free rent is going to be fairly commonplace throughout 2017. 
Nick Joseph: And then, Rick, in your opening comments you said that last year's sales would probably be difficult to replicate today. What is driving that comment? And then just more in general, what are you seeing in the transaction market in terms of cap rates and the size of the buyer pool today? 
Rick Campo: Well, that's driving it is that after treasuries spiked after the election, anybody that had a property that was under contract that wasn't hard earnest money was -- there was a lot of retraining going on. I think that's one thing.  The other is that we're later in the cycle here and people are worried about the supply side, as all investors are and where are we and what's going to happen over the next three to four years with a recession scenario. And so you're longer in the tooth from that perspective.  I think people are sitting on their hands a bit. There are still transactions getting done, but the type of property that we sold was definitely would not -- and the volume that we sold we think would be much more difficult to get done today and just in the sense of where we're in the cycle from that perspective.  I think you have a standoff between buyers and sellers today. Buyers think that with treasuries rising the way they did, that they ought to get a bigger discount. And the sellers are not willing to give that discount, so there's a standoff and it will be interesting to see who wins in that area. And I think it just depends on how the economy unfolds.  There's a lot of positives, you could say, about pro growth from both infrastructure investments, deregulation and tax changes that should provide growth. On the other hand, there's wild cards and everything else that we have going on in the administration. And so, I think a lot of people are sitting on their hands going, I think it could be good but I don't know if it's going to be good given the other volatility that could come out of there. 
Operator: The next question is from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Austin Wurschmidt: It's Austin Wurschmidt here. Just following up on Nick's last question there, what is, ultimately, what you're seeing in the transaction market, what do you think that means for cap rates over the next 6 to 12 months? Or have you seen any movement in the last several months? 
Rick Campo: Cap rates, again it's hard to say. I think most people think cap rates have moved somewhere in the 20, 25-basis-point range and it's just one of those poker hands. You've got the people on either side of the table looking for somebody to flinch and you have, even at 25 basis points, you have historically low interest rates today. And the interest rates haven't gone up that much on a relative basis.  And when you think about what drives cap rates, it's really liquidity and there's still plenty of liquidity. And then it's supply and demand fundamentals and even though we have a supply wane on the market, you still have really good demand cycles.  And then, a lot of folks use floating-rate interest rates to fund. And so and then when you think about inflation, people are -- if you have growth and interest rates are going up because of growth, then inflation should follow which is actually beneficial to the multifamily business. I think it's going to just take some time to see where those folks come out.  If you think about Camden, we've sold $1.2 billion last year and had more cash than I've ever had on my balance sheet ever and the lowest debt position ever. And so, we're looking at it going, so what do we do?  We're just like a lot of other people out there that have cash and have the ability to put money to work and we just don't see a lot of opportunity. Even in Houston, people think, oh gee, you ought to be able to go out and buy all of these great properties in Houston and they don't exist today.  So there's just not a lot of sellers that are willing to take -- to adjust their psychology of where they think the pricing of their assets are going to be. And ultimately, the question is, what growth rate are you going to have in cash flow going forward? And I think that's where all of us are in a quandary. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Appreciate the detail there and then just wanted to dig in a little bit more on Houston and the guidance and what you're assuming. Are you assuming any type of stabilization or perhaps, inflection later this year in Houston's operating trends? And then, how far do you think Houston's occupancy could fall before it bottoms? It's continued to trend lower here the last several quarters. I'm just curious where you think we could find a bottom within your portfolio. 
Keith Oden: I think 2017 in Houston is going to be just a lot of hand-to-hand combat. We've got 10,000 more apartments that are going to be delivered into a market that clearly is vastly oversupplied right now.  It really depends on the geography of where your assets happen to be. The good news is, is that we have a good mix of our assets, some in suburban areas that have been much less impacted. And the ones that are ground zero where the new supply is coming are getting a lot of more beat up.  We have Houston as down 4% for the year in terms of revenues. We have it also at about 200 basis points less than long term trend on occupancy, so down, call it 92%, 92.5% occupied throughout most of 2017.  I think it's possible that toward the end of 2017, if we worked our way through the 10,000 apartments through discounted pricing, that the merchant builders are going to have to deal with. Obviously, they're playing a different game than we're.  We're 93%, 94% occupied and we're playing defense and we're doing -- we've been doing for two years all the things that make good sense from a defensive standpoint, focusing on renewals, extending lease terms, we've done all of that. So we've prepared for what we know is going to be a tough 2017.  I think it's possible that if you absorb the 10,000 apartments and you don't -- again, you're not fighting against merchant builders who are given three months free rent, that you could, toward the end of the year, will get decent job growth and maybe start seeing some rays of sunshine.  But we're certainly prepared for a lot of grinding it out in Houston in 2017, as evidenced by the fact that we've got revenues going down 4% which is a historical low point for revenue declines in our portfolio. And we've been doing this for 30 years here, so we know it is going to be a challenge. 
Rick Campo: Of one of the things I think is interesting about Houston is that when you look at that job to supply ratio, if you just supply that to 2016, Houston should have abysmal, should have negative absorption for apartments because of all of the supply coming on relative jobs. But actually, it had positive absorption and significant positive absorption,15,000, 16,000 units were absorbed on 15,000 jobs.  And so, you look at that and you go, wait, what's going on? And so, what's really happening which is helping Houston absorb is that the supply that's being built, high-rise, 40-story high-rise buildings, downtown high-rise buildings, that product didn't exist in the past. So what you have now is a fair number of people that are selling their homes in the suburbs and moving into the urban core and that is actually helping absorb this supply. I think that's going to continue.  You're still going to have -- if you look at the single-family market, the single-family market has not missed a beat. The market last year sold more homes than they did in 2015. Prices are continuing to go up.  So you have, I think, a certain amount of momentum because we have 6.7 million people here and they're discovering that there are some really interesting, cool product that they can move in today that they didn't have in the past. And that's actually supporting more absorption than you would think. 
Operator: The next question is from Juan Sanabria at Bank of America. 
Juan Sanabria: Just hoping you could speak a little bit to the assumptions for 2017 outside of Houston where you said that was about half of the decline in same-store revenues. Maybe it would be easier if you could talk to some of your larger markets, DC, Dallas, LA, South Florida, what you're expecting on a new lease rate growth for the year. 
Keith Oden: Let me address it based on revenue, so that we're talking apples and apples with our Houston numbers. So in DC this year, we expect the top-line revenue growth to be up about just over 3%, about 3.3%. That's, again, that's a pretty good recovery from three years of less than 1% growth in that market.  So on a ranking basis, DC moved up from last place last year to -- or second to last place last year to eight, nine range. So it's still not in the top half of our portfolio, but at 3.3% that's a pretty good comeback.  In terms of Dallas next year, we've got about a 4% revenue growth that we're anticipating. Again, that's following last year's top-performing market of 7.7%, so a fair amount of moderation that is built into the model in our Dallas numbers.  Southern California which is an aggregation of San Diego orange county and LA, we should be in the -- just below our 4.2%, a little bit of both 4% growth in top-line revenues. And again, that compares to last year's about 5.5%.  So all of these markets, even the ones who were the best performers last year are going to experience some degree of moderation. And that's to be expected given where we're in the cycle and the fact that in every one of these markets, you've got, to one degree or another, we're trying to absorb a bunch of supply.  So 11 of our markets, 11 to 13 markets, if you add them up, they're in the 3% to 5% range top-line revenues. And if you think about where we're in the aggregate for our portfolio, last year, we delivered top-line revenue growth of 3.9%.  This year we've got budgeted at the midpoint, 2.8%, so and that includes Houston at a minus 4. So ex Houston, you're probably at 3.4%, 3.5% versus 3.9% last year and I think that to me feels about right in terms of where we're in our distribution of assets and where we're in the cycle.  Long term average in this business is 3% top-line revenue growth. We're going to be slightly below that at 2.8%, but you definitely have the anomaly of Houston in that number.  And ex that which we get it, we own that and we're going to work our way through the Houston market in 2017. But minus that, you'd be at 3%, 4% and you'd probably be saying, it's a good year which is where we rated it. We rated the portfolio as a B this year. 
Juan Sanabria: Okay, great and then I think you touched on it a little bit in a prior question with regards to Houston and if you see an inflection in the second half. But do you see the same-store growth? How should we think about that over 2017? Is there any acceleration in the second half as maybe some of the supply comes off or how should we think about that? 
Keith Oden: If you think about where we're for 2016, we posted a revenue decline of 1.2%. So you're definitely going to be in a declining mode for the next couple of quarters. I think the wild card is that if we get better job growth in the 25,000 to 30,000 that's currently being projected, I think you have got a shot in the -- late in the 2017 to see an inflection point and things start getting better. But to get to a 4% down revenues, you're going to see some pretty big declines in the first and second quarter. 
Juan Sanabria: And portfolio overall, the second-half trajectory improving potentially as well, given the Houston? 
Keith Oden: It's pretty flat. If you look at it quarter over quarter, I think you could anticipate just modest growth throughout the year and certainly no huge uptick in the fourth quarter. We always have a little bit of a seasonal decline based on occupancy in the fourth quarter, but it's relatively flat from a modeling stand point. 
Operator: The next question is from Alex Goldfarb at Sandler O'Neill. 
Alex Goldfarb: A question for you, just to wrap up on Houston, if you speak to the office side, there's no hope in office recovery for at least the next few years just with all the vacancy, et cetera. Keith, you're writing off this year, but is your view that Houston apartments are down and out for several years or you think it could be shorter than that? 
Rick Campo: Alex, this is Rick. First, the great thing about apartments is that people need a place to live. You can't have a virtual apartment. You have to put your head on a pillow to sleep, may be able to stand in corner, but you need a place to live.  Office, you don't need a place to office. And offices are getting smaller, people are using virtual offices, they're doing it from their home. So that's why we're in the multifamily business and not the office business. But I will let Keith finish the answer to that. 
Keith Oden: So I think that if you look out into 2018, Alex, the supply, the preponderance of the supply issue goes away in 2018. I think right now we're modeling about 6,800 new completions in 2018 which, in a market this size, is not a huge deal. We also think that we're going to end up getting probably around 50,000 to 60,000 jobs depending on whose numbers you're using. I get that's 2018 and that's pretty far out there, but it certainly wouldn't be shocking to see Houston recover, start recovering at a more reasonable pace job.  So if you get 25,000 jobs this year and the economy is go along, get along; Houston gets back into more of a hiring posture, we end up with 50,000 jobs, call it in 2018, with 6,000 apartments, that's -- jobs to completion ratio, that's a really strong number. That's about a 9 and that would put us on our projections right now in our portfolio, Houston would go from being the worst jobs to completion market in 2017 to one of the best.  And so, I think that's the hope certificate is more of a 2018 than it is 2017, just based on my view of what has to happen with the amount of new merchant build units that still have to clear the market. I think it's more of a 2018 story and we'll see how it plays out. 
Alex Goldfarb: Okay and then the second question is, just looking at your portfolio overall, the guidance for occupancy for next year is 94.9% which is essentially where you ended up in the fourth quarter, but down, call it 50 basis points, from where you averaged last year. My recollection is the last downturn, you guys were, I think down in like the 93% range. And you guys had lower occupancy than it seemed you would have wanted, especially versus peers.  And I thought the focus the next go-round was keeping occupancy above 95% just to maintain that higher levels, even if you have to give up on rent. So, are you guys rethinking that or is my recollection wrong or where is occupancy going to go? Are we going to see it go back toward the lower side that we saw last cycle? 
Keith Oden: No, I would be surprised. We target 95% as an occupancy level. Obviously, the last couple of years have been pretty unusual with the incredible strength in some of these markets.  We found ourselves, from a revenue management standpoint, pushing rents like crazy and still having above-trend occupancy levels. 95% is a -- that's our long term target. What's not in those numbers and when you do the math on portfolio-wide occupancy is you have got probably a 200 basis point below the long term average modeled into the Houston numbers, but everything else is modeled at 95% plus, just slightly north of 95%.  These, again, ex-Houston, these markets are still in really good shape and producing 3% to 5% top-line revenue growth which implies that we really don't have any pressure and shouldn't have any pressure on occupancy. 
Operator: The next question is from Rob Stevenson at Janney. 
Rob Stevenson: Keith, can you talk a little bit about the DC market in 2017 and where you're expecting relative strength and where you still may have some pockets of weakness going forward? 
Keith Oden: DC, for the first year in four years looks like it's going to be pretty constructive for us overall. You have the math -- the numbers there are really pretty healthy. You've got in the DC Metro area, we're going to get about 10,000 new apartments.  But right now, the job forecast that we're using for DC Metro is about 78,000 jobs, so you get 10,000 new apartments, 78,000 jobs. And that ratio of 7.5 on jobs to completion is the highest in our portfolio for 2017. Again, we have gone from being -- that math was one of the weaker math jobs to completion ratio in DC for the last couple of years and in 2017, it's got the best jobs completion ratio of any of our 15 markets.  Again, looking for about a 3.3% top-line revenue growth. DC, the DC proper, we continue to see really good strength there. We just opened the doors on our NoMa II and we still see a lot of strength in that sub-market. So expecting some really good success there.  But overall, there really aren't, with the exception of very small pockets where you have got a bunch of new deliveries coming that are competitive with our existing assets, DC Metro's going to be a good market for us in 2017. 
Rob Stevenson: Okay, so College Park and a couple of other problematic assets shouldn't be materially different than the group average this year? 
Keith Oden: No. The College Park was specific to the construction issues and the balcony repairs that we had going on there and that's all behind us. There won't be any impact from the construction balcony issues in 2017 and we're looking for a really strong year. 
Rob Stevenson: Okay and then, how are you guys thinking about development starts today? With -- it's obviously anything that you start today is not going to be completed until late 2018 or probably sometime in 2019, depending on the type of construction.  But, you've got a couple of Charlotte projects in the pipeline. Given your comments and given how low Charlotte is on your ranking scale, are those pushed out to beyond a 2017 start? Or would you start those in 2017 for an 2018, 2019 delivery in some of your other markets that aren't at the top half of your grade range? 
Rick Campo: Just generally on developments, we have slowed the growth of our pipeline. We talked about that over the last couple of calls and that's really a call on just where we're in the cycle and just the uncertainty about what's going forward.  As I said earlier, if we accelerate growth because of new policies and we feel good about that, maybe we could perhaps change that view. Right now though, we're going to do somewhere between $100 million and $300 million of developments.  We definitely have pushed back the development of our downtown project in Houston. We have a couple of small ones in Charlotte that are just add-ons that we'll do. But generally, the development market is a tough market today for everyone.  Most of the large merchant builder national development companies that we talk to every day are all cutting back, primarily because of the lack of construction financing and the difficulty that they're facing there. And cost pressures that most projects are delayed because of not only because of worker shortages; that's driving costs up and returns are harder to get.  So hopefully, maybe we'll have another leg up in the market for development. And the fact that we have -- that we don't finance the way that our competitors do could give us an opportunity to ramp up our development pipeline if we see things happening going forward. 
Keith Oden: And Rob, just to clarify on the two Charlotte projects, those are both townhouse projects that are being built on what essentially were out-parcels to existing assets. And it's a totally different product type than typical multifamily and they're both being done really primarily as defensive plays for the outparcel that is adjacent to our two large assets near downtown in Charlotte. So total development costs on those two projects combined is about $24 million, so we're going to go forward with those. 
Operator: The next question is from Nick Yulico at UBS.
Nick Yulico: I'm not sure if you gave this or not I know you gave a bunch of numbers on the bulk cable benefit. What was in the fourth quarter, what was the benefit to same-store revenue growth? 
Alex Jessett: In the fourth quarter it was very similar to what we had for the full year, but it was approximately 92 basis points to the revenue. 
Nick Yulico: Okay, so the reason why I ask is that if I look at your 2017 same-store revenue guidance, excluding the cable benefit, it's 2.2% at the midpoint. And in the fourth quarter, your same-store revenue growth was 3.1%; minus the bulk cable benefit, it's a similar 2.2%.  It doesn't seem then that you're building in much in the way of deceleration this year versus the fourth quarter which is a little unusual versus some of the other multifamily REITs which have mostly assume some level of deceleration this year versus the fourth quarter. So I'm hoping you could provide some thoughts on that. 
Alex Jessett: I think which you have there is we do -- we certainly have deceleration coming from Houston, but we certainly have acceleration coming from Washington, DC. If you look at once again, to Keith's original comments, the overall ranking for our portfolio is in the B, B+ range. So we're assuming that the rest of our portfolio is maintaining their positions fairly well. Go ahead. 
Keith Oden: The top-line revenue was 3.9% and that obviously had some cable benefit in it. In 2017, that number goes to 2.8%, so you've got 110 basis points of quote, deceleration. We're really essentially through with the rollout of the cable program. There's a very small amount that's left.  So on a year-over-year basis, that's in your 2016 number and then you've got deceleration coming from Houston, but also across the platform to get from the 3.9% to the 2.8%. 
Nick Yulico: Right, okay, so going back to some of the market-level commentary when you talked about certain markets being declining or stabilizing or improving, that was relative to 2016 full-year numbers, not what you saw in the fourth quarter. Is that the way to think about it? 
Keith Oden: Yes. 
Nick Yulico: Because it seems like you had a lot of markets that are still declining, but you're saying that's not versus the fourth quarter, it's more versus full-year 2016. 
Keith Oden: That's correct. And just to do the math for you, we have five that we listed as declining and we one that was listed as improving which is DC and then the balance were stable. 
Nick Yulico: Okay, so just going back to how you're thinking about guidance, you do feel like there's enough conservatism built in versus what you actually achieved in the fourth quarter. Or it sounds like growth, you're thinking is still going to be similar to the fourth quarter this year. I'm trying to figure out how much conservatism then is built into guidance this year. 
Rick Campo: When we provide guidance, we provide guidance based on what our middle-of-the-road expectation is; we don't try to build in over-conservatism over optimism. And if you look at last year as a guide, we raised our guidance twice, but only because the markets outperformed what we thought they would do.  So we try to give basically what we think is going to happen. Obviously, the world changes in front of us and you have about 60 to 90 days of visibility in this market. So if you add 3 million jobs this year, we're going to beat our guidance. If you add 2 million, we're probably right in the middle of the fairway from our guidance, but it's all predicated upon a basic set of assumptions that are in place. So we don't try to be conservative or aggressive on guidance. 
Operator: The next question is from Richard Anderson at Mizuho. 
Richard Anderson: For a lot of your peers, there was some whimsical commentary on 2018 and I know we're talking a lot about Houston. But could you -- would you be able to make some noncommittal comment that you think 2018 sets up to be a better year than 2017 when you look at the portfolio as a whole? 
Keith Oden: Rich, I don't do whimsical. I will let Rick answer it. 
Rick Campo: Well, I can be whimsical from time to time. But if you look at just the supply and demand scenario, right, so we still have 2 million people that are doubled up in either roommate situations or living with their parents and they don't want to do that. So if you have a decent job growth, more household formation, multifamily sets up really well. Two thirds of the demand or two-thirds of household formation has been going to multifamily, primarily because of millennials. You look at over 50% of the job growth are going to people 34 and younger.  So our business is set up to be really in a decent position, ex a recession or something like that. And when you look at the supply side with most merchant builders cutting their pipelines, cutting their pipelines in 2017, including us, then you can set up for a pretty interesting 2018 and 2019 for the multifamily business generally and I think that's probably where the whimsical view comes from people. 
Richard Anderson: Okay, good. I don't know why I used that word, but. And then the second follow-up question is and I don't know why, maybe I shouldn't be surprised to see Austin so far down the list. Is that one taking you a little bit by surprise by how weak it appears, relatively speaking? Or is that in the range of expectations when you were going into looking at this year? 
Keith Oden: Two things, Rich. One is what has taken me by surprise is the last two years in Austin, where you had really not constructive jobs to completions ratios in either of those years and yet we continued to -- our portfolio continued to put up big numbers. We did 5.5% top-line revenue growth last year I think this year we're just over 3%.  Again, you're looking at 20,000 jobs in Austin and 10,000 new apartments; that's a whopping 1.9 jobs to completions ratio which puts it in last place in our portfolio. So I've been surprised and part of it has been that even with the reported jobs numbers, it sure feels like there are a lot more people that are relocating to Austin that find a way into the job force that may be undercounted.  The only way I can look at Austin over the last couple of years, given the reported job growth versus the number of completions and absorptions is that there's a different category of folks that show up in Austin, Texas and find their way into the tech community and find jobs and pay rent in ways that may not be conventional.  But I have been surprised at the strength the last two years. I think we've done a good job this year of trying to anticipate where and when that oversupply condition starts to show up. And at 3.3% top-line revenue growth, I hope we got it right this year. 
Operator: The next question is from John Pawlowski at Green Street Advisors. 
John Pawlowski: Keith, what new lease and renewal growth trends underpinned the 2.8% at the midpoint of 2017 revenue guidance? 
Keith Oden: So we're right now running -- I think I gave you the numbers for the first, for January at down 1.6% on new leases, up 5% on renewals. I think if you look out across our portfolio, 1% growth on revenues, 5% on renewals, seems about right at a 60% renewal rate; that gets you to about the 2% or 2.8% top-line revenue growth. So I think that's in the ballpark. 
John Pawlowski: Keith, you alluded to your $170 million downtown Houston development that you pushed out. What is the current game plan on when shovels are going into the ground there? 
Rick Campo: It's just a waiting game. Houston is a great city long term and there's about 3,000 apartments that have been built in downtown Houston and it's creating a major buzz. Houston didn't have much of a downtown market up until the last couple of years and so those projects are filling up. They're definitely filling up at lower rents than the original developers had anticipated.  But once those are filled, then when you think about the size of the city, 3,000 units is a drop in the bucket when you think about the fourth-largest city in America. So we're going to watch it. We're going to built them, build that building at some point.  I think the $170 million was two buildings not one, so it's more like a $90 million building, plus or minus. We may get an opportunity where, if you think about what's been happening in the construction cost side of the equation here, construction costs continue to rise in Houston.  Projects, I think one of the reasons that we have so much project buildings coming on right now is that every project that I know of is delayed at least six months because there's not enough construction workers to finish them. That is still the case in Houston, Texas.  So, perhaps with the 50% or 60% drop in starts that we've seen here and the fact that no one is going to be building office buildings anytime soon here either, with the exception of there is a big deal that was done in downtown with Bank of America, that looks like it's going to start.  But with that said, hopefully construction costs moderate and there might be a window of opportunity for us to start that building with a lower construction process and deliver it sometime in 2020 or 20201 and we will do that if that's the case. But we'll watch it. We're not compelled to do anything in this market until we start seeing some moderation in prices on the construction side. 
John Pawlowski: Any sense of what you could sell that land for today? 
Rick Campo: I could sell the land for a lot more than what we paid for it. We got in the land at a really good price and land prices in Houston have not done anything but either stay flat or gone up.  There have been a number of trades, for example, Chevron's selling one of their campuses because they consolidated people in downtown. And there are probably 10 bids on that campus at very, very high prices.  People thought they would be able to come down here and buy cheap everything and there's just nothing cheap here. Now you could buy 1970s vintage office buildings for cheap here, but the challenge with those is they're 1970s vintage office buildings in probably poor locations and they ought to be cheap. 
Operator: The next question is from Wes Golladay at RBC Capital Markets. 
Wes Golladay: Assuming Houston does get to the equilibrium stage, how do you see revenue growth progressing? Will you have to work through a gain to lease after that? 
Keith Oden: I think that as we mentioned earlier, we think the declines will be worse in first and second quarter and then there will hopefully be some moderation in that decline. But we ended the year at 1% down; our guidance is -- our budget is 4% down for the year. So we know we're going to see first and second quarter with pretty big down numbers.  Depending on whether is it a fourth quarter back in 2017 or is it more of a 2018 phenomenon where you once again hit an inflection point and turn positive, then that -- the loss to lease numbers will move around based on that. But I don't see -- I still see declines at least through the second or third quarter of this year in terms of net effective rent.  So that implies that at some point, if there's an inflection point beyond that, then you'll get back to a gain to lease scenario. But we clearly are going to be rolling down the curb for the next couple of quarters. 
Wes Golladay: Okay and then, can I get a quick update on what you guys are hearing from the energy executives in Houston? Are they looking to just maintain their current employment base or any thought process of hiring? We're seeing the Dallas fed base book indicates sublet space in Houston was declining for the first time in years. I didn't know if you were seeing anything positive on the employment front. 
Rick Campo: Most of the energy executives that we talk to and we talk to a lot of them, especially this last weekend, they are cautiously optimistic. Obviously 50 and above oil prices is good for them.  Every rig that you see that goes up is 200 jobs and most of those jobs, just like the jobs that were lost, they were lost at the actual rig and then flowed back into the system. So most of those jobs that are being added, are being added in -- at the rig area.  So I would say that some of the big oil have commented that they do this every time you have a big oil bust which is they lay off more than they should. Then they have to compete for talent to get -- to ramp it back up when oil prices go up and I think there's a fair amount of that going on.  We haven't seen a massive increase in hiring at this point in energy, but we have seen -- where we've stopped the losses. And when you think about the 15,000 jobs plus or minus -- or 20,000 that were added last year, energy actually lost jobs to the tune of 10,000 or 15,000, but we offset that with major growth in other areas.  So as long as we don't have job losses, we actually will have from the energy sector, we will have positive job growth from the others. So I think everybody here is very cautiously optimistic that the bottom has been made and they are going to be moving up from here. 
Wes Golladay: What is your Houston job forecast for the year? 
Rick Campo: I think the jobs are anywhere from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs for the year. 
Operator: The next question is from Vincent Chao at Deutsche Bank. 
Vincent Chao: Just sticking with Houston here for a second, earlier you had talked about some conditions that could occur that would -- short of seeing stabilization in Houston from a job creation versus unit count. I was just curious, if that did happen, how quickly would you be able to go from say, a minus 4% same-store rev to something more normal?  Is there is seasoning period where folks have to get readjusted to price increases? Or if the job outlook does improve and the units do stay low, do you see an immediate jump in the same-store rev would you say? 
Rick Campo: We have seen markets like this to decline and given that this is not a recession scenario, it's really a supply issue and with moderate job growth. The merchant builders have issue with pricing, right, because they were giving three months free rent which is really 25% off of where their price is.  We're not giving those kinds of concessions, so if our revenue goes down 4% this year, there's not a seasoning affect that you need. You don't need to increase your rent 25% to get back to a strong growth. And given that our -- so I think you can have depending upon and this gets to the ultimate issue of tell me what the economy is going to do in 2017 and 2018.  If you add 3 million jobs, you add, instead of 30,000 in Houston, you add 50,000 and next year, you add 60,000 or 70,000, you could have a very robust increase in revenue Houston in 2018. But again, it's tell me how many jobs and how the economy is overall nationally, because Houston will drop nationally. We won't have the energy drag that we had before probably and so when you think about, we don't have to make up that big gap that merchant builders do. 
Keith Oden: Just to go back to one of the instances that I cited, we were down 4% in revenues in Houston in 2010. 2011, we were up 5% and 2012 we were up 10%. It when down 4%, up 5%, up 10%. 
Vincent Chao: And then just another bigger picture question. Earlier you talked about buyers and sellers and the spread being wider, part of which was uncertainty about the direction of the economy and policy changes, some of which are seen as positive and others are seen as maybe more negative. From your perspective, as you think about all of the policy that is being considered today, what do you see as the biggest negative for your industry, for your Company? 
Rick Campo: I think the biggest negative is uncertainty and it's just the uncertainty that, A, the policies will be implemented. And then, B, that they won't be offset by some factor that no one is thinking about today that is caused by an administration that tweets in the middle of the night. 
Vincent Chao: Right, so none of the policies per se, I'm thinking tax reforms, some of the GSE privatization, those things are not that concerning to you? 
Rick Campo: I think that all of the policy growth -- if the policy growth initiatives that have been laid out are implemented, it's great for our business. There's nothing bad on the horizon for our business. The bad thing would be, if it doesn't get impacted or implemented and if there is something that causes the economy to go off the edge.  And when you think about a recession, recessions aren't caused by time. So we've been in -- this recovery is the second longest recovery in my business career, third longest recovery since the Great Depression.  A lot of people think that time creates the recession, but it's really not that; it's something that happens that no one expects. A housing bubble in 2007 and 2008. We expected a boom, all the sudden, we have a big recession.  So to me, the real risk is not having a good feeling about what the future is going to be. And clearly, the stock market has rallied big time, believing that things are going to be good. But it's that unknown, not knowing what might happen that's, I think, keeping us at bay a bit in terms of how we feel about the world. We just have to see more cards played. Show me what is going to happen and are they really going to do something that is a positive overall? 
Operator: The next question is from Tom Lesnick at Capital One. 
Tom Lesnick: I will be brief since we're running pretty long into the call here. But on the subject of policies, with regards to immigration, have you guys looked at the sensitivity of some of your larger markets, like LA or Houston, to potential changes in the immigration policy? 
Rick Campo: We have, immigration definitely has a positive effect on household formation, generally and there's a certain immigrant population that comes in and rents apartments. I think immigration's a smaller part of the equation than the overall economy. If you have -- so I don't think that a close the borders and never let another person in policy is going to have a major effect in the short term for apartments.  I think the bigger issue that policy will have is wage pressure and the ability to find qualified workers. When you look at the jobs out there today, I think there's 5.5 million jobs that are unfilled today and those are unfilled because we don't have quality workers to fill them.  A lot of folks believe that immigrations have driven the wages down. The challenge we have is that we just don't have qualified workers that live here. When you think about the medical center in Houston, for example, has about 10,000 to 15,000 jobs always available and they can't fill them because they don't have qualified people to fill them.  And so, to me the issue and I think it's more a tech issue, is you can see the tech folks in California and in Austin are worried about the ability to bring in people that have the qualifications for their businesses. So I think it's more of a business issue than it is an apartment issue. 
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Donnelley at Wells Fargo. 
Jeff Donnelly: Rick, circling back to the proposed tax policy changes, such as deductibility of interest or the elimination of the 1031, I know it's all to be determined if they could implemented. I'm curious, if those do come to pass, do you think those might put REITs in a relatively better position, vis-a-vis, say a privately held owner or a builder who tends to use higher leverage. I'm just curious how you think about those dynamics. 
Rick Campo: I do, I think that those, particularly the interest deductibility issue and the 1031 exchanges puts us in -- and I think you missed one that's even bigger which is the carried interest. Because today, carried interest is huge and the carried interest for a merchant builder, for example, when you think about the cost of capital, cost of capital drives everything an investment decision that people make.  Now, our cost of capital is not change dramatically because we don't have a lot of debt and we don't use carried interest, so our taxes aren't going to go up. Ultimately, when you think about it from a competitive perspective, our competitors that are privately funded that use more debt are -- and if interest doesn't -- if interest isn't detectable and therefore, you're not subsidizing our competitor which is what they're doing today.  Our competitors definitely have a lower cost of capital because the use 70% debt, 30% equity. And we're the flip; we've got 25% debt and 75% equity or something like that. So I think it could be very beneficial to REITs when your competitors' cost of capital goes up. 
Jeff Donnelly: And then just one last one actually maybe for Keith. Beyond Houston, where do you see positive or negative inflection points in your markets as we roll into late 2017 and 2018? I know some, you mentioned have a declining outlook. I'm just curious where you see changes coming ahead. 
Keith Oden: I think the markets that we have as declining are the ones that we're likely to see. We're definitely at an inflection point or we'll see one in 2017 and those would be Denver, Dallas, Tampa, Austin and obviously Houston.  Every one of those is primarily a supply issue. Decent job growth, with the exception of Houston, but the other four markets that are declining, it's purely a function of you've got too many apartments that are in the market right now that have to clear. Once that happens in 2017, I think all four of those markets just because if you look at the pipeline that's coming behind that in 2018, it's going to be down across the board.  So it's not likely -- it's declining because of a point in time where supply has got to clear the market. Once that happens, I think all four of those markets would be set up for a decent year and a recovery in 2018. 
Jeff Donnelly: Do you think, my question is do think in 2018 you're going to have more markets set up that way that there's going to have an inflection to the positive once we get through 2017? 
Keith Oden: Well, I would hope that we would have more than one improving market in 2018 which is what we have for 2017. I would expect that we would. 
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Campo for closing remarks. 
Rick Campo: We appreciate you all being on the call today and look forward to visiting with you in the future. Thank you so much. 
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. Good morning and welcome to Camden’s Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today’s event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma’am, please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today’s call represent management’s current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden’s complete third quarter 2016 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on the call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Since there are two more multifamily calls scheduled this afternoon, we will be brief in our prepared remarks and try to complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard Campo: Thanks, Kim. Today’s pre-call music by Maroon 5 was chosen by with the help of Neil Malkin from RBC Capital. You may recall that Neil was the winner of a Camden trivia contest for – from one of our prior quarterly calls. The selection of Maroon 5 by Neil’s is a reminder that that musical preferences are largely generational. At Camden, we have a large number of awesome Texas A&M graduates, including Malcolm Stewart and Michael Gallagher, and they thought about this long and hard the school colors of A&M happened to be in maroon and white. When I told Malcolm and Michael that we are having Maroon 5 on today’s call, they looked at me confused and asked why would we want to have the Texas A&M basketball team on our conference call. You can’t make this stuff up. Our operating results for the third quarter and the year have been in line with our business plans. Our teams did very well managing operating expenses during the quarter and we realized savings in several areas, including property taxes, and Alex will give you more detail on that later in the call. We completed our 2016 disposition program in September and have no properties in the market today. Our capital recycling program has increased the quality of our properties and future revenue growth prospects through the sale of nearly $3 billion in properties, that represent nearly 40% of our portfolio, these properties were – had an average age of 25 years old. This was accomplished with very little dilution as a result of the historically narrow cap rate spreads between older properties and newer acquisitions. We have been a net seller for the last three years. And we continued to believe that capital recycling has really transformed Camden’s portfolio and positions us very well for the future. We made significant progress on our development pipeline during the quarter and have fully funded the remaining cost to complete as a result of our dispositions. I want to thank our Camden teams at the properties and our support offices for their great work this quarter and for their commitment to improving the lives of our customers one experience at a time. I’ll turn the call over to Keith. Thanks.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. We’re very pleased with our results for the quarter. Overall conditions remain above trend. And for the second straight quarter, sequential revenue growth was 1.6% with all markets positive for the quarter. From an operations perspective, we’re particularly pleased that all of the planned $1.2 billion in dispositions were completed by the end of the third quarter. Transaction volumes of that magnitude can be a big distraction to our onsite teams. But I’m very pleased with the outstanding job of our real estate investment and operating teams did in managing this effort. A few highlights from our same-store results. The third quarter revenue growth was 3.7%. The top 11 of our 14 markets averaged 5.8% revenue growth, led by Orlando at 7.4%, Dallas 7.2%, and both Tampa and San Diego at 7.1% growth. As expected, our three weakest markets combined contributed just slightly positive revenue growth for the quarter of 0.2% with Houston down 1.1%, D.C. up 1%, and Charlotte up 2.1%. All three markets are facing an increase in supply with the – with only D.C. creating sufficient employment growth to absorb the new construction deliveries. Camden’s D.C. revenue growth improved for the quarter, but is still being impacted by construction at one of our Maryland communities, which comprises 9% of our same-store D.C. revenues. Excluding that community, D.C. revenue growth would have been 50 basis points higher at 1.5% growth for the quarter and 1.0% flat year-to-date. Charlotte revenues rose 1.7% sequentially, despite continued pressure from new lease ups. Regarding Houston, revenue growth was negative again in the third quarter, down by 1.1%. We do expect further weakening in Houston in the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we projected Houston full-year revenues to be flat to down 1%. And based on our reforecast for the fourth quarter, we believe revenues will be at the low-end of that range. The 0.1% decline in our same-store revenue guidance for the full-year from 4.1% to 4.0% is almost entirely attributable to a weaker outlook for Houston. The most recent data we have indicates a total of 23,000 apartments to be delivered this year, with the majority of that coming in the third and fourth quarter. With employment growth this year projected to be in the 10,000 to 20,000 range for the year, deliveries will add significant pressure on occupancy and rental rates. 99% of the 23,000 completions in 2016 are coming from merchant builders, who have a very different capital structure and strategy, as to how they respond to disruptive market conditions. Let’s just say that patience is not among the virtues of merchant builders. In recent weeks, many lease up communities in Houston have moved from two months free rent to three months free rent, as they compete for an increase – for increasingly limited traffic. So the behavior of merchant builders is somewhat akin to a herd of wildebeest. Things look pretty calm in the herd until one wildebeest gets spooked, which causes a massive stampede. It seems as though that herd got spooked at some point in the last 30 days, and as everyone knows, it’s very hard to unspook the herd. Fortunately, we’ve been to this movie a few times over the last 30 years, and we’ve positioned ourselves well to minimize the damage. Longer lease terms and more aggressive renewal and retention efforts instituted last year had certainly helped. We believe, 2017 is going to be another tough year for Houston, as job growth remains weak and another 10,000 merchant built apartments are delivered. We are in the process of putting together our 2017 forecast, which we look forward to sharing you with – sharing with you on our next call. A few observations on our operating stats for the quarter. In the third quarter, new leases were up 2.3%, with renewals up 5.6% for an average increase of 3.7%, roughly 100 basis points below third quarter 2015 results. October new leases are trending up basically flat, up 0.1%, renewals are up 4.8%. November and December renewal offers are being sent out at about a 5.5% increase, and our portfolio-wide occupancy rates have remained strong at 95.8% in the third quarter, up from 95.5% last quarter. Net turnover rates for the third quarter were 57%, down 700 basis points from last year’s 64%. Move outs purchase homes were actually down to 14.7% versus 59% last quarter, while the year-to-date rate was 15%, up slightly from 14.3% in two 2015. Finally, I want to acknowledge our onsite teams for their excellent performance through three quarters. We’re on track to have another strong year of outperformance relative to our regional budgets, keep up the good work, and let’s finish strong in the fourth quarter. I’ll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, our Chief Financial Officer.
Alex Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move to our financial results, I’ll provide a brief update on our real estate activities. In the third quarter, we completed $484 million of property sales, successfully completing our 2016 disposition activities. These final third quarter sales bring our total disposition volume for the year to nearly $1.2 billion. The average age of the full-year dispositions was 23 years, and they were disposed of it at an average AFFO yield of 5.1%, based on trailing 12-month NOI and actual CapEx, equating to a nominal NOI cap rate, which excludes management fees in CapEx of 6.1%. The unleveraged internal rate of return for 2016 dispositions was 11%, with an average hold period of 17 years. Approximately, $200 million of our third quarter dispositions were completed later in the quarter than it originally anticipated, contributing to our third quarter positive FFO variance, which I’ll discuss later. Additionally, in the third quarter, as a result of our disposition activities, we paid a special dividend of $4.25 per share. On the development front, during the third quarter, we stabilized Camden Glendale in Southern California, completed construction at Camden Victory Park in Dallas, and began construction on Camden Washingtonian in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Additionally, we purchased 2.4 acres of land in Denver for future development. Our balance sheet remains very strong with debt to EBITDA of 4.2 times, a fixed charge expense coverage ratio of 5.3 times, secured debt to gross real estate assets of 12%, 74% of our assets unencumbered, and 93% of our debt at fixed rates. We ended the quarter with no balances outstanding on our unsecured line of credit. $414 million of cash and short-term investments on hand and no debt maturity until May of 2017. During the third quarter, the strengths of our balance sheet was recognized by one of the rating agencies as Fitch upgrade our senior unsecured debt rating to A-. We do not anticipate prepaying any portion of our current debt, given the high penalties that would be incurred. Instead, we plan to use our cash balances and future sales proceeds if any to fund our development pipeline. Our current $820 million development pipeline has approximately $213 million remain to be spent over the next two years. And we’re projecting another $100 dollars of developments to begin construction later this year. And finally, before I move on to our operating results, a brief update on property taxes. The majority of our assessments and rates are now in, and we have settled the majority of our prior year appeals. Almost uniformly, rates and assessments were positive to our forecast and we had great success with our prior year appeals. As a result, we now anticipate our full-year 2016 property tax expense will be up 3%, as compared to our original budget of 6% for our savings of approximately $3 million. Moving on to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2016 of $104 million, or $1.13 per share. These results were $0.04 per share better than a $1.09 midpoint of our prior guidance range. The components of this $0.04 per share outperformance are approximately $0.01 per share, resulting from previously mentioned later than anticipated sales date on approximately $200 million of our third quarter dispositions. Approximately, $0.005 per share in lower same-store property tax expense, resulting from a combination of lower rates in assessments and higher property tax refunds from prior years. Approximately, $0.005 per share in lower non same-store property tax expense resulting from a prior year property tax refund in Washington D.C. Approximately, $0.01 per share in lower other property expenses, driven primarily by lower personnel and unit turnover costs. Net turnover for the third quarter of 2016 was 700 basis points below the same period last year, and approximately $0.01 per share from a combination of other miscellaneous income items. Our new Camden technology package with Internet service is rolling out as scheduled and for the third quarter contributed approximately 95 basis points to our same-store revenue growth, 175 basis points to our expense growth, and 50 basis points to our NOI growth in line with expectations. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of a $1.12 to $1.16. The midpoint of $1.14 represents a $0.01 per share increase from the third quarter of 2016. This $0.01 per share increase is primarily the result of the following. A $0.025 per share increase in FFO due to growth in property net operating income comprised of; a $0.04 per share increase resulting from an approximate 3% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, driven primarily by our normal third to fourth quarter seasonal decline in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover and personal expenses, and the timing of certain property tax refunds. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate approximately $2.5 million of prior year property tax refunds resulting from our successful property tax appeals. A $0.01 per share increase resulting from the NOI contribution of our five developments in lease up during the quarter, a $0.015 per share increase, resulting from the normal third to fourth quarter seasonal increase in revenues from our Camden Miramar student housing community, and a $0.04 per share decrease due to the loss NOI from our $484 million of dispositions completed in the third quarter. This $0.025 per share net increase in FFO will be partially offset by a $0.015 per share decrease in FFO, as a result of lower fourth quarter non-property income and higher corporate overhead costs. Based on our year-to-date operating performance, we have revised and tightened our 2016 full-year revenue, expense and NOI guidance. We now anticipate full-year 2016 same-store revenue growth to be between 3.9% and 4.1%, expense growth to be between 2.3% and 2.5% and NOI growth to be between 4.8% and 5%. The new midpoints represented 10 basis point reduction for revenue, a 135 basis point improvement in expenses, driven primarily by lower property taxes, unit turnover costs, salaries and utilities, and a 65 basis point improvement in net operating income. We’ve also revised our full-year 2016 FFO per share outlook. We now anticipate 2016 FFO per share to be in the range of $4.61 to $4.65 versus our prior range of $4.50 to $4.60, representing an $0.08 per share increase in the midpoint. Our revised full-year 2016 FFO guidance assumes no acquisitions or dispositions in the fourth quarter. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we’ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the color on Houston. For the merchant built product in lease up, what percentage of the units do you think have been leased? And then what do you see in Houston transaction market in terms of any product coming to market in any movement in cap rates?
Richard Campo: So on the merchant build, it’s really difficult to pin down that number, because some of them are still in lease up from the prior year. A lot of the deliveries for 2016 ended up getting delayed beyond what they originally projected. If I had to pick a number, I would say, of the 23,000 apartments delivered this year since, a big percentage of those would be delivered in the third and fourth quarter. On average, you’re probably 25% to 30% leased in that – of that group. You do still have some that would have carried over from being 2015 – late 2015 deliveries that are later in their lease ups. It’s kind of hard to get a handle on it, because they’re – the – that – we don’t really have great reporting about actual percentages on – percentages leased. They’re pretty secretive about that information. But what we do have, I’m guessing, it’s 25% to 30% of that group. On cap rates, there haven’t been a lot of trades. There have been some and the cap rates generally have been around 5. So we have not seen if that sort of question is about where have cap rates risen and where the trades doing on – doing today? They really haven’t risen, per se, but there hasn’t been a lot of transaction volume. There’s some value-add that’s happened that’s pretty much in line with what the cap rates were in the past. I will tell you though that there are some new developments that are in the market that have finished leasing up, or are trying to lease up. And the interesting thing about those cap rates is, I think those cap rates have actually compressed. And you might think that’s counterintuitive for this part of the cycle. But what’s happening is, people are looking at the real estate saying, gee, what’s the cap rate today and what is the cost associated with that real estate in a very tough environment when you’re in a lease up environment? And so what’s happening is, people are looking more at what is replacement cost and what is the premium to replacement cost they’re paying and we’ve seen some cap rates on deals that have just gone to contract in the 4 – in the very low 4s. But when you look at them from a pure cost to replace perspective, people are going to start thinking more about that than they are about cap rates. And then the question is, when you think about their underwriting is what’s probably changed and that when they try to get a, say, a 6, or a 6.5% unlevered IRR, the growth rate for their – the next couple of years is going to be either negative or low. And then they expect a recovery to try to get back to their unlevered IRR. But I think trades are going to be more based on replacement costs than they are going to be based on cap rates and that’s generally what happens in markets, where you have dislocation of supply.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then, I guess, with the tech package you mentioned the 95 basis points benefit to same-store revenue growth in the quarter. When does that benefit disappear? And then is there any benefit to 2017 from that program?
Alex Jessett: Yes. So the full-year guidance that we gave for revenue from the tech package is 100 basis points. So when you think about, they are basically what we’ve have been running each quarter this year, and so the fourth quarter should be no different. And then, if you sort of continue to think about the ramp above it, we’re just over about 35,000 units signed up today. We’re getting about 5,000 units done at quarter, and we will get almost our entire portfolio signed up by the time it’s over. So we should continue to have some incremental positive impact going into 2017.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then last question on the cable portion of the tech package, is there any risk to Camden, or a potential risk to Camden from people cord-cutting, if you guys guarantee a certain number of units will subscribe, are there any other corporate guarantees or risks to that program?
Richard Campo: No, not really, because we have the ability at various points to unbundle with our providers. So we have belt and suspenders around our contractual agreements with the underlying, with the cable providers. Now on the flip side of that is, the question is, what about people who maybe want – they intend to be cord cutters. They have a bundled technology package with cable. And the reality is that the prop – the value proposition for our residence for high-speed Internet at 100 megabits per second, which is stellar, the value proposition for the high-speed Internet alone for most of our residents is enough for them to say, this is a good deal for me. And then in addition to that, they obviously get the cable, and it’s always on. You don’t have to deal with the installation and all the other things. So, I mean, I can’t tell you that out of 100,000 residents that we don’t have a couple a handfuls that when we roll the program out, say, I cut the cord, and I don’t want – I don’t need or want high-speed Internet and the bundling bothers me. But I can tell you that the overwhelming majority and I’m talking about 97% of our residents are – look forward to and sign up in advance of their lease rolling over when it’s offered at their community. So, yes, there’s probably some of the margin we missed, but the 97% that sign up and love the program, the rest of it is just background noise.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, it’s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just sticking on the tech package piece, you mentioned that you’ll continue to have the benefit in the 2017, as you continue to roll that out. But I was just curious if there’s any additional upside from call it, like a round 2 of increases on the initial that have already been rolled out?
Richard Campo: So we have the ability to increase rates kind of at a market level within our contract. We’re not tied to any particular rate with the underlying providers. So our strategy on that will probably be to mirror the increases of the underlying cable providers. Fortunately, for our – in our case, we signed – we got fixed rate agreements in some cases five, in some cases seven years. So we don’t have much risk on the underlying cost increasing. But as the retail value of the package increases and we’re already at a pretty significant discount to the retail value of the package, we obviously have the ability to continue to move cable rates up.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks for that. And then you guys have previously talked about the land bank kind of winding down around 2018. Any additional markets you’re looking at to add land backfill for future development starts?
Richard Campo: Well, we have enough land to take us through sort of 2018. And then we – in our plan, we have land being acquired to be able to continue the development pipeline at sort of the $200 million to $300 million a year range, assuming the market conditions allow for that. And we will be looking for new land to be able to put in the pipeline over the next year or so. We still love the markets we’re in. I would say, we probably err towards – we have some pipeline in Florida and California. And ultimately, we just acquired a project in Denver. So we look at all of our markets. We take a hard look at what the macro in the mid-term sort of view is and are looking in all the markets we’re active in today.
Austin Wurschmidt: And as you think about continuing to prefund new development starts, what do you view as your most attractive source of capital? I mean, could we continue to see you guys opportunistically sell assets?
Richard Campo: Absolutely. When you look at the spread, so our average AFFO, the spread between our AFFO rate on dispositions and acquisitions is about 27 basis points on this last book of business. And when you look at the spread between older asset and the new development, it’s a much, much wider gap obviously. And so the challenge we have, however, is that we are limited by the amount of sales we can do, because we sort of maxed out our taxable income issue with respect to paying futures – future special dividends. So there’s a limit on the ability to fund – to sell assets to fund development. But fundamentally, we think it’s a great trade. Obviously, you have short-term dilution when you do, because you’re putting cash on the balance sheet and giving up the cash flow. But when you look at the massive spread that you get between the old versus the new and the ability to create more value in your portfolio from an ongoing growth perspective, it makes a lot of sense too.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from CPT. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Just wanted to ask about your comments on Houston in the 23,000 units of supply this year, 10,000 next year. What you’re seeing in the job market today, kind of, what demand does that translate into units of absorption, so kind of think about versus that supply pipelines you talked to?
Keith Oden: So we’re currently using about a 10,000 to 20,000 job gain this year. And the math that we’ve always used is five new incremental jobs that get created creates one net market rate multifamily demand. So with 20,000 jobs at the top end of the range, you could absorb 4,000 apartments, and we’ve got 23,000. So therein lies the problem for, and the problem is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is primarily a merchant builds problem, because they are – they got – when they began to lease up, they begin at 0% occupied. And we are just in a very different situation vis-à-vis that competition, because we start at 95% occupied and we have to play defense. And we’ve been playing defense for the better part over the last year-and-a-half. So it’s baked in that 2000 – unless something dramatic happens in 2016, we’re going to have way too many apartments and not enough jobs to absorb them. If you look out into 2017, again, most estimates have job growth next year, and we’re using an average of the three providers and it gets to about 35,000 jobs. So in that math, you should be able to absorb 7,000 apartments. The problem is, we got another 10,000 coming next year and there’s no – that that’s pretty much baked in the cake as well. So you’ve got – you’re going to have an overhang of apartments this year from 2016. You’re going to make it a little bit worse than 2017, but getting closer to an equilibrium. And so the disruption that has to happen is the finding the market clearing price for probably what ends up being 18,000 apartments that we don’t have natural demand for in job growth.
Richard Campo: You do have some natural demand that’s coming from sort of the urbanization of Houston, where you have properties that have been built that didn’t exist before high-rises larger units in some of the prime locations, including downtown and the Galleria. There’s a fair amount of sort of the baby boomers moving from this the burbs into the urban poor and that densification that’s going on, but it clearly is not enough to fill that gap that Keith described. I think the interesting part of that is, the good news is, we know pricing has already come down, the two to three months free in some of the toughest markets. And what that does is the great thing about apartments is that, price elasticity is great. The lower the price, the higher the demand for the product. And so what’s going to happen is, you’ll have some acceleration of the urbanization that’s going on, especially in the downtown area. You have these 40 story brand new buildings with infinity pools on the 40th floor offering three months free today. And what that allows is the, when you start getting the pricing down to more affordable level for the millennial, they’re going to move into those properties, and they couldn’t afford them to start with when they originally had performance say at 3 – $2.75 to $3 square foot rent. So on the one hand that demand will be increased by virtue of the price elasticity for apartments. And ultimately, as they fill up after we should see a significant drop in the completions in 2018 and 2019. And if energy prices hold at $50 or higher, the energy companies are basically done laying people off and could actually start to ramp up in 2017, 2018 and 2019. And – but 2017 definitely is not going to be a year that that is going to be a seller’s year for Houston, it’s going to definitely be much more difficult than 2016. But I look forward to 2018, 2019 and creating some serious value then.
Unidentified Analyst: And just on your response to the increased and concessions took three months from developers, what you guys do for your existing product to keep that occupancy?
Richard Campo: Well, we’ve had to – yes, we’ve had to get more aggressive obviously on our new rental rates. I mean you’ve got to do two things. You have to close the back door. So that means focus like crazy on retention renewals, which we’ve done and by the way we started that process in the middle of last year. I mean, this has been known and knowable for us anyway for, at least, 18 months. So, first of all, you’ve got to play great defense and we’ve done that. We’ve been very aggressive on lengthening lease terms, so that we can get them beyond what we think the maximum period of stress is, and then we’ve worked on retention. So – but that doesn’t for the people that are new and the people that are shopping, you’re going to have to adjust your pricing, which we have already done that. In the last two months, our new lease rates that we’ve signed on average in Houston are down 5% to 6%. And if you roll that forward into the fourth quarter, we’re probably looking at something closer to down 7% to 8%, so that equates to one month free. Now, we don’t do month –we don’t do free rent and – because it’s all yields to our pricing, it’s just not effective rent pricing. But on an apples-to-apples basis, the new developers by and large are in the two to three-month range. And stabilized operators like Camden have adjusted their pricing to basically down a month from what it was a year ago. So you don’t have to meet their pricing, because they have a – again, they have a very different task ahead of them than we have. They’ve got to get from o% occupied to 95% occupied and we sort of just have to hold serve at 95%. And the way we – so if you think about the math at a Camden community and the reason our pricing doesn’t adjust and doesn’t have to adjust to what the merchant builders are doing. So take it a typical 300 apartment – 300 home community in Houston, we’re going to renew about 60% of those residents. So we know that from history and that’s what we’ve been doing for the last year. So that’s a 180 of them. So that means, you’ve got a 120, you’re going to have to sign a 120 new leases over the course of 12 months. That’s 10 leases per month. So what we talk to our onsite staff about is quit worrying about all the noise about two and three months and go find, you have a month, every month to find 10 people who want to live in an awesome location with the best management team in the city of Houston. So you just got to find 10 of them, and that’s what their mission is every month. So very different than what the merchant builder guys are facing and we’re – that’s what we’re focused on.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
Richard Hightower: Hey, good afternoon, everyone.
Richard Campo: Hey, Rich.
Richard Hightower: So, I appreciate all the good color on Houston with respect to supply and everything else. My question here is, could you kind of walk us through the cadence of supply deliveries, not only in Houston, but maybe for the top three or four markets in your portfolio next year, just across and yes…
Richard Campo: Yes. So on Houston, we know we’ve got 23,000. They’re going to be delivered this year. It’s going to be back-end weighted. And my guess is that 15,000 of those are coming in the second-half of the year, probably got 8,000 plus or minus in the first-half of the year. So the lease ups will roll over into next year. But in terms of new completions next year, we should get 10,000 plus or minus. My guess is that, if there’s delivery say, they are slated for the first and second quarter, there’s – we still have lots of issues with labor and getting units turned. So they’re probably going to slip. You’re probably going to have a little bit of a back-end bias to the 10,000 apartments next year as well. So and again, we’ve given you that the employment growth numbers, so that’s sort of the challenge that you have there. If you flip over to this, our second largest – our largest market in Washington D.C. very different picture there. Certainly, on the supply side, it’s more manageable than Houston. But more importantly, in terms of job growth in 2016, it looks like, the D.C. market will – is going to deliver about 70,000 jobs this year. Total deliveries we expect to be about 9,000 apartments roll forward to 2017, it looks like on an average of our data providers about 65,000 new jobs and again roughly 9,000 in new apartments delivered in 2017. And those are pretty good numbers, because if it’s – it would already be – it’s in the pipeline and knowable as far as 2017 delivery. So really D.C. looks like a – it looks very encouraging from the standpoint of supply and demand. You’ve got sufficient in both years job growth at the 70,000 and 65,000 to more than absorb the 9,000 each year that we think is coming. So the third market that is certainly on our radar screen and screen as one of our bottom three is Charlotte. And again, Charlotte’s issue is a pretty decent job growth, but probably just too many apartments that need to be delivered. Let me give you the comparable numbers for 2016 job growth in Charlotte was roughly 25,000, it looks like we’re going to get another 25,000 next year plus or minus. So that would imply 5,000 apartments that would – could be absorbed. And we’re going to get roughly 6,000 – 7,000 apartments in 2016, and it looks like, we get another 6,000 apartments. So slight amount of excess supply. The challenge is going to – in Charlotte will be kind of the location of where that supply is coming. As with all of these markets, it tends to be a little bit skewed towards the urban products. So if you’ve got stuff in – more in the urban areas of Charlotte, you’re probably going to have a little bit bigger impact. But overall, you’ve got 7,000 apartments. We got natural demand for 5,000, that looks to me pretty manageable in Charlotte. So that – so if you – of those three markets; Charlotte, Houston, and Washington D.C., the only one we really have a real gap from what we can see is or believe is coming in absorption as Houston.
Richard Hightower: Okay, that’s helpful, Ric. And then one quick second question here. You guys have had a lot of success on the property tax front this year. Do you expect the year-over-year comp in 2017 to be a bit of a headwind in that respect?
Alex Jessett: So one of the challenges that you always face when you get a lot of prior year appeal refunds in is that, it certainly does make your comp set a little bit harder the next year, and we’ve had obviously a considerable success this year on the appeal side. But additionally and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have across the Board seen rates and valuations come down. And the good news about that is, hopefully, that’s indicative of a sort of a mind shift in terms of assessment offices and hopefully, that translates to more of a normal base number for next year. Historically, taxes for us have increased on average at less than 3%. So I think if you sort of think about the base number, I think, we’re back to that sort of 3% range. And then we will have a small amount of headwind or sort of depending upon how it all shakes out associated with prior year refunds that we’ve gotten this year. This clearly has been an outsized year for us.
Richard Hightower: Okay, great. Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Wes Golladay: Hello, everyone. I’m just going back to Houston since you’re all out there. How does the overall business environment feel? It looks like looking at the employment data, Houston had a nice uptick in September, it’s only one data point and doesn’t make a trend, but just almost fourteen-and-a-half-thousand jobs added in the month. Are you feeling any better out there?
Richard Campo: The market feels pretty decent. I mean, the good news is, you’ve had – if you think about Houston, the oil dislocation was, if you measure it just in terms of price and in terms of of dislocation to the energy sector, it was worse than the energy decline in the 80’s. And the difference, however, in the 80’s, Houston lost about 250,000 to 300,000 jobs during that bust. During this situation, we’ve not have not lost any jobs. We actually have added incrementally small numbers of jobs. But that’s on top of or coming off of some really good years. When you think about the last big year in 2013 and 2014, we’re generating 125,000 jobs. So it’s not the sort of like a car going 70 miles an hour down the freeway, and now all of a sudden, we’ve got 20,000 jobs are going 20 miles an hour, instead of 70. So that’s what, it sort of feels like that that kind of speed change. I think the stabilization of oil prices from and the increase from the lows in February today definitely has put a zip in the step of energy folks and you’ve seen the rig count bottomed out and now it’s up 25% from the 400 level, and every new rig that gets put on its 200 employees that goes to that rig, they’re not necessary based in Houston, but it’s 200 employees going to a rig. So most of the energy people that we talk to are pretty much done laying off. They’ve cut as much as they can, and they’re now sort of holding their own and waiting for the recovery. The challenge you have in the job market is that 80,000 jobs that were sort of lost in the energy business. And we’ve offset those with jobs in the medical center, jobs in the petrochemical construction,business and in retail. Those jobs are not as high paying as the energy jobs. So there has been a loss of wages. And you’ve seen a decline in new vehicle sales, a decline in sales tax for the region, and things like that. But generally people feel like the worst is over and they’re going to drag on the bottom for a while, and if oil prices stay at these levels, then they’ll start ramping up. I think the – there was some an energy conference here this week and folks are talking about their budgets for 2017. They cut their budgets 55% from the peak last year and this year and they’re talking about a 25% increase in capital expense budgets from the energy companies as a result of $50 oil. So that would be positive. That doesn’t necessarily translate to big time hiring, because usually it takes a while after you’ve been shellshocked and laid off a bunch of people, you don’t really add them back immediately. And so, we sort of feel decent about it. And so I don’t think, we’re not as worried about the job prospects for Houston, because we know that’s coming and it will happen. And we’re – the big issue in Houston is really just taking up the supply that Keith went through. [Multiple Speakers] Yes. I just want to – I want to bring that back to kind of a multifamily, because we’ve talked a lot about Houston this morning, and I know there’s just a – and there’s a lot of questions and will continue to be questions about what is 2017 look like, and we’re not – while we’re not prepared to really give any numbers on that. I think it is useful to use history as a guide. So in 2010, which was kind of the last time we had a real dislocation in the Houston apartment market, the conditions in 2010. So in 2009, Houston lost $110,000 jobs as part of the great recession. So we were – 2009 was a really bad year for jobs in Houston, as it was for a lot of other places in the country. But at the same time, we delivered 15,000 apartments in 2009, which it’s less than what we’re delivering now, but you were delivering into a job market that was far, far weaker than what we have right now. So what it all that mean for our portfolio in Houston in 2010, you’ve rolled up the 110,000 job losses forward. We’re basically flat on jobs in 2010. We got another 6,000 apartments delivered in 2010. So between 2009 and 2010, we had 21,000 apartments delivered in a much worse job environment, and our revenues in 2010 were down 3.7%. So, we’re going to be down 1% this year. You sort of – if you’re sort of trying to think about framing the overall situation in Houston, to me it doesn’t feel anything. That doesn’t feel as bad to me as 2010 was. So it feels worse than 1% down, which is where we were in 2016, but it doesn’t feel like 2010. So, that’s kind of framing the argument about where we think it’s going to be and obviously, we’ll get detailed budgets and we go through our forecasting process and we’ll get back to you on the – in the first part of next year with where we think it’s going to shake out.
Wes Golladay: Okay, I appreciate that. And Neil Malkin has one question for you.
Neil Malkin: Hey, guys, thanks. You guys just talked about wanting to get into Northern California. I just wonder, given that there’s a lot of supply coming down the pike, growth slowing. I don’t know if asset prices, land values are getting anywhere close to the potential for you guys to make your foray into the northern California area? Thank.
Richard Campo: Well, we like Northern California long-term. And ultimately, I would like to add some exposure in some other of those markets, including the Pacific Northwest. And when you look at where we sit today with one of the strongest balance sheets or maybe the strongest balance sheets in the sector and a big bunch of cash on our balance sheet with no debt maturing, it definitely positions us to take advantage of the cycle. And right now we’re in the – in a – in the part of the cycle that is sort of uncertain. You have declining revenues sort of everywhere. And we’ll see what happens with job growth in the rest of the economy. We clearly are positioned to take advantage of the cycle from a capital perspective when the cycle presents opportunities to us, we plan to do that. When that happens, it’s hard to say. I don’t think it’s happened yet. And as I discussed in Houston, the Houston market, you can’t buy – there are no deals here. And so I doubt that there’s any deals anywhere in America today because of the capital flows and because of the significant equity positions that most merchant builders and other owners of apartments have. So we have no stress here. And I can’t imagine that there’s any stress on the West Coast at all either even though you’ve had some slowdown in growth and supply issues in markets that people never thought you’d ever could have a supply issue and which is sort of an interesting situation even though – so with that said, I don’t think there’s a lot of opportunity yet to do anything.
Neil Malkin: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Nicholas Yulico: Thanks. Just going back to this Internet rebuilding benefits that you get for same-store revenue this year. I’m sorry, did you say at what point that ends next year? And what might be the benefit to, if there’s any to your same-store revenue growth next year?
Alex Jessett: No, I didn’t give any guidance for next year. What I did say though is that, we’ve got about 35,000 units currently rolled out under the program. That number is increasing about 5,000 units a quarter. And when this thing is complete, we will have all of – for the most for all of our units that we own under the program. So I think you can do some extrapolation based on that.
Keith Oden: Some of the units – some of the – our homes are still under contracts and we have to wait until the contract expires. So it’s – I mean, it will eventually get there, but it may not be at the same pace that we’ve been at for the last year-and-a-half. But eventually if you look out long enough on the horizon, we expect to have every home in our portfolio with high-speed Internet.
Richard Campo: And as Keith pointed out earlier, we don’t have a fixed price with our residents. So as the package becomes more dynamic and Internet prices continue to escalate, we’ll be able to raise those prices as well.
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. And so just, I guess, the way to think about it from modeling standpoint is that the like when you get on page 12 of the supplemental, the weighted average monthly rental rate grow – that’s – going forward that’s going to be the more important number than the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied home number, which I guess, includes the cable package.
Richard Campo: Yes. So, correct. The weighted average monthly revenue is what it sounds like, it’s total revenue and so there’s total gross income, all of our other income categories et cetera per occupied unit. And that does compare to the rental rate, which is also on page 12, and that is exactly what it sounds like the asking rents and in-place rents for each unit.
Nicholas Yulico: Okay, got it. Thanks. Just one other question for me is, I mean, you talked about supply impacting some of your markets. I was curious for a couple of other ones like Atlanta, Florida, Dallas, how are you thinking about supply and whether it might be more impactful next year versus year in those markets? Thanks.
Alex Jessett: Yes. So if you roll the employment growth versus deliveries out to 2017, the markets that you mentioned, Dallas probably drops below the 5 to 1 ratio on the total employment to deliveries in 2017. Atlanta is probably still right at the 5 to 1. Austin’s – Austin has actually been below the 5 to 1 historical standard that we’ve always used for the last two years, and often still been one of our best performing market. So I’m actually and have had some conversations with folks about whether or not the 5 to 1 makes is still valid in today’s world of in markets like Austin, where people show up and whether they have a job or not and they find a job. And it’s just an interesting dynamic that we may have to go back and rethink whether 5 to 1 is the right long-term ratio of jobs to new supply. But in our world, the three markets – so the two markets that fall below currently the 5 to 1 that I have concerns about absorption rates out into 2017 are Houston and Charlotte.
Nicholas Yulico: Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Santos from Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead with your question.
Daniel Santos: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just a quick question on expenses. I know it’s been a long call. Just thinking about expenses, how sustainable are these savings moving forward and how should we thinking – we be thinking about expenses in 2017?
Alex Jessett: Well, once again, we’re not at the point to give guidance for 2017. What I will tell you is in this year, we’ve been incredibly successful on property taxes. Once again we’ll be at 3% for the full-year. 3% is the average in our portfolio. But part – but one of the factors that’s driving the 3% of property tax refunds this year and obviously that’s uncertain whether or not that replicates itself next year. If you think about the other line items, we’ve had success in salaries. We’ve had success in unit turn costs, a lot of that is driven by the fact that turnover has been down, retention has been up this year. And obviously, we’ll continue to focus on that in 2017. And then one of the outsized increases that’s been offsetting the positives on the expense side is utilities and that’s been driven by the new Internet program. And obviously, as the ramp up of that continues into 2017 and then ultimately plateaus, the expense side of that will as well.
Daniel Santos: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick from Capital One. Please go ahead with your question.
Thomas Lesnick: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I’ll keep it short since the call is going long, but just two quick ones. It sounds like from a lot of other commentary from other apartment REITs this quarter that D.C. is finally starting to turn the bend, if you will. And I know you guys just recently commenced construction on Camden Washingtonian out in Gaithersburg. I was wondering if you could comment at all on your general prognosis for D.C. and then what you’re seeing inside and outside the Beltway?
Richard Campo: Yes, actually we’re very constructive on D.C. I think it’s clear that the bottom has been in and things are moving in a very positive direction, you’ve got – so in terms of our portfolio for D.C., new leases were basically flat in the third quarter, but renewals were up about 5%. And kind of looking forward into – out into October, new leases still basically flat and October renewals up 3.5%. So our numbers have been dinged a little bit by our Maryland project that we’ve got some construction issues that we’re trying to get wrapped up hopefully by the first quarter of next year. But and if you roll forward to 2017 and 65,000 jobs projected, 9,000 deliveries, those are very healthy numbers. And I would expect that our portfolio would reflect that.
Thomas Lesnick: Thanks for that. Just one last one. You just mentioned the renewal and new lease of release comps for D.C. But for your other major metros, I think, you mentioned the overall number in the prepared remarks. But for markets like Dallas Atlanta LA, Houston, where do those comp stand?
Alex Jessett: Hey, let’s do that offline rather than I have to go through all of those in our last three minutes on the call. We would be happy to give them to you.
Thomas Lesnick: Sure. Thank you.
Alex Jessett: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Alex, which markets are you winning the bulk of these appeals and property-tax wise?
Alex Jessett: Primarily, it’s Houston. If you think about Houston, the last two years or two to three years, they had really incredibly outsized increases I think two years ago, they were 34% with the initial increases. And obviously, that gives us tremendous grounds to contest those and we have contested them and we contested them very aggressively, as you can see with the results. But that’s primarily where we’re seeing it.
John Pawlowski: How much are you arguing that property value in Houston has declined?
Alex Jessett: We’re not arguing that at all. What we’ve – what – the basis of our arguments is generally associated with what’s called the equal and uniform. And its based upon making sure that the valuations described to our asset is equal and uniform to the valuations described to neighboring and like kind assets in the market.
John Pawlowski: Understood. Thank you.
Alex Jessett: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
John Kim: Thank you. On the new lease rate that you will be offering in Houston, how quickly do you think the renewal rates adjust to the new lease rates?
Richard Campo: Well, our renewal rates have consistently been for all of 2016 have been running 4% to 5% above our new lease rate. So I don’t really see any reason that that gap would close much in 2017, depending on what happens to new lease rates in 2017, which we know that they’re clipping along right now at 5% to 6% down over the prior year, renewals are basically flat. I think that looks like kind of what the 2017 certainly in the first part of the year is going to look like.
John Kim: Okay. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have been a net seller for the last three years. And it sounds like from your commentary that the capital markets are still pretty healthy. But do you envision being a net seller again next year?
Alex Jessett: We could definitely be a net seller next year. The consideration would be, we have about $100 million of sales. We could do without having to do a special dividend, or having to do a 1031 Exchange in doing acquisition. So we have more limitations on that as a result of the sales that we’ve done – so done this year and prior year. So if we obviously looked at the market this year and said that we have historic pricing for the oldest and sort of slowest growing assets in our portfolio. And therefore, we made the decision to sell the $1.2 billion and bank the cash and pay a special dividend to shareholders. And if we have not completed our 2017 plans, but clearly, if we believe that was the case. And when we did our 2016 plan, or 2016 planning in 2015, it’s clearly on the table. We just have to go through the cycle analysis and the pricing analysis, where we’re going to be and then make those decisions.
John Kim: Thank, you.
Operator: And our final question today comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead with your question.
Dennis McGill: Hi, thanks for taking one more. Keith, I think you made this comment earlier. And I just want you to clarify, I hope I heard it right. When you were talking about the lease ups in Houston and the merchant builders being aggressive, you made a comment, I think,that they were priced at a level that the renter couldn’t afford to begin with. I just want to go back to that and make sure I heard that correctly?
Keith Oden: I think that’s probably the way you’re thinking about as a comment that I made about price elasticity, okay. So merchant builders starts with zero leased and needs to lease up to a rational number. And so what happens is, they – that’s where they get into these – a very big discounts. It’s just an endemic to the merchant builder mindset. It is if I have a zero revenue, I’m okay dropping my price to the point, where I start getting some revenue whatever that is. And that creates an opportunity for people who couldn’t otherwise afford it. So if you’re at a $3 square foot budget and you can’t lease it at $3 a foot, because you have a lot of competition and you start lowering at 8.3% for every one month you give. Then if you’re giving three months free, that’s a significant discount. And what it does is, it opens the market for a broader demand pool of people who can afford those properties at those levels, right? So it’s not so much that the people can’t afford it, because they can’t. I mean, we’ve been – we’re getting $2.50 to $3 square foot rents in a lot of buildings in Houston today. The challenge is, you just have too many buildings. So the buildings are dropping their rates and try to create that excess demand, or to steal demand from somebody else. And what that has – the effect of that is, it makes those properties more affordable to a broader cast of residents. And I think that’s actually very, very healthy, because what happens then is if somebody who, say a, baby boomer who lives in sugar land who’s thinking about their kids just went to Texas A&M, or maybe University of Texas, they look at the market and go. While I can go into downtown Houston or the Galleria lease up 2,000 square foot apartment that used to be 6,000 a month or 4,000 a month, and I’m going to go do that. And so they sell their house in the suburbs and move into the urban core. You’ve now created demand that didn’t have to be created by jobs. And so that that’s what I was sort of leaning towards. It’s not about that the people can’t afford it, because they can. It’s just that we have too much delivery at the same time and ultimately, they will fill them up and then the rents will rise. If you look what happened in 2010, we were releasing up Camden Plaza, for example, our pro forma rents were about a $1.50 plus or minus a square foot. We ended up leasing it up at a $1.20. And today that leases are at at $2 a foot. So that we had a tough lease up, because it was in that tough time. But once the properties lease up, and you have a stabilization in the market, the rents will ratchet up. And if you take Houston, Texas, for example, from a revenue growth, from Camden’s perspective, Houston, if you take from 2011 through 2016, it’s still the best market in America for Camden on a revenue growth and NOI growth and slightly being flat for 2016.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, that’s very helpful. Thank you for clarifying. Are there any markets across the country as you see those products being developed at an elevated price points that you are a little bit fearful of affordability, or is this representative of the story elsewhere with that?
Richard Campo: Not in our markets. In our markets, there – we don’t have caps on affordability, especially when you look at our average. Our average sort of rent to income is around 17.5%, 18% plus or minus. And so and historically, it’s in the 20’s. So we still have an ability to push rents pretty substantially in our portfolio and still get to those sort of averages. So we don’t really see it in our markets. I know that there’s some challenges in the markets like San Francisco and New York and elsewhere, but not in Camden’s markets.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect. Okay, thanks again, guys. Good luck.
Richard Campo: Thanks. We appreciate your time today. I know you have a lot of calls to handle. We’ll talk to you in NAREIT. Thanks. Bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call. We do thank you for attending the presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete second quarter 2016 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will try to be brief in our prepared remarks and complete the call within one hour as there are other multi-family calls scheduled after us. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Richard Campo: Thanks, Kim and good morning. Today's on hold music was brought to you by the one and only Prince, unquestionably one of my generation's greatest musical talents. In addition to being a musical genius we consider him to be a kindred spirit of sorts. 1993 Prince changed his musical identity to the artist formerly known as Prince. That same year in conjunction with our IPO we changed our name to Camden, the company phone formerly known as Suntech [ph], and the rest as they say is history. Camden strategy of operating in high growth markets, improving the quality of our portfolio through capital recycling and maintaining a strong financial to position continues to create value for shareholders. Apartment fundamentals remain strong with above average growth expected for the next few years. Revenue growth has slowed from the high growth levels over the last few years but remains above the long term average. 2016 results are in line with expectations and all our markets are performing exactly as we expect. We are maintaining our 2016 guidance ranges for both FFO and same store growth. Our developments are creating significant long term value for our shareholders. We currently have $850 million of properties currently under construction. 77% of the cost is funded, little less than $200 million left to fund. We expect to start one to two projects up $200 million in the second half of 2016. As we have discussed, we are reducing the size of our development pipeline at this point in the cycle. I do want to give a shout out to our teams for another great quarter and to our real estate investment group for their adept management in execution of the nearly $1.2 billion in dispositions that we'll complete this year. We all know it is much harder to buy than it is sell. And at the offset of what we did in the beginning of the year in terms of our disposition activity, I'm really excited that our teams have done a great job.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. We're pleased with our second quarter results aside from the elevated transaction volume in the quarter; this was a relatively routine quarter as operating results were right in line with expectations. Overall conditions remained above trend and sequential revenue growth was up 1.6% with all markets positive. This seasonal improvement was also in line with our expectations. With that in mind, I'll keep my prepared remarks brief today to allow more time for what's on your mind. A few highlights on our same store results; second quarter revenue growth was 4.3%. Our top five markets all grew more than 8% again this quarter. Tampa up 9.6%, Orlando up 9.3%, Dallas up 8.6%, San Diego/Inland Empire up 8.1% and Phoenix up right at 8%. As expected our two weakest markets were Houston, down 1% and DC down two-tenths of 1%. Houston revenue decline of 1% was in line with their expectations, as well as our commentary from last quarters call. We still expect full year revenue in Houston to be flat to slightly negative for the full year of 2016. DC revenue growth was slightly negative primarily as a result of a construction related issue in one of our large Maryland communities. Excluding that community DC revenue growth would have been approximately 50 basis points higher year-to-date or right at seven-tenth growth. We're expecting better performance in the second half of the year and we still forecast to full year revenue growth in the DC metro area in the 1% to 2% range. Rents on new leases and renewal continue to support our outlook for the full year results. Second quarter new leases were up 2.7% and renewals were up 5.9%. July new leases are running 3.1% up with renewals up 5.6%, and we're sending out our August and September renewal offers at average increase of 6.3%. Additional operating steps for the quarter continue to support our full year outlook. Same store occupancy in the second quarter averaged 95.5% versus 95.4% in the first quarter and 96% in the second quarter last year. July occupancy ticked up to 95.7% versus 96% for the same quarter last year. Net turnover rate for the quarter was down slightly versus last year at 47% year-to-date. Move outs to home purchases were 15.9% for the quarter with an as expected seasonal increase from 14.3% in the first quarter. Overall, 2016 move outs to purchase homes are running 1% above 2015 but still well below the long-term trend. Finally, our risk income for the quarter was 18% consistent with the 17% to 18% levels we've seen post-recession. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our portfolios performance. We operated national platform in 15 markets and while macroeconomic influences are strong, each market is subject to its own set of factors that can over shadow the big picture. These market specific factors explain why our two weakest markets Houston and DC are underperforming our overall portfolio while five of our markets grew revenues better than 8% this quarter. This reminds us that our diversified national footprint has similarities to a balanced stock portfolio where diversification is the only free lunch. Now I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results, a brief update on our decision activities. On last quarters call, we discussed the sale of our Las Vegas portfolio for $630 million and the plan disposition of an additional $400 million to $600 million of operating assets during the third quarter. We have since completed $210 million of these additional dispositions and the midpoint of our third quarter and full year earnings guidance assumes another $310 million of sales closing during the third quarter bringing our total expected disposition volume to nearly $1.2 billion for 2016. To date including Las Vegas, we have sold $840 million of assets at an average AFFO yield of 5% based on trailing 12 month NOI and actual CapEx equating to a nominal NOI cap rate which excludes management fees and CapEx of 6%. Most of these communities were 20 to 30 years in age with lower rents and higher CapEx in the rest of our portfolio. However, our most recent sales did include two assets in suburban Maryland which were less than 10 years old. We elected to dispose these relatively younger assets to both reduce our exposure to their respective sub-markets and to mitigate the additional DC metro NOI exposure that will result from the new development communities which begin leasing in 2017. The additional $310 million of dispositions expected in the third quarter consist of older assets, similar in kinds of majority of properties we have sold over the past few years. Since our last call, we have refined our 2016 disposition pool and associated tax planning. We now anticipate a special dividend in the range of $4 to $4.50 per share as compared to our prior guidance range of $4.25 to $5.25 per share and we expect to pay the full dividend amount during the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with no balances outstanding on our unsecured line of credit, $342 million of cash on hand, and no debt maturing until May of 2017. After completing the sale of our two Maryland assets earlier this month, our cash balances have grown to approximately $450 million. We do not anticipate prepaying any portion of our current debt. Instead we plan to use our cash balances and future sale proceeds to fund our development pipeline and return capital to shareholders later this year through the previously mentioned special dividends. Our current development pipeline has approximately $200 million remaining to be spent over the next two years and we are projecting another $100 million to $200 million of developments to begin later this year. Moving on to operate results; for the second quarter we reported FFO of $105.6 million or $1.15 per share, in line with the midpoint of our prior guidance range for the second quarter of $1.13 to $1.17 per share. Based upon our year-to-date operating performance, we have tightened the ranges for our 2016 full year FFO and same store guidance leaving the midpoints of guidance unchanged. We currently anticipate 2016 full year FFO to be between $4.50 and $4.60. Same store revenue growth between 3.85% and 4.35%; expense growth between 3.5% and 4% and NOI growth between 4% and 4.5%. Last night we also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2016. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.07 to $1.11. The midpoint of $1.09 represents a $0.06 decrease in the second quarter of 2016 which is primarily the result of an approximate $0.01 per share increase in same store NOI resulting from an estimated 50 basis point increase in sequential NOI as revenue growth from higher rental and fee income in our peak leasing periods more than offsets our expected increase in property expenses due to normal seasonal summer increases in utilities and repair maintenance costs, an approximate $0.01 per share increase in NOI from our five communities in lease up and an approximate $0.02 per share increase in FFO resulting from lower overhead costs. This $0.04 per share aggregate improvement in FFO is more than offset by an approximate $0.03 per share decrease in FFO resulting from the April 26 disposition of our Las Vegas portfolio, and approximately $0.03 per share decrease in FFO resulting from the $210 million of additional completed dispositions and approximate $0.03 per share decrease in FFO resulting from the $310 million of anticipated additional thirty quarter dispositions and an approximate $0.01 per share decrease in FFO resulting from lower occupancy at our non-same store student housing community in Corpus Christi, Texas. Occupancy declined significantly from May through August at this community. At this time we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. I'm wondering if you can talk more about what you're seeing in Houston right now, you mentioned that's still in line with your expectations of generally flat same store revenue growth. So what are you seeing there? And then also how do you see that trending going forward? And when do you think we'll actually reach a bottom up for our Houston?
Richard Campo: So Nick, we said last quarter that we thought our -- this will be the first negative revenue print in the second. So it's consistent with what we were expecting for this quarter. And our stabilized portfolio where occupancies have held up fairly well and we continue to be very aggressive on renewals, we did some things in the middle of last year to just kind of stabilize the embedded base in our portfolio, lengthening lease terms and getting a lot more aggressive on renewing and it's paid off for us. I mean we've got heads, we've seen less turnover on our portfolio and the longer lease terms have certainly helped us in terms of count extending the roll down of the rent but really is if we know cadence guys to the fact that we were you know this would be a year where if we could get out of the woods with -- sort of slightly down on revenues and that would be a good day's work. And as we sit here and almost in August now, it looks you know it looks like that's still achievable. So it's on the stabilized portfolio that's one part of the world. Obviously there is a lot more stress in the merchant bills arena where people are – to a different game when you're trying to get from 0% occupied to 90% versus trying to sort of hold on to your 95% -- in the range of 94%, 95% occupied. I think typical in the market right now when merchant billed, it's routine to see 6 to 8 months free rent. In the most impacted area which is out of the energy corridor we had a lot of these supply obviously very weak demand. I think that -- we've heard seen and heard anecdotal evidence so as much as three months free run but I would say what's typical in the merchant build world is 6 to 8 weeks free. In our world we don't really deal with concessions, it's all the net effective rents and so if you just kind of look at where we are year-to-date. We're about where we thought we would be in and we do expect that things will continue to get more pressure as the merchant bill stuff comes online. In terms of the kind of singing which is the bottom until, we get or do our bottom-up of budgets for 2015, we won't really have a better handle along that. But as we get closer to year end, we get our budgets rolled out for what we think is going to happen in our stabilized portfolio, we'll give you some more color on that.
Keith Oden: I think the other thing that I would just add is that supply has basically shut down in Houston. If you don't have a development loan now you're not getting the project completed. The equity requirements and the increase in costs associated with lenders as a result of your buzzle and also technical things that the banks may require to do now. So construction financing basically has dried up and you know unless you're putting 60% in a deal, you're not going to get construction financing. So when you look at the supply side, the supply coming into the Houston this year is 25,000 units, make sure it can be -- At least half of that, maybe less than half of that. And then 2016 eighteen or you don't see any kind of pipeline at all. So if you if you have a thesis on recovery in the energy business or at least we think the energy business has stopped hemorrhaging jobs and Houston's actually had flat job growth. So we've been able to add jobs in other sectors while the energy sector is contracting. So with that said, 2017 is sort of a better year job wise with that without as many energy layoffs and then 2018 -- depending upon on the national economy obviously -- both, the national economy in 2017-2018 along with energy is going to really dictate what happens but the good news is that we know that there is no supply coming in 2018. So you can kind of look at it and say well maybe it's middle of 2017, end of 2017 or really 2018 where you don't have the supply pressure anymore.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then just on -- I guess the difference between your weighted average monthly rental rate and your weighted average monthly revenue -- it was about 100 bips this quarter. I wonder what is driving that if it's still bulk cable. And Internet package, and how you expect that spread to trend for the remainder of the year?
Richard Campo: Yes, absolutely. So the main driver is exactly right, it is our tech package. What you're seeing year-to-date for the incremental impact which is in line with what the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year and is in line what we expect for the full year. So approximately 100 basis points.
Nicholas Joseph: So you'd expect that 100 basis points to hold quarterly through the end of the year?
Richard Campo: Correct.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, it's Austin Wurschmidt for Jordan. I was just wondering if you could give some operating stats for Houston into July, just how things -- in terms of how things are trending across quarter end.
Richard Campo: Yes, so we'll have to grab that for you, don't have those in front of me. I can tell you that it was pretty consistent as I recall from last quarter, we were down about 2% on new leases, renewals were flat to up 1%, and you do that math and you end up about down one which is where we work the quarters. I think that's still consistent with what we're seeing.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks. And then what are you guys assuming in terms of occupancy guidance in the back half the year? I mean it seems like occupancy is tracking a little bit ahead at this time. Do you kind of expect to hold that level for the rest of the year?
Richard Campo: Yes, I think our rolled up budget for the entire year was about 95.4%. It's about where we are right now. So yes -- you expect to see just the math of that would mean that we should still in the mid-95%. We're not -- we have never tried to operate our portfolio at 95.5% or above, it occasionally happens but our long-term target is really 95% to 95.5% which is consistent where we've been this year.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then so -- kind of my math is right, it seems like you'd have to do a little bit over 3.5% in the back half of the year to hit the midpoint in guidance. Is that fair?
Richard Campo: Yes.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks for taking the questions. [Technical Difficulty].
Richard Campo: It has both supply issues and demand, we continue to see decent job growth in all of our markets, we're getting our share of that. And where the deceleration is happening, I do believe it is primarily where you've got assets that are directly competitive with new lease ups and you've got merchant builders who are always a little bit more aggressive in their pricing than we are on our communities.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And secondly, the two assets you sold after quarter end in the metro DC area; what net impact do you believe that will have on your same store pool in DC? The subtraction of those assets help or hurt same store numbers in the near term?
Richard Campo: So both of those assets were relatively in line with our DC portfolio, slightly more positive but relatively in line. So the removal of them is not going to really have any incremental impact.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Looking at the camp in Chandler, it looks like leasing velocities slowed a bit. Is there anything special going on there?
Richard Campo: Yes, it's just one of those relatively large unit accounts where you sort of run into yourself on the lease up where you have lease explorations that are happening while you're not yet stabilized. So overall Phoenix was a great market for us for the -- it has been year-to-date and we think it will continue to be. So we'll get there but it's just one of those phenomenon's that happens when you sort of run yourself on the lease explorations.
Wes Golladay: Okay, and now looking at the DC market, it looks like Pentagon City, Crystal City and then Downtown Logan Circle, the actual metro state is starting to trend higher and you also have some pretty good employment data on relative basis coming out of the city. Are you getting more constructed to pushing new lease rate in the second half or maybe early the next year?
Richard Campo: Yes, our -- you could look at our progression throughout the state and our guidance for where we think we're going to be in DC and we're still pretty firm in our guidance that we're going to get between 1% and 2% revenue growth for the year and obviously from where we are here in -- at the end of the second quarter, that means we've got to see some pretty decent traction on both new leases and renewal and we think we're going to get there. I think the fourth quarter actually sets up pretty well for us and we still think when it's all said and done we'll be in the 1% to 2% percent range. If you recall our original guidance for DC as a market, we had two C-rated markets, both Houston and DC were C-rated with the difference being DC had a C plus rating but an improving outlook, and I think that where we are here almost in August -- we still see it that way.
Wes Golladay: And then lastly on Houston, we think we're getting a little bit of bottoming out in the rig count. Are any of the -- your contacts on the E&P executive side getting more constructive or just more of a bottoming out process going on?
Richard Campo: Definitely, the CEO's are more constructive about the bottoming happening. It's one of the big suppliers after they've announced the earnings talked about the bottoming and then at the same time we also said they were laying off another 5,000 people worldwide. So I think what's happening is that definitely the energy. complex is feeling better about the world with oil prices up from their bottom at the beginning of the year, and part of the equation is, is that they don't want to do what they generally do during the big downturn like this which is cut so far to the bone that it really takes him a long time to get back. I actually had a conversation few weeks ago with the CEO of Shell, and he expressed that sort of fear to me which is that you know we don't want to overdo it like we always do, and all of sudden oil gets back to $60, $70 dollars a barrel and they don't have any employees to get the job done. So I think there is a certain amount of expectation that oil has bottomed. I think people are sort of cautiously optimistic, and you have seen the rig count go up. The question of what happens long term to oil is really the key, but at least these folks are a little more constructive today.
Wes Golladay: Great, thanks for taking the question.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thank you. Can you share the individual nominal cap rates on the Tampa and two, suburban Maryland dispositions?
Richard Campo: Sure. So on the FFO cap rate on the Tampa asset was just slightly north of six, and it was the same for the two Maryland assets, slightly little bit less but in that range. That's on an FFO basis, if you go to an AFFO, the -- they were -- the Tampa deal was right at five. And then the other two Maryland deals, obviously our newer assets with slightly lower CapEx, and so their AFFO yields were sort of in the 5.5 range.
John Pawlowski: Great, thanks. And that's on in-place for forward NOI?
Richard Campo: That's trailing.
John Pawlowski: That's trailing.
Richard Campo: And that also doesn't include management fees or property tax increases or that kind of -- those things. Generally you will take the -- so if you're talking in general, sort of broker CapEx or broker cap rate, you have to take 75 bips off these numbers.
John Pawlowski: Great. And then how do these cap rates and the cap rates on your incremental $300 million in dispositions compared to your initial expectations?
Richard Campo: They are right in line. We've -- we had some ups some downs but not much and it was all marginally right in line with what we expected.
John Pawlowski: Okay, last one for me. Do you anticipate purchasing any more land in 2016?
Richard Campo: We do have a land site in Denver in the Rhino neighborhood that we will likely acquire between now and the end of the year. But when you look at our development pipeline, we have -- we have all of our development, if you assume about $200 million start per year, we're out of land in 2018. So if we are going to keep the development time -- pipeline at least in a position where we can in fact start projects in the future we will have to start looking at new land. One of the things I think is going to be really interesting is going to be -- with all those pressure on the merchant builders from a financing perspective and construction cost perspective, we think that there may be some opportunities to pick up land transactions that developers have -- either already done plans on what have you and aren't able to finance them and we may end up picking up some bargains in that area in the future. And I think that's an area that could be really interesting.
John Pawlowski: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rick Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Anderson: Thanks, good morning everyone. So Rick or Keith or anyone; one of you can kind of maybe wax poetic a little bit about M&A or privatizations in this environment. It seems to me with kind of latter in the real estate cycle, decelerating growth, capital available or debt and cheap to financially worthy entities and still exceptionally low cap rates and high property values being attributed, not just to your space but to a lot of spaces. Is this not like a perfect time to see more, an acceleration of reprivatization as sellers, whoever that may be -- feel like they're getting full value?
Richard Campo: I think -- so let me fit the M&A to start with. So M&A is a social issue related to whether companies really want to sell or not and it's not -- it never has been a financial issue in my view. It's always been one-off -- if they get pressure or they are just ready to retire or don't think they can create value long-term which most management teams believe they can. So I think M&A is one of those kinds of issues out there that continues to be out there even though there are fewer targets obviously since there has been a lot of take out. On the private side, the issue of going private is one of those classic sorts of discussions, right. So if our objective is to maximize total return over a long period of time for our shareholders, we're going to be along real estate all the time. And so if we thought that we were a value-trapped or that we couldn't continue to provide great returns to our shareholders over a long period of time then we would go private and we would sell because at the end of the day there is -- it would be no fun for any of us to be sitting in a situation where we're just limping along and not able to maximize value for the people that own a lot of shares, including our management team but also just shareholders, overall. If you think about it, I remembered during the downturn when I would talk to all the big banks I'd say, why don't you sell me $1 billion of your construction loans that are obviously underwater; and they would look at me and say what kind of rate of return are you trying to make on it. I'd say, just -- I'm trying to make a mid-teens return if I have to foreclose on some apartment project or what have been -- and there that they threw it back to me and said, guess what we're going to make that 15% return rather than giving it to you. So if you think about privatization today, those private investors have a return hurdle, they have a requirement to return money to their shareholders and why should we give them upside when we can create that value for our shareholders over a long period of time. So that's kind of my view of the privatization, just because you can sell at a high price doesn't mean that that's going to create value long term.
Keith Oden: Rich, I would add to that just -- and you've been doing this and following this long enough to know this in our 23 years as a public companies there have been four different cycles where at times the fate as it is favoring the public companies, and at times it favors the private companies and the reality is for the last five or six years, the playing field has been tilted pretty steeply in favor of the private guys with sort of unlimited access to pretty cheap debt, and in high leverage and all that comes with that. So ultimately we -- the playing field will flip and we think -- it you could very well be that we're seeing the beginning stages of that but clearly the next level -- sort of the next turn in the cycle is that it would be in the favor -- more in the favor of the public companies. So if you -- in my mind just looking at it from a macro perspective, it wouldn't be a great time to be making the switch. If the objective was how can you perform over the next five years or how the cycle unfolds; I think the public companies are going to be in favor relative to the private companies and who knows what triggers that it could be something as simple as – right now on everyone's radar screen that is the change in access to capital for the private players versus the public players and whether it's the Basel requirements or clamping down on construction lending for all real estate sources in the private world where they really only can compete, where they are in a development mode and building. So if that flips and that becomes much more expensive and much more difficult than the private guys are going to be. They are going to be on the short end of the stick again and it will happen, you just don't know when or what causes it to happen.
Richard Anderson: So related to that, Rick at the very beginning you said that you think you'll have above average growth for at least the next few years, I think that's what you said. I mean, first of all, what gives you comfort that you're not kind of trending more quickly to more of -- a kind of CPI based type of growth rate given all the kind of moving parts? And second, is that -- what's the time horizon for you to belong the -- the publicly traded model, in other words, if you saw that math being more like a year or this was it, would you be more inclined to be a seller today?
Richard Campo: I think that when you think about our above average, we're talking about above average growth and average growth will be defined as 3% sort of NOI growth over a long period time, that's how multi-family generally is delivered over a 20-year period. Obviously, it peaks in values associated with that. The reason I think that we're going to be above growth -- above trend growth, top line and bottom line for the next couple years is all the macro things that are going on in multi-family are all good. You have the baby boom echo, that's still big, that are big renters you've got; the single family homes have yet to take off and really do well relative to historic measures, it's still hard to get a loan for first-time homebuyers, the homeownership rate continues to be very low and falling. So multi-family is still in the sweet spot, with the pressure you have on slowing rents today I think it's generally supply driven in all the markets. You had outsized throw over the years as a result of the sort of the shortage of multi-family and now we've gone to the point where we're where we have built enough to sort of take the white hot growth off of the of the market, now it's just above average growth, it's not as strong as it was but I think it's going to be higher than average because of all these other factors and then we can start bringing in the more restrictive financing situation for builders and construction costs increase; you're going to see a flattening to a falling of starts. And so with that said I think we have a few years at U.S. recession or something like that that could change the dynamics. We're going to have a very constructive multi-family market over the next couple years. In terms of -- if we thought that the world was coming to an end and we could -- and we really believe that we were headed towards and we had perfect knowledge of a financial crisis or something like that and maybe you would sell but I don't have that kind of knowledge, I just have the knowledge of knowing that every single day I have a lot of Camden employees that are out there trying to create a lot of value for their shareholders and we're in a constructive multi-family environment so I don't feel like we -- we need to even think about that. I will tell you if you go back in history in our 23 year history back in the mid-90's to the late-90's when everybody was buying tech stocks and multi-family was all of the rich were sort of thrown to the wayside. We ended up buying 16% sixteen percent of the company back throughout stock buybacks; and I remember having this conversation then saying, look if you remodeled [ph] is broken, and I'm always going to trade in 20% to my net asset value. And I'm going to buy the company back and go private and or sell it to somebody who will pay me a premium and to get that NAV. And I think over time you do have those points in time were you do have disconnect but generally speaking it doesn't last forever and you get back to a few more rational positions so it's kind of -- might be the whole M&A private scenario.
Richard Anderson: Good stuff, Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tom Lesnick of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Thomas Lesnick: Thanks for taking my questions. First, I just -- observationally looking at your year-over-year occupancy comps, it looked like maybe more so than others quarters, a larger number of them were slightly negative. I'm just wondering if that's really a function of you guys pushing the rent perhaps a little bit, harder than equilibrium or as you kind of look out towards the next couple of years. How do you guys really view the balance between occupancy and rent in your portfolio?
Richard Campo: The balance that we try to maintain is 95% to 95.5%. And it doesn't mean that we're always in that band, last year we were above that band which is a little unusual for us. I think what's happened in the last -- there is two things that have happened to the portfolio wide occupancy rate. One is, Houston has had additional softness and as we expected I think worried about 93% occupied in Houston and the overall portfolio is still above 95%. So that's 12% of your NOI comes from Houston and 2% matters around the edges. The other thing is that in DC we have continued to try to trade-off between rental rates and occupancy rates. And last year we were definitely much higher than our normal trend on occupancy rates. We're back closer to what we what we view as more of a normal occupancy rate for DC in our overall portfolio but it's not -- it's never been an objective of ours to try to say let's operate at the highest possible occupancy that we can, obviously you can do that, the lever is pricing and we have -- we use a yield star, we have a Group in Houston, five people that manage that process full-time; and we have great -- what we think we have very good visibility into the push and pull of rental rates versus the occupancy rates, and we do a lot of toggling, we do a lot of tweaking, it's not -- it's certainly not autopilot; there is a ton of judgment and experience that goes into pulling those levers and we think that we're about where we need to be. But I don't -- other than Houston and DC, I don't see anything in our occupancy rates across our portfolio that gives me any pause whatsoever that we're not maximizing pricing and occupancy.
Thomas Lesnick: That's very helpful. And then just a couple quick ones; can you talk at all about the single family rental market in Houston? And maybe how much competition that is in Houston, specifically relative to some of your other markets? I get a sense that the rents are cohort since you say that is generally younger, in those first two or four years out of college as opposed to maybe late 20's or early 30's especially relative to some of your other markets. Just wondering if you have any contacts or color you shed on that?
Richard Campo: Sure. I think you hit the nail on the head in terms of demographics. From a rental perspective, single family rentals are really not major competitions, we have a small amount of people whom about -- move out to -- move into rental houses but it's really minor relative to the world. And part of it is that the single family rental market is out of the suburbs and the product is twice as large from a square footage perspective, as an apartment it has fewer amenities and all that. And generally moving out to either buy a house or rent a house is a demographic issue, its age, how many people do you have in your household, kids, that sort of thing. We do have -- probably the bigger competition is not rental -- move out to rent houses, its move out to buy houses. And on an average I think Keith has these numbers.
Keith Oden: Yes, we're about 16% of our total move outs in Houston were to purchase homes which is a little bit higher than our portfolio average but that number two years ago in Houston would have been probably 17%, 18% but it's -- it is -- as Rick said, we do lose more people at 16%. If you look at the percentages that give us as a reason that they moved out to rent a home, that number is in the 2% to 3% percent range versus -- to purchase a home at 16%. So it's out there, it shows up on our reasons to move out in every market that we're in but nowhere is it more than 2% or 3%.
Richard Campo: I think the -- I've said this bunch of times and people kind of look at me funny when I say this, I think that if single family -- if our move out rate for single family homes, right now it's around 14%, for the year I think it was 15% and some change for the quarter. If it goes back to its normal average over a long period of time which is 18%, I think we have another leg up in the multi-family business because what's happening right now is that there is not enough single family homes being built; the start of the market is pretty abysmal out there. And if you had starts in the million, 2 million, 3 million for which some folks seem to think we should have -- you would have better job growth, you would have better GDP growth and we would then be in a position where we could -- we would have more people moving in the front door than moving out the back door to go buy a house. And so I think that the whole housing issue is an interesting one, and ultimately the housing market is still trying to recover from the debacle in 2008 and 2009.
Thomas Lesnick: That's really interesting, I appreciate that insight. Just one final one for me and I'm serious on this, both from the perspective of jobs and from the perspective of the renter psyche; which is more influential right now in Houston, the raw oil price or oil volatility?
Richard Campo: I don't think any of the either one. When you think about us -- I think it's -- I think the -- ultimately it is what the real price is, but the volatility actually gets people twisted up as well but you have to think about Houston is 6.5 million people, it's the fourth largest city in the country, there are 3 million jobs that exist there today. And if you go back to 2014, there was 120,000 jobs, 2015 there was 20,000, and in 2016 it's going to be flat or maybe 2,000 or 3,000. So there is 3 million people working, 6.5 million people live in there, kind of doing what they do; and there is a certain amount of inertia that happens in that economy. So the bad news about oil and energy lapse, nobody gets -- but the 3 million people that are working are still working to get paychecks, paying the rent and doing the things that they do. So I think that that as oil prices -- when oil prices stabilize, if the psyche of the senior executives that are going to hire people -- I think it's more about what the real price of oil is and what their expectation is over a longer period of time.
Keith Oden: If you're not directly in the oil business, it's sort of background noise; if you are directly in the oil business, it's more likely that your psyche is what determines it is not the day to day spot price of a barrel of crude oil. It's the question we got earlier on rig count because the executives that we talk to they will tell you that whether oil is $45, $55, or $65 is not a game changer for the inputs to what drives their business. Whether the rig count is falling 20 rigs a week or rising 20 rigs a week is a big deal, and there is a fair amount of evidence that about two months ago we hit the low point on active rigs. And then the last -- I think the last four weeks straight there been small additions to the rig count. Now four weeks is not a trend make but I think that most people view that as maybe the worst is in -- the bottom is in in terms of the ability to start adding new activity levels because the rig count drives it, almost everything, it's not driven by the price of oil, it's driven by the activity level and that's workers in the field, it's down whole suppliers, services; it's all tools and it ultimately ends up in production. So what's the rig count and then the savvy folks at the oil companies as probably what they tend to look at more than the price of crude as to what the near term future holds for the oil business.
Thomas Lesnick: All right guys, really appreciate it.
Richard Campo: Absolutely.
Operator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Rick Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard Campo: Thank you. We appreciate your time today and we'll see in the fall. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Camden Property Trust First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2016 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will try to be brief in our prepared remarks and complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Thanks, Kim. We began our call today with Faith Hill singing Lets Go to Las Vegas and ended it with Sheryl Crow’s Leaving Las Vegas. The 18 years covered by those two song titles represent our tenure in Las Vegas which came to a close this week. It’s been a great ride. Camden is driven to improve people’s lives. We improved the lives of our Camden team in Las Vegas by providing a great workplace where they could do their best work and have fun. We improved the lives of our residents by providing quality homes which were expertly maintained and managed by some of the industry’s finest professionals, and finally, we improved our investors lives as our investor –- as our investment in Las Vegas produced an annual unlevered return of 10.7% over the 18-year old holding period.  The sale of our Las Vegas assets was the right decision for Camden as the communities no longer look like the balance of Camden’s portfolio. It was twice as old and had monthly revenue of roughly $500 per home less than the balance of our portfolio. The biggest negative of the sale is having to part ways with a 100 Camden team members, many who have been with Camden for over 10 years. I want to acknowledge their loyalty, the professionalism that they all exhibited throughout the years together, which continued through the Tuesday closing. Thank you for all that you did to make our years in Las Vegas fun, meaningful and rewarding.  The Las Vegas sale and the planned dispositions this year is a continuation of our capital recycling program. By the end of the year we’ll approach $3 billion in property sales since 2011. We have consistently sold older, non-core properties and replaced them with more current and competitive properties. This effort has increased our revenue per apartment from a $1042 per month to $1566 per month, improving the quality and strength of our resident base. We're not calling a top to the multi-family market with our sales, we're simply taking advantage of the market opportunity to improve the quality of our properties, reinvest in development on a significant cash-flow positive basis, pay down debt, and return capital to shareholders. Our increase in disposition guidance was driven primarily by a significant increase in institutional investor interest in our Las Vegas portfolio. We received numerous unsolicited offers for the portfolio at prices higher than we expected. We ran an auction process and were successful bringing the portfolio to market and closing it quickly. We did not include the sale in our original 2016 guidance because we thought doing so would reduce our negotiating position.  The decision to exit Las Vegas was a balance between losing the market with above average NOI growth in the near term versus the long-term challenges that Las Vegas faces. Whitman Associates ranks Las Vegas into the bottom of their market rankings over the next five years. We believe that we were paid well and in advance for the loss of the near-term net operating income growth. Overall, multi-family fundamentals continue to be strong and above long-term trend among most of our markets with 10 of our 15 markets exceeding 5.5% revenue growth. Washington DC and Houston performed as expected during the quarter. Houston feels a little worse than our last call. The jury’s still out on the market. The good news is construction lending for new development has come to a near stop in Houston.  Our development properties are leasing up on schedule and at better lease rates than projected. As we discussed on our previous calls we are slowing the growth in our development pipeline taking a more defensive position at this point in the cycle. I want to give a big shout out to all Camden team members for another great quarter by providing living-in-excellence to our customers. I’ll turn the call over to Keith Oden now. 
D. Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. We're pleased with the way 2016 has started. With same store revenue growth of 4.9% which was actually slightly higher than the first quarter of last year which came in at 4.6%. Our top five markets had revenue growth of better than 8%; Tampa at 10.1%; Dallas, 8.7%; Orlando, 8.3%; San Diego, 8.2%; and Phoenix at 8.1%. As expected our two weakest markets were Houston at 4/10th's of a percent growth and DC Metro at 7/10th growth.  We're well positioned to have another really good year in 2016. For the first quarter same store average rents on new leases were up 6/10th of a percent and up 6.3% on renewals compared to first quarter of last year which had new leases up 1.3% and renewals up at the same level of 6.3%. For April new leases were up 2% with renewals at 6%. May and June renewals have gone out with 6.7% average increases.  Overall our same store portfolio averaged 95.4% last quarter in occupancy compared to 95.5% for the first quarter of 2015. Occupancy in April averaged 95.4% versus 95.9% last April. Qualified traffic remains strong in all of Camden’s markets and despite another year of fairly aggressive renewal rate increases, our occupancy rates remain at the upper end of our historical range. In part this is due to the low net turnover rates which at 43% for the quarter tied to lowest net turnover rate we’ve ever reported.  14.3% of our residents moved out to purchase homes in the quarter and that compares to 14.8% last quarter and 14.3% for the full year of 2015. Our resident’s financial health remains strong as our average rent as a percentage of household income was 17.8% for the quarter.  Finally since our last conference call we learned that we were once again included in Fortune Magazine's list of the 100 best places to work. In fact we moved up on the list from number 10 to number 9 this year. Nine straight years on the list, six years in the top 10 which is a rarity, and all the years Fortune has compiled the list only 9 companies have been in the top 10 six or more times. We claim this on our own behalf of our all real estate investment trust and we give credit to our Camden team which has allowed us to achieve our vision of creating a great workplace. I’ll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer. 
Alexander Jessett: Thanks Keith last night we reported first quarter 2016 operating results, detailed the disposition of our 4918 unit Las Vegas portfolio, and the planned disposition of $400 million to $600 million of additional multifamily communities, and revise our full year 2016 guidance accordingly. Moving first to operating results, for the first quarter we reported FFO of a $110.1 million or $1.20 per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.02. This $0.02 outperformance was primarily due to $0.01 in higher same store net operating income resulting half from higher miscellaneous property level fee income and half from lower expenses resulting from the timing of certain repair and maintenance projects, lower employee benefit cost, and lower common area electrical cost.  As a reminder on last quarter's call we anticipated certain insurance reimbursements to occur on the first quarter. Those reimbursements occurred as anticipated and accounted for the quarter-over-quarter and sequential decline in property insurance. $0.05 and higher net operating income from our development and non same store communities and a $0.05 from the unbudgeted gain on sale of 6.3 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to an operating community in Tampa.  Last night we also detailed a disposition of our Las Vegas portfolio for $630 million. This portfolio of 4918 operating units was on average 23 years old, approximately twice the average age of our total portfolio. At average revenue of 1060 per door versus 1524 per door for our total portfolio, and at average CAPEX per door of almost $1500. The completion of this transaction significantly improved Camden’s portfolio. Using the actual CAPEX, this disposition was completed at an approximate 4.75% AFFO yield generating a 10.7% unleveraged IRR over an 18-year hold period.  Based on a broker cap rate which assumes $350 per door in CAPEX and a 3% management fee on trailing 12 months NOI, the cap rate would be 5.4%. Last night we also announced the planned disposition of another $400 million to $600 million of operating assets. We are currently marketing approximately $500 million of individual assets and may add or substract communities at the margin. Four assets are located in Florida, one in Maryland, one in Texas, and one in Southern California. These disposition candidates are on average 29 years old and have lower rents with higher CAPEX then the rest of our portfolio.  The anticipated average AFFO yield on this group of assets is approximately 5% and we anticipate the sales to occur in the third quarter of 2016. If all of these dispositions occur as scheduled we are forecasting a special dividend of $4.25 to $5.25 per share with approximately 90% paid in the third quarter of 2016 and the remaining paid in early 2017 upon completion of our final year-end tax analysis. We had the ability to absorb approximately $250 million in tax gains in 2016 prior to the Las Vegas transaction which generated gains of approximately $375 million. Of the remaining 216 dispositions the tax gain is approximately 60% of the total proceeds.  Our already strong capital position will be significantly improved upon completion of these transactions. Of the $1.1 billion at the midpoint in expected dispositions, approximately $425 million will be returned to shareholders in the form of a special dividend and the remaining $675 million will be used to retire debt and prefund in entirety the $245 million remaining to be spent on our current $916 million development pipeline. By year-end 2016 our anticipated net debt-to-EBITDA will be approximately 4.5 times.  Moving on to revised 2016 earnings guidance, we now expect 2016 FFO per share to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 with a midpoint of $4.55 representing a $0.30 per share decrease over our prior 2016 guidance. The major assumptions and components of this $0.30 per share decrease in FFO at the midpoint of our guidance range are as follows: a $0.42 per share decrease in FFO related to lost NOI from our completed and planned 2016 dispositions, partially offset by an $0.08 per share increase in FFO due to a lower interest expense as we will use part of the proceeds to pay off all outstanding balances under our lines of credit which currently total $340 million, and we will no longer need to complete a previously forecasted mid-year $250 million bond transaction. And a $0.02 per share increase in FFO related to net operating income from our development communities which are leasing ahead of schedule and finally, a $0.02 per share increase from interest income earned on invested cash proceeds combined with slightly lower overhead costs and the unbudgeted first quarter gain on sale of land.  Last night we also provided a revised full year 2016 same store guidance. This guidance is based on the removable from same store for the full year of 2016 of both the Las Vegas portfolio and the remaining 2016 dispositions. In the aggregate these disposition communities were forecasted to deliver same store revenue growth of just under 8%, expense growth of 5.5%, and NOI growth of approximately 9%. The full year removal from same store of the communities which have sold and the anticipated full year removal from same store of the communities being marketed reduces our anticipated revenue growth by 40 basis points. The remaining 10 basis points in low revenue is the result of our typical quarterly reforecast of same store expectations. Our revised 2016 full year same store guidance is as follows: revenue of 3.6% and 4.6%; expenses of 3.25% to 4.25%; and NOI of 3.5% to 5%. The reduction in anticipated same store expenses is driven primarily by successful insurance renewal, successful property tax appeals, and lower than anticipated common area electrical cost. Last night we also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2016. We expect FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.13 to $1.17.  After excluding the first quarter gain on sale of land, the midpoint of $1.15 represents $0.045 per share decrease in the first quarter of 2016 which is primarily the result of an approximate 1% or $0.02 per share of expected sequential increase in same store NOI as revenue growth from the combination of higher rental and fee income as we move into our peak leasing periods more than offsets our expected increase in other property expenses due to normal seasonal summer increases in utility and repair maintenance costs and the first quarter of 2016 favorable property insurance refund.  An approximate $0.01 per share increase in NOI from our six communities in lease up and approximate 1% per share increase in the FFO resulting from lower overhead costs, and an approximate $0.005 per share increase in FFO due to lower interest expenses. This $0.045 per share aggregate improvement in FFO is more than offset by an approximate $0.07 per share decrease in FFO resulting from the April 26 disposition of our Las Vegas portfolio and an approximate $0.02 per share decrease in FFO resulting from lower occupancy at our non-same store student housing community in Corpus Christi, Texas. Occupancy declined significantly from May through August in this community. At this time we will open the call up to questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citigroup. Please go ahead. 
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks, I am wondering if you can talk about the flexibility in terms of the user proceeds from the asset sales. I know in the past you have talked about volatility of the stock over the last year. So what's your appetite in potential for share repurchases if there is actually attractive opportunities?
Alexander Jessett: Well the share repurchases we have been consistent on that and the discount has to be persistent and the volatility again has been pretty amazing when you think about the change in stock prices over the last three months. We are consistent with that, if the market does allow us to buy stock and sell assets and then buy stock we will do that. The bottom line is the challenge you had is this volatility in the stock price and it does take a while to sell assets. We will not sell assets and/or buy stock and then sell assets. So it is just a timing issue. Clearly when you look at investments, the investment alternatives when the stock is trading you see getting discount and you can acquire the stock and make an arbitrage between the private market and the public market, that’s a good thing to do. We just haven't been able to do it because of the timing of everything. 
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks and then appreciate all the color on the guidance changes but once you get through the timing impact of the dispositions, what's the right quarterly run rate going forward in terms of FFO?
Alexander Jessett: Well, you really have to sort of look out towards the fourth quarter of the year and once you do all that the math is going to get you somewhere around sort of the $1.10 plus or minus range.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks and then just finally you mentioned the unsolicited imbounding course for the portfolio, were any of those for the company overall?
Alexander Jessett: They were not. No. 
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead. 
Robert Stevenson: Good morning guys, can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing in the DC market in terms of maybe some bifurcation between any of the sub markets, anything sort of sticking out to you is better or worse in that market then you were expecting given some of the supply and operating dynamics there?
Richard J. Campo: So when we went into this year and the letter grade that we gave DC was a C plus and improving. And that still seems about right. If anything maybe the C plus becomes a B minus. So in conversations with our folks on the ground there I think there is probably a little bit more optimism then when they put their original plan together. But I think that’s still in the right zone for what we’re seeing in DC this year. Obviously the first quarter at up 7/10s on revenue that was in line with what we expected it to be. But it does feel like there is a little bit more traction, our traffic has been good, our closing percentages have been in the range that we expect to see them.  In terms of the markets overall it is more driven by what's going on in your neighborhood than it is suburban, our metro DC versus DC proper. If you happen to have a lease up or two there are in your market area then you are feeling much more of an impact then if you are not. So when you actually just bifurcate it between the DC proper and DC metro there is not enough change to make any difference. But if you bifurcate it between what's going on, do you have a competitive set that is in a lease up then it matters. And so that’s more of the impact that we’re seeing. But I would say overall DC feels a little bit better then it probably did even four or five months ago. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay, then second question, have you guys thought about -- you guys have 22 assets I guess in joint ventures today, did you guys think about liquidating some of the joint venture assets, breaking those to market, and going that way with the dispositions as well?
Richard J. Campo: No we didn’t the joint venture is with Texas Teachers and its one partner and Texas Teachers really likes your cash flow and the return that they’re getting on the cash flow, and the challenge you have with selling assets and bringing cash in is where do you invest it and when you think about the investment risk of having to reinvest in this market, it’s just more difficult. So they would much rather hold and harvest cash flow than take that reinvestment risk. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, guys, its Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. I was just curious if you could comment on the impetus to increase the dispositions this year and then just give a little bit of color around the buyer pool, maybe for both the Las Vegas portfolio as well as these individual asset sales you're planning. 
Alexander Jessett: Sure. The market is very, very buoyant from a pricing perspective, and when we looked at the Las Vegas asset sale and we're going to be put in a position of doing a special dividend anyway, we looked at it and said it makes sense for us in this part of the market to continue to create value by selling our older, less productive assets. And I think part of the thing that’s missed here is we all look at NOI growth and we're giving up high NOI growth properties. We're also giving up high CAPEX properties, properties that are actually growing on a return on invested capital basis at a slower rate than the overall portfolio. So it really allows us to kind of step that up in a very positive market environment.  In terms of the Las Vegas competition we had sort of the -– you can -– you could, I'm sure, put the list together of names that were involved. There was an article in a realty review I think it was that listed some of the potential buyers and so they were -– it was very widely marketed to great investor group that sort of, I think, validates that we're not at the top of the multi-family market because they, I don’t think, would be buyers if we were. So with that said we're not going to comment specifically on who bought it but there is some press out there that will give you a lot better detail on that. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks and then just kind of your comments on CAPEX leads into my next question here. When you look at the residual portfolio, what type of numbers should we be thinking about for CAPEX going forward?
Alexander Jessett: Yes, I think if you look at the -– if you look at where we are today and you strip out everything we saw, it’s going to bring our total CAPEX to somewhere around $39 per door. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for that. And then just last one from me, Ric, you mentioned in your opening remarks about Houston feeling a little bit worse. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail around that and then just give us some operating trends subsequent to quarter end.
Richard J. Campo: Well, the feeling of being a little worse is when you look at the job numbers that happened in the first quarter, they’re a little less than we had thought they would be. And the – even though energy prices have -– are at higher levels than they were, there's just still a lot of property coming online and we just -– you just sort of feel like there's -– that it’s just not as plain as it was. And quite frankly we were all sort of shocked that it was as good as it was last year and I think part of that is simply the inertia that a city this big, 6.6 million people that have been adding -– that’s been adding in last 10 years, Houston added 1.3 million people to the economy herein. So there's a lot of that inertia that just sort of kept going and now that inertia is slowing a bit. I’ll let Keith kind of fill into that as well.
D. Keith Oden: Yes, I just to put a little perspective around kind of the “the feeling” and its feeling worse. If you’ll recall when we did our walk through the markets in the first quarter, I gave Houston – we gave Houston a C and declining, which is –- so the inference from that is, is that you would feel worse every quarter because it’s a declining market. And starting from a C that’s a pretty harsh rate for at first our portfolio. So it’s not like we were not really cautious about what we were going to likely to see in Houston this year. And its – to put it in perspective we did as Alex mentioned and when we went back through our reforecast, as we do every quarter, the revision to Houston -– and by the way, Houston actually outperformed their budget for the first quarter. So it was a -– it’s not like we were surprised by anything in the first quarter, they actually did a little bit better.  The revision for Houston in those numbers is roughly $400,000 and you’re talking about on a $110 million revenue number. So what we said at the beginning of the year and the guidance we gave was that we thought that Houston's revenues overall would be flat and that is still what we expect to see. In fact even with this revision in my book it still rounds to flat. But it is not like we had any rosecar glasses on but what we were going to encounter in Houston this year. And its playing out pretty well and in accordance with how we thought it would. So, we think we got a fence around the competitive set and the lease ups that we are going to have to deal with and the inventory that’s coming online and obviously everyone is dramatically revised their job growth projections where our two data providers for Houston this year if you average the two that we use its somewhere around 12,000 to 15,000 jobs for the year which is kind of a rounding error in Houston. And we still got 22,000 apartments to deal with in terms of new supply. So I think as the year unfolds I think we got -- we have it properly surrounded and my guess is we will slightly worse in the third quarter than we do today because we are in a declining market. 
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s fair, thanks for the comments. 
Richard J. Campo: You bet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. 
Richard Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I guess maybe to you Keith, how much do you think a parallel can be made between your experience in DC and what you are going through now in Houston, obviously different inputs as to why things have weakened but do you think you can expect a similar timeline in terms of it pivoting to a recovery that you’re experiencing in DC?
Richard J. Campo: In DC it was sort of a slow motion grind down and it was a combination of you always felt like you just had a 1000 or 1500 too many apartments for the job growth that was being generated. Houston is more – if just kind of -- and if you look at the decline in the glide slope in DC and then sort of the modest recovery that we’re seeing we are getting some traction there. That feels like a four year or five year unfolding of a scenario. You look back at Houston last year, we were still throughout the year we held it pretty well. We had mid single-digits revenue growth and here we are flat. So that feels a lot more sudden and jolting than what we saw in Washington DC. And the reason for the caution that you hear from us and heard in our guidance is that it needs to stop getting worse before it can get better and we’re still seeing pretty substantial job losses in the energy sector.  Obviously the recovery in crude oil prices in the last 45 days have given people a little hope for that maybe the worst is over but the reality is that $45 a barrel you are not going to see much difference in activity and you still have the Chevrons and Exxons of the world who are still downsizing. Now fortunately for Houston most of that has been in their footprint around the globe and a not a lot of it in Houston. But in that environment where major employers in your city whether the lay-offs are hitting Houston or not, they act differently and their employee base acts differently. So this feels different than DC to me and we’ll see how it plays out through 2016. 
D. Keith Oden: I think the other big difference between Houston and DC is that we shutdown supply and DC didn’t shutdown supply. That was one of the big issues. You continue to build new properties in DC and supply just kept chugging along. Here if you can get a construction loan you are one lucky developer in Houston, Texas today. And maybe it’s a 40% construction loan and 60% equity with the pristine developers getting that kind of deals but other than that it is done. You are not building a project in Houston, Texas today unlike in DC where we have been delivering 10,000 units a year in a slow growth environment. So the good news here is that once the market bottoms, you don’t have the supply pressure that DC has. So it could be a pretty robust recovery when we fill up these units that are coming online now. 
Richard Anderson: That was going to be my next question. If it could bounce back as fast as it bounced down and I guess you are kind of saying that if things kind of fall into place. And then maybe just one broad question. You identified that Las Vegas is older and higher CAPEX and all that, is there any other markets in your portfolio that exhibit similar type of drags on those measures relative to the rest of your portfolio?
Richard J. Campo: No, there really aren’t. The delta between the average run rate in Las Vegas and our average portfolio of $500 a door doesn’t -- there's -- we don’t have any other market that comes close to that.
Richard Anderson: Okay, great. Thank you.
Richard J. Campo: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning, down there. Just a few quick questions; first, on the common dividend going forward, Alex, the $1.10 a quarter you mentioned that would seem enough to sustain the $3 dividend but obviously the coverage would be a little tighter than it’s been over the past several years. Your intention is to maintain the dividend or should people expect a resizing?
Alexander Jessett: No, no, we feel comfortable with the coverage where we have today and then obviously we anticipate that we're going to have organic growth in 2017 from developments and so we feel very comfortable with where we are right now. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then on the $425 million to $525 million special, is that -- the range is more tax planning based or ultimate disposition amount based?
Alexander Jessett: So if you think about the midpoint of that range, that’s based upon what we currently expect for our tax planning assuming another $500 million is sold. Obviously, the ups and downs in that can account for a couple of things, number one, whether or not any -– we have any changes in our tax planning and number two, whether we add or subtract assets at the margin, which we might do. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then finally, Ric, you mentioned construction lending. Given all the increased talk with Basel III and I guess they’re called high volatility loans and whatever, the regulators are terming, resi construction loans, is your view that construction lending overall is materially getting a lot harder for everyone or is this really just for the smaller players, in which case, the bigger players are probably unaffected but suffice to say we may see a change in the price of land going forward?
Richard J. Campo: I think it’s getting -– the construction loans are getting more difficult for everyone, not just pristine borrowers. It’s because you have the classic situation of -– the banks have to put a higher capital reserve involved in the -- because of the Basel III. And I've heard we were at ULI last couple of weeks ago and that was one of the big discussion points was that the best developers are having more trouble getting construction loans today because of those Basel III issues and risk capital issues. So I don’t think it’s just the small guys, I think it’s across the Board. And if you look at sort of some of the industry analysts like Ron Witten who is projecting that the multi-family construction is peaking in 2016 and then going to be lower in 2017 and going forward and part of that is just the pressure on construction loans, one of the pressure points besides land and cost, the availability of workers and the like. So I think it’s a broad-broad issue around the country. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
John Kim: Good morning. Ric, I read in the press of your increased concerns, the U.S. economy may be heading towards recession which may explain the disposition guidance. Can you just elaborate on this and are you concerned more about slowing job growth or assets that are being mispriced today?
Richard J. Campo: I’m more concerned about just the length of the recovery that we've been in. So my 40 years in this business we've had six major recessions through that period of time, through my business career. And the longest recovery we had was 1993 through 2001, eight years. And now we're six years into this recovery and so when you think about the cycle, maybe the -– lot of folks who think the cycle is going to be longer because it took so long to get out of the recovery.  On the other hand, who knows. So we're clearly not in the first part of a recovery and of a cycle. So we're not, I'm not sure whether we're at the top or on the way down but bottom line is when you get this long into the cycle, you have to start being – we fundamentally believe you have to start being a little more defensive, you have to have less capital with capita committed that isn’t prefunded. And you have to keep your debt at levels that if you are -– that could allow you to be opportunistic if in fact the cycle does come. We know that the business cycle is alive and well and will happen and unfortunately none of us know when and so at this point we are definitely more defensive than we would be otherwise. 
John Kim: It seems like outside of DC and Houston many of your markets will be having accelerating job growth over the next years at least some prediction. Do you not share that view?
Richard J. Campo: I do share that view, absolutely. If you look at the supply and demand dynamics at Houston and DC it’s a great market. We have millennials, we have empty nesters moving into the urban core, single family homes are still hard to buy and to get loans for. So the background for multifamily is really good and we are not disputing that. The issue to me is that we are six years into the cycle and it is something outside of the U.S. going to change people's view of the world. I think negative interest rates around the globe, commodity prices, you name it terrorism, whatever. At the end of the day if we are wrong we are going to be conservative and our cash flow does not grow as much because of that because we are selling assets. But at the end of the day it is just for us the time is right to be a little more defensive.
Alexander Jessett: And John I will just add to that its always at this point in the cycle it comes down to a race between the growth in NOI and the potential change in cap rates. And while we have seen these kinds of NOI growth rates many times before, probably four or five times before as a public company. We have never seen cap rates like this. So the question is, you got to look at both ways. Yes, cash flows are continuing to grow, how much longer and how much higher that’s a question mark. And then the flip side of that is what happens to cap rates. It doesn’t take much change in cap rates to blow up another 5% NOI growth. 
John Kim: Right, okay. Thank you. 
Operator: And our next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. 
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Can you just walk us through the process of selling Vegas, when did the process start and what were your initial expectations for pricing?
Alexander Jessett: Yes, so we actually started this process in October of 2015. And by that I mean getting data together and betting who we were going to use as the intermediary. So that’s when we started the process. When we set out to put the portfolio together and go down the marketing trail we were in the 610 to 620 sort of what we thought the strike price would be. And then as we refined our numbers the market seemed like it got stronger. Over the course of our marketing period, our team in Las Vegas continued to put up increasing cash flow numbers. We did Las Vegas for the first quarter was over 7% revenue growth and so all that factored in, we ended up really on the high end of what we thought the trading range would be at the 630 million. 
John Pawlowski: Okay and then lastly how did you arrive at the 60% 40% split between debt pay down, development prefunding, and special dividend and why is that the appropriate mix?
Alexander Jessett: Special dividend is a function of required dividend based on taxes and then the balance of it was a function of knowing. It is sort of just the math, right. You know what your special dividend is. You take the total cash minus the special dividend and then you know where you are funding for development is and this plug was pay debt. 
John Pawlowski: Okay, understood. Thank you. 
Alexander Jessett: You bet. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Janet Ghulam [ph] of Banc of America. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Just a quick follow up on your comments regarding the transaction market. Does pricing suggest a portfolio premium or discount and then for the assets that you are marketing now are you packaging them or are they all one off?
Richard J. Campo: The market does I think there is a premium for portfolios today definitely. If the portfolio is a cohesive portfolio that makes sense. And so with said we do believe we got a premium for the Las Vegas portfolio. In terms of the other assets, some are being packaged. We have some buyers that are talking about putting various properties together within the same submarkets. But as Alex went through the properties are from coast to coast and those tend do not be real constructive for a portfolio of sale. Some people might like Florida, some don’t, some like California, some don’t. So it’s more likely to be more one off or clusters of properties. 
Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. And then maybe just on Tampa and Orlando which were very impressive and it doesn’t look like those markets will see supply meaningfully increase. Do you think that they can continue at these high-single-digit levels for the year?
Alexander Jessett: We have very aggressive budgets on both Tampa and Orlando, and our original -– in our original guidance we had Orlando as an A minus and improving. We had Tampa as also as an A minus and improving. So if that rolls out through the year then A minus improving turns into an A and that’s pretty high. It’s pretty high grading in our world. 
Unidentified Analyst : Thank you.
Richard J. Campo: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
Richard Hightower: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Quick question about the move out for home purchase rate, I think it was 14.3% per the prepared comments and it’s a little bit lower than a year ago. We have seen mortgage rates come down pretty meaningfully since the beginning of the year. Do you see that as becoming an increasing risk in certain markets as time goes on here with rates a little bit lower?
Richard J. Campo: What I'm surprised about is that we're still below 15% in our portfolio. If somebody had told me four years ago that we would be four years down the road in a recovery and we still wouldn’t be back to 15% move outs to purchase homes, I would say, “You’re nuts.” Now we had always believed that the home ownership rate was going to fall and fall meaningfully and we originally were one of the first ones to kind of put out numbers like 63.5%, we thought we would get to, well, we got to that. And we're sort of rocking around right now between 63.5% and 63.7% home ownership rate. But that compares to the peak and in 2007 of roughly 68% -- 68.5%. So we are well-well off of the levels that we saw in at the end of the last cycle. So what's surprising to me is that with the low mortgage rates, also with the increases that we've seen in rents in terms of overall affordability of homes that we don’t see a higher home ownership rate.  Now, there are obviously other factors that get into that. There’s the recent effect of all of the carnage and the single-family housing market that many of the people who are at their prime home buying age right now, kind of saw and lived through. Clearly there's a preference that’s being played out by a lot of our prime age renters for the flexibility that goes with renting versus home ownership. And then on top of that and finally to that you have a locational preference of people want to live closer to where they work and play, and in most cases that means near the urban core and in most cases that means renting is the preferred option. So that means all of that stuff but regardless of which one, kind of how you push and pull it, 14.3% move outs to home ownership rate still strikes me as a shocking number for our portfolio. 
Alexander Jessett: I would argue that if we got to 18% that we would have a reacceleration of growth across our markets and our cash flow would grow. So 14% tells me that the market is not building enough houses, the economy is not doing as well as it could do if you're building a million single-family houses every year, and so to me, the getting to 18% and a more constructive single-family housing market is better for apartments, better for Camden, and will create another leg up in the apartment rental cycle. 
Richard Hightower: That’s an interesting perspective. Thanks for that. And then just one quick follow up on Houston. I think the question was asked earlier about new and renewals that you are seeing today. I didn’t quite catch the answer but if you could provide that info and then maybe on top of that ball park if and when you think the market goes negative in terms of same store revenues overall?
Alexander Jessett: Yes, it’s on the -- same store revenues, so we're plus 6 or 4/10ths for the quarter. I would be surprised if it weren’t either light second quarter or the mid-to-light second quarter that we’d probably see a negative number. In terms of where we are year-to-date, we were at about minus 6 on new leases but plus 3 on renewals. So you do the math on that where we got about 60% of renewal rate in Houston, about 40% move out rate. So you do the math on that and we’re heading towards a negative same store revenue number for sure.
Richard Hightower: Alright, thanks for the info there. 
Richard J. Campo: You bet. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. 
Drew Babin: Good afternoon. Referring to your comments about the macro economy and also obviously with a lot of capital coming in with assets sales, how should we think about your "shadow" development pipeline opportunities and whether should we read that less of those will maybe started in the near term, is there any way we should kind of change our thinking there?
Alexander Jessett: We’ve put it in our guidance zero to $200 million this year and we still think that moderate development makes sense and to the extent that we do have a shadow pipeline that we can bring online. We are likely not to change this numbers this year, but next year depending upon what happens we can do another 200 million to 250 million of development without any trouble. We are not accelerating the development pipeline but it definitely is waning. 
Drew Babin: That’s helpful, thank you, and I am also curious to get your thoughts given that you do have a number of CDD assets but majority of your portfolios in suburban markets whether there is anything kind of magical about the urban versus suburban relationship vis-à-vis new supply job growth and other benefits to market?
Richard J. Campo: Early in the cycle our urban property there are more urban developments in suburban but now in the cycle the suburban markets have caught up and you have plenty of development in the suburban markets as well. We have always believed that you should have a balanced portfolio both geographically and market balance from urban to suburban A to B. That way you lower the volatility of the cash flow overtime and its working very well for us. It doesn’t seem to be a dramatic difference between I guess within each market there is probably some dynamics that are different but generally speaking we are not seeing a big difference between As and Bs right now. 
Drew Babin: Great, thank you very much. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC. Please go ahead. 
Wes Golladay: Hello everyone, when you talk to energy executives you have obviously had a nice rebound in the price of oil, do you think this will make them more comfortable maybe not to the point where they hire re-pass the mass layoff at this point. 
Richard J. Campo: Clearly there has been a lot of layoff so far and the question when you talk to energy executives is so where are you in the cycle. And they are guardedly optimistic but at the end of the day I don’t think we are out of the layoff cycle. It might be less this year than it was last year. But it is going to continue until you have more stability in that oil price. I mean sort of like the volatility you looked at over the last three months it’s been pretty volatile. 
Alexander Jessett: And I would just add to that when I talk to the folks in the energy business they don’t whether the price of oil is at 35 or 45 is really not a big difference making in their way they process it. And the thing that they look at and then we have always looked at most carefully is rig count. And if you look at the rig count we’re at a 30 year low on rig count and it has not stopped falling. I mean it is not falling precipitously but every week you get another five rigs taken out of the mix and we’re down from 1800 working rigs down to somewhere around the 700 level. I think these are dramatic changes and so until you start to see a stop in the fall of the rig count and recovery there that all the rest of its just sort of background noise. 
Wes Golladay: Okay, that’s a great point and then when you look at some of your energy workers that live in your communities, is there typically lag effect from when they get their layoff notice imagine they have a severance package, you probably want to maintain their credit way to the lease expiration are you noticing an uptick in move outs and the typical lag period from the layoff?
Richard J. Campo: You know we have seen some of that but not a dramatic exodus because the layoffs from energy and part of it is that when you think of layoff they tend to layoff the older people first because they are the highest paid and they keep their young kind of best and brightest. And so the millennial that lives at Camden in Houston is a little more insulated from the layoff than the 45 to 55 year old getting laid off and that 45 to 55 year old is in house in West Houston on the west side and with their severance and with all the help that the energy companies are doing for their laid off employees, these people are just staying in their homes and looking for new jobs. So we haven’t had a mass exodus or major sort of blip in our move outs because of layoffs. We had some for sure but not dramatically. 
Wes Golladay: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Vincent Chao: Hey everyone. Just want to go back to the dispositions again. So with the Vegas portfolio it sounds like you got some reverse inquiries, some accelerating interest in that market. Just curious on the subsequent portfolio that’s being put up for sale, I mean are you just seeing an overall acceleration in demand for some of the more secondary markets and maybe some of the older assets that are out there or was that more specific to Vegas?
Alexander Jessett: Well, it’s pretty much a consistent demand and I would say that the demand for older properties with sort of higher cash flow is definitely in vogue. I mean the challenge you have with the top-of-the-market properties in every single market is that you're talking four – high threes and low four cap rates, and those are a little harder for buyers. You have to be very institutional in order to buy a sub-three cap rate or a sub-four cap rate in Austin, Texas for example or in Downtown Tampa. But when you buy a 29-year old asset you can get a five and some change cap rate. And then the other thing that these buyers do is they grossly underestimate CAPEX and they kid themselves and think that even though they’re buying a $1,500 to $1,600 per door CAPEX, they use a $350 or $500 in their underwriting criteria. And then those cash flows look really good when you don’t include the entire CAPEX. So there’s still a major bid out there for leveraged real estate or multi-family transactions at the age that we're selling them. So it hasn’t really increased, it’s just been a constant wave of capital that has been in the market for a long time.
Richard J. Campo: The response to the second group of assets that we're in the market with right now has been really very strong. 
Vincent Chao: Got it. Okay, I guess what I'm trying to understand is the demand has been consistent. I think I heard with the Vegas transaction happening you’re already are going to pay a special dividend, so it may sound like, hey, this is an opportunity to accelerate the quality improvement and sell some more assets. Was that really the only driver then? I mean if demand spiked up and you saw an opportunity that might make some sense but is it just…
Alexander Jessett: Well, its – that is the driver but it’s also the place we are in cycle. I mean we are six years into the recovery and we've got supply and demand doing really well in all these markets. But we are peaking in multi-family supplies around the country. Every major market has had an increase in supply. So with that said even though we're – so we've harvested lots of cash flow growth in these properties and we think it’s time to take a more defensive position and that’s why we are increasing sales as well.
Richard J. Campo: Yes, and the respond -– I mean the truth is that this response that we got from our Vegas portfolio, this group of 29-year old assets in Las Vegas that are sort of that -– the screen at the bottom of our -– bottom tier of our portfolio was very encouraging and that has carried over for that genre of assets. And the pool that we're in the market with right now looks a whole lot like the Las Vegas assets writ large. I mean they’re obviously, they are older assets, they have higher CapEx needs that we have to address in a different way than a new buyer would, and if you kind of think about the -– Alex gave you the cap rate on the Las Vegas portfolio, the AFFO cap rate that we use, I think that’s the best way to look at it, was 4.75 and the cap rate on this second wave is about 5%. These are unprecedented cap rates for this for that vintage of assets in my career. 
Alexander Jessett: And of course it’s all being driven by incredibly low interest rates. I mean most of the buyers are using floating rate debt and there's – and that floating rate debt is plentiful out there, it’s not being impacted by the banks because the banks aren’t the ones providing. It’s Freddie and Fannie and insurance and others. And so what's driving pricing is the wall of capital and the unprecedented low interest rates.
Vincent Chao: Okay. Thanks for that color. And just maybe one other question on different topic, just we talked about the strength of the Tampa market in Orlando, you did sell some land in Tampa so just curious if there is something about that land that just didn’t work?
Richard J. Campo: The land was a part of a transaction. It was adjacent to a development that we built and it was always non-core land and you couldn’t built multifamily on it so we sold it to another developer. 
Vincent Chao: Got it, thank you. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please go ahead. 
Ross Nussbaum: Hey guys, its Ross Nussbaum here with Nick. How are you thinking about your portfolio NOI contributions following all these asset sales. In particular I guess I am imagining your Houston and DC exposures tick up a bit. How do you think about -- do you think about taking those back down overtime or your comfortable with higher concentration to your top markets?
Richard J. Campo: They do tick up slightly. It is not a huge difference on DC and Houston. Actually one of the dispo assets is a DC metro asset so once you net that out it’s a not a big change. Ultimately and we said this before we would like our exposure in DC metro to trend downward. We are comfortable with where we are right now but I would expect that over the next three to five years by just our normal process of selling assets that need to find a new home our DC metro exposure probably will come down. Houston probably will also come down again if you just think about what we have in our pipeline here. We only have one asset that’s under construction in the Houston market. We have two other parcels of land. They are kind of on hold right now, so it is not like we have a large backlog of projects in Houston. The likelihood that we would be doing on balance sheet acquisitions in Houston in the near term is not very high. We would obviously like to sell into a better environment then what we have right now in Houston. But I think overtime you would expect to see both of those concentrations come down some.
Ross Nussbaum: Okay appreciate it, I think we all have to got to go over to Amco call but I am curious what you think of Will Fuller being a receiver now?
Richard J. Campo: We are absolutely full of optimism. Jackson [ph] was my guy but Fuller he is a horse so I am happy with it. 
Ross Nussbaum: Well you can’t do much worse than last season so good luck.
D. Keith Oden: Speed is cool and great. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Tom Lesnick of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead. 
Thomas Lesnick: Hey guys, I know we are getting towards the end of the call so I’ll be brief but just wanted to hone in on some of the components of same store. First on the expense side, I know you talked about the revision being attributable to tax appeals, insurance, and utility cost, could you break that down a little bit more and kind of provide some context as to the ratable contribution of each?
Alexander Jessett: Absolutely, so approximately half of it is from insurance. We just completed our annual renewal and we are very, very successful on that side. Of the remaining half about half of that comes from taxes and the rest comes from miscellaneous things which includes lower commonary electrical cost. 
Thomas Lesnick: Got it and then Denver in particular stood out on a negative same store expense line this quarter, anything in particular driving that?
Richard J. Campo: Absolutely, so it was due to some large property tax refunds that we got in the first quarter of this year.
Thomas Lesnick: Got it and then on the overall NOI, I know you said about 10 basis points was due to a reforecast of expectations. As you kind of think about the first quarter and the trajectory of effective rent growth through the first few months of the year, how are you guys viewing seasonality right now as opposed to last year and could you provide any kind of month-by-month commentary, like was January and February strong and then it kind of fell off in March or vice versa anything along those lines. 
Alexander Jessett: No, it is just very normal seasonal patterns. There really is no anomaly to this or seasonal pattern going from fourth quarter into the first and into the second at this point. 
Thomas Lesnick: Alright, thanks guys. Appreciate it. 
Richard J. Campo: You bet. 
Operator: And our final question today will come from Gilles Marchand of Knights of Columbus. Please go ahead. 
Gilles Marchand: Hi, have you earmarked any particular debt issues that you are going to pay with this cash inflow from Las Vegas?
Alexander Jessett: So, what we are going to first of all is we are going to repay the line of credit and so we will do that and it currently has about 340 million outstanding. And then we have got the next debt that we have coming due is May of 2017 and so effectively we will be holding cash to repay that at maturity. At this point we don’t intend on prepaying early any of our fixed rate debt.
Gilles Marchand: Alright, thank you. 
Richard J. Campo: Thank you. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. 
Richard J. Campo: We appreciate your time today. I know there is another call so thank you and we will see you at NAREIT.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. For those of you who listened to our whole music prior to the call, you heard songs from ZZ Top, Beyoncé, Kenny Rogers, Archie Bell & The Drells and Robert Earl Keen. These five artists have one trait in common. If you can identify the unifying trail of these musicians, please e-mail me now at kcallahan@camdenliving.com. The first person with the correct answer gets a shout out on today's call and the opportunity to help select music for our next call. Now for the business at hand. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making Forward-Looking Statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them.

As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2015 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind everyone that it is our company's policy not to comment on market speculation or rumors. An article was published earlier this week regarding a potential sale of several Camden communities. At this time, we have no comment on that article and as such we will not respond to questions related to the content of that article on today's call. We will try to be brief in our prepared remarks and complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have additional items to discuss. Just a heads up, we already has 14 people in the queue, so it might be a little bit longer. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today would be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Thanks, Kim and good morning. To most of you, good afternoon in New York. I want to first give a shot out to our Camden team members who work smart and with integrity to produce another solid year of growth and improved portfolio and strong balance sheet for the company. In 2015, we guided at the beginning of the year to a 4% increase in same property net operating income and we finish the year with 5.2% growth in our net operating income. Our geographic and property diversification strategy continues to work for us, stabilizing our operating income as markets go through their business cycles. I know that the market is forward looking but it's important to understand the pasts have set the stage for the future. As Mark Dwayne, famously said “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.” In the last cycle that we began in 2010, I want to give you Camden's score card to the end of 2015. Our average rent increased from $937 a month to $1,322 a month a 41% increase producing a 7.1 compound average growth rate. Our average portfolio age began 2010 with at 12 years old and ended in 2015 at 12 years old. I wish I could do that with my age. Camden's net operating income growth was the second highest in the sector from 2010 through 2015 at 37.1% growth, which produced the compound average growth rate of 6.5%. Our debt to EBITDA improved from 7.2 times to 5.2 times producing with the strongest balance sheets in the sector. 2016 will be another good year for our business with operating trends above long-term averages. Apartment demand from millennials and empty nesters should be sufficient to absorb new supply and be constrictive for rent increases in most markets. Houston is our second largest market with 12% net operating income contribution. Last year as Houston added 23,000 jobs. The energy sector loss 31,000 but the healthcare, education, hospitality and government added 54,000 and its offsetting those energy losses. We expect another slow year for job growth in Houston coming up. Another 20,000 energy jobs look like they are going to be lost, but they will be offset by 42,000 jobs gained in the same sector that we are adding in 2015. In the near-term Houston has too many apartments coming online given the slow job growth that we are experiencing now. Houston is no stranger to oil price volatility. In the last 20-years oil prices have ranged from $16 a barrel to a high of $145 a barrel with lots of peaks and valleys along the way. Over that same period, Camden has experienced only one year where our net operating income was down 10% and that was during the recession of 2003 with revenue sound 3.7%. Our guidance doesn’t include such a drop at this point, but for those of you who have a much more bearish outlook for Houston, a 10% decline in our net operating income will reduce our 2016 same property net operating income guidance from 4.5% to 3.5% we will reduced our FFO by $0.06 per share. While we expect Houston to be our slowest market in the near-term the market will hold up better than most people expect. Forbes magazine just published a list of the Top-10 cities for growth in the U.S. from a business perspective and Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio were in the Top-10. Low oil prices are good for America and especially for our residence. They have more income to pay rent and other necessities. Over the last two years, we have been a net seller of properties. We will continue to be a net seller of properties in 2016. Apartments are fully valued in the private market. Private apartment companies enjoy a cost of capital advantage over public companies at this point in the cycle, we will continue to sell non-core assets during 2016 using proceeds to fund our development, paying down debt and return capital to shareholders when we can't find a suitable investment. With that I will turn the call over to Keith Oden. Before I do that however, we do have a winner and the winner is Neil Malkin with RBC, who correctly guessed that all five of the new additions featured on our pre-call music started in the Houston, Texas. Just a reminder that there really are other things other than apartments to get started in the Houston, Texas. Over 30 other people have the correct answer so far, but Neil was the first one, so Neil good job and we are glad to your quick one on your feet and on your iPad as well. So now we will turn it over to Keith as well. Thank you.
Keith Oden: Thanks Ric. Consistent with prior years I'm going to give my time on today's call to review the market conditions that we expect to encounter in Camden's markets during 2016. I'll address the markets in the order of best to worst by signing a letter grade to each one, as well as our view on whether we believe the market is likely to be improving stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview, I'll provide additional details of our fourth quarter operations and our 2016 same property guidance. Our number one ranking this year goes to Denver, which we rate as an A with a stable outlook. Denver was our top market in 2015 with 8.2% same property revenue growth and we expect it to be one of our top performers again in 2016. Supply should remain below the historical levels with 6,500 new apartments expected to open this year and nearly 30,000 new jobs should be created. Orlando and Tampa are the next two spots both with A minus ratings and improving outlooks. These markets have been somewhat average performers for us over the past several years, but they began to accelerate in mid 2015 and by year end both markets ranked in our Top-5 for quarterly revenue growth. Tampa should see 30,000 jobs created with around 6,000 new units being delivered. Job growth in Orlando is projected to be closer to 50,000 with 7,500 new apartments coming online providing the favorable ratio of supply and demand in both markets. Rounding out our Top-5 ranking for this year our Dallas and Phoenix with an A minus rating and a stable outlook. Both markets posted over 7% revenue growth during 2015 and are poised for very good performance again this year. Job growth in Dallas has been very strong with over 80,000 jobs added in 2015, estimates remain pretty strong for 2016 with approximately 70,000 new jobs projected. New developments have been coming online steadily for several quarters and another 20,000 plus new units are expected to open this year, while some of the DFW Dallas Fort Worth sub markets nicely increase competition this year, overall demand for apartment should be healthy given the contain strength on the Dallas economy. 55,000 new job were added in Phoenix last year and another 60,000 are anticipated during 2016. With 6,000 to 8,000 new units scheduled for delivery this year, we think the outlook for Phoenix is very good. Las Vegas moves up a bit this year after ranking as one of our bottom markets for the past several years. Today we rate Vegas as a B plus with in improving outlook. Our revenue growth there has been less than 2% in both 2012 and 2013, but the market began showing a solid improvement in 2014. Last year we posted 6.7% revenue growth, we expect strong results again in 2016. Supply remains minimal with less than 3,000 new apartments to be delivered this year and 30,000 new jobs are forecast. Atlanta and Southern California and Austin are next on the list earning B plus ratings and stable outlook. Atlanta has been a top market for the past three years averaging 7.9% annual revenue growth over that time frame and while we expect another good year in 2016 we all know trees don’t grow to the sky and another year of 8% growth seems too ambitious. Job growth remains solid and Atlanta with projections are ranging from 60,000 to 80,000 new jobs this year and supply remains very manageable as well with 10,000 to 12,000 new apartments scheduled for delivery. Our Southern California market markets also we are having a healthy supply and demand outlook with an aggregate of a 190,000 jobs and 30,000 new apartments for our portfolio and LA, Orange County and San Diego. Our San Diego and Inland Empire markets achieved slightly better revenue growth for us in 2015 we think that trend will repeat again this year. Austin has posted solid numbers for us over the last few years averaging 6.4% annual revenue growth despite the steady ways of new apartments that have come online. Completion should moderate this year to around 8,000 apartments and job creation will be similar to last year at 35,000. We gave Raleigh and South Florida a B rating again this year both with stable outlooks, like Austin, Raleigh has faced high levels of new supply for several years, but our portfolio is held up well. We expect 2016 to look a lot like 2015 there with job growth in the 16,000 to 18,000 range and new deliveries of roughly 4,000 apartments. South Florida should also continue on a steady path with around 9,000 new units being easily absorbed by the 47,000 new jobs expected to be created in 2016. Conditions in Charlotte are currently a B with a declining outlook. Charlotte added around 12,000 apartments over the last two years and with another 8,000 completions are expected to began this year. Job growth should remain healthy with 30,000 new jobs versus roughly 35,000 last year, but our occupancy and pricing power will began to moderate during 2016 as even more new communities come online. Washington DC moves up one spot this year to a C plus rating, but improving outlook. Revenue growth was seven tenth of a percent just better than flat in 2015, which was the lowest in our portfolio. We expect the modest improvement to roughly 2% in 2016. Completion this year should begin to slow to the 10,000 range, but job growth remains a little bit of wildcard for DC with the estimate strengthening from 35,000 of the 60,000 new jobs this year. It should be no surprises that Houston rank last year with the current rating of C and conditions are expected to decline during 2016. As Rick mentioned, over the past 20 years of operating in this market, our same-store revenue growth has ranged from minus 4%, which roughly 4%, which is happen twice during the recession years of 2003 and 2010, up to a high of 11% in 2012 with the average over that timeframe being 3.4%. We finished 2015 with just under 2% same-store revenue growth in Houston and that number will likely be zero or completely flat this year for revenues in Houston. While Houston average a 100,000 new jobs annual from 2010 to 2014, 2015 it looks like we’ll get about 23,000 new jobs and most for 2015 and it looks like the estimate for 2016 will be in the 20,000 to 30,000 range as Rick gave a little bit of color around that number. New supply has been significant for the past several quarters and another 20,000 new apartments are expected to open in 2014, which will continue to have pressure to the overall market. Overall, our portfolio would rank close to B plus again this year, which is roughly where it ranked last year, which puts us in a very good starting position for 2016. For the markets we ranked B or higher, our same-store revenue growth should average 5% to 7% this year. Factoring in Washington DC at 2% and Houston is flat, our 2016 guidance range for same-store revenue is 4.1% to 5.1%. Now few details of our 2015 operating results, same-store revenue growth was 5.4% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full-year. We saw strong performance during the fourth quarter of 2015 was 12 of our 2015 markets exceeding 6% revenue growth and five of those recording over 8% growth. Our top performance for the quarter were Phoenix at 10.6%, Tampa at 9.8%, San Diego/Inland Empire at 8.8%, Dallas at 8.7% and Orlando at 8.3%. Rental rate trends for the fourth quarter were as expected with new lease is up six tenth of a percent and renewals up roughly 6%, which was approximately 50 basis points below last year’s levels. For January so far, new leases are flat with renewals up 6.2%, which is about 40 basis points under our average gain in January 2015. February and March renewals are being sent out at roughly 7.3% and those typically get signed within 100 basis points of the original offer. Occupancy averaged 95.5% during the fourth quarter, compared to 95.6% last year. January occupancy has been running at about 95.3%, which is where it stands right now and the same as it was in January 2014. Net turnover for 2015, actually came in 200 basis points than 2014 that 51% versus 53%. Continuing the years long trend of well below trend move out to purchase homes were 14.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015, 14.3% for the entire year and that compares to 14.2% in 2014. With that I will wrap up and turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer. Alexander Jessett Thanks, Keith. Last night we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $109.6 million or $1.20 per share. Exceeding the mid-point of our guidance range by $0.01. This outperformance was due to slightly lower same-store operating expenses driven by expected cost controls and lower interest expense due to timing of capital market transaction. Our prior guidance assuming would issue an unsecured bond midway through the fourth quarter of 2015. Due to continued strength of our balance sheet and volatility seen in the bond market in the fourth quarter, we felt comfortable delaying the timing of this transaction. As of December 31, 2015, we had $244 million outstanding under our $640 million revolving lines of credit. These two positives were partially offset by higher overhead expenses relating to a change in the accounting for our trust management’s compensation and a slight acceleration of the plan retirement of our general counsel. All other line items for the quarter were in line with expectations. Our new Camden technology package with bundled cable and internet service is rolling out as scheduled and for the fourth quarter contributed approximately 40 basis points to our NOI growth. For the year, this initiative has added 60 basis points to our same-store revenue growth, 120 basis points to our expense growth and 30 basis points to our NOI growth. We now have approximately 23,000 units signed up for our technology package and the program is performing in line with expectations. Moving onto 2016 earnings guidance. You can refer to page 26 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on key assumptions driving our 2016 financial outlook. We expect 2016 FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 with a mid-point of $4.85 representing a $0.31 per share increase over our 2015 results. The major assumption in components of this $0.31 per share increase in FFO at the mid-point of our guidance range are as follows. A $0.26 per share or $23 million increase in FFO related to the performance of our 47,894 unit same-store portfolio. We are expecting same-store in net operating income growth 3.5% to 5.5% driven by revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.1% and expense growth to 4.3% to 5.3% and a $0.20 cent per share or $18 million increase in FFO related to net operating income from our non same-store properties resulting primarily from the incremental contributions from our development communities in lease up during 2015 and 2016 and five developing communities which stabilized in 2015. These positives are partially offset by a $0.02 per share or $2 million decrease in FFO related to loss NOI from $147 million at this position completed in 2015. A $0.03 per share or $2.5 million decrease in FFO related to forecast of lost NOI from planned 2016 dispositions. $0.05 per share or $4 million decrease in FFO related to increase interest expense is roughly primarily from a have planned mid-year $250 million bond transaction and lower levels of capitalize interest. In 2015, we completed 1500 units of our development pipeline and at this stage completed approximately 1200 additional units in 2016. Once the units are completed and we receive a statement of occupancy we must begin expensing all interest and operating costs related to that unit. A $0.02 per share or $2 million decrease in FFO due to increases in net overhead expenses and finally, a$0.02 per share decrease in FFO due to additional shares outstanding resulting from regularly scheduled vesting of prior and anticipated incentive share issuances. Taking a closer look at our anticipated same-store expense growth of 4.3% to 5.3% for 2016. We are once again expecting a large increase in property taxes. Property taxes are approximately a third of our total operating expenses and are projected to be at 6% in 2016. 5.5% is core the resulted from anticipated increases in assessments from our properties in 2016 due to continued increase real estate values. 50 basis points is due year-over-year reduction and anticipated refunds from prior year tax purchase. Additionally, we are anticipating a 10% increase in property utility expenses in 2016 as a result of our continued bulk internet initiative. Utilities are approximately 22% of our total operating expenses and this initiative is adding approximately 200 basis points to our total 2016 expense growth. Approximately 100 basis points to our 2016 estimated same-store revenue growth and approximately 50 basis points to our same-store NOI wide growth. Excluding taxes and utilities, the rest of our properties level expenses are projected to grow at less than 1.5% in the aggregate. Page 26 of our supplemental package also details our expected ranges of acquisitions dispositions, dispositions and developing activities. The mid-point of our 2016 FFO per share guidance range assumes the following. $250 million in on balance sheet dispositions towards the later part of the year. No on balance sheet acquisitions, zero to 200 million of on balance sheet developments starts and a $250 million bond transaction midway through the year. Currently, we estimate that all-in 10-year bond prices for Camden will be in a high 3% range. Our balance sheet remains strong with debt to EBITDA 5.2 times, a fixed charge expense coverage ratio of 5.4 times. Secured debt to gross real estate assets at 11%, 80% from our assets are encumbered and 83% of our debt at fixed rate. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the first quarter 2016. We expect FFO per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $1.16 to $1.20. The mid-point of $1.18 represents a $0.02 per share decrease from the fourth quarter 2015 which is primarily is the result of $0.02 or approximately $1.5 million decline in sequential same-store net operating income, mainly due to higher property taxes and normal seasonal expense increases partially offset by the timing of certain insurance reimbursements and a slight increased in the same profit revenues due to continued improvement in rental rates. At this time, we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning it's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. I was just curious first from the same-store guidance. How conservative do you guys really feel you are being this year versus the position you were in a year ago entering the year?
Richard J. Campo: Well, I think the guidance that we give is always we try not to be overly conservative, but we also try to be realistic on what we can achieve. I think that one of the things that is interesting to know that wasn’t in our prepared remarks. It was just the interest thing as I was putting together my notes for the call is that if you go back to our original guidance for 2015. Our 2016 guidance is actually higher than our original guidance for 2015 which I think even though we outperformed our guidance, so we obviously some of our markets did substantially better than we thought they were going to do. So particularly the range that we built around Houston we basically hit right on our number for Houston for 2015, so 3% revenue growth was kind of what our original plan was and that's about where we ended up. So if you think role forward this year obviously we've got the role forward of the rent role in Houston, which is still providing some benefit to us and we've got a forecast this year for basically flat on revenue growth, which we think is appropriate. We think it appropriately addresses the conditions of a lot more supply coming online with some pretty new to job growth, but at the same time it also reflects the fact that a lot of our portfolio in Houston is not hit ground zero for the delivery of new supply. So we think we properly covered the risk that are out there, obviously the Houston being a little bit more volatility around that number, but we think we got captured appropriately.
Austin Wurschmidt: So how much of the higher same-store growth do you think is a function of what's already earned into the pipeline versus what was earned in last year?
Alexander Jessett: Well I think the numbers are roughly the same in terms of where the overall affect is going to be. We rolled down roughly 300 basis points from 2014 through 2015 and that's about what we've got again this year. So I think it's roughly the same. So from an occupancy standpoint we’re starting at about the same place we did last year, clearly over the course of the year you would expect that there is going to be a little bit more pressure on occupancy rates, just because the overall market is going to be little bit sloppier than it was in 2015. But gain I think we've properly captured the scenario that we think is going to play out in Houston this year, which is 20,000 to 30,000 new jobs and trying to absorb another 20,000 apartments.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for the detail. One for me and then I think Jordon has a follow-up. I was just curious what you are seeing on the ground in Houston any increase and move outs for job losses or uptick in bad debt expense?
Alexander Jessett: None whatsoever in our portfolio on either account, no uptick in bad debts and certainly anecdotal evidence is very minor around job losses in the energy sector, but I mean you are talking in handfuls of people not anything meaningful on our portfolio. So far so good, as Ric mentioned in his comments that if you kind of take the 20,000 energy jobs that we lost it gets offset by employment in other areas and we ended up with the net gain for the year of roughly 23,000 to 25,000 jobs.
Richard J. Campo: And I think the key to that too you have to dig into the details of who really looses their jobs and if you think about what’s going on, it’s similar to what happened at financial services and you guys probably on the call know more about that than we do, but a lot of people are getting laid off in energy are older people, people 45-year and up and they are hiring younger people for obvious reasons. Younger people cost less, are more flexible, have new technology in their brains and 50-year old don’t. And generally 50-year olds or 45-year old don’t live in apartments, they live in homes and those people are doing even though they are laid off, they generally have more capital and they are making a home mortgages and things like that so there is no stress in the market. So I think that part of the equation people miss and just think well if you have this print of a 31,000 job losses in energy, it's all bad for the market. But remember we have 6.5 million people that live in this region and 31,000 people losing their jobs is very, very tough for them personally, but it's a drop in the bucket in the scheme of 6.5 million people in the region.
Jordan Sadler: Thanks for that. Just a quick follow-up its Jordan. Just on assets sales I know the position you are vis-à-vis in your opening commentary, so I'm not asking specifically about that but how are you determining what's non-core? So is it a function of the market or is it purely an individual asset underwriting and from an IRR perspective.
Alexander Jessett: So what we do is we first rank our portfolio by property to start with and it's one to 172 and that model is sort of a econometric model that takes into account the markets, takes into the CapEx, the return on invested capital and then that's really a kind of analysis. Then we also analyze everyone of our markets and our sub markets within our markets and we look at that and say what do we think this market is doing, where is it going. And we also look at pricing within the market and on a relative basis where it was in the past, where it is today on a cap rate basis to try to understand if that market is gaining a lot more love from investors, because the cap rates are substantially lower perhaps than they have been in recent history. So with all that said, it gets it sort of rolled up and we look at it and decide we generally speaking would rather sell the bottom piece of our portfolio and then when you start looking at sub markets. If we see sub markets that are moving in a different direction then we might want to exit those sub-markets as well. So over the long-term that's how we evaluate our asset pricing model and our disposition strategy.
Jordan Sadler: I’ll hop back into queue. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. Can you hear me?
Richard J. Campo: Yes.
Alexander Jessett: Yes.
Nicholas Joseph: Perfect we've seen a handful of large portfolio sales and privatization in the apartment sector over the last 12 months. Wondering what your thoughts on selling a larger portfolio of the assets give the strong bid and then how you think about multifamily asset pricing at this point in the cycle overall?
Richard J. Campo: Well multifamily asset pricing as I said in my remarks priced very full right now, cap rates are the lowest. We've seen them in our business careers and in every single market that we operate in. and so when you think about it from that perspective, it really is hard for us to compete with the private people from acquisition perspective. That's why last year we had zero acquisitions, even though we had $400 million of joint venture funds money to spend in addition to our own. With that said, we think development is a smarter alternative even though we are shrinking our development pipeline giving where we are on the cycle. As far as portfolio sales go, clearly there is a premium for portfolios today and to the extent that we can drive value from that premium and we will.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks and what percentage of the portfolio today would you consider with non-core?
Richard J. Campo: Well you know when you first rank every property you look at the bottom sort of 10% or 15% of your portfolio and that sort of by definition is non-core, because it's growing slower than the rest of the portfolio. And when an asset is growing slower than the overall portfolio, it's obviously a drag on your cash flow and a drag on your NAV. So redefine those as non-core and then what happens generally is that if a property is experiencing a slowdown in its return on invested capital there is a reason for it, it’s either old and it requires CapEx. It doesn't return cap that doesn't increase the ability to increase rents or maybe a sub market that’s going sideways and so that generally creates the situation that sub market situation or market situation that actually creates the non-core position. So will always have properties that are non-core.
Alexander Jessett: Disposition guidance for this year is 1.50 to 3.50 and I would say that's the range of what we consider with non-core
Nicholas Joseph: Okay. And then I guess just the exposure, if you were to hypothetically exit a market, your exposure to the other markets obviously would go up as we as a percentage. so I'm wondering what your thoughts are on a level of concentration that you would want to avoided in any one individual markets?
Richard J. Campo: Well when you look at the market, our largest market is Washington DC and we have properties from Washington DC that beyond on that list too, but the bottom line is that when we think about our geographic exposure we think about percentages, but we are not wed to a specific number. So when you think about DC for example, 16% of our portfolio is Washington DC plus or minus. Washington DC is a bit vast market, we have some in the district, we have some in Northern Virginia, we've some in [Lawton] County and so you can't really sort of say it's all one market in my opinion. So with that said, we are wed to a specific percentage, but we do look at the percentages to try to balance the portfolio, because when you think about a geographic diversification just like a stock diversification, you are trying to lower the volatility of your cash flow this year. So our same-store NOI growth is going down 60 basis points at the mid-point from last year and that's because Houston is going down and other markets are going up to offset that. So we want to keep a balance, but we're really not wed to a specific number
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.
Robert Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Keith of the eight or so stable market that you talked about when you ran through your list, any of those that wouldn't surprise you if they move to declining over the course of 2016?
Keith Oden: So, the stable markets that we have for 2016, just to run over more them real quickly, because we don’t have that in front of them. We have Denver is stable, Dallas, Phoenix, Atlanta, Sothern California, Austin, [indiscernible] and South Florida. So of that group, there is not really one on group that I think has much volatility associated with it around the stable rating. If you just look at the projected job growth versus the deliveries, all of those are at a range that should sustain kind of what we saw in 2015. Obviously the ones where we have declining markets, we have Charlotte and Houston as declining market and I think those probably have a little more volatility associated with outcomes and that's primarily because they have got a lot of news supply that's being delivered into the marketplace. When you got merchant builders who are heading for the exits, it always creates the potential for more volatility, because they tend to discount now and ask questions later. So if you got leased ups that are specifically in your competitive market set in markets that have a lot of new supply, then you know you are going to be more impacted by it. But we think we’ve captured those appropriately, but other stable markets it would surprise me if any of those that I just listed off that we ended up wishing that we had attached to declining range to them.
Robert Stevenson: Okay and then if you look at the expected deliveries in DC over the next couple of years, I mean borrowing some major increase and unexpected increase in job growth there, is that just a market that’s going to continue to stuck in a mud for a long period of time?
Richard J. Campo: Well, it is a market that is improving. So instead of just flat or down a little, it's now up 1% or 2%, but we don’t see it getting to the point where it's 4% or 5% like the rest of the country because of sort of supply pressure. Even though supply is coming down some. It will be interesting to see how the presidential election affects, because generally speaking when you think about DC, change of administration whether Republicans come in or Democrats retain, all those creates a lot of movement in activity. And given that we as a country are not doing stupid things like shutting the government down and things like that that’s obviously a positive for the DC market sort of long-term.
Alexander Jessett: And so if you look at - we’ve got forecast in our data that we keep out through 2017, so we’ve given you the numbers for 2016, but if you roll that forward to 2017 and again this really the average of the data providers. It looks like we’ll get another 8,000 apartments in DC Metro in 2017 and the average of the job forecast for the DC Metro area are about 42,000. So again those metrics would not add to any pressures that - or go along, get along scenario, which is what we’ve projected for 2016. We think we’re going to get some additional traction out into 2017 and certainly those job growth and supply numbers are supportive of that.
Robert Stevenson: Okay and then just lastly, is there any markets that you are finding it easier to backfill the land supply for future development relative to the others?
Richard J. Campo: No, not even in Houston.
Robert Stevenson: Okay, alright thanks guys.
Richard J. Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Anderson: Thanks, good morning. So Ric could you talk about how the buying public, those folks that are buying multifamily property, how that kind of is changing, what types of players are in that side of the table?
Richard J. Campo: I don’t think the players are changing much. You do have the big buyers that have emerged obviously the portfolio buyers, but you still have sort of a combination of depending on the markets you are talking about, a combination of what we call Country Club money buyers which are private individuals that are using 70% to 80% leverage, floating rate debt. So they are buying five cap rates or the low end of five cap rates, financing it with 2% to 2.5% money, generating 8% cash-on-cash returns, and just focusing on cash-on-cash returns more than anything. And you have sort of the pension funds that are still big buyers out there in a lot of markets and they are buying core assets and they are paying sub five in most markets and sub fours in closable markets. So I think there is a very good combination of private pension and large capital players that everyone knows about. And in most markets you are getting multiple bids by all the above players depending on the property type you are trying to sell.
Richard Anderson: Okay if you are having a walk in park selling assets and I don’t suggest it’s that easy, but obviously as you mentioned pricing is full. Why not just sell more and not do a debt offering, explain to me that thought process from a capital source perspective.
Richard J. Campo: Sure. So when you build guidance you have to build sort of guidance around what you think is going to happen, but on the other hand, you also have to adapt to the market as it goes forward. And so to the extent that we see opportunity to sell, larger asset base at a really good price, then we would do that. And clearly if we exceed our 250 million mid-point net disposition guidance we would have to change our strategy and not do a bond deal and we do have some complicated tax issues that we obviously have to deal with. We’ve told people in the past, we are probably right at the edge of - if we increase our dispositions from where they are today, we would have to do special dividends, most likely unless we did 10/31 exchanges and the 10/31 exchange markets really sort of you are selling you have the same challenge of buying and I don’t see a lot of opportunity to do that. So yes, if we sell more you we will do a bond deal and we’ll have to change guidance.
Alexander Jessett: And Rich just a follow-up on that I mean we have in fact then significant net sales and I think Ric gave you the numbers from 2010 forward, of our debt to EBITDA going from 7.2 to 5.2 and the primary source of the pay down in debt over that period of time from 7.2 to 5.2 is a net dispositions. So we've been doing that and if you look at our guidance in this year, the mid-point of the dispo range is 250 with no acquisition, so we have been big time net sellers.
Richard Anderson: Thanks and I realize I sound like I'm talking in a cave and it’s because I am so. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey good morning down there.
Richard J. Campo: Good morning.
Alexander Jessett: Good morning.
Alexander Goldfarb: So just first going to Houston, I think if I heard correctly, you said you are expecting flat NOI, but also flat revenue and assuming that expense are up in Houston. So can you just walk us through sort of the dynamics and maybe you were just using an average so maybe there is a range which is why is revenue flat, NOI flat, but when you do the range, it makes more sense?
Alexander Jessett: No, its revenue flat Alex and NOI will be down probably 2% something like that, but our comments on Houston are flat revenues. So that's the difference as we didn’t give the expense number, but it's NOI down roughly 2%.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay and then just based on your experience from last year where sort of Houston performed as you expected and you had jobs came in a lot lower. To what extent do jobs really matter versus it's really what's going on around the property and in that particular sub market that's the bigger driver? And therefore sort of curious why you guys were out of jobs metric versus if it's really lower a sub market by sub market decision.
Richard J. Campo: Well, obviously, if you got lease ups going on in your neighborhood then you are going to be more impacted, but jobs obviously do matter in the sense that people will congregate and aggregate where most of new construction has been closer to down town which is where the job growth has been and which is where also poor people want to live. So the difference the last year n 2015 Alex between kind of what we thought was going to happen. So you have a 3% revenue growth target. We end up hitting 3%, but we did that with 20,000 plus or minus jobs instead of a 100,000 jobs, but the biggest difference in our forecast was that we also last year had new supply coming online of roughly 20,000 apartments and our guess is that roughly 6,000 to 7,000 of those apartments did not get delivered in 2016 that were originally forecasted to be delivered. And the reason for that is delays in construction and just the lack of availability of subcontractor and skilled labor. So you start out the year, you think you are going to get 20,000 apartments and 80,000 jobs, you will look forward to get 25,000 jobs, but you only deliver 12,000 apartments to 13,000 apartments. Now, it doesn’t mean they went away and they will be delivered and some of those are going to be delivered into 2016 and obviously some of the 2016's are going to roll over into 2017, but to me the explanation for how we still hit 3% revenue guidance in light of a dramatically different job picture was the supply got rolled forward.
Keith Oden: I think the other piece of that too is there are two other pieces and again what I said earlier which is the type of jobs that are being lost and where they are been lost and then second there is something going on too that's very interesting. I mentioned empty nesters, I mean we are having sort of a battle between millennials and empty nesters where empty nesters are moving in from the suburbs because the traffic conditions have the ability to do that. Have ability to sell their house and move in. And a lot of the product that's being built today didn’t exist in the past, meaning that high rise product, very well located, walk able neighborhoods things like that and these empty nesters are giving up their homes and moving in to the urban and core and that's helped a lot and I think that that's why even with the low job growth we've had you haven’t had the apartment market fall off the edge.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then just final, given the strong demand that we are seeing from the private players, why do you think the volatility in the stock market hasn’t scared them or that volatility is causing more of them to seek directed investment?
Richard J. Campo: Well the disconnect in the stock prices versus the private sector, I think if you think about what drives prices first of all of any commodity or any assets it's liquidity number one. Number two is supply and demand, number three is inflation expectations and number four, interest rates. So right now the private sector has had interest rates are the least impactful. When you think about liquidity, the market is still awash with cash with massive amounts of cash. People are looking for yield and where you can buy a multifamily property in a reasonably balanced supply and demand market, those folks aren’t worried about the volatility of the stock market. In addition, I think it's interesting because when the stock market is volatile everybody wants something that's not correlated to the stock market they want an assets that they can invest in. They don’t have to worry about it going up and down every day and so often times there is a lot of the people that I know that are selling this country club equity that comes in. They lover apartments because they don’t know what they value is from day-to-day, it doesn’t go up and down. If they buy Camden stock, the volatility has been huge obviously. So I think there is a huge disconnect between the public markets and the private market today and we've seen it over the years and what happens is whether it will be interesting and see whether the public market is right or the private market is right. Right now until liquidities rise up or supply and demand fundamentals changed dramatically the bid for multifamily is going to be strong and there is nothing going to change that unless you have a massive shift in those issues.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Dana Gallen] (Ph) of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Ric you mentioned shrinking the size of the development pipeline and the guidance reflects that. What would cause you to come in at the low end and not have any starts this year, is it markets specific, are you looking at broader economic indicators?
Richard J. Campo: We are looking at both things. So clearly we want to make sure that we can deliver yields and returns that are reasonable for the risk you take in development and so that’s really important and then when you look at the cycle, so we have been in this recovery cycle for we are going on six years now. The longest recovery that I can remember was in the early 90s through 2001 and that was an eight year cycle and so most other cycles are three to five maybe six at longest cycles. Now some folks believe that this cycle should be longer or could be longer because we had such a big decline in that million jobs, we've added back about 14 million jobs now and it's been sort of a slow swag obviously in terms of the economy trying that recover from that decline. But we start looking forward in the future with all the uncertainty with oil prices, with the Fed with sort of late the long [Indiscernible] the economic cycle. We are just getting more conservative when it comes to development spend to make sure we are not peaking in a development spend right at the same time when there some economic situation happens that none of us can foresee at this point.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And then can you share the new year renewal lease trends for Houston specifically?
Richard J. Campo: For what period of time?
Unidentified Analyst: Fourth quarter and if you have January that would be great.
Richard J. Campo: So for the fourth quarter new leases were down roughly 2%, renewal was up 3.5% so call it up three tenth on a blended basis. So for the January numbers they are incredibly volatile on a one month basis, because we don’t even have full month in there, but I can tell you at the portfolio level, we are roughly most date we rolled up new leases basically flat, renewals about 6% for a total blended of about 3%.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Richard J. Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lewis of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Michael Lewis: Thanks. Ric sounded that low oil prices are good for America, I'm guessing that might not make you really popular with your neighbors in Houston, but my question is if you know how many of your residents actually drive cars, because given kind of rise in the millennials and own US things. I'm wondering if the impact of lower gas prices might actually be less impactful than it's been in the past?
Alexander Jessett: Given on our market concentration that non- built with pretty limited public transportation, I would say that we have a substantial - there are some millennials that don’t drive for sure in some of our more urban projects in DC and elsewhere, but I would say by and large that lower oil prices are definitely helping our residents and they have more money in their pocket. and even Houstonians if they are not directly tied to the oil business our 6.5 million people that are living here are experiencing pretty good cash flow increases when they fill their cars up as well. So we operate in markets where people rely on their cars.
Michael Lewis: Fair enough the supplier side in Houston. You have talked in the past about projects getting pushed off because of shortage of labor and cost going up and things. I'm wondering what’s in your outlook, do you expect this to be kind of gradually delivered or do you think 2016 as a heavy supply year than maybe there can be - maybe it sets up for a little bit of a bounce when we get through all of that?
Alexander Jessett: When you look at the supplies. Supply is slowing, there is no question about that projects are getting pushed off as Keith mentioned earlier, projects are delayed because of construction workers. So the product is not coming in the market as fast as it would otherwise. When you look forward into 2017, actually the greater Houston partnership has 60,000 jobs projected in 2017 and a follow off in completion in 2017. If Houston gets set up to have a recovery in maybe middle of 2017 and through 2018 perhaps.
Richard J. Campo: Our numbers for 2017 deliveries, the average of our data providers is about 12,000 apartments, which will the substantially less on either 2014 and 2015. And a pretty big substantial part of that were originally, if you would ask when that would be deliver, there would have been 2016 deliveries that are rolled in 2017. So from a permitting standpoint they are falling off fairly dramatically, in 2016 we’ve got Houston permitting at roughly 8,000 apartments and a lot of those were things that were already underway in 2015 and have been push out.
Alexander Jessett: And the only thing really getting started here now in Houston, are pension fund build the core type deals, which are sort of 100% location irreplaceable where they already have huge investment in the land and they are willing to go have build, because it’s build to core kind of strategy. And by and large anything that’s a normal merchant builder sort of run at the mill site, it has to be financed is not getting done.
Michael Lewis: Okay, thanks and that’s helpful. And then finally, you just answer to question about the development starts and how you to be in the low-end. You guys were early to take advantage with the opportunity to develop. Are you getting the sense that it’s still more effective than acquisitions but maybe the opportunity there has run its course give it costs up and cap rates probably not compressing anymore?
Richard J. Campo: Well clearly the development pipeline is not as buoyant from return perspective as it was at the beginning of this cycle, but our pipeline, still looks really good. I mean we have a pipeline that has roughly 7% return and today in this environment we’re still very wide on the sort of acquisition to development spreads. And so while they are harder to do and more complicated view today and maybe we have 200 and 250 spread on development premium and early in the cycle, it was like 300 or 400 basis points spread. But clearly the thing on development for us, it’s more about where we are in the cycle and when is an extra session coming. And if you say well, we are not going to have a recession in 2020 that will be 10 years of recovery, I haven’t been at least in my business career you are going to have 10 years are straight up.
Michael Lewis: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Thomas Lesnick: Hey guys I'll keep it short since the call is running a little over an hour. But with respect to G&A and guidance, I know you guys give guidance. [indiscernible] year and for 2015, it was initially $41 million to $43 million and your policy is not really to update G&A guidance through the course of the year. But I guess given fourth quarter being a little out sized. Is that something you would contemplate update on a more frequent basis particularly if there was something material that change it?
Alexander Jessett: Absolutely, but one of the things Tom we do every quarter is I do a full walk from the current quarter to the next quarter. And so if there is anything that we assume would be unusual movement in G&A or any of our line items I call it out at that point in time. But absolutely, we would update it if they were something unusual that we were aware of.
Thomas Lesnick: Okay, thanks. And then Rick you made some comments about oil having a positive impact on the U.S. consumer. But I guess on the flip side of that, a lot of the sovereign wealth money and foreign capital that come to United States has really come in large part, because of oils impact over the last cycle. Are you concerned at all about the bid on U.S. assets from foreign capital going forward to 2016?
Richard J. Campo:  I haven’t saying any indication that foreign capital was point back in a big way that was going to change that. And we did have a win with the FERC legislation sort of doubling the ability that was past year, recently in the tax code. So that all actually help with foreign investment on the one side. So I have not seeing any indication to that and any publication or any discussion with any one at this point and there is still a big bid for all kinds of different asset classes from foreign investors.
Thomas Lesnick: Alright, thanks. That’s all I have got.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. With regards to proceeds from plan disposition. Could you give us a rank order of the attractiveness of the uses of proceeds as you see today?
Alexander Jessett: Of rank order, okay. So rank order proceeds for dispositions would be funding development, because it’s required to the funded, paying down debt and then returning capital to shareholders either through special dividends or share buybacks.
John Pawlowski: Okay, great thanks. One last one. Could you quantify the revenue enhancing cash back spend in Houston this year in 2015 relative to 2014 and what are the plans for this year?
Richard J. Campo: Yes, it's fairly de minimus if you look at 2014 and 2015 there wasn’t really hardly any repositions done in Houston and the same for 2016.
John Pawlowski: Okay, great thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Hi thanks for taking my question and I'll make this quick. If you look at lot of your markets call it the ex-Houston Sunbelt. When you look at two of your competitors that have similar geographies, it would be easy to assume that most of the supplier that’s coming to just even spend more [CBB] (Ph) oriented and that out in the suburb the supply has been a little slow to come into the market and maybe just so to avoid from 2010 to 2012. That said, Camden’s portfolio is maybe a little bit between the other two in terms of urban versus suburban split and there are instances where the supply is within the realm or relatively close to some of your assets. So maybe if you could talk about the recipe behind the outperformance in those markets and anything specific you are doing to compete against the new supply and then maintain operations in that environment?
Richard J. Campo: Sure. I think there is some outperformance cause in two areas; one is we are just better operators; two, when we talk about geographic diversification, we are also talking about market diversification within product types. So we want to make sure that we aren’t 100% concentrated in urban core downtown or urban properties, because we know what happens in the cycle. The urban properties are very highly sought out by institutional investors, so they get overbuilt first and therefore you have more competitive pressure on the urban core. So we keep our properties - We like urban for sure, we like to develop urban and we like own urban, but we want to have a balance between urban and suburban. We want to have various price points within our portfolio, because that price point is where you can outperform where if a high end project is getting pressure from new development. The more moderate price development is not getting that pressure, so you will have better growth rates in the more moderate versus the high end price. So it's all about balancing your markets within your sub-markets and geographically balancing within the product mix as well.
Drew Babin: Great, thank you that’s all I got.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kris Trafton of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kris Trafton: Hi guys. Just going back to your Houston forecast. It sounds like your revenue forecast is flat with about 20,000 to 30,000 jobs out in 2016. Do you know what oil price that forecast implies and then what is your sense of how long oil can stay at these levels before where it can be little bit more substantial?
Alexander Jessett: Well if you look at oil price projects, all of them are from $20 barrel to $60 a barrel, so I have absolutely no clue and I don’t think anybody in the world has any clue what oil is going to do. So with that said, the 20,000 jobs plus or minus that are projected has oil fairly stable in the level it is today which is somewhere between high $20 and $40 a barrel, they are not assuming any recovery in oil through the end of the year to get those jobs.
Kris Trafton: And so even at those prices, you don’t think there is going to be widespread losses in the energy sector?
Alexander Jessett: No, I think we have to remember that energy sector is a broad thing right. And so there have been somewhere around 300,000 jobs lost in the energy sector and we lost 31,000 here in Houston. And so the energy sector is worldwide and when you think about the folks that are in Houston they tend to save their highest intellectual capital type of folks. And a lot of the deeper job cuts are going to be closer to wellhead and related to supply chains and things like that that are just not here.
Richard J. Campo: There is also a massive expansion in the petrochemical complex that’s going on between all the way from Houston down to ship channel to Galveston, and it's extraordinary that what the capacity that’s being built. And if you think from their perspective, the people on the petrochemical industry, low oil prices are a really good thing, it's their feedstock. So it's a mixed picture for sure and there is obviously winners and losers even within the Houston market.
Kris Trafton: Got it thanks okay and then on development, is that 7% yield with the 225 basis point spread applied just what you have under construction? Or does that also apply to some of the shadow pipeline? And if that apply to your land bank, is that enough of a margin to give you some leeway in case things turns out?
Alexander Jessett: It is both the existing portfolio and the shadow pipeline have similar characteristics in those numbers, okay so they are plus or minus within the same band. And then the question of whether the spread is wide enough to develop, I think you get down to the - if all things were equal and we are early in the cycle of 7% return when an asset market is trading at five or sub five for new development that’s a great spread and you could do that all day along. The issue we have with that today is that we are long in the cycle not short in the cycle and how much development risk do you want to take given the uncertainty about when the next downturn in the market is going to be. And that’s what drives our development decisions when it come to whether we should start or not.
Kris Trafton: Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Good morning. On your same-store expense guidance, first question how much pressure do you anticipate from wage growth. And secondly, with the 6% increase in property taxes are the reversals of some of the large increase from last year no longer on the table or just delayed.
Richard J. Campo: Yes absolutely. So we are assuming that there is really no incremental pressure on wage growth, we've got that about in our budgets. If you look at property taxes, so we're going up in 6% in 2016 and obviously that’s slightly lower than it was 2015, but it is still elevated. We will continue to protest every single tax assessment that we think we can. But we have certain markets that based on what we know today, we assume only high and although we don’t think that Houston is going to be quite as Dallas last year but we are anticipating additional pressure on markets such as Dallas and Raleigh.
Alexander Jessett: John the only place we have wage pressure in our portfolio over the last five years has been until recently in Houston. So I mean it was a major issue for us from a competitive stand point, but that changed about 18 months ago and since then it's not really a problem anymore. So that’s the one outlier that we did have wage pressure has certainly diminished greatly as a result of the overall employment situation in Houston.
John Kim: Even if it increased the supply coming into market you don’t see wage pressure has stuff potential move to competitors?
Alexander Jessett: No we don’t.
John Kim: Okay. And then I’m little surprised, you consider the top market for 2016 given the anticipate in supply commodity market can you just elaborate why you are more in thank your peers?
Alexander Jessett: Well no one is immune from new supply, but if you look at what is actually going to be delivered in Denver is about 6400 apartments, we are project 30,000 new jobs. Denver was our top performing, one of our top performing market last year. So you sort get a bleed over from your in place rents as they roll through your 2016 results. We had revenue growth in Denver last year was 8.2% in 2015 and obviously some of that rolls forward into 2016. So if you think where a lot of new supply is being built we don’t have a lot of direct exposure to bulk of the new supply in Denver. So from our perspective Denver is going to be another great market in 2016.
John Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford of Mitsubishi UFJ. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford: Good afternoon. Ric you talked in the last call about your thoughts on share buyback since then leverage is down NAV is up. Can you just update us if you start from buyback had changed at all since then?
Richard J. Campo: They have not changed, I mean we have consistently said that share buybacks were always on the table as long as there was persistent disconnect between NAV and our stock price was persistent. The challenge that we've had has been in the volatility, and also a lot of folks sort of think well we should have buy the stock in December. Well you can't, because we have these blackout periods. So stock buybacks are on the table, I mean if we get an open window and it's look good to us we will buy it back.
Karin Ford: Thanks. And then my second question is related to same-store revenue guidance. Did I hear you correctly that there is a 100 basis point impact from the tech package rollout embedded in the 2016 number and do you care to share what is the new renewal increase assumptions are embedded in there?
Richard J. Campo: Sure so I'll take the first part. And yes that’s correct, so we've got a 100 basis points in our 2016 numbers from the tech rollout on the revenue side. And another 200 basis points on expense side. And then we are excited just to close the loop to 50 bips on NOI.
Karin Ford: And then just on new and renewals can you share what your assumptions are on that?
Alexander Jessett: We don’t actually break it out that way. What we do is when we do our assumptions we just sort of use a net number based on the market. So we don’t really have that data.
Karin Ford: Okay, thank you.
Alexander Jessett: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: Hey guys. Sorry to prolong this a little bit longer, but I was just curious in Houston obviously longer term happy with the market. But just curious what is your appetite for further investment in that market would be maybe how much would you have to see cap rates backup before got interesting?
Alexander Jessett: Quite a bit. These people calls all the time, private equity people saying “hey can we come down there and take advantage of some of the blood in the water in Houston” and I tell them I say don’t waste a trip, there is no bargains here at this point, I don’t see them happening. They sort of look at that 80’s collapse and look at history and say “oh jee with everything is going on in Houston, it's got to be cheap” and when you look at it it's not cheap. When you think about the structure of the capital today, I don't know anybody who has built the property or bought a property that doesn't have anywhere from 25% to 35% equity in the property and those people don't have pressure on them, you have heard, you saw what our numbers looked like we had top line growth of nearly 3%. We did have a negative NOI print because of the operating expense tax side of equation, but you don't have that opportunity. We like Houston long-term, we think it's a great market to be in, 12% of our portfolio feels pretty good, I would rather have less right now, but probably more when it recovers. But I don't think there is a lot of opportunities for us to do much in Houston right now given the market and there is just no opportunity at this point for great deals, if you want to call on those.
Vincent Chao: Right. Okay and then on Camden County, I mean how far away are we from that potentially starting?
Alexander Jessett: We are about three miles away from it right now. sorry, just getting punchy on this, this call getting so long and I know why it is, because we don't have any other people reporting. So whenever we have a shadow pipeline we look at it and we think about the market, we think about capital allocation, we think about what the cost structure would be for us to build that project today and I think people also thinking that Houston costs have obviously come down which they haven't. So we still have a labor shortage in Houston from a construction perspective, cost continue to go up. So we will take a look at that it's likely not to be a 2016 start, I think it's in our shadow pipeline sometime in 2017. But the good news is we will look at it and decide what we are going to do based on the market conditions at the time. So it's not on the horizon at this point, but we always have it on our pipeline.
Vincent Chao: Alright, thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Daniel Oppenheim: Thanks very much. Let me be quick given the time and I was just wondering about Denver, I think last comment was that feeling it will be another great market in 2016. Given the sort of occupancy loss in the fourth quarter, is that something where you view that as a hiccup or are you adjusting based on that. How do you look at that to given the account for the market being great for 2016?
Richard J. Campo: It's cold in the fourth quarter in Denver. We think that just a seasonal fluctuation. We still have great traffic, very strong, like I said we are coming off a year. Last year where we did 8.2% top line, our revenue budget for Denver for 2016 is right at 7% top line growth, again we think that's very doable.
Daniel Oppenheim: Okay, thank you.
Richard J. Campo: You bet.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: Well I appreciate you be on the call today and have fun on the rest of the calls for the next week or two. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your line. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan. Please go ahead, Ma’am.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder Camden's complete third quarter 2015 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on the call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. We will try to be brief in our prepared remarks and complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have other items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today we'll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. And good morning. Let me begin by congratulating our onsite and sport teams for delivering a package, a package of solid results directly to our shareholders and resident front [ph] doors. For the third quarter, your hard work has supported an increase in our same store property net operating income guidance. Our developments, re-development and construction teams continue to create value for our company. A $1.1 billion development pipeline will add nearly $350 million of value to our shareholders when completed and leased. We will again be a net seller properties in 2015 as we were in 2014. Pricing in the acquisition market remains robust, given the wall of capital that continues to bid for apartment properties in all of our markets. Since 2011, we have sold over $1.7 billion of 22 year old properties that had lower revenue growth potential and increased capital expense requirements. This represents a 20% turnover of our portfolio in a very short timeframe increasing the portfolio quality, revenue growth profile and lowering capital expenditures. Our capital recycling program will continue in 2016 using sales proceeds to fund further development costs. The [Indiscernible] apartment market was slowing continues to perform at our expectation for the year. Demand is holding that well given the flat job picture. Apartment fundamentals are stronger improving in all of our other markets and are likely to be above our long term trend for 2016. At this point I’ll turn the call over to Keith Oden Thanks Ric. At the beginning of this year we found ourselves in familiar territory. As we began rolling out a solution to a challenge facing the multi family industry. It’s just the latest example of Camden leading the way in our industry. In 1998 we were the first multi family company to build residence for water usage, an initiative that promoted water conservation. Other controversy over the time, today the vast majority of apartment communities have followed our lead. In 2005, we were one of the first companies to roll out a system wide revenue management solution. In 2006, we implemented our bulk [ph] cable option which continues to provide significant savings to our residents compared to their one-off retail subscription offering. We are in the process of rolling out bulk high speed internet with additional savings to come for our residents. Earlier this year we communicated with the largest package carriers that we wanted to begin offering our residents the same service single family home margin [Indiscernible] front door delivery. Based on the local and national media coverage of our approached package delivery it’s clear that there are misconceptions that need to be cleared out. So first a little background, the number of onsite packages delivered to our communities has grown from a handful eight, ten years to an average of 150 per community, per week. We had a total of one million packages in 2014 and that number is growing by 30% to 50% per year and there is no slowdown in sight. A few years ago we began getting requests from our onsite teams for things such as new package tracking software, package locker systems and additions to staff to handle packages. While we were evaluating these requests the response of our onsite teams was merely to work harder and longer to improve the package dilemma for our residents but we were loosing the battle. Before we started trying any of these new, the new adhoc solutions to package handling, we decided to make sure that whatever policy we adopted would meet three key objectives. Number one, it would provide the best customer service to the greatest number of our residents, number two, it would have to free up our onsite task time from package management so they could get back to property management. And number three it had to be a solution that was scalable and could withstand a five times increase in volume or in our case upto 5 million packages per year which is very likely where we are headed over the next five to ten years. So we studied the package problem for six months including all currently available package solutions in the industry or solutions being proposed by vendors. After doing this we concluded that there were three classes of customer service solutions that the apartment communities that didn’t have a 24/7 concierge service option. Camden has 11 high rise communities with 24/7 concierge service and they were not included in this rollout. We identified our first class solution and that is the delivery of a residence package directly to their door step by the best package delivery companies in the world. Using state of the art tracking software with complete transparency regarding date and time of delivery. This is a service that I enjoy at my house. I suspect that many of you also enjoy this first class solution at your homes. We also identified a second class solution. This occurs when carriers deliver packages to an intermediary, in our case a management company which takes possession and then engages their personnel in completing the delivery through a variety of ways. Some use package room, some use package lockers and some use neighbourhood distribution centers made available by the carriers. While not as good as first class service, because residents still had to go retrieve their package and transport it back to their home, atleast the residents had better access to retrieve the package at a time of their choice. Finally, we identified a third class solution. Our management company takes possession of the package and holds it hostage in their office until the resident can get around to picking up their package during office hours. For many residents this was a poor solution. Unfortunatley this was a the Camden model which is why our efforts to solve this dilemma internally became known as package gate. Not only were our customers limited to office hours to pick up their packages we were compounding the problem by having our staff to more and more time shuffling packages instead of attending to our residents or their needs. As we studied the second class solutions it became clear that no matter which of the options we adopted and no matter how good we got it executing them we could never achieve the original three objectives that we set out. The solution that we ultimately adopted was a hybrid of first class and second class solutions. Work with the carriers to allow easy access to deliver packages directly to the door step of our residents and provide those who for whatever reason prefer to not have door step delivery with information on how to direct their package delivery to the carriers closest distribution centers. As always we are getting new initiatives, we did a pilot, we piloted the program with 11 communities and we got really good results and then we rolled it up to an entire district, then a region and then ultimately throughout the entire company. The rollout was completed this summer. The results so far we estimate that over half of our residents now enjoy first class service and we think that facility will grow overtime as neighbours see and hear the excellent results they are enjoying by having packages delivered directly to their door steps. The most common reason we heard for reluctance to opt for door step delivery is concerned that their package might be lost or stolen. Our results so far show this fear is largely unfounded. Since we adopted this hybrid approach an estimated 500,000 packages have been delivered to resident’s door steps and we have not seen an increase in reports of packages being lost or stolen. The response from our residents was predicted by our pilots and our initial rollouts. The majority of residents are fine with the new approach. This isn’t surprising since we were moving all of them from third class service to their first class or second class service. Despite this, not everybody was happy and there was a small but -- minority of residents who preferred the old approach, change always creates anxiety. And even after several months to a long as a year under the new plans, some residents remain unhappy. Last week, a few of them had the opportunity to share their opinions on local and national news. I’m not sure why the media got so interested in a change on how we handle packages but they did. Finally we had 100,000 plus residents and as of last week we are not aware of more than a handful of resident communications to our onsite staff that the resident would not be renewing their lease due to our change in package handling. All of our onsite policies are designed to provide living excellence to the greatest possible percentage of current and future residents. Our experience over the last year with our package delivery policy indicates that we are achieving that objective. We are always looking to improve our customer service and if a better solution for a package handling comes along regardless of whose idea it is we’ll adjust our policy accordingly. In the meantime we’ll continue to support the carriers who are providing first class delivery service to the majority of our residents. In addition we’ll continue to look for better ways to provide second class service to our residents. We you don’t use the door step delivery option. We are well past worrying about how many of our residents might leave because of our improved package policy. We are focussed on how many residents are more likely to stay or sign new leases with us because we offer them the first class experience of having their packages delivered directly to their front door step. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, operating conditions across oru portfolio remained strong as we posted the best quarterly revenue growth in nine quarters. Same store revenue growth for the third quarter was 5.5% with all markets except Houston and DC over 5%. Our top 5 markets exceeded 8% growth, Denver at 9.3%, Phoenix at 8.5%, Atlanta 8.4%, Santiago Inland Empire 8.3% and Dallas at 8.2%. DC and Houston performed as expected for the quarter with approximately 1% and 3% revenue growth. All markets performed well sequentially with 2.1% revenue growth over last quarter. New leases for the second quarter were up 3.5% and renewable were up 6.9% both 20 basis points better than at this time last year. October new leases and renewals are running 1.1.% and 6% and this November, December renewals newer offers are going out at about 7.3%. For the third quarter, occupancy averaged 96% versus 95.5% last quarter and 95.9% in the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date our net turnover was 3% below last year at 53% versus 56%, move-outs to purchase new homes fell in line with seasonal trends at 14.2% versus 14.8% last quarter and basically flat with a year ago. Our onsite teams continue to outperform their competitors as well as their budgets, keep it up finish strong, we’ll see you soon. I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander Jessett : Thanks, Keith. Last night we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2015 of $104.4 million or $1.14 per share. These results are in line with the midpoint of our prior guidance range for the third quarter of $1.12 to $1.16 per share. For the third quarter, total property revenue exceeded our forecast by approximately $900,000 or $0.01 per share. With half of the variance coming from our same store communities and half of the variance coming from our non-same store and development communities. Fee income continues to be favourable to plan driven primarily by higher occupany and additional pricing power which enabled us to collect higher net fees and move them. This positive variance was entirely offset by higher than anticipated property level expenses related to higher employee benefit and healthcare charges and the timing of property tax refunds we now anticipate during the fourth quarter. All other line items for the quarter were in line with expectations. Our new Camden technology package with bundled cable and internet service is rolling out as scheduled and for the third quarter contributed approximately 30 basis points to our NOI growth. For the year, this initiative has added 50 basis points to our same store revenue growth, 100 basis points to our expense growth and 20 basis points to our NOI growth. We now have approximately 20,000 units signed up for our technology package and the program is performing in line with expectations. Based upon our year-to-date operating performance we revised upwards and tightened our 2015 full year revenue expense and NOI guidance. We now anticipate full year 2015 same store growth to be between 5.1% and 5.3% for revenue, expenses and NOI. The new midpoint of 5.2% for both revenue and NOI represented 20 basis point improvements. We are increasing our expenses midpoint by 20 basis points as a result of the previously mentioned higher than anticipated levels of employee benefit and healthcare charges we recognised in the third quarter. We’ve also revised our full year 2015 FFO per share outlook. We now anticipate 2015 FFO per share to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.55 versus our prior range of $4.47 to $4.57 representing a $0.01 per share increase in the midpoint. This result mainly from higher same store NOI growth now expected in the fourth quarter. Our revised full year 2015 FFO guidance assumes no additional real estate transactions in the fourth quarter. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.17 to $1.21. The midpoint of $1.19 represents a $0.05 per share increase from the third quarter of 2015. This $0.05 per share increase is primarily a result of the following. A $0.065 per share increase in FFO due to growth in property and net operating income comprised of a $0.03 per share increase resulting from an approximate 2% expected sequential increase in same store NOI driven primarily by a normal third to fourth quarter seasonal decline in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover and personal expenses and the timing of certain property tax refunds. A $0.02 per share increase resulting from the NOI contributions of our five developments and lease up, a $0.02 per share increase resulting from the normal third to fourth quarter seasonal increase in revenue from our Camden Miramar student housing community and a $0.05 per share decrease due to the loss of NOI from our recently completed $33 million disposition. This $0.065 per share increase in FFO will be partially offset by $0.015 per share decrease in FFO as a result of the planned fourth quarter bond transaction.  Turning to the capital markets, during the third quarter we completed the refinancing of our existing line of credit increasing our borrowing capacity by $100 million to $600 million in total extending the maturity date by four years and decreasing our borrowings led by 20 basis points. Although our current plan for the fourth quarter contemplates a new $250 million 10-year bond transaction we are flexible to the exact time and issuance. We are monitoring bond market conditions closely and may complete this issuance this year or early next year. Currently we estimate that all in ten year bond pricing for Camden will be in the high 3% range. Our balance sheet remained strong with debt to EBITDA 5.4 times, a fixed charge expense coverage ratio at 5.3 times, secured debt to gross rate asset with 11%, 78% of our assets unencumbered and 84% of our debt at fixed rates. At this time we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Nick Joseph of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Hey it’s Michael Bilerman here for Nick. Rick, you talked a lot about the private market and acquisition pricing being robust. We have clearly seen some M&A deals through larger portfolio transactions. I guess how aggressive are you going to be to try to now just tap between your stock and your NAV. How much of the company would you sell, would you entertain a failed company? I’m just curious how you are going to take advantage of it?
Richard Campo: Well, we clearly have taken advantage of upgrading the quality of our portfolio by selling a substantial amount of assets into this market and redeploy the capital into either development or acquisitions and also lowering our dept profile pretty dramatically over that period of time as well. So, it does make a lot of sense to take advantage of the acquisition, but then the high bid prices that are out there and we'll continue to do that. As far as selling the company, when you get into the discussion of that kind of thing, so the question about whether you want to sell your company or not is really a function of you think the value proposition is spread between the NAV of the company today and a current stock price is a permanent issue because of something wrong with company. For example, if people don't trust management or there's a fundamental CASM between the public markets and the private markets. But generally over the 22 years that we've been in this business we found that those times are around, but they generally aren't permanent and generally the markets those spread between NAV and prior market value and stock prices narrow all the time if you do the right thing, which is continuing to allocate capital properly during these market times. And then making sure that you are executing above and beyond what the private market is executing on from a net operating income perspective. We tell our people in the field that we want them to exceed the market conditions, outperform their market no matter what the market conditions are. As long as we do that the management team, we keep our debt low. We focus on executing in the field every single day, the gap between our stock price and our NAV will narrow over time. If we didn't think that would narrow and it was a permanent, investors didn't want to invest in REIT stocks and there was a long term permanent disconnect than we would clearly look at making sure we harvest that value for shareholders.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And this is Nick here. You mentioned that almost all your markets are stronger improving and then you like to see above long terms trend in 2016 except for Houston obviously, so what is your expectations for Houston revenue growth both to finish in 2015 and looking ahead to next year?
Richard Campo: Nick, we still think we'll finish in the 3% range for Houston this year and with regard to next year we're just in the process. Right now doing our Roundup budgets and once we get numbers some in the field we're very much – very decentralize as it relates to our budgeting process. We give guidelines. But ultimately our operators in the field have the best intelligence and do the best job given the information that we provide them with. And coming up with your budget, so we'll see what comes out of that process in the next 30 days or so. And then we'll put together a plan for 2016 that's approximately given that input.
Alexander Jessett: Houston, clearly its not going to be better than 2016 better than 2015, but I will tell you that lot of people surprised by the demand side of the equation given the supply coming in and also given the job growth being flat. And so, there's a lot of interesting things, dynamics that are going on in this market that people don't get. One of which is we had a housing shortage here for a long period of time and we're just filling that sort of shortage whole to this new supply coming in. And then the other thing that's been happening that's very interesting is that product has been built, it's delivered in Houston today, a lot of it, it hasn't ever existed in the market. We're talking about high end, high rise buildings, urban developments that today are leasing for $2.50 to $3 a square foot and that's creating its own new demand suburban flight if you will, people moving in because of the traffic and the product is bigger, its more luxurious and its more sort of welcoming to that [Indiscernible] investor crowd that is trying to sort of get rid of the traffic scenario. So, that's been a really interesting and unusual situation, because in last cycles you said sort of regular apartments. Today, we have apartments that are actually appealing to the non-traditional apartment dweller, somebody who has an average income of a quarter a million and up and can afford to live wherever they want.
Nick Joseph: Just a follow-up on that supply, what percentage of that supply being built in Houston has been done by merchant builders?
Richard Campo: 80% and 90%, 95%.
Nick Joseph: Does that…
Richard Campo: Well, so let's put it this way, there's only one development being built today in Houston by a public company which is Camden and all the rest are merchant builders. So its actually 99% probably.
Nick Joseph: And what's your expectation around what type of concessions that they will use to lease up?
Richard Campo: Merchant builders are very typically and we are too, new developments tend to when you have a zero occupied property giving free rent is easy to do since you don't have any revenue anyway right. So, free rent today range is depending where you are to zero for the hottest properties and up to month or two months free for some of the merchant builder property that here today. But there is a sort of dichotomy happening, the shift between the As and the Bs, which is very typical in cycles like this where sort of the suburban properties in Houston doesn't have as much competition, everyone wanted to be in the urban course, so the urban core is probably weaker than the suburban core and the A properties are growing at a – or getting more pressure from that supply than the B properties.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Gina Glenn of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Gina Glenn: Thank you. Maybe following up on that, new type of supply that’s been delivered, you have great results in Denver and Atlanta, but those markets that are seeing a lot of mid and high rise product built, can you maybe comment on how portfolio compares in the price point?
Richard Campo: So, in both Denver and Atlanta, our portfolio was less exposed to where the bulk of the construction has been going on. It tends to be in the population and job growth centers outside of the CVD and obviously we got a couple of assets in those markets, but generally speaking we're going to be less effected. In both of those markets, if you look at supply and demand situation out in to 2016, they both look still pretty strong. And Denver it looks like our forecast for 2016 is about 30,000 jobs and forecast for new deliveries in 2016 is about 7,000 apartments, so that's really not that far off what we would considered to be equilibriums. The numbers in Atlanta, 2016 forecasting 65,000 jobs, forecasting 11,000 new apartments and that's actually a condition that would add to overall market tightness, not the other direction. So obviously if you in a submarket and you have three new – two or three new communities that are trying to get least up and your direct competitors you're going to catch some track note from that, I don't care really what the market conditions are, but generally speaking we think those markets. We're very well positioned in those markets at the submarket level and on – if you just look at the macro level those should continue to be pretty strong market for us next year.
Alexander Jessett: I think the thing that's interesting too when you think about those markets with strong job growth. You still have a 1 million to 1. 5 million of millennials that are still living at home more than they were living in home in 2007. So, there still unbundling that's coming, that's happening as a result of these of job gross. And then when you look at the idea that the millennials are not buying homes now, we just saw the new home sales numbers were pretty down across the country in the last week or so. And so, the home purchases, we don't have as many people moving out to buy homes, so and the millennials are taking time to get married and change jobs and things like that. So that demand side is a whole lot more robust which means you need a whole less job growth in order to fill up the properties you have to create more demand for multifamily and you saw the homeownership rate I think flatten and stop declining, but it still at very low levels, so that just bodes well for the increase and demand in these markets like Denver, Atlanta and Chevrolet and in Florida, Southern California.
Gina Glenn: Thank you. And appreciate the update on move outs for home trend seem kind of flat. Do you have an update on affordability for your markets?
Richard Campo: Yes. We've been bumping around 17.1, 17.2 for a long time. We did have a slight uptick in the quarter to about 17.5, but again well below what we think kind of the long term average of affordability is in our portfolio which is over 20 years, its closer to about 19%. So we still think we got a fair amount of room there and again quarter to quarter blips are kind of hard to read much into, but it did tick up 17.5.
Gina Glenn: Thank you.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning. Hey, referring to Billerman’s question, maybe I missed it but did you address or talk about maybe a chunk of the portfolio not a full company, but clearly if the demand is strong you guys have massive discount, it seem like a good time to sell assets that may not fit longer term. I'm sure you could price shelter fair amount and pay a nice special dividend and reward investors. So what are your thoughts about that?
Richard Campo: Well, clearly we showing that we're willing to sell assets, 1.7 billion and we continue to look at the portfolio and turn the portfolio where we think in [Indiscernible] trend, so that's out of the question. It's just the matter of the right moves at the right time, at the right price. And so we clearly recognize that there is disconnect today and we're going to maximize the value per shareholders anyway we can including portfolio analysis.
Q – Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then switching to Houston, if you just think about what may go on there and let's assume that it’s a replay, what happened in Washington DC., we sort of have prolong soft market. Are there any lessons that you took away from operating in DC. over the past number of years that will help you sort of maybe do a bit better in Houston, vis-à-vis its sort of soft market with supply continuing to come out. I get it that you know its more higher end supply, but still it supply. So is there anything – any takeaways from operating in D.C. that make you help perform Houston to the next – during this soft time?
Richard Campo: It's not really -- Alex, it's really not from lessons learned from DC. This is lessons learned from 30 years of been in this business and operate in bunch of different markets. And one of the things that we always do when we're forecasting weakness in the market ahead as we start adjusting things like least term, which we've already – we started that process some time ago here in Houston. Normally we would encourage 12 months leases, so that in a raising market we get to reset the price every 12 months. And obviously as you start doing your forecasting and you see that you're not going be in the strong rent growth period potentially not a strong rent growth period. Longer leases are better for the landlord [ph] and we've already done that. The other thing is that you try to – one of the things that we know is that as much dollars bring on your product they're going to get very aggressive on concession, so one of the things that we do is we very much more aggressive on renewals that can get increasingly expensive to backfill units and in an environment where merchant builders are willing to give pretty substantial concessions to try to get to the finish lines. So, we've done all that and obviously we did that in the first part of the Washington DC cycle. You kind of never know how long these things are going to persist. I do think it's interesting though on our numbers in commentary we seem to get people at sort of lumping Houston and DC together, obviously they are two weakest performing markets in our portfolio right now. So there is – I understand the natural tendency to do that. But I think you're talking about markets that are in very different places. So Washington DC has been in our either bottom one or two for four years. Houston has been on our top four for four straight years. So this is the first year in five that Houston won't be our top performing market. So, I just think you get markets that are in very different states and obviously the operations formula for that is those two are very different.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Appreciate it. And I like the opening music, looks like you guys had some fun with your [Indiscernible]. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Weissman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys. This is Chris for Ian. Great quarter on revenue growth, but same-store OpEx is up 5.7%, we talked about on previous calls. You talked about higher employer benefit. Could you talk a little bit more about number overall? What drove that 12.8% increase in Houston? And then just the overall 9.2% increased in property taxes?
Richard Campo: Yes, absolutely. So, if you look at Houston, the12.8% is almost entirely driven by property taxes. But Houston for the year on property tax basis is going to be up approximately 20%. If you look at what it was for the quarter taken in account certain refunds we got a year ago same quarter was of course 24%. So that's what drove the Houston operating expense issue. When we think about operating expenses in general, so taxes for us this year is going to up approximately 7%. Taxes make up a third of our total operating expenses, so right off the bat you got approximately 2.1% increase in operating expenses before you look at anything else. And then, on top of that the new technology package we're rolling out with [Indiscernible] adding about 100 basis points to our full year expense number. Those are really the outliers. Once you extract those the rest of our operating expenses are in line with the expectations and we'll pass the history.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And when we hear you have a huge refund in 2014 versus this year, what's driving your ability to get that big refund last year versus not being able to do kind of something similar this year?
Richard Campo: So the refinance I was referring to refunds in Houston last year because in regards to the 12.8% increase in expenses for Houston, a lot of that just timing. So what happens is when we get all of our assessments out from the appraisal district we obviously contest the vast majority of them and lots of them end up actually go in the litigation and so settlement timing is really dependent upon when you get the final resolution with the appraisal district.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. And then just moving over to the Camden Washington you remain partial acquired earlier this months and did you talk about maybe the capital budget for the project. What you underwrite in terms of the stabilized deals. And then where does that fit into the shallow pipeline in terms of expected starts?
Richard Campo: Sure. The Washingtonian underwritten yield is in the mid 6s and the start is scheduled for 2016. We have – when you look it our search this year we started two projects this year. Development pipeline is definitely shrinking and it's appropriate in this part of the cycle and with capital constraints the way they are. So we are – we think that project is great project, great yield and we will evaluate start in 2016 when we get closer to it.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mr. Sadler, is your phone on mute?
Richard Campo: We cannot hear him.
Operator: Your next question then comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good afternoon guys. When you think about run rate for same-store expenses given personal cost and given the property taxes, given your exposure to markets like Texas and others that are being hyper-aggressive on passing through, I mean, what's out there that sort of gives you relief over the next couple of years that you don't keep seeing, 4.5%, 5% same-store expense growth?
Richard Campo: Well, ultimately when you endure Alex, mentioned 29% increases in tax cost in the market, how many of those can there be that before there is no gap between assess value and market value. So each year that you get one of those behind you think you're making progress. In terms of long term expense, we back 20 years and look at our reported same-store operating expenses, its roughly 3% on all expenses and the interesting thing is over that same time frame property taxes, the increase in property taxes over 20 years is been about 2.1% in our portfolio. So even though right now we're getting killed by property taxes and it certainly makes us to pull our hair out. Reality is that over a long period of time they've been below the average of all other expenses in our portfolio. So, we're definitely getting slam right now, and some of that is just reflects the reality that everyone knows that property values even in markets like Houston which are getting a lot of scrutiny right now. The stuff is still trading the CapEx rate that's going to make you eyes expand. So I think long term it’s a 3%, 2.5% to 3% cost market in terms of expense growth, long term its 2% on taxes but right now I tell you we're upside down with 2%.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then, today how do you guys think about redevelopment within the portfolio, I mean, what's the overall opportunity there and how much did you guys spend in 2000 for going to spend on 2015 and what are return sort of averaging for you guys?
Richard Campo: So, the entire program that we laid out a couple of years ago had a spent of about $230 million associated with it, with a pro forma yield of about 11, and that's what we have return year to-date on our redevelopment, so obviously the bulk of that's behind us. I think this year we're on track to do about 2500 to 3000 apartments we probably go another numbers similar to that, that would be available for 2016, but obviously the bulk of it having done 20,000 apartments already is those that were didn't make sense for economically and given their market position have been done.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, guys. This is Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts on the elevated multifamily permit levels and then what your thoughts were on the homebuilders getting into the multifamily business more permanently.
Richard Campo: The multifamily, the elevation of the supply is a function of the demand that's been met, if you go back to the over the last five years, we've had a shortage of multifamily housing in America for last five years, that's why occupancy rates were the highest they been and rental rate growth has been robust for long time. so we're basically delivering and starting projects that are being absorb near the marketplace very efficiently. So I think that the ability for multifamily to increase the level of production from this level is very limited even with home builders getting into the business, also there's been a bunch of office companies get into it, high ends is now developing the permits as well as these office companies or the [Indiscernible] challenge we have today is that, if you look at ours, our delivery for example Camden, everyone of our projects is delayed at least two months and in some times as long as six to eight, nine months, its primarily because the lack of construction workers and the lack of ability to get product complete. And I think some of the worry about supply has been muted or at least the effect of supply have muted by the fact that you have a lot of projects under construction that can't delivered the market because of this construction worker shortage. So I don't think that the industry has the capacity to increase the supply side of the equation very much from where it is today. The other think that will hold that back through a certain extent is because of this shortage of construction workers cost have gone up dramatically, land cost have gone and the financing model that was used in the last cycle before the great recession has changed dramatically where banks actually look for merchant builders liquidity and they actually test for contingent liabilities relative to real tangible capital which is amazing right. In 2007 most merchant builders had infinite contingency as to capital and/or guarantees to capital which is pretty amazing. So today I don't think we have even with the new competition coming in, but you don't have an ability to really increase the number of units that re being build based on sort of at today's level.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for all the detail there. And then just could you comment on the performance in DC between your suburban and CBD properties and which set of properties really are you more optimistic about headed into 2016?
Richard Campo: Our DC proper communities have historically outperformed our suburban assets. In the last four years it hasn't been much spread because there's been, there has whole lot of pricing power, but the pricing power that we have had was in our DC proper assets, obviously we had great success with our normal one lease up. We had great success with South Capital and those sort of came on the market at a time where there wasn't a whole lot of other competition in DC proper based on that we started, number two which again we are again we think we're going to hit the market at a really opportune in time. So my guess is there is probably a permanent benefit to DC proper assets if you look at over ten-year timeframe versus suburban. But before DC kind of hit the skids on in this cycle both of those asset classes were doing extremely well. But they've – DC proper would have a premium than as well.
Richard Anderson: Great. Thank you.
Ric Campo: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Dave Bragg: Thank you. Good morning. Just going back to the topic of capital allocation, despite the unfavourable cost of capital Camden is really still a net grower this year when we factor into development, and the stocks underperformance this year and over the long-term doesn’t really make it clear that this strategy is working. So its good hear that you're considering a more aggressive approach on the asset sales. So the question is about development, the continued focus on development, kind of sticks out given your cost of capital. How do you think about the risk adjusted returns available on development versus the stock?
Ric Campo: Well, the – we've had a lot's of discussions about stock buy backs and the challenge that we've had with buying the stock back is been the volatility and the blackout periods that we've been in. And when you look at the disconnect between the stock price in NAV and historically we have been big buyer of the stock back and we purchased A huge amount of the stock in the past and we typically done it with a 20% discount to NAV. And so I think that’s a reasonable opportunity to do if we have what we've been saying all along which is persistent sort of disconnect and in last time I looked in the last three months we were 52 week high and 52 week low and that happened during our blackout period the last time. So when you think about our development pipeline we've definitely shrunk it and we're definitely not driving that to high levels today because of the capital situation and the cycle in the market. So if this persistent disconnect between NAV and the actual stock price continues, we will be in the market buying to stock back.
Dave Bragg: Thanks for that Ric. So now that maybe the stocks performance today takes it back closer to a 20% discount and the stocks been trading out of discount for the group for about a year now that might be said and you have further opportunity to do that?
Ric Campo: Yes. We've always said, its persistent and a significant discount that allows us to sell assets and buy stock and keep it on leverage neutral basis, we will be doing that.
Dave Bragg: Okay. The second question, besides the capital allocation, the other key reasons that might be trading up a discount, that it is, its probably Houston. What are you thoughts on selling assets in Houston proving out private market values there?
Ric Campo: I don’t think selling assets in Houston proves anything, because the private market is robust. So you can look at lots of trade that have been done in the last 60 days at sub five cap rates and selling the couple of assets in Houston is not going to convince people that Houston is not going off the cliff in 2016 and '17. So I think its sort of a moot or its sort of game that wouldn’t get you anything. And so when we look at selling assets, we want to sell assets that are slow growing assets, with that high CapEx, that somebody will pay a premium for because they don’t put the real CapEx number in their underwriting, and we want to keep the portfolio quality long-term really good. And we like our Houston assets. We think Houston is going to be a great market long-term and our Houston assets don’t scream in the bottom quartile of our properties when we look at them on that basis.
Dave Bragg: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hello, everyone. I wanted to go back to that point you made about the pent-up demand in Houston, where were these people staying, were they coupled up or they outside Beltway. And would some your properties be impacted by their supply, your properties that are outside the Beltway, if people were to start to move into the city?
Ric Campo: The people that are moving into the city are leaving homes and not apartments, a lot of them…
Wes Golladay: Okay.
Ric Campo: And so new supply is just coming in that is new to that – new product type, that’s attracting investor into the urban core, they are definitely coming out of homes not apartments. Those are typical people who, you know, kids got to college, so they have a big house and husband and wife or what have you and they now move in. In terms of the – where the people were, I think there were lot of people doubled up, no question about that and a lot of people would come in to Houston and they would, sort of settle into a specific area and the figure the city out and then move to where they ultimately wanted to be. So there was definitely a fair amount of doubled up folks. The other thing I think what's happening to this, and I think this is supporting suburban, and that is that, the suburban supply has not been as robust at the urban supply in Houston. So those folks were filling the suburban properties up to the point where they had 97%, 98% occupancy's and that’s just unsustainable. I mean, Houston generally is a 95% occupied market, maybe even a 94-5 [ph] market and today we probably have 200 basis points of excess occupancy in the overall market because of the people moving in.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then how is the Tenet Health [ph] out three, are you now seeing any up tick in bad debt expense in your Houston properties?
Ric Campo: No, not all. We have meeting every, I think at least once a month, but also when we have conference call, we check with our managers and we haven’t had very limited information about people moving up because they lost their job and energy or something like that. And so it has not been a massive wave of energy losses that have impacted our specific properties. And I'll give an example, when Enron went bust in 2001, I mean, we had a property in downtown or in midtown Houston that went from 95% occupancy to 75% in like a day and that nothing like that is happening here today in Houston, Texas.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then you offered up some preliminary job forecast for some of the markets, did you happen to have one for Houston, are you guys still working on that?
Ric Campo: We've got Houston and these are not our numbers, these are Ron Whitman's number just to be clear. We've got Houston ahead about 30,000, 31,000 jobs forecasted for 2016. He still carry in 25,000, 20 to 25,000 for 2015. Houston historically has big chunk of their annual job growth in the fourth quarter. So we'll see if that happens or not, but in any case his number for 2016 is about 31,000.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate all the color.
Ric Campo: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. Ric, you had talked about the development pipeline coming down going forward and so just based on capital and the environmental overall. Just kind of curios, how much do you think starts will come down for you in '16 and '17 versus, say '15?
Ric Campo: Well, in '15 we started two projects. I don’t think we'll start more than two in any of those years, given the current environment. So they likely will come down some because of just project cost. In '15 Camden NoMa is a big project and other ones will be probably be smaller than that in '16 or '17 in terms of total dollars.
Dan Oppenheim: And then you are talking about the funding environment being more difficult. What about the funding via assets sales given how strong interest there, so at this point?
Ric Campo: The funding – the assets sales are – there is no limit to the number of assets that you can sell today given the robust bid. The issue with asset sales to fund development is that we have limited amount that we could sell and not have to pay a special dividend because of the tax aspects of REIT land. I think we have – we've said in the past that we can sell somewhere in the $300 million, plus or minus depending on the game structure without paying a special dividend. But every dollar over that from a sales perspective you have to do either do a 1031 exchange or you have to do a special dividend of the game. And which we're not opposed to if it make sense and we can create value in that way.
Dan Oppenheim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Just a going back to the job growth side of things. I think in the opening comments you talked about expecting for most of the markets to see continued above trend job growth. I was just curious, you know, does that presume that job growth picks up from sort of where it’s been in the last couple months. We've seen a little bit of dip here, but just curious what kind of overall growth you're sort of thinking about?
Ric Campo: So the numbers that we gave you today on job growth in the markets for 2016 forecast are from Ron Whitman and he is using a national or US number in 2016 of 2.5 million and that would compare to his, what he is forecasting for full year 2015 of about 2.9 million. So he is actually forecasting fewer jobs in 2016, than what were created in 2015, were about 3,000. So that then derives or drives his analysis at the individual city level. So you - if you carry that across all of our markets, you'd say that the job market – overall job market is not going to be a little bit lesser robust in 2016 than 2015. But 2.5 million jobs overall next year I think most people would take that and we certainly would.
Vincent Chao: Okay. And it sounds like he is projecting Houston to actually be up. So I guess is there any market that is projected to really fall, thinking maybe West Coast where things have been extremely strong?
Ric Campo:
's: But our markets tend to create more jobs than the national average does and that’s the reason we operate in these markets. So I can send it to you market-by-market.
Vincent Chao: Okay. Thanks. I'll follow up afterwards. But – and then just one other question on the expense side. It sounds like most of that was – we talked about the key drivers. But have had to think about changing your market expense at all, in terms of trying to adjust the current additions and drive demand, drive volume?
Ric Campo: So what we do, in terms of total marketing spend, our actual marketing spend has been down for the last three or four years, primarily because of the ability to do better targeting and through our search engine. What we do more of now is rotating dollars between markets and then even between sub markets, sometimes targeting specific community. So where there is a need then we do a much better job of allocating that resource where it’s needed. Where as before we sort of had to take the – if Houston is showing some weakness, then we would support all of Houston communities and we longer do that. I mean, because in Houston even today despite the fact that the overall market is 3% we got a whole lot of our communities that are still below 5% and 6% and again the primarily suburban assets. So where we need to spend the money, we're lot smarter about spending it overall, marketing spend for the last couple of years is down slightly. If you go back to the total spend as a percentage of where we were say five, six years ago, its down pretty significantly. So it’s – just been smarter about where you spend your money and have in better idea of what communities need support and what – at what parts of the cycle.
Vincent Chao: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tom Lesnick of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Tom Lesnick: Hey, guys. It looks like most of your under construction lease of properties improved by double-digit lease up sequentially. But looking at Camden Flatirons that will only improve a couple of percentage points. Just wondering what if anything was driving that and what are your thoughts generally on Denver's supply right now?
Vincent Chao: So on Camden Flatirons that’s 424 unit community and this is - we always know that this happens, you get to a point in your lease up where you're actually competing with yourself in a sense that you got residents that moved in 12 months ago. We've averaged over the [indiscernible] into our timeframe with that lease up about 25 to 30 apartments per months. So if you do the math, somewhere when you get to about 80% occupied you start running into the residents that you put in there on day one. So it’s just – its part of what we know is going to happen. So yes, that one was a little weak in the quarter, but we're well along the way if that one stay last. Overall in Denver, still a really good environment to be leasing in. There is a fair amount of new stuff that’s been build right now, but we were very early to the – our starts in Denver and they have come online at a very good time for getting well above pro forma rents in every case.
Tom Lesnick: Okay. And then Alex, I am just curious on the fourth – the plan unsecured this year in 4Q, where you heard another company talk about their known debt financing need this quarter and their preference actually to utilize the term loan market as opposed to the unsecured market right now, so I think volatility in the unsecured markets. So I’m just wondering have you guys considered a term loan and will of the unsecured or what are your thoughts there?
Ric Campo: So the unsecured bond market certainly has then -- has had some ups and downs during the last quarter. The thing I’ll tell you is when you are still at a historical low interest rate it seems best to get duration. The challenge with the bank term loan market is five is a preference and some have got the sevens. But interest rates this were we still like ten is a longer.
Tom Lesnick: Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Richard Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Anderson: Thanks. I know it’s going to be a busy day, so I FedEx my questions. Did you receive them?
Ric Campo: Yeah, as a matter of fact it got delivered directly to my door step.
Richard Anderson: Oh good, good.
Ric Campo: Because I demand first class service.
Richard Anderson: So what’s your answer then?
Ric Campo: The answer is no.
Richard Anderson: So Keith, if you were to look at Dallas, Austin, Charlotte and Denver, you know we talk a lot about Houston and DC, but those are some markets where I think you know you can argue there is some fly issues. Would you be changing your kind of rank on them you know in terms of the direction they were going from maybe neutral positive to decline on four -- any one of those four?
Keith Oden: You know not right now Rich. If you look at the job growth that those four markets are getting this year and what’s projected next year, they are still all four of those very strong markets. Yeah, of those on a percentage basis you got -- the Charlotte market has a lot of new constructions that’s kind of working its way through the pipeline, but you know even Charlotte next year projecting about 16,000 new apartments plus or minus and Charlotte has projected to be about 32,000 jobs, so that’s dis equilibrium in this near term. But I would tell you that we have not seen any real pressure from the new developments to this point. And I think its speaks to what Ric talked about earlier is that if you just kind of look at traditional measures of digi growth jobs and what was the multi family supply. I don’t think you can get to the answer that we’ve absorbed almost 14,000 units in Charlotte, and we’re still 96%, 97% occupied and raising rents. So it just doesn’t make any sense, so there is got to be other things in play and I think the unbundling that Ric described is certainly in evidence in Charlotte.
Richard Anderson: Okay. And follow up to Ric early on in the conversation you said you know your company is not broken or you know beyond repair and you are not going to sell and I get all that and no one is arguing the quality of the organization. But looking at it the other way if you had the equity markets to back you up, do you see any kind of situations out there of scale that are kind of “broken” or permanently below NAV that you would be buying right now if you could ?
Ric Campo: I think that’s a complicated mass situation with stock prices where they are at this point because you would have to use massive leverage which would be countered to what we want to do with leverage wise. But I don’t think I see that out there. I mean, you are talking about public companies, the sort of broken ones have been taken out and you know we are always looking for interesting opportunities but when you look at this capital environment it will be pretty hard to make the math work with the equity prices where they are today.
Richard Anderson: No doubt. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: On Houston organic growth, its pretty much what you expected at the beginning of the year, but is it safe to say the employment situation is not as strong. And are you concerned at all with the recent announcement by Chevron and Halliburton hires white collared jobs being cut?
Ric Campo: So we are definitely concerned about the long term aspect of what’s going on in Energy obviously. And if energy prices continue to stay at these low levels and these companies have to adjust its definitely going to impact Houston. We understand that. But, the interesting part is it’s hard to say when and where and like to the issue with Chevron and Halliburton they have both -- they are reticent to say where the jobs are being cut and a lot of them are cutting jobs outside of Houston but and bringing people in Houston to warehouse some in Houston. So, its really hard to say how that’s all going to play out and that’s why there is probably pretty limited visibility into what happens in 2016. And you know on the one hand you got the bulls who say that oil is going to be 70 bucks by June 2016 and on the other hand you have you know the Bears who its 20 and obviously there is a big difference between those two numbers in terms of how that economy overall performed. So at this point you haven’t seen any major employer just give pink slips to a ton of apartment dwellers that live in our properties.
John Kim: Ric, you referenced your experience with Enron and now the situation appears to be different, but is there anything that you could do this time around if thing did turn sour quickly?
Ric Campo: Well the key as we manage it every single day we mark our properties to market every day. We extended our leases as Keith discussed so that we have longer duration. And beyond that you just have to offer the best living experience in the market and outperform the market no matter what the conditions are. And we’ve been to this movie before, Houston is as a market that we know how to operate on the uptick and we know how to operate on the downtick. And so we will get through this time in a I think a very reasonable way and what is it going to look like next year the year after you know it’s anybody’s guess at this point. The good news is they are tubulising [ph] that people do about Houston and you think about it’s 12.5% of our portfolio and the reason we -- its only 12.5% is we don’t want to have any one market, the dominant market that’s going to take the whole company south. If you have a 10% decline in Houston’s NOI next year it’s a 100 basis point change in our overall same property NOI for the portfolio or 110 or something like that. So at the end of the day, you can tubulise Houston but it hasn’t -- we haven’t seen it manifest and I think that it’s well over blown and already in the stock.
John Kim: Okay moving on to potentially something else that’s over blown package gate. I think you did a good job explaining your rationale, but it seems like the cost to handle the extra packages is really not that significant especially when you consider all the media attention brought to it. How serious are you at this point considering other options like these competitors have to drive there.
Ric Campo: So when the -- so to answer your question about considering other options, we’re not because we are perfectly happy with the solution that we have put in place. Now about half of our residents in our portfolio get the package -- the package is delivered directly to the front door which we think is a far better customer experience for almost everyone. I think ultimately that number of 50% of our residents will continue to climb and at some point our residents, the people who come to our community will begin asking as they are in the market shopping, they will begin asking our competitors why don’t they have the option of having their package delivered directly to their door. And when question starts being asked in large numbers by our customer base then we’ll see what other people do. But we are perfectly comfortable with where we are and we think that we are providing higher level of service to a large number of our residents all ready, we think that number is going to grow. If you look at what happened when we starting drilling for water [Indiscernible] you are not taking something away from somebody and in this case we are improving their service by the packages. But when we build for water we have properties across the street from us, with big Billboard banded signs on their property saying free water here, don’t lease at Camden. Well I can tell you that those properties today charge for water, any property in the institutional quality real estate realm today charges for water. So somebody has to lead the way and start paving the way and we’re going to take some arrows from the press and maybe competitors saying no I can’t believe they are doing that, but at the end of the day it’s a better solution for the customers, it’s a better solution for us and our competitors will follow you watch.
John Kim: Now when you are talking about customer satisfaction to the state, how do you track this, is this on surveys or your property manager feedback or?
Ric Campo: Property manager feedback, you know you just kind of look at the numbers, right. And when we ask our top 170 property community managers how many people in your community have actually given notice or made a change to their living status based on a package policy, the answer is those are handful. So you can -- you know anybody from the outside looking in unless you have access to the fact I can’t imagine that you could make an informed judgement about what’s better for us or our customers. The solution that we’ve rolled out is the only one that I’m aware of that actually meets the three objective that we set out for making a change to our package policy, provides best customer service, frees up our on-site staff time and it’s a solution that’s scalable upto 5 million packages. If you got another one that meets those objectives I want to hear it.
John Kim: I think that was fine. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Well I appreciate your time today and we will see you -- in a few weeks. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our conference. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder Camden's complete second quarter 2015 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. As there are several multi-family calls today we will try to be brief in our prepared remarks and complete the call within one hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue if you have other items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today we'll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. A few weeks ago our team had to discuss topics for this quarter’s conference call and as always we started with most important item, picking the pre-call music. Well it’s been a really hot summer here in Houston. The summer is in full swing so we decided to use songs about summer as a theme. We sort through dozens of summery songs and settled on five, one of which was All Summer Long by Kid Rock. A few days later I got a research report from our REIT analyst group whose name I won’t mention, except to say that the name rhymes with Fernings Beat [ph]. The report was an update on the residential REIT’s titled All Summer Long an obvious reference to the song by Kid Rock. Honestly what are the odds that we would both reference a somewhat obscure Kid Rock song in the same week. I'm guessing the odds are very low and certainly less than 20%. I’d like to thank our operating teams in the field and our corporate teams supporting our field teams for their contribution to our strong quarterly results. I know that some of you were surprised that we produced a strong quarter and raised guidance for the second time this year. We are however not surprised. We have built our portfolio based on a philosophy that geographic and product diversifications, in markets where population growth and job growth lead the nation will produce long term net operating income growth with lower volatility. Houston has been on everyone’s question list and is great example about how geographic and product diversification has served us well over the years. For the last three years, Houston has led our NOI growth and our revenue growth and as Houston moderates, we now have Atlanta, Denver and Austin leading the way for our revenue and NOI growth producing very good numbers. During the quarter we acquired two development sits, that I think they deserve discussions. They illustrate our disciplined and our strategy in this part of the apartment business cycle. It’s really difficult to compete for acquisitions given the low yields generated by the incredible law of capital that continues to invest in the multi-family business. So we’ve taken our objectives towards development and value creation to development and we’ve created a fair amount of value in our $1.3 billion of completed and under construction developments that will add $400 million of value to Camden’s NAV or nearly $4.50 a share. Development is also becoming more difficult as land prices continue to accelerate and construction costs and labor shortages are the order of the day. We acquired the two sites on a very attractive basis. The first I’ll talk about is the Arts District in Los Angeles. We’ve been working on this project for three years. There been multitude of zoning and entitlement issues and everything you can imagine that goes on in Southern California but we stayed with it. We focused - since we’ve been working on this job for three years, we acquired the land for $86 a square foot in a market that’s $250 to $400 a square foot today and we’re ahead of most of our competition there. The land in Arizona is an interesting story. So we bought the land from the State of Arizona adjacent to the Mayo Clinic, which is an incredible site that’s never been on the market, that we’ve been working on for five years. Complicated transaction buying from the state in an open auction, not always the thing you want to do. However since we were the only bidder, we bought the property for the lowest possible price. The fact that we were the only bidder was a result of the complexities and the timing the state required for bidders to put up dollars and also the due diligence. So being the only bidder in an incredibly attractive site is how we create value long term. So these two transactions I really think typify how you have to focus on a part of the market you’re in, if you can’t do acquisitions and you can’t do things that you’re used to doing. It’s really about discipline and focusing on trying to create value and wherever you can in this kind of the cycle and that’s what we are with these kinds of transactions. With that said, we’re very excited about what’s going on with Camden and we appreciate our teams in the field and I’ll turn the call over to Keith.
Keith Oden: Thanks Ric. As Ric mentioned the operating conditions across our portfolio remain very strong. Same store revenue growth for the second quarter was up 5.2% and 2.2% sequentially. The quarterly revenue growth of 5.2% represents our best growth rate in eight quarters and 12 of our 16 markets had revenue growth of better than 5%. Our top four markets for revenue growth were Atlanta at 9.2, Austin 8.4, Denver 7.9 and Phoenix at 7.2%. Houston and DC Metro continue to perform in line with expectations, posting revenue growth year-to-date of 3.7% for Houston and 0.6% for DC Metro. As a reminder in my market-by-market outlook for 2015, I assigned DC Metro a letter grade of C with a stable outlook and I rated Houston as a B market with a declining outlook. Both of these markets are performing slightly better than original budget and it’s certainly in line with our expectations for the first half of the year. Regarding Houston’s performance year-to-date, it’s perhaps a little surprising that our original revenue guidance is holding up in light of the substantial downward revisions to the employment growth outlook. Our original budget for Houston was based on an employment growth estimate of 60,000 new jobs for the year. Despite adding 4,000 jobs in June Houston’s job growth rate year-to-date rounds to zero. Based on the weak job growth in the first half of the year the employment growth estimates for Houston have been revised downward by Whitman Associates to 23,000 for the full year and by Greater Houston Partnership to 25,000. Although there are certainly more bearish estimates out there we believe it’s still possible that Houston ends the year with 20,000 or so net new jobs. Based on historical data from the Greater Houston Partnership, Houston typically adds 50% to 60% of its annual job growth in the months from September to December. Houston’s job growth is well below our original estimates and our revenues year-to-date are slightly ahead of budget which seems like a conundrum. We think there are two factors which have helped soften the impact of lower job growth. First, the skilled labor shortage has most likely pushed back the scheduled multi-family deliveries by at least a quarter. This is an issue in every market where we're building and its particularly acute here in Houston. Whitman is estimating 22,000 completions for the year in Houston. However we believe some of these deliveries will be pushed in to 2016. Secondly we believe that there is much higher level of pent-up demand for new apartment homes than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. In the four years leading into 2015, Houston added 400,000 new jobs and completed only 40,000 new apartment homes. Using the five to one ratio of jobs to apartments as a measure of equilibrium an estimated excess demand of 10,000 apartment homes was created. Some of the current absorption is undoubtedly coming from this pool of excess demand. Despite the downward revision to job growth our regional budget for Houston revenues still looks achievable at roughly 3.5% for the year and obviously Houston job growth in the second half of the year will greatly influence our outlook for 2016 results when we get to that. Back to our overall portfolio results, new leases for the second quarter were up 4.5%, renewals were up 6.7%, both better than the second quarter of ‘14 which were 3.6% and 6.3% respectively. July new leases were up 5.2% and renewals were up 6.8%, again both ahead of last year's results of 3% and 6.6%. August and September renewals were sent out at averaging at 8.3% increase and we're currently renewing leases in the 7% range. Our same store occupancy averaged 96% in the quarter, up from 95.5% last quarter and that from 95.6% in the second quarter of 2014. July occupancy averaged 96%, we currently stand at 95.8%. Our net turnover rate year-to-date was 48%, down 500 basis points from the 2014 levels and then finally our move-outs to purchase new homes remains historically low across our portfolio at 14.8% versus 14.6% in the second quarter of last year. To all of our associates we greatly appreciate your dedication to providing living excellence to our residents, especially during the dog days of summer. Hang in there, the long hot summer will be over before you know it. And as Kid Rock sings in All Summer Long now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves begin to change or how we thought those days would never end. We'll see you soon. Now I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move onto our financial results, a brief update on our second quarter development activities. During the quarter we reached stabilization at three communities; Camden Lamar Heights and Camden La Frontera both located in Austin, Texas and Camden Boca Raton in Florida. These three communities had a combined cost of approximately $135 million, delivered a 7% plus yield and created approximately $50 million of value to our shareholders, based on current market cap rates. Additionally, during the quarter we completed construction at Camden Hayden, a $44 million development in Tempe, Arizona, began leasing at Camden Glendale, a $115 million development in Glendale, California and began construction at Camden Shady Grove, a $116 million development in Rockville, Maryland. Also during the quarter we purchased two land parcels for future development in Los Angeles, California and Phoenix, Arizona. Subsequent to quarter end we completed construction at Camden Flatirons, a $79 million development in Denver, Colorado. As we do each quarter, on page 17 of our quarterly supplemental package we've adjusted our cost and timing for our developments to reflect our current estimates. The only significant change relates to our Camden Paces development in Atlanta, Georgia. We've increased our cost estimates by approximately 6%. Half of this increase is associated with own enhancements and the remainder relates to previous weather delays. This community is currently 57% leased and should deliver a 7% yield. Moving onto financial results, last night we reported funds from operations for the second quarter of 2015 of a $102 million dollar or $1.12, per share. These results were 0.02% per share better than the $1.10 mid-point of our prior guidance range. This positive variance resulted almost entirely from better than expected operating performance from our consolidated and non-consolidated communities, as both rental and fee income continue their favorability to plan, driven primarily by higher occupancy and additional pricing power which enabled us to collect higher net fees at move in. Our turnover for the quarter was 400 basis points better than this point last year while our occupancy for our same-store portfolio averaged 96% for the second quarter of 2015, 40 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2014. Each of our markets registered positive sequential revenue growth in the second quarter. Our new Camden technology package with Internet service is rolling out as scheduled and for the second quarter contributed approximately 45 basis points to our same-store revenue growth, a 100 basis points to our expense growth and 20 basis points to our NOI growth, all in line with expectations. Regarding property taxes, the majority of our assessments are now in, and although many of our initial tax assessments were higher than we had originally anticipated. We've had some degree of success with our protest and appeals. Last quarter we told you that we expected property taxes to increase 7% on a year-over-year basis. At this time we remain comfortable with that estimate. Based upon our strong year-to-date operating performance and our expectation of continued out performance for the remainder of the year we've revised upwards and tightened our 2015 full year revenue and NOI guidance. We now anticipate 2015 full year same-store revenue growth to be between 4.75% and 5.25%, expense growth to remain between 4.75% and 5.25% and NOI growth to be between 4.75% and 5.25%. As compared to our prior guidance ranges, our revised revenue midpoint of 5% represents a 50 basis point improvement and our revised NOI midpoint of 5% represents a 75 basis point improvement. For the second time this year we've also revised upwards our full year 2015 FFO per share outlook. We now anticipate 2015 FFO per share to be in the range of $4.47 to $4.57 versus our prior range of $4.40 to $4.56, representing a $0.04 per share increase to the prior midpoint. This increase is anticipated to result entirely from same store outperformance, as indicated by our 75 basis point increase in the midpoint of our full year 2015 same-store net operating income guidance. Part of this outperformance occurred in the second quarter and we anticipate this outperformance to continue throughout the remainder of the year. Our revised full year 2015 FFO guidance assumes a $100 million in wholly owned dispositions and $100 million in wholly owned acquisitions, both occurred in the fourth quarter with acquisition yields in the high-4% and dispositions yields in the high-5% range. Last night we also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2015. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.12 to $1.16. The midpoint of the $1.14 represents a $0.02 increase from the second quarter of 2015. This $0.02 per share increase is primarily due to higher property net operating income as a result of an approximate 1% or $0.01 per share expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, as revenue growth from the combination of higher rental and net fee income as we continue into our peak leasing periods, more than offset our expected increase in other property expenses due to timing of second quarter property tax refunds and normal seasonal summer increases in utilities and repair and maintenance cost, and an approximate $0.01 per share increase from our non-same-store communities as the additional NOI contributions from our six communities and lease up will be partially offset by the lost NOI from our student housing community in Corpus Christi, Texas. Occupancy declined significantly from June through August for this community. Turning to the capital markets, we anticipate completing the refinancing of our existing $500 million line of credit in the next few weeks. This will increase our borrowing capacity by $100 million to $600 million in total, extend the maturity date by four years and decrease our borrowings by about 20 basis points. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the REIT world, with debt-to-EBITDA in the low five times a fixed charge expense coverage ratio at five times, secured debt to gross assets at 12%, 80% of our assets unencumbered and 85% of our debt at fixed rates. At this time we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. For same store revenue growth, at the beginning of the year you expected a 25 to 50 bps benefit from the bulk internet initiative. What does the updated guidance assume for that?
Alexander Jessett: Right now, it's rolling out exactly as we had anticipated. So we are still in line with that estimate, might be a little bit towards the high end of that range.
Nicholas Joseph: Okay and then when looking into 2016, is there going to be a continued benefit from that or will it lead absent anything else to deceleration in kind of the other revenue line?
Alexander Jessett: So 2015 and 2016 are both roll out years. Obviously more of the roll out in '15 than '16 and then ultimately this will become a meaningful number for us, probably around $5 million.
Nicholas Joseph: Okay, thanks. And that's true on the expense side as well, right?
Alexander Jessett: That's correct. Generally what happens is you will see more of the expenses upfront.
Nicholas Joseph: Okay, so the actual NOI benefit will be more focused in 2016 in terms of the growth rates?
Alexander Jessett: That's correct.
Nicholas Joseph: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Alex Goldfarb: Good morning, down there. Hey, just quickly on the development, you guys obviously you walked through the background on each of these deals. But at the same time your common theme on this quarter has been - which has been for some time now, has been the difficulty in finding attractive acquisitions and development sites. So should we anticipate more developments from you guys or were these two sides just sort of one offs that guys have been working for some time and therefore we shouldn't expect a pick-up in new development starts from you guys?
Ric Campo: Definitely these project have been worked on for quite a while and we continue to - our teams continue to try to find those needles in the haystack, like we found in these two transactions. We think the development business is definitely more difficult today and it’s harder to cancel deals and we definitely pass on more than we buy. We have been consistent in our discussion about where we are on the development cycle and where we are in the permit cycle overall and as we finish developments we'll starts others. But we definitely have peaked in terms of the total under construction that we have now and will be adding anywhere from $200 to $400 million annually going forward on the development assuming we find can the right deals.
Alex Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is of course Houston. Oil has taken another leg down. Clearly - well it seems that the initial oil decline didn't translate to massive job loss that was some concern over Houston apartments. Now with the latest job loss the headlines talk about more job cuts and it seems like more are coming to the office rather than out in the field. So can you just give us what are you hearing from your oil neighbors and what's being going on recently with this oil defined and the lay-off announcements?
Ric Campo: Sure. You definitely have seen some announcements, especially from some of the big integrated oils and so we are not sure what to expect there. There have been some big numbers but when I talk to the people that are actually running these companies here locally, they tell me that they are definitely tightening their belts. But they are not doing any massive type of scenarios because the challenge they have is that they have, in terms of being able to replace those employees in the future, they have some real issues with that and so they are trying to hold on to all their talented tech people and geologists and those kinds and then there is more support people that are probably being let go that weren't otherwise. So we have not felt that and even though they talk about it, it's still a really big employment market here and so we really haven't seen much of that. I will tell you that, that in some of the conversations with some of the big oil, for example there is a 50 storey building that’s been planned to house one of big oil companies downtown and already have two 50 storey buildings. And what they were telling me in their office, I’m going to name them, but [indiscernible], they have an office in California where they are headquartered and they said that the downturn is actually supporting their thesis to their management that they need to go to a lower cost market, including Houston and so that building, given construction cost is falling is likely to be started and those people move here in the next couple of years. So…
Keith Oden: So, I’ll just add, Alex I think we are going to continue to see net job losses in the oil industry in Houston. But I think June was kind of interesting because we got 4,000 net new jobs which got us to basically flat for the year, but within that 4,000 net new jobs there were 6,000 created, total jobs created and about 2,000 lost, in oil-related jobs. So the net of 4,000 is not that bad a number if we can continue to see that. And there is a lot of information about - from the Great Eastern Partnership that indicates that even in recession Houston has historically created jobs, backend loaded jobs between September and December. So we just need to see whether that pans out again this year and if it does then I think that bodes pretty well for 2016, the count what would be looking at for 2016. But yeah, I think clearly those jobs losses in the oil patch are going to continue, the question is how much and then how much is the offset from all other sectors of the economy which continue to grow.
Ric Campo: The other thing, I didn’t mentioned was the downstream operations, because when you have the big oil with oil prices down and natural gas prices still very low as well there is still a big boom going on from a construction perspective around the Gulf Coast and on the east side of Houston for all our petrochemical factories and what have you. As long as the U.S. economy continues to do well and manufacturing continues to do well, those basic products have to be made and there is something like 30 billion under construction and a $50 billion backlog of new primary chemical activities and plans going on in the Gulf Coast. So that part of the equation should add jobs on the construction side and on the product manufacturing side of the equation that hopefully offsets some of the layoffs in the G&A side of the Energy business.
Alex Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. Just one more on Houston. I mean wouldn’t it be expected that this wouldn’t be the year that you would see any meaningful impact to your performance in Houston, that it would be a second or third year impact? I mean if somebody who’s lost my job the last thing I am going to do is double down and leave my apartment. I probably want to give that some time and then reconsider a year later or something like that. So wouldn’t this - isn’t the real litmus test here going to be 2016?
Ric Campo: I think that clearly the 2016 - the jury’s out on 2016, there is still 20,000 apartments that’s going to deliver in 2016 and the question will be whether there is enough jobs to support that. Keith mentioned a couple of things being the pent-up demand that we’ve had because of the job growth that we had prior to this downturn. And the other thing - what he didn’t mention though was the inversion that’s happening here, which is the people moving from the suburbs into the urban core and a lot of the development is in the urban core. And it’s still - the traffic is not really great here and people continue to do that. Anecdotally just to give you a sense some of the high rise for example that’s been developed in Houston today, which high rise product, you really didn’t have a lot of high rise product in Houston, maybe five or six buildings max from a rental perspective. Now we have something like 10 that are in lease-up and what’s happening is there is a whole new product that has opened up in to Houston. And its high-end urban, high rise and so one of the lease-ups that’s going on right now with one of our competitors for example. We went through the data on that, and the average income for this project - and by the way this is $3 a square foot, average units of 1,500 square feet, so at a $3,000 average, or actually more than, $4,500 average apartment rent and they are giving zero concessions in Houston today, zero now, not some, but zero, the project’s 80% leased, it’s the 30 storey building in the Galleria, the average age of the person leasing this property is 55 years old, and their average income is $385,000 a year. Now those folks are not energy accountants getting laid off. Those folks are people making the decision they want to move in from their house in the suburbs and live in the urban core. And so there’s a fair amount of that going on as well, but I mean at the end of the day 2016 will be determined based on what the overall economy does for Houston. Do we have more pent-up demand, do we have some of this inversion going on that’s actually helping the market more than we thought, and you’re right on the issue of people hunkered down. When people have a tough situation and they are laid off and they have the funds to stay in their apartment, they do tend to hunker down. So your turnover rates go down, which means that we don’t have to lease as many apartments, because our people are staying longer in those apartments and so it will definitely depend on what happens job wise in 2016, and then how the supply plays out. At least we know that the supply is going to play out in ‘17 and ‘18 because it’s really hard to get a new deal financed in Houston today.
Richard Anderson: Great color, thanks and then a bigger picture. How do you get to the top end of your FFO guidance range, seems like something very special would have to have to happen in the third and fourth quarter, more like the fourth quarter?
Alexander Jessett: Yeah, obviously I think a lot of it comes down to whether we end up being at the very high end of our NOI range. If we are at the very high end of our NOI range that will get us most of the way there and then obviously there’s also timing on acquisitions and dispositions can have an impact too.
Richard Anderson: So no, nothing one-timish land gains, anything like that in fourth quarter that gets you to the top end?
Alexander Jessett: No.
Richard Anderson: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Weissman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Ian Weissman: Yes, good morning. Just a question on the balance sheet. You paid off your $250 million June maturity with your credit facility and I just want to get your thoughts on long term financing with the rates coming down here. How are you guys thinking about just continuing to use the balance sheet or going a little bit longer out on the lending curve?
Alexander Jessett: Although treasuries have been moving around quite a bit and I think the tenure is at 2020 today and if you assume that we can borrow, say a 160 on top of that, I think 3.8% for ten year money is a great rate and we’ll do that all day long. We obviously do look at longer, we looked at 30s before, we’re not quite sure whether that’s something we want to do quite yet, but certainly we think in this type of interest rate environment it’s still very attractive to go along when you can.
Ric Campo: We are old school real estate people that match long term assets with long term liabilities. We hate short term debt, floating rate debt. We have a certain amount that we’ll keep but bottom line is that real estate, if you look at the real estate frame racks [ph] over the history of time it’s all about financing, short or long term assets and then all of a sudden you have a hiccup in the capital markets and somebody needs to fund and they can’t fund. That’s why we are trying to take our maturities out. I think if you look at our maturities we have one of the longest maturities in the apartment sector and it’s not long enough for us. But it’s the longest. And then the other thing is that when you think about financial flexibility long term, as Alex said at the beginning of the call we have 80% of our assets that are unencumbered, meaning that they have no mortgages on them. So we do have a financial hiccup like we had, maybe you don’t call ‘08 ‘09 as a hiccup, maybe it’s a retching, then we have the ability to put mortgages on those assets. So we’re old school long term fixed rate kind of shop here.
Ian Weissman: I appreciate that color. And just lastly, just want to get your thoughts on where you see margins moving overtime. I mean do you think Camden is able to maintain the same store revenue growth in the mid to high 4s and also on the expense side, it’s been running high over the last several quarters, is there much more tax assessment catch up left that would cause you to kind of keep expense growth in the 4% to 5% range?
Alexander Jessett: Yeah, so long term same store revenue growth, 4% if you look backwards for the last 20 years it’s been in the 3% range, high 2s, low 3s and I think that’s probably more appropriate thought process for what the next ten years look like. Obviously the last four years have been quite an anomaly relative to that long term trend. On the expense side the challenge that we've had has been exclusively contained in property taxes. So [indiscernible] that we thought that there would be some relief this year, obviously there wasn't particularly in the Texas markets. So that's going to be something that we're going to continue to probably have to deal with. We've been very effective over the years in terms of being aggressive on property tax increases. We're continuing that trend this year. It looks like we're going to have a ton of lawsuits on our Texas valuations that we're going to have to work our way through, but that's just part of the process and we know that that's something we're going to have to deal with. The interesting thing is about property taxes that we spent a lot of fair amount of time studying this, because it’s obviously it’s been a big issue in our same store expense numbers for the last two years. If you go back for - and do an analysis over 20 years in our portfolio, the average annual increase in property tax expense over that 20 year time frame has been 2.1% which is actually less than all other non-property tax components of our expenses combined. So it’s even though right now it’s very painful and it’s very painful to our same stores results and certainly to all of our operations folks that are getting hammered with these property tax numbers, the reality is that it is - over a long period and time it’s actually been pretty manageable. We think our property taxes they are one of the only two expense line items in our - a lot of our expenses that ever go down. So we're - it’s something that we do spend a time on. Over the long period and time we think it’s manageable but obviously it’s painful right now.
Ian Weissman: Just last question, I appreciate the color. Not to beat the horse, the dead horse I should say, on Houston but can you just give us an update on where renewals are trending in the third quarter in Houston?
Ric Campo: Yes. So the horse is not dead. He’s galloping and he has had a heck of a run for the last four years, at a 100 degrees, he’s sweating pretty bad today too. So we said our renewals are going our right now at an average of roughly 8%. In Houston they are going out at about - that's portfolio-wide, in Houston they are going out at about 4% and we think we'll get them signed, most of them in the 3.5% to 3.75% quarter range. So that's consistent with what we think we will end up for the year. I think in my prepared remarks, I said I thought we will end up revenue growth for Houston of about 3.5% for the full year and we are still pretty comfortable with that. So we just keep chopping away at it and the horse keeps running.
Ian Weissman: I appreciate that. Thank you so much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Yulico: Thanks, Ric or Keith, I was hoping you just talk a little bit about supply and where you see deliveries. If you think that they are sort of peaking in your market this year or and 2016 might be an easier number?
Keith Oden: Yeah. So if you - in Camden’s entire portfolio, if you're looking at completions for 2015 our current working guestimate looks like it’s about a 133,000 over the entire - all of Camden’s markets combined. And that number looks relatively flat to 2016. Obviously there is a lot of movement around in that number. Houston in particular is, as Ric mentioned I think we are at, probably 21,000 guestimated deliveries this year although that may - some of that may slip into 2016. And if that trend continuous then some of the ‘16 is going to slip in to ‘17 but based on current thinking we're likely to get in this crop of 2015 class of apartments somewhere around 21,000 and that number comes down but not very much in 2016 to about 20,000. So we've working on the supply side. We're still going to have a fair amount of supply to work our way through in the next two years in Houston.
Ric Campo: I think nationally one other thing, question we get a lot of is why if the permitting business is so good and, which it is obviously based on all the numbers that all of our competitors and public companies report out there, why wouldn't starts go from 300,000 to 500,000. And I think a lot of investors are worried about that, right because there is lot of capital trying to invest in multi-family. I think one of the governors that - there are actually two big governors on the system that I think today. One is it is harder to make your numbers work and from our land cost and construction cost and there's a limit of skilled labor. So everyone in the business is spending - staying up at night, thinking about can I get my project built and for how much. And then the next big thesis that the financial crisis, when happened it really did change the multi-family finance, as it relates to merchant builders, which merchant builders create 85% in the entire market for new development. And the merchant builder, prior to 2008 was able to guarantee debt from banks and the guarantees basically were infinite guarantees. There was no tangible capital behind their guarantees. Today however, merchant builders have to have tangible capital, they have that have real cash or real liquid securities on their balance sheets to guarantee certain amounts of debt. Now that has been it's been flexed now and there are today, because the markets so good, they're requiring less than they did two years ago. But the fact is they're requiring tangible net worth which actual cash, not just real estate value in order to guarantee debt. So you have a natural governor on the amount of deals that can be done because we just don't have that amount of construction workers nationwide to do it. And second, the financial, there is financial discipline in the banking system so far. Now do they get out of control in the future, who knows. I think it's going to be tough for that happen for a while anyway.
Keith Oden: And just one more thought on that and because I thought - I think it’s kind of interesting, and I'll give attribution to Ron Whitten [ph], he did some interesting work on that. There is a lot of conversation about the June starts number which looked like it spiked to on an annualized rate of about 450,000 of multi-family starts. But when you dig into that there was a tax incentive in New York that was expiring, or it did expire at the end of June. And there were roughly 8,000 starts, close starts in the month of June. If your annualize that it's about 100,000. If you back that out you're back to about a 340,000 annual run rate on starts which looks pretty rational with where demand is.
Nicholas Yulico: Right, now, that is helpful. Just one other question, looks like - I mean is your development pipeline going to be coming down, if I just look at the pipeline of communities versus what underway right now. And are you starting sort of less incrementally now?
Keith Oden: Yes, we are. We have a $1.1 billion under construction and we're going - when we finished we will start, but we will start less than we're finishing over a period of time. And we think it's prudent in this part of the cycle to do that.
Nicholas Yulico: So not only is it part - I mean is it not only that you think it's prudent, it's also just that you don't have as much land that you could really keep the pipeline this high?
Keith Oden: Absolutely. We went through our legacy land that we kept during the down cycle and we're pretty much out of our legacy land in '16. And so we have to add new land to it and the new land is just harder to add. And also we just think given where we are in the economic cycle and funding issues and we just we think it's prudent to sort of bring it down little bit.
Ric Campo: So just to put some big numbers around that concept. We get - in 2016, we'll have roughly $750 million that rolls out of our development pipeline into stabilized. And our guidance for this year is $300 million in starts and we tell people that that's kind what it’ll look like on a run rate going forward. So the math is pretty easy from there, the development pipeline’s coming down.
Nicholas Yulico: All right thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Can you talk about what the sort of monthly trends have been in the DC market? Have you seen more stability, more traction as we’ve gone from May to June to July or has it sort of been back and forth, back and forth.
Ric Campo: Well the big change for us Rob was the change in occupancy. We had a pickup in occupancy for the quarter. We had a negative revenue quarter-over-quarter per unit in the first quarter for the first time in this entire cycle. And most of our competitors have had numerous negative revenue per units. And it one tenth to 1% negative. But we were - we're pleased to see that jump backup. And I think that obviously a chunk of that was occupancy. I would say that scrapping along the bottom still feels about right. I mean our budget for - our game plan for DC this year was revenue growth of somewhere around 1% maybe slightly better than that. And I think that's what we're on track to see. So it's hard to see that as being a real positive scenario and that' why we've rated that market as C and stable. I think that's kind of what we're looking at through the balance of this year. I think if you look at on 2016 you get roughly on Whitman’s numbers you get 40,000 jobs and we get about 8,000 new apartments and that again sounds a lot like equilibrium to me on five to one ratio. But I think things are improving. I think the worst is probably over for most operators in the DC market. Our geography is a fair bit different than many of our competitors and I think that worst is probably over. But we are sort of scraping along the bottom in DC.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, and then can you talk about the Atlanta market? I mean this has been multiple quarters in a row that this has been very, very strong from a rental rate growth. You were seeing somewhere probably between 2% and 2.5% new supply still being injected there. Is it just job growth has come in, in and above everybody's expectation that’s been driving this or has it been some other phenomena where people have been moving more towards the core, like Rick was saying in Houston. You talked what about the phenomenon is that's been driving the Atlanta results.
Keith Oden: So we are on the 2015 forecast for jobs is still 75,000 in Atlanta multi-family completions. Looks like they are going to be roughly 10,000 apartments and that's very, very healthy. If we think about Atlanta it was a little bit late to the cycle. So we did not - and that's why you get 10,000 completions in Atlanta versus some of the other markets that are delivering more units. So from the standpoint of new supply it's been delayed relative to some of the markets. But in terms of rent growth, in a market like Atlanta where you are growing that kind of jobs and you are a little bit out of balance on supply, I don't think it would be unusual to see Atlanta have another great year in 2016. If you just kind of look at the Houston experience, going back to 2011-’12-’13 and ‘14 we had - Houston was our top performing market for four years straight. So when the conditions are right and you don't have - and the supply doesn't kind of overwhelm the job growth then you can have a pretty good run and I think that's where we are in Atlanta. Yeah, the market just seems very strong and no let-up in sight.
Rob Stevenson: And I don't know where you guys are with your sort of supply numbers. But some of the data providers are actually showing less supply in '16 and '15. I mean if that's the case, I mean is there anything that really interrupts you guys being able to post sort of 8%-9% rental rate growth in that market for the foreseeable future?
Keith Oden: If the job forecast is correct that we have which shows another 70,000 jobs and roughly another 9,000 apartments is correct, then yeah you are going to have another year in '16 that looks a lot like this year.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babine of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Given that most of the new supply that been delivered over the last couple of years has been ubiquitously urban, high rise CBD type development. So are there any markets where you are seeing your suburban assets significantly outperform urban? Just among your markets are there any kind of worth bringing [ph] in that apartment and what is sort of keeping new supply from springing up in the suburbs relative to city?
Ric Campo: The best example of that would be in Houston. I mean right now our suburban assets are clearly much less affected by - they are not catching near the competition that some of our close-in assets are catching. There is construction going on the suburbs. It's in market that we operate in, we built suburban assets in Orlando and in Tampa and they have done incredibly well. So there is construction going on. It's just not to the same scale as you want you see in some in the urban core markets. The flip side of that is that there right now, the natural demand seems to be where the job growth is happening in these cities is closer to the urban core and that's where people want to live. So I mean there is - it's not completely irrational that developers have trended back towards the urban core. You’ve got tons of issues with mobility and these large employment growth markets like Houston, Atlanta, Phoenix et cetera. People want to live closer to where they work, they want to live closer to where their social life is and by and large that’s the urban core. So it's not completely irrational. It's probably going to be, when it's all said and done, there will probably be the more competition and more pressure in the Houstons of the world in the close-in assets than in the suburban assets.
Drew Babin: Thank you. That's helpful.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Most of my questions been answered here. But just curious, I know you're not necessarily looking to enter new markets or/and the pipeline is coming down. But I was just curious, if there are any markets that even if you're not necessarily getting ready to jump in, that seem to be still offering good yields and also maybe have an improving longer term outlook from your perspective.
Ric Campo: We like the markets we're in. We always are looking at other markets and trying to decide whether it make sense to enter those markets. And the challenge is most of those markets are very highly priced and the development aspects are really high priced too. So you try to get some sort of - we want to have a scale - we just want to - you don't want to go do one-offs in markets you're not in. And so it's just - we keep our eye out and we think about it a lot and we debated a lot. We haven't gone there yet and we'll see what happens in the future.
Vincent Chao: Got it. And on the starts coming down, I was just curious with land cost and construction cost are both going up and shortages of labor, I mean do you think the yields are going to continue to kind of - it doesn't sound like they have compressed necessarily near term. But I mean over the next couple of years, do you expect them to compress or do you think rental rate growth will keep up with the construction inflation?
Ric Campo: I think development yields have been compressing and they will continue to compress. And the challenge you have is that as they compress then the justification that developers use is that well yeah but if you do have five trended transactions in California you can sell it for a 3.5. And because in California, for example in the LA every deal where you look at as a three something cap rate that's on an acquisition. So the challenge with that is that as cap rates compress, they and development yields compress, the risks associated with rising cap rates or what have you is just higher. And then the risk of actually delivering the five trended with construction cost and labor shortages is higher risk then it was. So that's why our development pipeline is shrinking as it's much more difficult and higher risk to deliver those kind of yields today. So yields have definitely compressed from when the cycles began. And now they're getting - and I think they will compress in the future. And the question will be, will developers take the risk of lower spreads and lower risk return relationships because they have the capital and I think a lot of institutional investors are building the core now. And a lot of capital continues to come into the sector. We on the other hand don't have the need to or the stomach to take the risk on those kinds of low spreads. And so that's where discipline comes in and one of the - I can tell you our development teams don't like to hear this. But that's what you got to do in when the market is heated as it is in our business.
Vincent Chao: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Bragg of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Dave Bragg: Hi, good morning. We're pleased to hear that your big [indiscernible] ends too. So it is to get them for the Super Bowl half time show Rick.
Ric Campo: Dave, you've added yourself.
Dave Bragg: Okay, we're proud fans. Anyway, on the Internet rollout, is that uniform across the country or there are some markets that are benefitting disproportionately relative to the 45 basis points of revenue growth upside seen this quarter?
Alexander Jessett: Yeah, it's across the whole platform. And it really is dependent on where the contracts, who the provider is, whether it's Comcast or whether it's Time Warner. So as we get the contracts in place and get them renegotiated then that's where the rollout occurs. Now there is also a just a physical limit on how many of these things you can roll out at one time based on personnel constraints and people constraints. But yeah it's pretty uniform across the portfolio and it's - but ultimately we think we will have coverage of somewhere upwards of 85% to 90% of the communities that will have an Internet high speed Internet solution bundled with cable.
Dave Bragg: Okay, so as we think about your numbers relative to peers, we can be confident that there is no markets where you're getting a 75 to 100 basis point boost right now.
Alexander Jessett: No.
Dave Bragg: Okay.
Alexander Jessett: No, you bet.
Dave Bragg: The next question is can you just provide your latest thinking on dispositions?
Ric Campo: Sure, dispositions, we have sold about 1.8 billion of assets in the last four years and we continue to think that it makes a lot of sense to sell assets into this market given the robust bid. On the other hand we’ve pretty much dealt with our low hanging fruit and so in terms of being able to recycle that capital. The challenge we have today - we have a couple of challenges in that given that all those asset sales that we’ve done in the past, we have some tax considerations and tax constraints on how we sell and what we sell. But it’s still a decent environment to sell in and we’ll be selling assets.
Keith Oden: And Dave, the other thing that we talk about with folks is that we really want to match our dispositions with acquisitions. Obviously we can always - at least from disposition perspective you can control and you can sell assets whenever you want to. The flip side of that, which is matching it with acquisitions, is something that we have really struggled with in terms of the pricing of these assets and where the cap rates are. Let me just give you the latest example on - I know there lots of anecdotal evidence floating around, but I want to give - I’ll give you one from the last two weeks without naming names, we were in the - got in the best and filed for an asset in downtown Denver. It’s great location but it’s ten year old product and kind of little bit tired and had some little bit of a floor plan challenges so it was not a pristine physical asset but it’s a great location. Having said that we thought we could go in kind of do our renovation, our rehab program, do all of our ancillary programs and we really, really pushed hard from an underwriting standpoint, got in the best in file, we were given guidance that - thought the asset would trade in the $83 million range. So we decided to go nuts from our perspective and raised our bid even though we were given guidance of 83 million we raised our bid to 83.75 million and we finished dead last of the four companies that bid. So it ended up - the asset ended up going - it contracted at about $85 plus million, almost $2 million above what we’ve thought was kind of a crazy high number. And on our numbers it was a trail - a 3.6% cap rate on trailing 12 months on real live underwriting. So that’s the challenge that we have from the standpoint, Ric talked about being disciplined. We’re just going to be disciplined on acquisitions and we’re going to pick our spots but when you’re trying to match developments - dispositions with acquisitions I mean that’s just the world that we’re in today.
Dave Bragg: Last quarter you - when I asked about share buybacks you explained that you needed time, you needed time to sell assets and then observe where the stock is trading. The stock’s been very volatile since October. So the reason we asked is just to understand why not to sell some assets now and create that opportunity for yourself should it present itself in the stock rather than stabilize assets?
Alexander Jessett: Well I think it gets to the same - to the issue, you just hit which is the volatility right. So that’s an interesting scenario. It’s the challenge we have with that is just on the side of is there an opportunity to buy the stock, and we talked about it being persistent, the challenges because of the volatility and because of blackout periods makes it difficult, in terms of selling assets and putting cash on the balance sheet and having tax considerations associated with that, that’s what makes it more difficult.
Ric Campo: And David just to be clear on the share buybacks we don’t have a philosophical high bound mindset against share buybacks. In fact over the last - as a public company we bought back almost $500 million of our shares in the open market. And we bought those shares at an average discount to NAV of about 20%. So it’s not that we’re philosophically opposed to it. It’s just that sometimes when we talk about persistency and then gap to - closing the gap to NAV and given the volatility that we’ve had in our stock in the last nine months it would have been a real challenge to put all those - that Rubik cube together to make it make sense to buy the stock. The other thing that goes in from a consideration standpoint is obviously we have a development pipeline that where you have assets that are under construction that needs to be funded and there has to be a source of funding for that. So it’s just - it’s balancing all those things but it’s not - certainly not something that we’re philosophically opposed to, and we've done a ton of it.
Dave Bragg: Okay, thank you.
Ric Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from of Dan Oppenheim of Zelman Associates. Please go head.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. I was wondering if - do you see - there was one other question there, so do you see occupancy now 40 basis points above the company average after the 170 basis points sequential increase in second quarter, but you still seem somewhat cautious, I understand the cautious in the environment overall. But how's that impacting what you're doing in terms of renewals in the market, given where you are on occupancy now?
Ric Campo: So we're not - we are back to an occupancy level that we're comfortable with. But when you look at many of our competitors in the comp set that we deal with, they are struggling day in and day out just to get to the 94%, 94.5% level and that gets reflected in their pricing and we don't operate in a vacuum. And so their challenges become our challenges. I think that our guidance for the year that we think we'll end up with revenue growth of 1% or slightly better than that, it just reflects the fact that you don't have a lot of pricing power. Now obviously you can get more aggressive on - less aggressive on renewals, close the back door, get some occupancy, which is clearly what we needed to do. You can't even think about pushing prices when you're not above 95% occupied. So job one is get the occupancy back, make sure that you have stability in your rent role and then you can start testing increases which is what we are doing right now? But I still don’t think anyone should expect that by the time it’s all said and done for 2015 that we're going to be far away from 1% growth.
Dan Oppenheim: Okay. Then in terms of turnover, you talked about down 400 basis points year-over-year and pushing rent significantly in some market. How do you think about that in terms of any risks, in term of affordability driven turnover with some of the rental rate increases?
Ric Campo: Yeah. So our portfolio for this quarter, the average, the percentage of our household income that went to pay rent was 17.2% and it’s been in the 17% range for the last six quarters. Historically that's a very low place for us. I think we only have market of all of our 15 markets where it’s about 20%, its 21% in Southern California. Most were in the 14%, 15%, 16% and a few in the 18%. There is absolutely no question from an affordability standpoint, our residents, their financial health is better than it’s been in the last five years. They have the ability to pay higher rents and we want to give them that opportunity.
Dan Oppenheim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick from of Capital One. Please go ahead.
Tom Lesnick: Hey guys, good afternoon. My first question, I just wanted to get clarification on your comments earlier about merchant builders, obviously hugely contingent on financing from banks. I am just trying to get sense of your 85% comment was that nationally or was that with respect to Houston specifically. I am just trying to get a sense for how much of the supply in ‘15 and ‘16 could potentially be turned off or held or delayed?
Keith Oden: It's nationally. So merchant builders as defined by the [indiscernible] of the world, the Hanovers of the world, those folks are by - are build and sell builders and 85% of - and this data comes from National Multi-Housing Council. They do analysis of who is building and what structure they are building under. So the REITs are building and these very a little bit annually but the REITs generally around 15% of the market nationally and the merchant builders are 85% of the market.
Tom Lesnick: And with respect to Houston specifically?
Keith Oden: Houston specifically it’s about the same, actually it’s probably less. And Houston specifically because there only one REIT that I know of that’s building anything and it might be Camden and we're building one project out of - so we have a 300 unit component of the market and the rest are being built by merchant builders. So obviously I would say it’s a 100% in Houston and the under construction we have is 300 units out of 20,000 units that are being delivered may be in 2016.
Tom Lesnick: Got it. And then my second question, obviously a huge factor in urbanization trends over the last several years has been lower crime rates in cities leading to development in emerging sub-markets and there has been reports over the last of couple of months or so an uptick in crime in NoMa obviously your existing asset is doing well and NoMa II has just announced in development last quarter. But couple of your competitors recently announced new projects in NoMa. I'm just trying to gauge how you guys are thinking about demand risk to emerging sub-markets like NoMa.
Ric Campo: So when we went into NoMa to start with, it was a very, very transitioning neighborhood and the local government really wanted to change the nature of NoMa. They put in a bunch of financial incentives for developers to build, office developers, multi-family developers, they got MPR to move there, they committed to the management teams they were - and investors who were investing those monies that they would improve the quality of life, they would improve policing and all those things, and they actually have done a great job. And NoMa has really turned into an incredible success story of a district that was a very transitionary and difficult neighborhood. I think with the additional investments that people are making including Camden and the additional office tenants that have come there, it's going to be a great, great long term neighborhood. Now do urban neighborhoods have issues? Sure, you have homelessness, you have crime and things like that. But the more people you get down here and the more new people that come in and the more people that are being served in those areas the better it gets. So I don't think that we have any risk in NoMa or any other emerging market. I could give you 10 emerging markets like that ARTS District in downtown LA as an example that are all getting better and not worse and I think that municipalities really want this inversion to happen because when inversion happens it solves a lot of other social issues and that get to mobility and just being able to concentrate people in locations. So it's a really a huge benefit for cities long term. So I don't see it turning back.
Tom Lesnick: All right, great. Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I know we are running a little long here. So I'll keep it tight. I was just curious your four market saw some strong acceleration this quarter and just curious about your thoughts about the acceleration and then what your outlook is for these markets?
Ric Campo: Our top four markets?
Austin Wurschmidt: No, I'm sorry. For the Florida markets.
Ric Campo: Florida, I'm sorry. Florida markets they had acceleration. Go ahead, Keith
Keith Oden: Yeah, they did and they are - combination of pretty decent job growth in all three markets and very low. I mean there is some stuff that's in the planning process right now. But both Tampa and Orlando have been very late to the supply party and that’s served us well. So I think we got good runway in Florida markets throughout 2016.
Austin Wurschmidt: And what kind of supply are you expecting next year?
Keith Oden: For 2016, in Tampa looks like completions are going to be 5,000 apartments which is very manageable for that sub market and in Orlando looks like 4,400 apartments. Again those are very historically low markets for this point in the recovery cycle for those two markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks for the detail.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: Great, we appreciate your time on the call today and we hope that you have a great rest of the all summer and it's a nice all summer long for you. Thank you very much. Take care.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be on a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instruction] Please also note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2015 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. As you probably know, another multifamily company is hosting their call at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, So we will try to be brief in our prepared remarks and complete the call within 1 hour. We ask that you limit your questions to two then rejoining the queue if you have other items to discuss. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard Campo: Thanks, Kim. One of the things that I was looking for in 2015 was a decrease in the amount of time that I spend talking about the oil business. But just like Bono I still haven’t found what I’m looking for.  During the quarter we continued our capital recycling program. We sold two older properties and started construction on Camden NoMa II in Washington D.C. We will continue to recycle capital taking advantage of the robust demand and attractive pricing for our properties. Capital recycling improves our portfolio competitiveness, the quality and the average age. We’ve increased the average revenue per month from $1,040 per apartment four years ago to $1,440 apartment today.  Our development program continues to add value to our cash flow and to our net asset value. Camden’s geographic diversification continues to drive our strong revenue performance for the quarter and for the past four years. We favor markets with pro business governments, strong job growth, strong population growth and with an educated and young work force.  We are currently seeing a market rotation in our portfolio in 2015 with Huston slowing due ot the oil and gas economy. I didn’t think I was going to talk about oil and gas but I probably will on this call; and increasing supply here in Huston. While markets like Phoenix, Atlanta and Sothern California are accelerating other markets are sort of holding their own as well. So, at this point I really want to give a shot out to our team Camden for such a strong start for the year. I really appreciate everything they do, everyday, taking care of our customers and taking care of their Camden customers.  At this point I’ll turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. We are off to a really good start for 2015 with the same store revenue growth of 4.6% for the first quarter which is virtually on top of last year’s first quarter revenue growth of 4.7%. And from a historical perspective 4.6% revenue growth is really strong. As we review their quarterly results with our operating team last week. All indication are that 2015 will be another very good year for Camden, for the first quarter same store average rents on new leases were up 1.3% and renewals were 6.3% and that compares to 1.8% on new leases and 6.7% on renewals last year. For April new leases were up 4% and renewals were up 6.5% and that compares favorably to 2.8% and 6.6% at this time last year. Based on this early strength we point our guidance up by 25 basis points for the full year. May and June renewal offers have been sent out at roughly 7.5% increases.  Channel of our markets head year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5% or higher which interestingly is exactly the same number as in the first quarter of 2014. Our top five markets for quarterly revenue growth were Atlanta at 8.9%, Denver at 8.7%, Austin 6.7%, Dallas 6.2% and Phoenix at 6.1%. Although Huston fell out of the top five, the growth for the quarter was still at respectable 3.9%. With the exception of Washington DC metro and Corpus Christi, all other Camden markets saw sequential revenue growth. Overall our same store portfolio averaged 95.5% occupancy for the first quarter, the same as last year and down just 1/10th of a percent from the fourth quarter. Occupancy in April averaged 95.9% and we currently stand at 96% occupied portfolio wide. Our budget contemplated rising occupancy rights into the second and third quarters. So the occupancy related revenue gains will likely moderate in future quarters.  Qualified traffic was strong across all of our markets and despite our aggressive renewal rate increases, our occupancy rates remained above planned. In part this reflects the second lowest net turnover rate we’ve ever reported at 43% versus 48% for the first quarter of 2014. Our residence financial health remains strong and our current average rent as a percentage of household income stands at 17.1% versus 17.2% for the same period last year. 13.2% of our residents move out to purchase homes in the quarter and that compares to 13.7% in the first quarter of 2014 and 14.2% for the full year. All of the home purchase numbers remain well below our long-term average of 18% of move outs to purchase homes. The home ownership rates reportedly fail again in the first quarter of this year to 63.7%, down from the peak of roughly 69%. Finally, since our last conference call, we learned that we’re once again included in Fortune magazine’s List of 100 Places to Work. In fact we moved back into the top 10. Eight straight years on the list, 5 times in the top 10, which is a rarity. In all the years fortune has compiled the list, only 10 companies have ever made it into the top 10, five or more times. We claim this on behalf of all our brotherhood in REIT land and we give credit to our Camden team which has allowed us to achieve our vision of creating a great work place. I’ll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Before I move on to our financial results, a brief update on our first quarter transactional activities. During the quarter we sold two communities with an average age of 24 years for a total of $114 million, delivering to our shareholders an unleveraged internal rate of return of 10.8% over a 19 year hold period. These communities were sold at an average FFO yield of 6.4% and an average AFFO yield of 5.2% based on trailing 12 month NOI. The difference between the FFO yield and the AFFO yield is $1,300 per door in actual CapEx. During the quarter completed construction at Camden La Frontera and Camden Lamar Heights, both in Auston, began leasing at Camden Chandler and Phoenix and Camden Southline in Charlotte and commenced construction at Camden NoMa Phase II in Washington DC. Also during the quarter we finalized our third fund agreement with Texas teachers. Camden will have a 20% ownership in this new fund which has a total investment capacity of approximately $450 million based upon 70% leverage. The mid-point of our current earnings guidance is not the same in any investments in this third fund in 2015.  Moving on to financial results. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2015 of $98.5 million or $1.08 per share. These results of $1.8 million or $0.02 per share better than the $0.06 midpoint of our product guidance range. This $0.02 per share positive variance primarily resulted from $1.1 million in better than expect operating performances from our communities and $500,000 in lower than expect corporate expenses. The $500,000 positive variance in corporate expenses is primarily driven by timing and lower employee compensation cost. The $1.1 million is better than expected performance from our communities is a result of the following. Property revenues from our same store communities exceeded our forecast by $1.3 million as both rental and fee income were favorable to plan. Our new Camden technology package with internet service which discussed last quarter is rolling out as scheduled and contributed approximately 30 basis points to our first quarter same store revenue growth in line with expectations. Property revenues from our consolidated non same store and developing communities exceeded our forecast by $500,000 as a result of better than expected occupancy at our student housing community and accelerated leasing at our developing communities. Our Camden Boca Raton development is now 95% leased and our Camden La Frontera development is 96% leased, both ahead of schedule.  The $1.8 million in better than anticipated property revenues from our consolidated communities was partially offset by $700,000 in higher than expected property tax expense which makes up approximately one third of our total operating cost. Certain property tax refunds we anticipated receiving in the first quarter will now be received in the second quarter. And late in the first quarter we will see larger than anticipated tax valuation increases for our Houston and Austin communities and adjusted our tax accruals accordingly. Property values continue to increase in all of our Texas markets and the tax assessors are taking notice. Our original operating budgets were based upon a 5.75% full year increase in property taxes which we now anticipate to be closer to 7%.  On page 14 of our supplemental package, we’ve provided a closer look at the components of our same store expense growth for the quarter. Excluding property taxes, the quarterly results from many of our expense line items included certain timing and nonrecurring events in current and prior quarters which were accounted for in our original budget. We expect each subsequent quarter's total expense growth to be in a 4% to 5% range. For full year 2015, we anticipate larger than usual expense increases for taxes and utilities. With the remaining expense categories averaging in an approximately 2.5% increase.  In line with expectations, our new Camden technology package with internet service contributed approximately 70 basis points to our total first quarter same store expense growth and approximately 340 basis points to our total utility increase. The combined revenue and expense component from this technology initiative added about 10 basis points to our total same store NOI growth for the quarter. Based upon our first quarter operating results, we’ve revised our 2015 same store guidance. We now anticipate full year 2015 same store revenue growth to be between 4% and 5%, expense growth to be between 4.7% and 5.25%, and NOI growth to be between 3.5% and 5%.  As compared to our prior guidance ranges, our revised revenue midpoint of 4.5% represents a 25 basis points improvement, our revised expense midpoint of 5% represents a 25 basis point increase and our revised NOI midpoint of 4.25% represents a 25 basis point improvement. The expense increase is entirely driven by higher property taxes. We’ve also revised our full year 2015 FFO per share outlook. We now anticipate 2015 FFO per share to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.56 versus our prior range of $4.36 to $4.56 representing a $0.02 per share increase to the prior midpoint primarily driven by our first quarter performance.  Last night we also provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2015. We expect FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.08 to $1.12; and midpoint of $1.10 represents a $0.02 increase from the first quarter 2015. This $0.02 per share increase is primarily the result of the following: A $0.04 per share increase in FFO due to growth in property net operating income as a result of an approximate 2% or $0.03 per share expected sequential increase in same-store NOI as revenue growth from the combination of higher rental and fee income as we move into our peak leasing periods combined with the receipt of prior year tax refunds more than offsets our expected increase in other property expenses due to normal seasonal summer increases in utility and repair and maintenance costs. And an approximate $0.01 per share increase from our non-same-store communities as the additional NOI contribution from our nine communities and lease-up will be partially offset by the lost NOI from our first quarter dispositions and lower occupancy at our student housing community in Corpus Christi, Texas. Occupancy declined significantly from May through August at this community. The growth in our property net operating income is being partially offset by a $0.02 per share decrease in FFO due to higher property supervision and general and administrative expenses resulting from delayed first quarter corporate overhead costs and the timing of our annual trust manager compensation cost. Finally, our capital position remains very strong. We finished the quarter with a $174 million of cash on hand, no amounts outstanding under our $500 million unsecured line of credit and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.3 times. At this time, we will open up the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.  And our first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Two questions on Houston actually. On the last call you mentioned that you thought job growth to be at 50,000 to 60,000 and that guidance for same-store revenue would be about 3.4%. Do you have updates to either of those or are you still tracking towards that?
Richard Campo: So the data provider that we rely most heavily on is Ron Whitten and he still got Houston job growth numbers at about 63,000 for the year. I would tell you that that his 63 is a soft 63 based on what he’s seeing right now preliminarily. He has not redone his forecast number, so it’s still, so his official forecast is still in the 63,000 range. As you know one of the challenges is that the bid ask spread on job growth in Houston for 2015 runs all the way from essentially 0 to the high end of the range which is still in the 60,000 range. So I think that’s the thing everybody is still trying to get their hands around. And we’ll just have to see as it plays out through the year.  Obviously the first quarter was weak not only in Houston, but weak all across the entire country in terms of job growth, so we’ll have to see how that pans out. We’ve not changed our forecast for the full year in terms of revenue growth for Houston. We’re still in the mid 3s. We still think that’s achievable, and the one thing that could make that slide if the 0 turns out to be the case and not something closer to the 50,000 to 60,000 jobs that we’d forecast last quarter then obviously that that will come into play in the third and fourth quarter this year. But at this point, we still think that 3.5 is the right number for the year.
Nick Joseph: And I know you mentioned the values are increasing in all your Texas markets. Can you talk about cap rates in the transaction market in Houston specifically?
Richard Campo: Sure, cap rates continue to be very-very sticky and low here in Houston. The thing that the real change or so, there’s been really no change in cap rates in Houston. What’s happened is instead of 15 aggressive to 20 aggressive bidders, now you have 8 to 10 which say you have fewer but still enough liquidity and enough activity on the bid side to keep prices very high. And Alex mentioned our fund, 450 million in acquisitions that we are trying to do for our fund, and we have been beat on a number of Houston transactions where we just couldn’t stomach the price and when you get down to 4.5 cap rate on a really high quality property in Houston, that’s happening every day here. I wouldn’t say that if you have had lower quality properties that don’t have a good rehab story or they’re just in core locations, you probably have lot less bid for that kind of property. But any kind of property that has quality like Camden's or anything in the B plus A category is still a voracious bid and a high price.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jana Galan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Jana Galan: I'm just hoping if you could provide an update on D.C, it's been -- 2014, you are holding up better than peers, but this quarter you were a little bit weaker?
Richard Campo: Yeah, we had a soar of revenue, perhaps this year -- for the quarter was down one-tenth of percent. Interestingly enough that’s the first negative revenue number that we’ve had in D.C. since the downturn. So our portfolio did hold up much better than many of our peers, whom, I think all of which reported in a couple of negative quarters that in last year. So we held up a little better than the peers, but yeah we did have a negative one-tenth. But really that was basically inline with our budget for the first quarter of 2015. And we still think that we’ll be positive on revenues by the end of 2015. It’s not going to be a big number, but we think it’s in the 1% to 2% range for the year and we still think that’s doable. So my update would be for D.C., it’s really as we expected it to be and we still expect to positive revenue contribution from D.C. for the full year.
Jana Galan: And then on your communities and lease-up, it has been successful and also it’s in high supply market. So I was just curious, if you’re seeing competitors not too much in terms of concessions or how you’re having so much success there?
Richard Campo: Sure. The new development is still very robust around the country. And when you think about concessions, it just depends on which market you’re in and it depends on the sub-market. Most merchant builders are very quick to pull the trigger on free rent. And the logic is you’ve got an empty building, so free rent is easy to give since all your units are not paying rent the day you open. So most people put in, including Camden at least a month free concession on your lease-ups. And so we have some markets for example that like in Boca, for example we lease-up Boca much faster than where thought. We gave very few concessions and in the early part of the cycle they’re really no concessions to be had. Today, they range anywhere from two weeks free or look and lease kind of thing to, in some markets a month free to six weeks free. It just depends on the sub-market. But it’s fairly typical and even with those kinds of concessions we’re leasing up at generally faster than we anticipated. But there are concessions in the market just because of the nature of having an empty building that you need to fill in up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: Just going back to new sales, hoping you could give a little bit more detail on where renewals and new leases or trending so far in the second quarter?
Richard Campo: Yes. So for April and Houston the new leases came in at about 1.7% up, the renewals came in at about 4%. So the weighted average or those two is just short of 3%. That trend is continued. It actually got a little better on the renewals that have been sent out. They have been sent out in the 4.5% to 5% range out into May and June. So slight improvement from the first quarter, but I mean keep in mind that when we gave our forecast for Houston in our guidance call, in last quarter, we graded Houston as a B market and declining. And so I think that the market is kind of rolling out exactly as we had anticipated in our guidance. So it’s stable, we’re continuing to push occupancy. We’ve got occupancy in Houston. The current occupancies is about 96%, which is higher than what we would normally see this time in a year. It tells me that if 96% occupied and still able to get 2% to 3% increases on new leases that we are not under a whole lot of stress from an operating standpoint. But it’s early in the year and we will just have to see how the rest of the year plays out.
Nick Yulico: And just one other follow up is do you have any visibility at on how the new graduate markets work and kids coming out of college, getting jobs in Huston. It seem that to be starting to work at apartments, any insight on whether any of these bigger energy firms are starting to tell their [indiscernible] don’t bother coming or any insight on that would be helpful. 
Richard Campo: Sure. The new graduates are not as robust as they were in terms of, say if you go back a year clearly because the big energy was hiring really big. I think what’s happening now is they are not pulling back offers or anything like that. And one of the most important news at least from my family was my daughter got graduated from University of Huston with a Masters in Geology in December, and actually got a job with an Oil Field Services company, you can imagine that. And so what’s happening in having the -- I have a lot of conversations with oil & gas people here and whether not, they are not hiring as many young graduates. What they are doing is they are completely not hiring. But what often happens -- and I had a conversation with one of my people at big integrated oil that I actually went to school with, and he is likely to get a retirement package and basically he told me was that they are going to give him a retirement package and then they'll hire two younger people and save the third of his total comp. And that generally is what happens in these kinds of situations as you end up with more younger and less older. And if you think about the economy and the jobs we create since the downturn, somewhere in the tune of the 60% of all the jobs have gone to people 30 to 40 years and younger. So I think that trend is probably going to happen here in energy as well or where you’ll see sort of older people getting packages and younger people getting hired. So I think it’s pretty good right now. I was at EU of age event this week and I didn’t hear anybody talking about people not getting jobs. So I think there is still a fairly robust economy around the petrochemical business, the medical business and the Port.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Ken [ph] of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Ken: If I can quote another YouTube song, that looks like you are running to stand still in taxes regarding the higher property taxes. So how did you comfortable that this won’t happen again in 2016?
Richard Campo: That’s really one of the challenges we have here for sure. And of course, our State legislature is in session and they meet every two years because they don’t want to meet every year because they might do something stupid. So they are actually talking about a $3 billion property tax cut in the State right now. The challenge you have with where we are on property taxes here is that during the downturn we pounded on the values big times and got them down pretty aggressively and now we are on the way up. I think that the good news is that we had substantial increases and the question will be can we fight those increases effectively. We generally have been very effective at that and one of the things I think that you have to remember on property taxes is that it’s not so much about, is of property tax evaluation exactly what the current market value is your property. And is there a fairness of test which means that if there are 4 properties in a line and your property happens to be assessed at a higher value as the one next to you. You can argue even though your value may not be as right at your net asset value of that property. You can argue for property tax reduction on a fairness basis. So with that said yes, we’re at risk about with property taxes in Texas. But on the other hand we’ve been a fairly good battler in that area and hopefully we’ll be able to do that again in ’16.
John Ken: Okay, thanks for the color. On your balance sheet you’ve been very consistent in using a very modest amount of floating rate deck compared to your peers. Is this something that you can contemplate increasing and in particular how do you fund the $250 million maturity this year?
Richard Campo: Yes, so obviously we do look at floating rate deck quite a bit. We think for us probably about 20% is the maximum amount that we would like to go up to. Obviously we are under that number right now. So we do think we’d have the capacity to take on some more float We do have a $250 million bond maturity in June of this year, but as I said earlier, we’ve got full capacity underneath our $500 million line of credit and we’re sitting on about $174 million worth of cash. So we’ve got a lot of options when it comes to how do we handle that maturity. On the flip side of that equation with interest rates as low as they are today, when you lock in a ten year unsecured bond at 3.25% or 3.5%, five years from now that might look really-really good. So that’s the sort of the push pull, right. You can really feast on the incredibly low rates. But on the other hand if you can lock up long term debt at pretty historical lows there’s some compelling arguments about that as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Alex Goldfarb: Just a few quick questions. First on Houston. As we watch the oil price bounce around, obviously had a low like close to 40 and now it’s up in the mid 50s. Can you just help us understand how all your friends in the oil business view that? I mean they see a lot more long term than finance firms in the operator business. But still it would seem like people are breathing a much better sigh of relief now that oil has rebounded up versus the lows that it was. But just curious if that’s changed any of the sort of talking the chatter among your executive peers?
Richard Campo: The interesting part of what’s going on is that a lot of people thought there’d be more sort of carnage in that space, right. You’d have more M&A, you’d have -- they actually in the Houston Chronicle publisher what they called a death list, and it’s the companies that are on the edge that levered up and we’re blowing and going and using short term debt, you know faster business and didn’t have positive cash flow. And so they made this list and one of the top companies on that list that and I think their stock price collapsed to about a $1 a share and their bonds were trading at $0.30 on the dollar. Well that company about a month ago got a $1.5 billion infusion on a secured basis to take out their challenges. And now they’re sitting raising their stock quadrupled went from like a $1 to $4 or something like that.  And so what’s happened here is that there’s massive amount of capital that has been accumulative and that’s sitting on the sidelines waiting for the big drop, almost like we were in 2009 and ’10. And then the big drop or the big value or the free lunch if you will never came for real-estate obviously and it may not come for oil and gas because there’s so much liquidity and people are getting deals done. So there’s not a lot of carnage there. And the people that have low debt and prepared for the cycle are very excited about having opportunities to deploy capital in a lower cost environment. And so on the one hand people talk about great things happening, being able to buy things, but on the other hand there’s not a lot for sale. We do have these two big mergers that are going on right now with Shell and the BG Group and you also have Halliburton and Becker Hughes.  And so there are going to be some divestitures around that and in the discussions that I’ve heard with some of those people that are close to it. They said they have buyers lined up to buy their assets and it’s going to be very robust pricing. Probably a lot less robust if it was a year ago when the price of oil was $100. So I think part of the issue is there's just a huge amount of liquidity and capital so there’s no capital shortage in that. Therefore you don’t have a lot of wounded companies out there rather just trying to -- others are really trying to make a deal.
Alex Goldfarb: And then the second question is on the property tax, you discussed Texas a bit, but broader when you think about Florida and some of the other heavy property tax states, how much of a mark do you think still exists in your portfolio between where as far as the big true-ups? Do you expect still a lot more or in your view most of the assessors have taken your properties to market?
Richard Campo: Obviously we evaluate that constantly. I think we have a very good team that contest all of these taxes on a regular basis certainly tax assessors has been getting more aggressive in some of these market but Florida and particularly we’ve done a very pretty good job of keeping them in check and it’s not a market that we look at and think there is a tremendous amount of risk.
Keith Oden: That’s like a hard question to really answer because the problem is that net asset value or the value of the property is interesting in a discussion but not what really drives the tax discussion, what drives it is the relative valuations of the properties in the market place you’re comparing yours with. So, most of the properties are probably substantially under their market value, the question is how much are you under the market value compared to your competitors gross history and that’s where you negotiate. 
Alex Goldfarb: I mean you’re not obviously giving 2016 guidance but if you’re raising the impact of real estate taxes this year, we saw the same thing with post where they’ve been hit with that successive years. Is this something you think is going to be an issue over the next few years or your view this one time pressure is more this year and otherwise it’s just normal property tax. 
Richard Campo: Since property tax is third of our operating cost, we are vigilant and we are focused on this every single day with our team in the field, assessors want to have values going up. The good news is we get hit sort of regionally, what has happened has right now in Texas is getting smacked and the couple of years ago Florida was and so, it’s always going to be something that we’re worried whether it’s above trend, next year it’s likely to be above its long term trend or three but we’ll be seven, we hope not but I’m not sure what the numbers will look like in ’16. The key is making sure that you constantly on and you have the best people focused on it and we have that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: So Ric, is there one care right now about West Texas being up 11% this year up 40% from the trough is that having any impact on business in Houston or people who have kind of letting that that off for the time being.
Richard Campo: It don’t have an impact because when you think about companies that have debt and their debt is tied to their value of their production and the value of the assets in the ground, it’s important to them because they have more value when they starting marking their assets to market and they compare to their debt. So, it is a big deal to have it up 10 or 11 bucks and I think the biggest issue that most people they all feel want, they just need less volatility. They want to make sure if they get $60 oil or $58 they can live with that as long as they believe that it’s not going to $30. 
Keith Oden: I think just to add to that the stack is probably more directly impacting and impactful, is not necessarily is the gyrations in the price of west Texas crude; it’s the drilling rate count. And so that is probably a more meaningful thing to watch in terms of directional impact on the overall economy and we’re down at 932 rigs which is about a half of what we were a year ago but the rate of decline in rig count has slowed pretty dramatically. I think the last decline was 20 rigs or so and at one point they were dropping 75 to 80 rigs on a weekly basis.  So, I think watching the rig count over the next quarter or two is probably more telling to what the prognoses or the oil patch in Taxes is going to be throughout 2015 and in 2016, assuming that oil stays approximately in some band around $45 to $60 a barrel the more interesting thing to watch is probably rig count.
Rich Anderson: Because of it’s forward looking in? 
Keith Oden: Well, it’s also because it directly impact it’s eployment and when the rig stops drilling those are great quarter in the wall street generally other day that basically said something about paraphrase that, the probability that you lose your job is directly related to the proximity of your job to an oil rig. So, I think there is a lot of truth in that. So, when you think about all the layoffs that have been announced today -- not all of them but substantially all of the layoffs that have been announced in oil field services companies and the majors have been in the oil patch and oil field workers and that those people are not in Houston now. Ultimately there is flow through you can’t have a 50% drop in active rigs and not have the derivative impact on Houston and where we are and finding out how big that’s going to be, I think that’s what’s causing the bid spread of zero jobs to 60,000.
Rich Anderson: The decline and rig also is driving force to pushing oil prices up?
Richard Campo: It is, but it’s less than you then what you might think because you’re talking about drilling rigs, dropping 50 overall week over week basis. That production does come on pretty quickly, but it’s in the scheme World Oil Supply, it’s a drop.
Keith Oden: The other challenge with supply dropping is at the frac wells both in Texas and in North Dakota. Once they drill and they deplete really fast, something like 45% to 50% in the first year, which means that they bring that oil out really fast. So you still have even though the rig count drops, you still have production ramping up, because you’re bringing that oil out really fast. I have heard anecdotally that people are now drilling wells, testing them out and then copying them waiting for lower oil prices rather than brining the oil out selling it and then having to story in Oklahoma. So that’s been an interesting situation now or they drilling company.
Richard Campo: The tankers are waiting offshore to get a better price.
Rich Anderson: And then the second question is I’m assuming the impact, the real immediate impact of all this and has been is on the office sector, and assuming someone who loses their job doesn’t call Ric Campo and given the bad news I’m leaving my apartment, I think that’s more of extended impact on your business and the multi-family business. So if this kind of stay that as well and 2016 is a decline from 2015 and you talked about recycling capital. Why won’t you -- and you have talked about a bit in Houston. So why wouldn’t you be more inclined to be a seller in Houston today before that 2016 impact?
Richard Campo: I think, it’s all about, at the margins, we’ve sold out sets in Houston, it doesn’t make sense to me really to sale the assets we have here. When we look at our asset pricing model and we rank our assets and we rank which ones in our portfolio, the right ones to sale. Houston is not even in the top, in the bottom third in terms of sort of return the forward return on invested capital growth rate. And so to me, I look at our portfolio globally and I don’t react to and try to tie in market, because we’re going to be long real-estate, a 100% of the time and I want to be long the right properties in the markets that we are going to be in long-term and we want to sell the properties that are going to grow slower on a return on invested capital and that is on real cash flow on AFFO and we have other assets in our portfolio that are just higher priority sales.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jordan Sadler: It’s been a while since you guys have been involved in the M&A game. And but obviously have had an appetite historically. I’m curious where we are in the cycle and just the opportunities that seem to be out there. What sort of your current latest thinking on the environment?
Richard Campo: I think its fun to watch. But we having involved in M&A and we focused, when I think about buying a company or doing M&A, it’s all about, is it a strategic opportunity that improves our ability, our long-term growth in our NAV, in our cash flow or and that’s one type. And then the other would be tactical which doesn’t really change your world, but it improves the quality of the portfolio, the growth rate going forward and things like that. As long if you could do it leverage neutral and we did it on a way where it was not significantly dilutive. Then right, let’s do it, I think the problem that you have today or the challenge with company to company M&A is when you look at our stock price, our currency isn’t a great currency right now to swap somebody else given that we’re trading a substantially below our net asset value. So that’s kind of hard to go by somebody and premium at NAV and then give more stock and discount NAV that make a lot of sense to me. So I mean when you get down to the whole M&A issue, M&A tends to be socially driven and not necessarily because somebody wants to sell so, I think there is lot of social issues around it, we have been successful in the past and everything we’ve ever done is been strategic that has created value for Camden and shareholder long term and we saw something like that and it worked financially great, but I don’t see a lot of it and what we have like nine companies left, 35 since over the last 20 years.
Jordan Sadler: Getting slimmer. 
Richard Campo: It is. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is [indiscernible] you’ve talked in the past about construction cost decline across D.C. and potentially Houston and you starting new project in D.C. this quarter. Would you guys consider any starts in Houston or is that stabled for now?
Richard Campo: We have our construction starting in Houston we did last year, which was towards the last year, which is McGowen Station and we do think that construction cost is going to coming down in Houston. McGowen Station project has a fairly long lead in terms of been able to go to start up building, we’re building a 400 space parking garage and a Camphor Park [ph] 3 acre park adjacent to property which will take us probably into the fall to get to the point where we’re actually going vertical on our building. So, we are going really slow on our buyout on our job and hopefully we’ll be in a situation where we can get some favorable pricing later in the fall and towards the end of the year but by due thing construction costs are going to come down here. When you look at office building, for example there is 17 million square feet under construction right now and they’re very likely won’t be a lot of spec with the construction going forward a lot of that staff, 4.5 million square feet at the 2017 is Exxon’s new facility up in North Huston and that’s almost finished. So, what’s happening is the construction workers that are working on those jobs and a construction contractor are looking on the horizons going where is my pipeline and the pipeline is going to shrink pretty dramatically, I think the same think is going to happen with multifamily here in Houston.  If you don’t have your project financed today it’s highly likely that you’re not going to get finance. So, what’s the pipeline that we see today, what coming online in 2015 and 2016 you’re going to probably see a significant drop at least 50% drop from ’16 to ’17. And that should have the downward pressure on construction cost when construction companies today are at premium margins and may be get back to more normal margins.
Unidentified Analyst: So, just to be clear would you start another one in Houston this year? 
Richard Campo: Probably not, we have one that we started and I think we have two tracks of land in downtown, the downtown market is really robust and doing well but even if we wanted to start this year we really couldn’t because when I finish with plans and what it could be a ’16 start but we watch to market and make sure that our time is right on that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Vincent Chao: Just want to stick with Houston here, if we’re at 3:9 today and it sounds like 3:5 is sort of the expectation for the year, I guess. Would you expect the number two to end the year at lowest level or do you think we’ll bottom out sometime in 2015 and potentially have the opportunity to see that go up again in 2016 or towards the end of 2015. 
Richard Campo: My guess is that you would draw straight line from 3:9 down to mathematical average of 3:4 because the timing of the supply than the wildcard on that forecast is gets back to the job, the jobs number whether it’s the bearish into the spectrum or more towards the bullish into the spectrum. But, what we are seeing right now and what’s happening in Houston is completely in line with the plan that we laid out because when we laid our plan out the 22,000 apartments they’re going to be delivered in 2015 we’re 100% notable. Now, there is been a little bit of shifting in timing of the deliveries of those apartments just because contractors haven’t had enough labors to get the units turned but they’re coming and it’s pretty easy to identify where they are and where the impacts going to be we did that on a submarket by submarket basis around our communities and we think we have properly anticipated and got a fence surround the supplying impact and then you are left with the question of demand and job growth.
Vincent Chao: Okay, that makes sense. Maybe just another question a little bit of different slant here but obviously your long term positive on Huston, you’ve got a little bit… you got some additional land tracks that you mentioned but I was just wondering if you’ve made comments that cap rates really haven’t moved on income producing. I was just wondering if land prices have changed at all and that you have had any interest in picking up some additional land in Huston?
Richard Campo: Land prices have a change some they went from white hot to too hot and they were opportunities in a big land, people selling land at a big discount, we might look at that, you haven’t seen any bargains or anybody in trouble. You have a classic situation here where people expect you have the job losses and everything they talk about Huston and then they go let’s go find some value and guess what there is no value any more, value is defined. I got to find somebody who is down on the luck and willing to sell me a property of $0.50 on the $1, property is that land for example that was going for selling numbers like $200 a foot and up from a $100 a foot, now it’s $150 a foot. But it’s still pretty high and it’s still in order for that land to be utilized properly in a development you still have to build the very high end product very dense. So there really is not a lot of value opportunity there are guys who are definitely looking, who are trying to find some of those things. But we still see land that was under contract closing at really high prices here. So there are really not a lot of great value, we are searching for it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the Drew Babine of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babine: Good question on the way supply is going to shaping up and ’17 for DC based on what looking at it looks like things trail off little bit in ’16, but your rumblings and there maybe some supply coming in ’17. I was hoping you could talk about its early to kind of pin point number, but where that supply maybe coming on especially relative Camden?
Richard Campo: Our forecast for new supply in DC and this year is about 11,000 apartments and we’ve got it coming down to about 7,000 next year and then if the number are at the ’17 with too much less reliable are also around 7,500. If you get the kind of job growth that we are currently forecasting for DC metro area which is in 40,000 to 50,000 apartments, 11,000 of new supply is not a really troublesome number. If you get the 40,000 to 50,000 jobs and then if you look out and to the ’16 and ’17 time frame unless something changes pretty quickly that ’16 number of 7,500 apartment is going to be fairly reliable and then in that case for equilibrium you need to create another 30,000-35,000 in DC metro and I certainly hope that would be something that a number that we could surpass if we get some kind of recovery in the DC metro area 30,000 to 40,000 jobs in DC metro area still fairly anemic relative to the long-term employment growth in that whole region. So I think the wildcard is still the only employment side of things. Right now, completions what [talk/thought] they would be fairly manageable in DC metro.
Drew Babine: Any indication of this point in terms of submarket within DC metro and where the supply is more likely to be concentrated?
Richard Campo: Well, that you’ve got a fair amount of construction going on right now on the District. But that’s historically has been the area, that’s been the strongest in terms of bringing in new people to live in District where people want to live. I guess the whole host of reasons and then the historical rent growth has been better there, when we look at DC Metro and we kind of look at it property community by community when we account with our game plan for 2015 with our operating teams, it’s really not submarket related in terms of Northern Virginia, Maryland versus DC proper it’s really submarket driven with regard to new supply. So if you have a community that’s got two new lease-ups that are considered comparable and in the same sub-market that community is going to struggle with the lease-up. It doesn’t really matter whether it’s, what part of Northern Virginia and what part D.C. Metro is in. So it’s more matter of find out with this new supply is coming online and that is likely to be where the pressure is going to be, it certainly been that case for our portfolio.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ian Weissman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is Chris for Ian. I’m just curious if you could update us on the shadow pipeline NoMa to put $115 million and to your 300 million guidance and it sounds like you’ve Shady Grove and content logistic 2016. Are you kind of done with starts for the year or do you think that -- come online this year, I’ll start? Thanks.
Richard Campo: Okay, on NoMa, there are definitely two to three other projects here including other one base project, which is right across the street from us. And the NoMa is an interesting case, because NoMa you think about in last three years ago NoMa was plays that was kind of nowhere and also said now you have a robust workable area very, very high demand and we leased up NoMa Phase I ahead of schedule and ahead of budget on rents and returns. And so we really like the Phase II investment and we like NoMa long-term. I think it’s going to be fine there with the number of apartments that are coming up, it’s not over committed or over, there is not too much to absorb, I don’t think. Especially when some of the additional improvements are done in the NoMa, it’s very good.
Keith Oden: And just to clarify Shady Grove has not been shelf as a 2015 start, I think that was the second --.
Richard Campo: Yes the second question was Shady Grove. Shady Grove is start for 2015.
Keith Oden: And if you add those two together that’s roughly $200 million and that’s kind of mid one of our guidance range of 100 to 300 starts.
Richard Campo: And the Atlanta deal is probably a 16 start not a 15 start. And if you look at our pipeline on page 17, you can see there are four in the pipeline and Shady Grove is one of the other three are likely to be either end of sometime in 16 or even 17 depending on how we feel about Houston.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. I think I misunderstood your last comments. So just going back to D.C. quickly, you talked about how supply and different sub-markets effects rent growth. But just want to talk about what you’re actually seeing on the ground right now referred some of the peers that the CBD is actually kind of catching up with the suburban markets. What are you seen in the different sub-markets of Washington DC?
Richard Campo: So actually in the, since the end of the quarter, I think I gave you the April new lease from renewal numbers for D.C. which is really pretty good. Where 2.3% on new leases, 4.3% on renewals and that’s weighted average of about 3.2% and that was for actual in April. Our renewal offers that have gone out in the entire D.C. Metro area that go out into through May and June are actually have gone out at about 4.6%. So that and I also, I think I share with you occupancy rate was it currently it’s currently a little bit above 96%. So we were 94.7% occupied in the first quarter, there are a whole lot of reasons for that obviously whether was -- D.C. But notwithstanding that we’re back at 96% occupied and our new lease and renewal numbers are stronger now than they were in the first quarter. So all that sounds a lot more constructed to me. And I think that’s why we still feel despite one-tenths down in the first quarter on revenue that by the end of the year, we’re going to have a positive revenue number for D.C. Metro.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Segal of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi [indiscernible] with the quick one before David goes. The question is just falling up on your comments that you trade, you think your stock is that a substantial discount NAV. And you seen have a lot more conviction in outlook for asset values in Houston and the public market. So why not repurchase shares right now?
Richard Campo: We’ve always said that we are we would repurchase our shares if they were to substantial discount for a reasonable period of time. The challenge that we've had this year is that the volatility has been kind of wild, right? You know $82 to $72 to $79 to wherever it is today and the challenge. So to me, the issue is we need to sell assets and then buy the stock. And if we're going to do that and we need to make sure that it's -- that we have a period of time to be able to do then and we just haven’t seen that opportunity. It's been so volatile. But if we have a period of time where we have the ability to sell assets and buy the stock and it has substantial discount, we'll do that. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and based on your past experience doing this and we all know you put an active buyer___ of your on stock in the past, how much time does that usually take?
Richard Campo: Well it's got to be more than a week or two. And that's kind of what we're seeing or may be a month. And so to me the challenge -- the other challenge you have is, you have these long blackout periods, where you can't buy either right? Somebody will say aren't you buying your stock right now and we have only a certain windows and time that we can actually do that with black out periods and so to me it's got to be persistent. It's got to be more than a month. 
Unidentified Analyst: And is it fair to assume that given the significantly better value seen in your stock than in the transaction market you've put in any of your acquisition plans on hold for now?
Richard Campo: Well, we have $450 million to spend the fund. So no, we haven't put our acquisitions from the fund on hold. If you look at our history the last three years we have net seller of property and we the question will be whether we are going to continue to be a net seller property. So, clearly to me the thing that's attractive to trading assets in the capital recycling part is that we've been able to trade older 20 plus year old assets for newer asset to the very, very low spread to negative spread to real cash flow or AFFO and to me that is a good thing to do in an environment like this. Generally the spread between older assets and newer assets has been very wide and we're really historically tight spread there. So we will continue to try to turn those assets that way, increase the quality of the portfolio, raise the rents, increase the or decrease the average age and so we may do some of that as well. But that wouldn't preclude us if we have the opportunity with a reasonable amount of time just to sell assets by stock either. 
Unidentified Analyst: Great. This is David. Can you talk about the difference in performance between your urban Houston assets and some of your suburban Houston assets. It looks like the higher price more of over located properties has had so are rent growth. And I'm curious if you could just kind of talk about that. 
Richard Campo: Its interesting that something that we do look at and if you go back over a 4 year time frame the difference in the As and Bs is rounding. There are points in time and right now is one that the -- there is probably more pressure on the urban stuff, but I don’t think that's a function of product type or mindset of the renter or the renter -- the choice that they're making. I think it’s as simple as -- that’s also where most of the new supplies coming online. So, if you -- my thesis is that it's always more instructive to look at where the -- in a market that's growing supply look where the new supply is and that’s likely to be where you're going to get an impact of this proportionate impact on the ability of raised rents. It doesn’t mean that people's attitudes have changed where they want to live. It just means there is a ton more under construction and being delivered in the urban areas, which is flowing through in some cases to our urban communities. So I don't think it's -- I think I would say that's the distinction in the market place. It's just more supply. 
Keith Oden: Yes, it’s a cycle. Today clearly the urban properties are under more pressure than the suburban properties. So, said very simply the As are definitely going to outperform the Bs. And that’s exactly what part of the -- what happens in this cycle. 
Richard Campo: That’s why we also have a diversified product base within our portfolio of a fair amount of Bs and As we like to keep them that way. So that we have a balance of that -- we're all sitting all in the urban core and then when the market gets to where it is today we end up suffering more than having to balance portfolio.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And last question, do you expect the rents on the NoMa Phase II to be comfortable with the Phase I and what kind of yield are you expecting for that development?
Richard Campo: Sure. We think they’re going to be higher than, but slightly higher than, because new pain is always more expenses in old pain and not but two will be a couple of years all more finished. And our yields are very robust, the yield we have is interestingly number one is an 8% plus or minus, I think our number two is projected David, I think maybe 7.5% on plus or minus on NoMa 1. So the thing is interesting about people love to talk about D.C. and lack rent growth, but on the hand, we can develop a $115 million project and have an 8% yield and the market we can settlement survive that creates a lot of new asset value.
Operator: Our next question comes from Thomas Lesnick of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Thomas Lesnick: Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered at this point. But Rick I just want to ask about big picture geographic investment allocation decisions. In the context Vegas D.C. Houston any recent development push with Austin, LA and Charlotte. Can you share some live to the extent that you can without disclosing something for priority to process by which you make those geographic allocation decisions and what is a lead time what you’re making them?
Richard Campo: Sure. So every budget cycle, we go through a massive review of each market and within the market, we rank assets within that market. And then we look at a broad macro a view going forward. So it’s always interesting look backwards, but forward is more important in my view. So we look at or the growth is going to be over the next two to three years and where we want to position our assets from that perspective and then we make decisions on development starts, acquisitions dispositions along that cycle. We do review this every quarter as well and each market get it analysis from a macro perspective and then we drill down into the sub-markets and that’s how we make our long-term decisions and what we’re going to sell, what we’re going to buy and what we’re going to build.
Operator: And our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. I was wondering about the renewals, we talking about 7.5% and May and June but also talking about 4.5% Houston presumably over the next Houston closure to eight. Wondering if you’re doing that also in April, what you’re seeing in terms of retention, if you think that puts us secures would be retention that any as you comments early on about there has been second lower, second lowest turnover you’ve seen. Do you think, you can get 7.5% and keep turn over that low or just start to keep-up last year goes on?
Richard Campo: So on the 7.5% that’s the rate increased that renewals go out at. And we typically through the process of compensations end up losing about 100 basis points on that. So you an, is there the 7.5% renewal probably turns into 6.5% on executed renewals. That’s portfolio wide it sort of backup to your April question new leases were up about 4% in April across the entire portfolio renewals were up about 6.5. So May, June I look a whole lock April, which is --. So is that answer your question.
Dan Oppenheim: It’s very nice. In terms of the turnover, you expecting that without levels of renewal increases we see turnover status look?
Richard Campo: The 43% is an unusually low number and our turnover rate always lowest in the first quarter. So throughout the year that will -- backup but from a 43% versus 48% in the quarter last year. I mean I think clearly, we should be on the year, we’re going to be left turnover than we had in 2014. But that’s the number in 2014 if our number right was about 56% plus or minus on turnover. So maybe that number is 52%, 53%, but Yeah it will trained up because it always does throughout the year.
Dan Oppenheim: But if you don’t only seasonally, you’re now expecting that the higher rent will push to return?
Richard Campo: We have not seen that in April no have we seen it in the renewals that have gone out in May and June.
Operator: And this conclude our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard Campo: Okay, great. We really appreciate you being on the call today and we will see you at [indiscernible] Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. And we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Thanks, Kim. First, I want to give a shout-out to Michael Bilerman at Citi Research for providing the crude oil theme and several song selections from our pre-call music. We include James Taylor's How Sweet It Is, not as a reference to light sweet crude oil, but rather to point out that despite all the understandable anxiety about how Houston will be impacted by low oil prices, our geographic diversified portfolio will deliver another year of strong results for our shareholders. How sweet it is. We turn the page on 2014 with a view that 2015 will be another above long-term trend for our business. Revenues should continue to trend above long-term trend growth, with 10 of our 15 markets experiencing higher revenue growth in 2015. Continued rising apartment values will continue to put pressure on our operating expenses through property taxes as they make up 30% of our operating costs. We continue to transform our portfolio by selling older assets and recycling that capital into acquisitions and developments. During 2014 and '15, we sold $333 million, and we'll use that capital to fund development. We continue to enjoy very tight AFFO yield spread on our capital recycling program. In the last cycle -- in this last cycle, we have sold more than $1.7 billion in properties with an average age of 26 years and have reinvested those proceeds in our acquisition and development programs. Average rents in our portfolio have increased from $940 at the beginning of this program and now are at $1,250, representing the improvement in the quality of our portfolio through this program. Now let's talk about the elephant in the room, oil prices and their effect on Texas and Houston. So I'm going to start broadly with Texas because I think there's a lot of confusion about Texas and oil and Houston and oil. So Texas has been leading the nation in job growth and in migration for 15 years. Between 2004 and 2011, 840,000 people moved from Texas from other parts of the country. The next highest immigration state Florida at 450,000 people. The highest states that had x migration or net people moving out of their state was California during that same period. 820,000 people moved out of California during 2004 through 2011 and most -- a lot of them probably moved to Texas. The next highest state with net x migration was New York with 750,000 people moving out of the New York area. So when you think about Texas, Texas, so why do people and companies move to Texas? It's not about oil. It's about a pro-business environment. It's about low taxation. It's about affordable housing, low cost of living, a young and diverse and educated workforce, and some of you might disagree with this, but also good weather. And based on the northeaster that hit Boston and the concerns about what might've happened in New York City, you just don't have that in Texas. And so Texas is a diversified state and it's not dependent on oil. In the '80s, for example, when we had our big oil bust, the state revenues, about 15% of the state revenues for the state came from oil. Today, it's about 5.7% of state revenues for oil. So Texas is not about -- it is about oil, but it's also about economic development, it's about diversity and a lot of other businesses driving the Texas market. The other thing that people start to talk about with this broad brush about Texas is that Dallas and Houston are connected via oil. Now Houston, I will admit, is definitely more concentrated on oil. I'm going to talk about Houston in a minute. But if you -- there's a report out that we've been interested in that BBVA Compass research put out. And at $40 oil, they estimate the annual GDP impact of each city, and Houston does have a negative GDP impact from $40 oil and I'll talk about that a little more in a second. But Dallas-Fort Worth, for example, show -- they show a 2% increase in GDP in Dallas-Fort Worth as a result of $40 oil. Obviously, Dallas-Fort Worth is more diversified than Houston, from an oil perspective. It's a transportation hub, and with low, low oil cost or low gas cost, it actually improves the Dallas economy. San Antonio gets a minor lift from $40 oil. Austin gets about a 1.5% increase in their annual GDP from $40 oil as well because of its tech business and low-cost gasoline also helps Austin. So when you think about Texas, you have to remember that Texas isn't all Texas. It isn't all oil. Now Houston, let's talk about Houston oil. It's clearly important to Houston. But Houston has 3 distinct economic drivers. The first is oil, and within that oil sector, 80% of the Houston oil business is upstream, either E&P companies or midstream companies that are transporting the oil and the energy. So that's a big piece, and obviously, the E&P companies are suffering with this oil price. But -- and that's the main concern that people have obviously. 20% of the oil is downstream, which would include chemical and product plants and things like that. And of course, that piece of the oil infrastructure is actually doing really well. Low oil prices, low gas prices increase the margins of chemical companies. There's about $50 billion of construction underway in the Gulf Coast, another $60 billion behind that. So 20% of the oil business is actually going to create jobs, the other 80% is definitely going to tread water or lose jobs. The second leg in the Houston economy is medical. The Texas Medical Center employs over 200,000 people, and people from all over the world go to the Texas Medical Center and Medical is doing incredible. They're having a tough time hiring nurses and hiring other medical professionals and it is an engine that is on fire. The third leg of the stool, if you will, for the economic activity in Houston is the Port of Houston. Port of Houston is one of the largest ports in America, and with the widening of the Panama Canal, their business is going to increase dramatically. In addition, the 20% of the oil business is actually doing well. This chemical business makes primary chemicals for manufacturing across the world. Those chemicals then get transported down into the port and become an export item for Houston. So the port is actually doing much better as a result of oil prices as opposed to worse. So and the port is doing incredibly well. They widened the port. And they just had their 100th anniversary and the activity is incredible. So yes, Houston has 3 economic drivers, of which 80% of one is sputtering and has issues. Now let's talk a little bit about how companies you've heard layoffs of -- from various oil companies and what have you. Now what's interesting is we have a fair amount of intel on how these oil companies are thinking, and what's going on is, when you hear the layoffs today, mostly it has to do with the falling rig counts and those layoffs tend to be in the fields and not in the corporate offices. A good friend of ours who runs one of the midsized energy companies was telling me last night that they have -- they had 8 active rigs in the Eagle Ford Shale and, this is a publicly traded company, and they're now down to 4. They may go to 2. They have 400 people in their corporate office in Houston and the psychology is this. They're laying -- they're definitely laying people off in the field, but they refuse to lay off people in their corporate office for 2 reasons: one, it took them a long time to build that team, and in Houston, Texas today, to get to recruit engineers and software technicians and folks like that is tough and the competition for talent has been really, really difficult for these companies. So they think -- they feel like the oil price situation will be a 12- to 24-month event and that they don't want to come out of the cycle having laid off their key people that will bring them out of the cycle when it turns. So there's a fair amount of job losses, but they're really hesitating on the high sort of power jobs at this point. From a Houston perspective, Houston had 125,000 jobs last year. We always knew the job -- that job growth couldn't be sustained. We think it's going to be 60,000 this year. Most cities in America would love to have 60,000 jobs that Houston is going to generate. So we expect our revenue growth to slow in Houston. We don't expect it to crash. We expect the biggest pressure we have in Houston is the property tax issue because our value of our properties has gone up so much. So the overreaction to this oil situation has been really interesting and actually could be very helpful for our business going forward. Houston has a big red circle around it right now and the circle as flashing and telling investors not to invest in Houston, including new development starts. New development starts will fall off the edge of the map here very quickly. Anybody who doesn't have their multifamily equity and debt financing in place are not going to build. So we should see starts fall dramatically and permits fall dramatically over the next 12 to 18 months. The good news also is that labor is going to be less of a problem. We've had oil companies poaching our top talent at Camden for a long time now. That's probably going to slow and stop. The other issue that we have in Texas overall is that labor to finish our development has been tough. Most of our developments have had to be delayed because we can't get the full complement of crews on our jobs and construction cost has gone up as a result of that as well. We think that both of those things are going -- both of those issues are going to be dealt with in the next 12 to 18 months. So we fundamentally believe that starts are going to really go down low and then costs are going to go down. So opportunistic folks like Camden are going to take advantage of that opportunity and build into the market so that when the market has a hole in it in 2017 and '18, we're going to be there to fill it. So on the good news, Texas is not all oil related, and while Houston is, there are plenty of other economic drivers driving Houston than oil. And ultimately, a slowdown from white-hot to good is something that we think is a good thing for not only Texas and Houston, but also Camden. So with that, I would like to thank our Camden teams in the field for a great 2014. I know you're up to 2015 and making sure that we create a lot of value for our shareholders. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Keith Oden.
D. Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. And consistent with prior years, I'm going to spend my time on today's call to review our market conditions that we expect to encounter in our largest markets in 2015. I'll address the markets in the order of best to worst by assigning a letter grade to each one as well as our view as to whether we believe that market is likely to be improving, stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview, I'll provide additional details on our fourth quarter operations and our 2015 same-property guidance. Starting with an overview of Camden's markets. Our #1 ranking for 2015 goes -- again, goes to Atlanta, which we rate an A+ with a stable outlook. Atlanta was our top market in 2014 with 8.4% same-property revenue growth. Supply remains below historical levels with about 8,000 to 10,000 new apartments expected to open in 2015, and 65,000 to 70,000 new jobs should be created. We expect Atlanta to be our top performer again in 2015. Denver and Austin are in the next 2 spots with A ratings, and outlooks of stable. These markets have performed well for us, averaging over 7% revenue growth for the past 3 years. While new deliveries will continue in both markets, demand should remain strong, providing another year of solid growth. Around 42,000 new jobs are projected for Denver in 2015, which should easily absorb the roughly 8,000 units coming online. Austin is projecting 35,000 to 40,000 new jobs in 2015, and completion should be down slightly versus last year but still remain close to 10,000 units. Average rents for our Austin communities range from $1,000 to $1,400 per month, which does not really put us in direct competition with most of the new development. However, the elevated level of new supply will continue to be a factor weighing on rent growth in Austin this year. Phoenix and Southern California, both earned an A- with improving outlooks, and they're expected to post above-average results in 2015. The Phoenix economy generated around 55,000 new jobs last year and nearly 60,000 are expected during 2015. Supply remains well below normal levels, with roughly 8,000 new units being delivered this year. Southern California has been steadily improving over the past few quarters and should be one of our top markets for same-store growth in 2015. The outlooks for job growth in Orange County, L.A. and San Diego markets are all favorable and new supply remains at very manageable levels. Dallas is next on the list, earning a B+ rating and stable outlook. Job growth estimates remain quite strong with around 75,000 new jobs projected in 2015. New developments have been coming online steadily for several quarters. Another 14,000 new units are set to open this year. We believe demand for apartments should be healthy given the continued strength in the Dallas economy. Conditions in Charlotte are currently a B+ with a declining outlook. Charlotte's job growth has been steady in the range of 25,000 new jobs annually with another 7,000 units will be delivered this year, many located in the urban submarkets of south and in uptown. Our occupancy remains strong in Charlotte, but our pricing power will be tested during 2015 as these new communities come online. Las Vegas moves up several places this year after ranking as one of our bottom 2 markets for the past several years. Today, we rate Vegas a B with an improving outlook. Our revenue growth there was less than 2% in both 2012 and '13, but the market began to turn last year and we posted 3.7% revenue growth for 2014. Supply is clearly not an issue in Las Vegas with only 2,000 new units being delivered this year. Job growth has been running at a level of nearly 25,000 new jobs annually and is expected to continue at that rate. Our Las Vegas portfolio is currently 96% occupied, is well positioned for above-average growth this year. The Raleigh market also -- was also rated to B with an improving outlook for 2015. Completions peaked last year and are slowing to around 4,000 units during 2015, with over 20,000 new jobs projected. This should position us well to maintain occupancy levels while increasing rental rates this year. The rating of B with a stable outlook goes to our 3 Florida markets: South Florida, Tampa and Orlando. Conditions in South Florida should look a lot like last year with job growth of 50,000, easily absorbing the 8,000-or-so new completions in that market. In Tampa and Orlando, our 2015 revenue growth projections are also quite similar to 2014, Tampa should see over 30,000 jobs created with around 5,000 new units delivered. Job growth in Orlando is projected closer to 40,000, with 6,000 new apartments coming online, providing balanced levels of supply and demand for both markets. In Houston, our current rating is a B and we do expect conditions to decline during 2015. For the past 4 years, our Houston same-store revenue and NOI growth has averaged 8% and 9%, respectively. Over the past 20 years, those averages were 3.4% and 4%, respectively. So despite the ups and downs we've experienced during many cycles, Houston has been a job that has consistently performed for Camden. While the city's averaged over 100,000 new jobs for the past several years, we know that 2015 will be a different story. It's too early to tell what the exact impact of falling oil prices is going to be, but it's likely that job growth this year will still be in the 50,000 to 60,000 range if current conditions persist. New supply has been steady for the past several quarters and up to 20,000 new apartments are expected to open in 2015. As a result, we are projecting same-store revenue growth to moderate this year in Houston and return to a level around our long-term average of 3.4%. Washington, D.C. Metro will be our weakest market again this year with a C rating and stable outlook. Revenue growth was 0.9% in 2014, the lowest in our portfolio, and we expect that to be a recurring theme in 2015. Estimates for completions this year in D.C. are in the 12,000 range. However, most economists are predicting a better year on the job growth front, with estimates of 40,000 or more new jobs this year. Overall, our portfolio would rank close to a B+ again this year, which puts us in a great starting position for 2015. Now a few details on operating results. Same-store revenue growth was 4.2% for the fourth quarter and 4.5% for the full year of 2014. We saw strong performance during the fourth quarter with Atlanta up 8.4%; followed by Denver, up 8%; Austin, up 6.9%; and L.A./Orange County, up 6%. Overall trends for the fourth quarter and January were better than what we experienced in the prior year. Fourth quarter new leases were up 1.3% and renewals up 6.8% versus down 0.3% and up 5.6% last year on renewals. In January, so far, new leases are up 0.8% and renewals are up 6.5%, again, versus 1.3% and 6.1% last year. February and March renewals are being sent out at around a 7.5% increase and are typically signed within 100 basis points of the offer. Occupancy averaged 95.7% for the fourth quarter, in line with last -- our entire last year. And January occupancy has been running 95.5%, which is where it stands today. Net turnover for the fourth quarter was 46% versus 49% in the prior year, and year-to-date turnover was 43 -- 53% in '14 versus 56% in 2013. Move-outs to purchased homes was 14.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014 versus 15.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 13.9% in the third quarter of 2014. I'll wrap up with a shout-out to our Camden team members. In 2010, we made a very bold prediction. We told you that over the next 3 years would be the best in Camden's history. Your collective efforts since then have made us look incredibly smart, which we aren't, and feel incredibly proud, which we are. In 2014, the best 3 years became the best 4 years and it looks like we're set to make it the best 5 years in 2015. Thanks for all you do, and we'll see you at the upcoming ACE Awards. I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Last night, we reported the results for fourth quarter 2014 and provided guidance for both the first quarter and full year of 2015. Before I provide further details on each of these, a few general observations about 2014. In 2014 and subsequent to year-end, we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio by disposing of approximately 2,100 wholly owned apartment homes with an average age of 30 years, and we anticipate the disposition of another 27-year-old community with 832 apartment homes this Friday. This will bring our total disposition volume for the last 2 quarters to $333 million, $33 million more than our prior guidance midpoint. We'll use the net proceeds from these dispositions to fund in part our $1 billion pipeline of new developments. In 2014, we delivered same-store revenue growth to 4.5%, likely to be near the top of the peer group. And our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the REIT sector with debt-to-EBITDA in the mid-5x, a fixed charge expense coverage ratio of 5x, approximately 80% of our assets unencumbered and 92% of our debt at fixed rates. Additionally, we restructured our 2 funds, extending the maturities by approximately 8 years to 2026, and in recognition of the value we have created within the funds, received an additional 11.3% ownership. These funds own 22 communities, encompassing approximately 7,300 apartment homes with an average age of 6 years. 2014 was another very good year. The $248 million of 30-year-old dispositions we sold in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 were sold at an average FFO yield of 6.25%, but an average AFFO yield of 4.7% based on trailing 12-month NOI, the difference between the FFO yield and the AFFO yield being the inclusion of $1,800 per door and actual CapEx. These communities deliver to our shareholders an unleveraged internal rate of return of 10.25% over a 17-year hold period. We anticipate selling the remaining 27-year-old, $85 million community tomorrow at a fixed 0.8% FFO yield and an AFFO yield of 5.7% after accounting for actual CapEx. Regarding our development pipeline, during the quarter, we reached stabilization at Camden NoMa, a $102 million development in Washington, D.C. NoMa is currently 95% occupied and is expected to achieve a 7% stabilized yield. Also, during the quarter, we completed construction of 2 wholly owned communities: Camden Boca Raton in Boca Raton, Florida; and Camden Foothills in Scottsdale, Arizona. Began leasing at Camden Hayden at Tempe, Arizona and commenced construction at Camden Lincoln Station in Denver, Colorado and Camden McGowen Station in Houston, Texas. Moving onto financial results and guidance. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of $90.3 million or $0.99 per share, in line with the midpoint of our revised guidance issued on December 29. Included in this results is a onetime charge of $10 million or $0.11 per diluted share in incentive compensation relating to the value created by our increased ownership in the funds. Adding this charge back to our reported numbers results in core funds from operations for the fourth quarter of $100.3 million or $1.10 per share, in line with the midpoint of our original fourth quarter guidance. Our full year same-store results of 4.5% for revenue, 3.8% for expenses and 4.9% for net operating income are exactly the midpoint of our prior guidance ranges. Moving onto 2015 earnings guidance. You can refer to Page 26 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2015 financial outlook. As detailed in our supplemental package, our 2014 reported FFO per diluted share of $4.18 included $0.085 of net non-routine charges. Excluding these net non-routine charges and adjusting for the year-end 2014 share count, our base 2014 FFO per diluted share would have been $4.23. We expect 2015 FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $4.36 to $4.56, with a midpoint of $4.46 representing a $0.23 per share increase over our adjusted 2014 results. The major assumptions and components of this $0.23 per share increase in FFO at the midpoint of our guidance range are as follows: a $0.22 per share or $20 million increase in FFO related to the performance of our 47,878 unit same-store portfolio. We are expecting same-store net operating income growth of 3% to 5%, driven by revenue growth of 3.75% to 4.75% and expense growth of 4.5% to 5%; a $0.28 per share or $25 million increase in FFO related to net operating income from our non-same-store properties, resulting primarily from the incremental contribution from our development communities in lease-up during 2014 and 2015, 1 development community which stabilized in 2014 and 1 community acquired in 2014; and a net $0.04 per share for a $4 million increase in FFO resulting primarily from our increased ownership in the 22 fund communities. These above positives are partially offset by: a $0.14 per share or $12 million decrease in FFO related to lost NOI from the $218 million of dispositions completed in the fourth quarter of 2014; an $0.08 per share or $7 million decrease in FFO related to lost NOI from completed and anticipated first quarter 2015 dispositions. Earlier this month, we sold a $29 million operating community, and we anticipate the sale of another $85 million property tomorrow; a $0.06 per share or $5 million decrease in FFO related to increased interest expense, primarily as a result of lower levels of capitalized interest. In 2015, we anticipate completing approximately 2,000 units of our development pipeline. Once a unit is completed and we receive a certificate of occupancy, we begin -- we must begin expensing all interest and operating costs related to that unit; and finally, a $0.03 per share or $2.5 million decrease in FFO due to increases in overhead expenses. As a reminder, $300 million was the original midpoint of our 2014 disposition volume. Combining the dispositions that were completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 with the dispositions completed or anticipated to be completed in the early part of the first quarter of 2015 results in $333 million of total sales, adding $0.02 of additional dilution to 2015 earnings. Taking a closer look at our anticipated same-store expense growth of 4.5% to 5% for 2015. We are once again expecting a large increase in property taxes. Property taxes are approximately 30% of our total operating expenses and are projected to be up 5.75% in 2015. 5% is core, the result of anticipated increases in assessments for our properties in 2015 due to continuing increases in real estate values. 75 basis points is due to year-over-year reduction and anticipated refunds from prior year tax protest. Additionally, we are anticipating an 8% increase in property utility expense in 2015 as a result of our recent bulk Internet initiative. Utilities are approximately 20% of our total operating expenses and this initiative is adding approximately 75 to 100 basis points to our total 2015 expense growth. Many of you are aware of our existing bulk cable program where we purchase cable directly from our providers at wholesale and then provide cable services to our residents at a discount to retail prices, generating a profit. The bulk Internet program will work the same way. Like our cable program, the residents will receive Internet service at a lower price than they can get in the retail market and Camden will make a profit, a win-win situation. This initiative is adding approximately 25 to 50 basis points to our 2015 estimated same-store revenue, depending upon the pace of the rollout. As 2015 is an implementation year for the program, the actual net profit will be minimal. However, this initiative should become meaningful in 2016 and beyond, contributing an estimated $5 million in annual FFO. We will provide more color on future calls regarding the success of the program. Excluding the Internet-related expenses, our utility increase would be approximately 3%, in line with the remainder of our expense categories. Page 26 of our supplemental package also details our expected ranges of acquisitions, dispositions and development activities. The midpoint of our 2015 FFO per share guidance range assumes the following: $200 million in on-balance sheet dispositions, which includes the $29 million completed to date; $85 million, which should close shortly, and the remainder closing the latter part of the year; $200 million in on-balance sheet acquisitions also anticipated to occur in the latter part of the year; and $200 million of on-balance sheet development starts throughout the year. Based on our projected development spend of $350 million in 2015 and our midyear $250 million bond maturity, we anticipate needing approximately $600 million of new capital during the year, which we expect to fund through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our undrawn $500 million line of credit and utilization of the capital markets in an opportunistic manner. The composition of our 2015 capital markets activity, if any, will depend upon a variety of factors, including the then current market conditions and economic environment. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.08. After adjusting for the $0.11 per share fund restructuring compensation expense, the midpoint of this range represents a $0.04 per share decline from the fourth quarter of 2014. The $0.04 per share decline is primarily the result of the following items: a $0.01 or approximately $1 million decline in sequential same-store net operating income, mainly due to higher property taxes and normal seasonal expense increases, partially offset by a slight increase in same-property revenues due to continuing improvements in rental rates; a $0.035 or $3.3 million decrease in FFO related to lost NOI from our fourth quarter 2014 and first quarter 2015 disposition activities that I previously mentioned; and a $0.005 decrease in FFO due to lower levels of interest capitalization. These decreases in FFO are partially offset by a $0.005 or approximately $500,000 increase in net FFO, resulting from our fund restructure, and $0.005 or approximately $500,000 increase in FFO from continued leasing at our development communities and our fourth quarter 2014 property acquisition. At this time, we will now open up the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It's Michael Bilerman with Nick. Ric, I appreciate your comments surrounding Texas and Houston, and clearly, uncertainty and perception doesn't help. And even though you provide a lot of comments, I think it's just the uncertainty that's sort of waves. And I'm curious, as you think about your forecast, and I think Keith had mentioned it was 3.4% same-store revenue growth for '15 for Houston and I'm just trying to piece that together as you go through the year. Your earn-in is probably just under 3% from '14. And so I guess, what are you assuming in terms of occupancy, rental change on rollovers and how does that carry through throughout the year and into '16?
D. Keith Oden: So Michael, this is Keith. On the -- on our Houston numbers, our actual budget for the year on revenue increase is 3.4%. I think -- or 3 5%. I think I gave the long-term historical average at 3.4%. So we're actually at about 3.5% for the year. Our calculation on the earn-in is a little lower than what you have. We think it's about 2% earn-in for the year. And so the balance for the year, clearly, we think we'll pick up another 1.5%. We budgeted occupancies fairly flat, and we don't think that we're going to see any big drop in occupancy, certainly not at the high levels that we had last year. We've been running 96% occupied in Houston for almost 2.5 years now. So I don't think we'll see that. We'll be closer to the historical 95% range. Looking at the beginning of the year, if you take what happened in December in Houston, we were at about 2.7% average on -- between new leases and renewals. New leases were basically flat, and renewals were about 5.5%. That was for December. We don't really have an enough data in January, but it looks like the trend in January is a continuation of that. So it's clearly -- we've clearly baked in a significant slowdown, not necessarily so much from declining job growth. I think in a normal year, 60,000 jobs would be enough to kind of keep things in a steady state. But you got 20,000 apartments being delivered, and you have 20,000 apartments being delivered in some really relevant submarkets to our operation. So we think that we properly anticipated that in our forecast in Houston for 2015. But I guess, the devil's in the details in terms of how long the oil price stays where it is and how quickly companies do respond, I think that Ric's point is certainly about the fact that the oil companies have spent the last 5 years clawing each other's eyes out for talent. I think there's going to be a lot of stickiness on the letting that talent go side until -- I think there's going to go much -- the duration is going to have to be much longer than what people are currently thinking to see an impact on that in Houston. Now obviously, the field operations are a different story.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just second question, maybe just in terms of the transaction market Houston and Texas more broadly. And maybe you can make an analogous situation to D.C. When D.C. was pretty -- went through its weakness, both supply as well as job growth, and the fundamentals were weak. The thought process was, well, if we can assets that hopefully will come to the market cheap, we'd be all over it. And cap rates really didn't move. So the investor interest sort of looked through what was weaker fundamentals. How do you sort of see that potentially playing out in Texas? And sort of what's your desire to participate or not?
Richard J. Campo: Sure. The -- I think it's the same song, second verse of D.C. versus Houston. Anybody who wants to sell probably won't sell because of the psychology issue, right, which is, gee, why should I sell in this uncertainty? And then, on the -- so on the one hand, I don't think there's going to be -- there clearly is not going to be any bargains here. There haven't been bargains in Houston for a long time, that's why we haven't bought a lot here. We are developing some, but that's it. In terms of other -- there is an interesting piece. Houston has definitely been redlined by a lot of investors. And -- but other markets have not. So people are still getting equity deals done, and acquisitions are robust in the other markets. We do think Houston sales will fall off next year just because sellers don't really want to sort of try to see what the market will do today. But on the other hand, I have heard some folks talking about maybe this is the opportunity to go in because some institutional investors will pull out, maybe you don't have as much competition. And some of the developments that were done have such massive profit margins. We're talking if you built in 2010 here, you might have an 80% profit margin in your development deal. And so on the one hand, somebody says, "Oh, I got an 80% margin. Maybe I have to take a 70% margin to sell it. Then, what the hey, I'll still take it." And so there may be some of that going on. But there's no signs that anybody is under distress or anything like that. I will tell you land prices have adjusted pretty effectively, pretty fast, like some deals that we have been monitoring are down 20% or 30% because of the development side. So we are definitely going to be scouring the market for opportunistic activity and land might be the thing that really is the opportunity as opposed to existing assets.
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Ric, I was wondering if you can talk about valuations in the private market and perhaps both individual assets and also perhaps even commenting on the Gables valuation. And would also like you to maybe tie into how you think Camden's trading perhaps because it seems like you guys are at one of the highest broad cap rates right now.
Richard J. Campo: Sure. I think the Gables transaction is a really interesting one because it was heavily bid. The cover bid was $500,000 on a $3.2 billion transaction. And this is all in the marketplace, not -- I'm not -- it's not confidential in any way. You've read the reports. The portfolio, interestingly enough, matches up pretty effectively with ours. It was about a 60% A and 40% B portfolio, 42% based in Texas, 12% based in D.C. So when you think about it, heavily bid, heavily -- very robust pricing, sub-5% cap rate with CapEx. And you look at the portfolio being 54% in the 2 markets people are worried about today, yet there was huge institutional capital demand for the product and it's going to -- it hasn't closed yet, but I understand it's closing in February. So I think that's pretty instructive. The private market has definitely not discounted the -- Texas overall or Houston as -- from a punitive perspective as they have public company stocks. Camden has underperformed by about 900 basis points since the oil prices started dropping relative to our peers. And on a pure cap rate basis, you haven't seen any of that happen in the marketplace at all. So that's sort of the way I see it.
Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just a follow-up on Houston. Any sense of what the impact on the 3.5% growth rate would be if the job number would've come out as flat or even go negative this year?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, it's really hard to extrapolate that one. I don't -- it's hard to see the -- some of the estimates that in the market right now of Houston having as bad as negative job growth on 2015. I just can't even -- there's nothing that we look at that gets anything close to that, and I think we're very comfortable in the 50,000 to 60,000 range. And again, for all the reasons that it's not -- it's not that there won't be job losses, there will and there already have been. But the -- how -- Schlumberger has already announced job loss -- job cuts. Baker Hughes has announced job cuts. But if you look through that and look at where does are happening, as Ric mentioned, those are primarily field jobs. To date, there have been really literally a handful of notifications of layoffs and those are less than, in the cases that we've seen, less than 100 individuals involved in the oil and gas industry. So it's hard to get a thought process around where we are right now and having that big of a disruption in 2015. I think there's going to be a lot of stickiness on employment in the headquarter offices of all these oil companies, and I think the question really becomes more -- almost more of a 2016 question. If you have a scenario that you want to run and say, let's say, for grins, oil prices stay in the $40s for another -- throughout '15 and throughout '16, I think you're dealing with a different set of facts then. But for 2015, it's hard to parse that. The other part of it is, is that we had 2% built in because of '13 -- or '14 rent growth. And the other part of that equation will be, what happens to the national economy? If you continue to create 250,000 jobs, that will drive the other parts of the Houston economy. So if you say 0 jobs, then you're probably not going to get 3.5%. You're probably going to be in the 2% kind of zone, I would think. Sort the good for the first half and bad for the second half.
Operator: Our next question is from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Can you talk about the net impact on the rest of your portfolio at $40 oil? You shared a lot of thoughts on Houston. But for the portfolio as a whole, you regularly disclose the rent income ratio and now you have an effective tax cut for your customers. So how much more can you push rents at $40 oil than $100? If you could quantify that and tell us if that, in your mind, offsets the weakness that you're seeing in Houston.
D. Keith Oden: So Dave, if you look at our portfolio and you kind of stratify the way our budget's rolled up this year, and again, we have a very -- it's a very grassroots down at the property level, begins at the property level. We give guidance on some macro issues, but these are -- by and large, these are budgets that are developed by the people in the individual markets. So of the 15 markets that we operate in, our budgets, the budgeted revenue increases for 2015 are higher than the budgeted revenue increases for 2014. And I think that's -- yes, you've got 5 markets that are lower than 2014, but there's not a single market in our -- the only market in our portfolio that has revenue growth declining by more than 1% is Houston and it's down 2.3%. So you got 4 markets that have very slight downs and you got 10 markets with ups. So I think that the answer from the people that are best suited to make that judgment about what the current state of play vis-à-vis consumer confidence, ability to pay, what's going on in their individual markets, the resounding statement from our folks was that in 10 out of the 15 markets, they think it's going to be better in 2015 than in 2014. And obviously, a tax cut vis-à-vis the price of gasoline is an important part of that. I think also that what Ric mentioned his prepared comments is that the tax cut aspect of the oil price decline is a net positive in our other 2 Texas markets, in Austin and Dallas. So I mean, the big loser in this is Houston for sure. We think it's -- we think we've put a sense around what the impact can be in 2015 and we'll see.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Just a follow-up on that. If it's a positive in the other 2 Texas markets. I assume it's a positive in the rest of your markets. So would you suggest that the near-term and long-term growth rate for your portfolio is better at $40 oil than $100?
D. Keith Oden: I think, net-net, it is because you've got the impact spread over 80 -- or 87% of our portfolio x Houston that is clearly going to benefit. And I think you're going to see it in the job growth numbers, and that's the #1 driver of the performance in all of our markets.
Operator: Our next question is from Ian Weissman of Crédit Suisse.
Ian C. Weissman - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just a quick question on your development starts. It looks like you tempered your expectations from previous comments made in past quarters. I guess my question is, are you -- are the deals just not penciling? Because the bulk of your pipeline is in D.C. and Houston. Would you start projects in those markets today or do you think the economics just don't make sense?
Richard J. Campo: Well, we have -- we really haven't moderated our view. We have said sort of all along that we would -- once we got through our big pipeline, we would start moderating the development activity from $250 million to $350 million annually plus or minus. The -- in D.C., we actually finished our NoMa project and we are going to start our NoMa II project. And the interesting thing in D.C., and this is, I think, going to happen in Houston as well, is that construction costs have moderated in D.C. So we're able to build our NoMa II at a little bit less than our NoMa I. NoMa II -- NoMa I, for example, is yielding over a 7% cash-on-cash return. Our NoMa 2 returns look like they're going to be higher than NoMa I, so we like those kind of returns. And when the cap rates are sticky at the sub-5% and I can build to a 7%, 7.5% in those markets, I'm going to still do it. In Houston, we started -- we're going to start McGowen Station, which will deliver in 2017. And we think it's perfect timing to get our costs in line with the sort of red line around Houston. And we know this is a great long-term market and so we're going to build that building. We've -- that particular one we've been working on for 13 years. People talk about how easy it is to build in Texas, but that particular site is one of the prime sites in Midtown. We negotiated a -- with the city a 3-acre city park in the project. So it's a very unique and interesting project. So that's where we are that -- from that perspective.
Ian C. Weissman - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And just 1 follow-up question on, I guess, on the Gables, but more importantly just the transaction market in general. Where would you peg unlevered IRRs today in your markets? And how much have they compressed over the last 6 months?
Richard J. Campo: I would say unlevered IRRs are probably in the high 5s now and they were in the sort of 6. They're probably -- talking probably 25 basis points at least in the last few months. The -- and it depends on the type of property you're doing. Part of the challenge with this -- with using unlevered IRRs, your kind of bogey, is that most of the private buyers that are sort of the buyers that are country club monies, they don't ever think of unlevered IRRs. A lot of the people that we sell to, I'd ask them the question after they buy. I said, well, what was your targeted unlevered IRR? And they go, "Well, we're not sure how to calculate that or what that is. What we're interested in is cash-on-cash return and what the levered equity returns are." They do unlevered IRR, but it's sort of interesting to know. And with interest rates as low as they are with using floating rate debt, these cash-on-cash returns are just out of control and the leveraged equity returns are out of control, too. But generally, institutions are in the 5s.
Operator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just 2 quick questions here. One, as far as Houston goes, if we use D.C. as a sort of a template, what should we expect on turnover or concessions or NOI margin impact? Competitors are suddenly discounting or offering free rent, et cetera, to try and lure tenants. Should we expect -- so Keith, you spoke about 3.5% revenue, but what about the expense of trying to keep people in there?
D. Keith Oden: Well, if you've used D.C. as a model, in the last 4 years, we had 1 year that was a, call it down 3% and the other 3 have been flat to up 50 basis points. So the story in D.C. really was more of a, you had a slight oversupply condition but you had job growth dropped from -- we're on a run-rate basis of 50,000 to 60,000 jobs a year, we dropped down to about 10,000 jobs. So you just didn't have the demand in D.C. and you had this sort of pent-up supply that just kept dribbling into the marketplace without any net demand to take care of it. So I think that in the Houston scenario, if we're right and if the economists that we follow are right and we get 50,000 to 60,000 jobs, you're going to have some impact from direct competitors that are in lease-up. They tend to be pretty aggressive when they get to the 30-yard line, trying to get the ball in end zone and get their lease-up completed. So yes, you'll have people that are offering free rent or we're already seeing some of that in some of our markets. And we just have to -- we have to do what we've always done, which is sell the value proposition. We think we have properly anticipated the pressure that we're likely to see in Houston in 2015 and we'll just have to see how it plays out.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: So your marketing budget is up a little bit then?
D. Keith Oden: Yes. We don't -- so what we do -- we don't have a marketing budget by community or even by city. We have a marketing budget for the entire -- for all of Camden, and we target those dollars where they need to be targeted. And it's all -- 90% of what we do these days is Internet spend. And we're very agile and very flexible when it comes to where do you need to spend the dollars to have the desired impact on meeting your objectives? So yes, I'm certain that based on our methodology, Houston is going to get more money this year than they got in 2014.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then just finally, Denver, I don't think you mentioned that. That's another energy market. What are your expectations for there as far as impact, either positive or negative?
Richard J. Campo: When you look at Denver as an energy market, it is so small relative to its overall job growth. It's sort of like -- I think it's sort of like Dallas to a certain extent. And we think Denver is going to be a very strong market this year. It was a very strong market last year, the demographics, the job growth the starts. We feel really good about Denver.
D. Keith Oden: Yes, we're at budgeted revenue increase in Denver worth 6% this year. That's down from last year actuals of about 7% or 6.9%. So yes, a little bit less than last year, but last year was an incredible year for Denver. And it's the second ranked -- highest ranked in our portfolio for the second year running.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: I'll be quick. When you look at the $0.22 dilution in your FFO guidance from dispositions, what would be your guess of what that number would be, if it would be anything at all, if you were to give AFFO guidance?
Richard J. Campo: Last call, I said we had a 15 basis point negative spread on AFFO for $1 billion-plus of dispositions. If you look at the spread, the spread on this last round was probably 30 basis points negative maybe. So that's a real issue because it's really interesting because when we look at our disposition, when we make an analysis of it, we don't even look at FFO. We look at real cash flow. When I look at it, I say, if I can sell a 30-year-old asset at a cash flow yield of x and I can build a new development at a cash flow yield of y and there's a tight little spread on that, either both -- and oftentimes, it's positive because people underestimate their CapEx. We've sold a lot of these deals at 4.5% AFFO yields, and we're taking that 4.5% and putting it into a new development that has a 5.5% or 6% AFFO yield. So I haven't seen that, Rich, in my business career very often. That's why we've been pounding it and sold so much.
D. Keith Oden: So I think it's -- my quick math, Rich, is it's about a $0.01 or $0.02 versus the $0.22.
Richard J. Campo: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from Karin Ford of KeyBanc.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just going back to the D.C. analogy. Ric, Keith, do you foresee a scenario where market rent growth in Houston could possibly go negative, either later in '15 or even in '16?
D. Keith Oden: I think if the correct conditions, meaning $40 a barrel oil persist into 2016, you'll likely see that, yes.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And is it -- have you seen the impact yet on the consumer mindset in Houston? Or is it ahead of potential job losses there? Or is the environment and sort of the mentality continuing to the positive?
Richard J. Campo: I think, by and large, when you think about 13% of the workforce is in oil and gas and you have the add-on to the oil and gas, consumers are nervous. There's no question about it because you're starting to see every day in the paper other issues about layoffs and what have you and they're talking about it on the news all the time. And so I don't think we have seen anybody on our sites per se that are all nervous. But I think it's just sort of people -- the uncertainty creates a certain amount of angst and people worry about it. I don't think -- I think on the other hand, the low gas prices are helping all the consumers as well. So even though overall Houston itself has a job issue this year or potentially going to have a job issue this year, all the consumers are still getting the same benefit that the rest of the consumers in America are, which is a big tax cut. So on the one hand, they feel good about low gas prices. On the other hand, they worry how it's going to affect them individually.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And did you guys consider not starting McGowen Station?
Richard J. Campo: We did, absolutely. We looked at it very critically. And because we think we're going to be able to buy it out from a construction perspective at lower than what our budget is, and because we're delivering into '17 knowing that there's no one going to start a deal that they don't have funded today, we're going to be leasing in '17 and '18, which could be a -- which I think will be a very low supply environment in a very great location with the transit access. And it'll be a -- so yes, we went through a very deliberate process and decided that it was the right thing to do.
Operator: Our next question is from Tom Lesnick of Capital One.
Thomas James Lesnick - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division: I'll be quick. Just shifting away from Houston for a quick second. I was wondering if you could perhaps elaborate a little bit on the timing of the bulk Internet implementation this year? I'm just trying to think about margin sequentially through the year.
Richard J. Campo: Yes, so the rollout is underway, and we've got a pretty ambitious schedule for rolling it out. It'll happen, I think, pro rata throughout the year would be your best assumption. Although keep in mind that in 2015, the net contribution, even though there's a lot of noise on the expense side and a little bit on the revenue side, the net contribution of the program is less than $1 million. So I don't think it's going to -- if we had our druthers, we would have matched the revenue, netted it with the expense and called it a rounding error and moved on. But our accountants won't let us to do that, so we have to report both the expense side and the revenue side. So there will be some noise in our numbers for this year. Also, into 2016, we'll complete the rollout. And as Alex mentioned in his remarks, the payoff for this program minus the rollout year of 2015 is by the end of 2016 we'll be at roughly a $5 million profit FFO impact for years beyond 2016. So ultimately, you're talking about fairly sizable amount of money and we've got to go through a little bit of noise in the reporting to get to that.
Operator: Our next question is from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Ric, can you comment just for a second on the decision to award the special incentive, $10 million incentive comp at the end of the year? Just it would seem to me that most of the value creation in terms of triggering the promote was cap rates going down and market rents going up as opposed to massive outperformance in -- at the property level. So I guess I'm just curious around the decision to give that special comp.
Richard J. Campo: Well, we have a fundamental philosophy at Camden, and that is that we share the wealth with all of our employees. And that's a really -- that's a critical part of our culture. And so -- and I would sort of beg to differ on the on-site production because every single pro forma that we did, and we were trying to hit a mid or low teens return for our investors and we hit -- and did far better than that, had in the 20s IRR. And those returns and that the result of that -- the restructure was directly driven by a combined team effort, that we had a team that acquired the properties. We had a team that did due diligence. We had a team that did the financing. We had a team that did the asset management. We had a team that was on-site that focused on maximizing value for Camden and for Texas futures. And so the -- every single property outperformed their original pro forma. And while cap rates have compressed. It's one of those kind of things where if you're making the decisions and your teams are effective and you're beating your budgets, you can always say, well, you just got in front of a good market and it ran into you. And I found over the last 30 years in the real estate business that it takes a lot of teams doing the right things at the right time at the right place to make sure you get in front of that market and let it run over you. And so with that said, we fundamentally believe that our employees are some of the most important people in our constituent group. And if our employees have smiles on their faces and get paid on a big value creation, then the customers will smile, and ultimately, the shareholders will smile. So we're -- that is just part of our culture and that's why it was really important for us to make sure that everyone knew that senior management didn't take -- Keith and Malcolm and I didn't take a nickel in it and are -- most of the bonus, about 80% of it, went to -- or actually 85% of it went to field people and people on the team. So that's just our philosophy.
Operator: Our next question is from Jana Galan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a couple quick questions on the move-out for home ownership. Was the year-over-year decline pretty consistent through the portfolio or did any markets pick up? And then when you look out for 2015 with better job growth and higher consumer confidence, do you think you could see a little bit of pressure from greater move-outs for homeownership?
D. Keith Oden: Jana, we'll have to get you the individual markets. We have that. We just don't have it in front of us. But in terms of overall move-outs to home purchases, we have been surprised consistently over the last 3 years that, that metric has not moved back up more aggressively with an improving economy. And there's a whole lot of demographic reasons around why we believe that's not happening, including it's taking -- millennials are taking longer to get married. They're taking longer to have children, which has historically been the triggering event for, in many cases, moving out of an apartment and buying your first home. So there's just -- there's a lot of things that we think are not part of the cycle, but they probably are a real secular change in terms of the demographics and the way people are forming families at what rate, at what age and having children. So I think that's likely to continue. The -- but it has been surprising. Our long-term average move-outs to home purchases is around 18% and we actually ticked down from the prior year. So we're -- I'd be surprised at this point if 2015 gets much beyond the 14.5% range across all our markets.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: Thank you. Appreciate your attention on the call, and we will talk to you next quarter or see you in Florida, too. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan. Please go ahead.
Kimberly A. Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. Any forward-looking statements made on today's call represent management's current opinions, and the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements because of subsequent events. As a reminder, Camden's complete third quarter 2014 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. As you all know, our call is the third of 5 back-to-back apartment calls today. So we will try to be brief in our prepared remarks and complete the call within an hour. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Good morning. Our teams produced another quarter that was all treats and no tricks. Strong employment growth across our markets continue to outpace the spooky multi-family supply. Dispositions are on track to deliver devilishly low AFFO cap rates, and our development pipeline is producing frighteningly high value creation. Apartment demand continues to exceed new deliveries, keeping rental rate growth above long term trends and occupancy high. Over the last 3 years, we have taken advantage of the historically tight spreads between lower -- newer and lower cap rate properties and -- CapEx properties, and older high-CapEx properties. We have sold nearly $1 billion in assets, average age 26 years old, and we have acquired about 1,300,000,000 of properties with an average age of 12 years. These transactions were completed at a positive spread to AFFO of 15 basis points. I'm not sure I've seen that kind of spread in my business career. This environment is pretty amazing when you can do that. We have quietly turned over 1/3 of our portfolio, improving the quality, the age, lowering CapEx and improving rent per door. The rent per door at the beginning of our capital recycling program in 2010 was $950 per door, and now, it's nearly $1,300 per door. 2/3 of the increase came from market improvements and 1/3 from capital recycling. We will continue our capital recycling to improve the quality of our portfolio going forward. Our portfolio is well positioned for continuing above trend growth for this foreseeable future. I'll turn the call over to Keith Oden, our President.
D. Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Our third quarter results were solid, and they were in line with our expectations. Comparing revenue growth to the third quarter to our original market-by-market rankings that we provided earlier this year shows a very high degree of correlation, and we expect to see more of the same through the end of the year. After 3 incredibly strong years of NOI growth, our operating teams are on track to deliver 4.9% same-store NOI growth, which represents a 65-basis-point beat to our original NOI guidance for the full year. Our same-store revenue growth remains strong, it's 4.6%, up slightly from 4.5% last quarter. Sequentially, revenues rose by 1.8% versus 1.6% in the second quarter. And our top performers for the quarter were Atlanta, up 8.7%; Austin, up 7.9%; Phoenix, up 7.6%; Denver, up 6.8%; and Houston, up 6.4%. D.C. metro managed to remain in positive territory at plus 1.2% revenue growth for the quarter versus 9/10 revenue growth year-to-date. During the third quarter, new leases were up 3.6% and renewals were up 6.8%, as compared to 1.3% and 6.6% for the third quarter of last year. October new leases were up 2% and renewals are up 7%, and that compares very favorably to last October, which had new leases up 2/10 of 1% and renewals up 5.5%. November, December renewals are being sent out between 5.5% and 6%. Our occupancy rate averaged 96.1% for the third quarter, up from 95.7% in the second quarter and 95.3% last year. We currently stand at 95.8% occupied, up slightly over our fourth quarter average of last year's 95.7%. Our net turnover percentage for the third quarter was 62.3%, which was well below the 69.5% rate from the prior year quarter. Fewer of our residents purchased homes during the quarter as move-outs to purchase homes fell to 13.9% versus 14.6% in the second quarter, and we continue to see move-outs to home purchases well below our historical average of 18%. Recent talk of loosening lending standards has caused concern of an increase in move-outs to purchase homes. It's something we'll continue to monitor closely. Our view is that nonfinancial reasons are a larger influence on the home purchase decision. Our residents' financial condition is as strong as it's ever been. Despite the average rental rate increase -- increases Ric described, the percentage of rent to household income declined again this quarter to 17.1%, which is as low as it's ever been in our portfolio. There's plenty of evidence that our key rental demographic of 25- to 34-year-olds are delaying their decision to get married and start families, a historically dominant reason to purchase a home. In year 5 of this recovery, the increased propensity to rent is feeling more secular than cyclical in nature. A big thank you to our entire Camden team for another excellent quarter. Now let's finish the year strong. Here's wishing everyone a happy, fun and most of all, safe Halloween. I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2014 of $98.7 million or $1.09 per share, representing an approximate $3 million or $0.03 per share outperformance to the midpoint of our prior guidance range. This outperformance resulted primarily from: $1.8 million of gain on sale of land; $750,000 in less-than-anticipated interest expense; and $450,000 in higher-than-anticipated property net operating income. The $750,000 positive variance for interest expense resulted primarily from the timing and interest rate of our $250 million, 3.5%, 10-year senior unsecured note that we closed on September 10, approximately 1 month later than we had anticipated. The $450,000 in higher-than-anticipated property net operating income resulted from higher rental revenues at both our same-store communities and our stabilized 2013 and 2014 acquisitions and development communities, which are not yet included in same-store results. Regarding our development pipeline. During the quarter, we reached stabilization at 2 joint venture communities: Camden South Capitol, a $78 million development in Washington, D.C.; and Camden Waterford Lakes, a $38 million development in Orlando, Florida. Also during the quarter, we began leasing at 2 wholly owned communities: Camden Boca Raton in Boca Raton, Florida; and Camden Foothills in Scottsdale, Arizona. And finally, during the third quarter, we completed and stabilized a 75-unit subsequent phase at our Camden Miramar student housing community in Corpus Christi, Texas. We are continuing the marketing process for approximately $300 million of wholly owned dispositions that we anticipate closing late this quarter. The pool is made up of 7 communities located in North Carolina, Florida, Georgia and Texas, with just under 3,000 total units. The average age of the portfolio is 29 years, and our whole period will be just over 17 years. Our anticipated disposition yield is in the high 5% range. But due to the capital-intensive nature of these older communities, their AFFO disposition yield should be just under 5%. This week, we completed the acquisition of Camden Fourth Ward, a $63 million, 276-unit community located in the Old Fourth Ward neighborhood of Atlanta's Midtown, downtown submarket. This community was completed in October 2014 and was purchased at approximately a 5% yield. Portfolio operating performance continues to be strong, as same-store revenues increased 4.6% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. These increases were driven primarily by increased rental rates and improved occupancy. Each of our markets registered positive sequential revenue growth in the third quarter. Occupancy for our same-store portfolio averaged 96.1% for the third quarter 2014, 80 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2013. As we had anticipated, this improved occupancy created additional pricing power in our peak leasing season. We are currently 95.8% occupied, which should result in higher-than-anticipated revenue in the fourth quarter. As a result, we have revised upwards and tightened our 2014 full year revenue and NOI guidance. We now anticipate full year 2014 same-store revenue growth to be between 4.4% and 4.6%, expense growth to be between 3.6% and 4%; and NOI growth to be between 4.75% and 5.05%. As compared to our prior guidance ranges, our revised revenue midpoint of 4.5% represents a 20 basis point improvement, and our revised NOI midpoint of 4.9% represents a 15-basis-point improvement. We are increasing our expense midpoint by 10 basis points as a result of higher-than-anticipated levels of self-insured employee health care charges. As a reminder, our expense growth comparisons continue to be challenging in the fourth quarter. We have also revised our full year 2014 FFO per share outlook. We now anticipate 2014 FFO per share to be in the range of $4.27 to $4.31 versus our prior range of $4.20 to $4.30, representing a $0.04 per share increase to the midpoint. The primarily components of this $0.04 per share increase are as follows: First, the $0.03 in outperformance recognized in the third quarter; and second, $0.01 in higher same-store NOI growth in the fourth quarter related to our increase in same-store guidance. Our revised full year 2014 FFO guidance is based on the following transactional assumptions for the fourth quarter: approximately $150 million in new on balance sheet development starts and approximately $300 million in additional dispositions with no additional acquisitions. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.08 to $1.12. The midpoint of $1.10 represents a $0.03 per share core increase from the third quarter of 2014 after excluding the third quarter gain on sale of land. This $0.03 per share core increase is primarily the result of the following: a $0.05 per share increase in FFO due to growth in property net operating income comprised of a $0.03 per share increase, resulting from an approximate 2% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, driven primarily by our normal third to fourth quarter seasonal decline in utility, repair maintenance, unit turnover and personnel expenses; a $0.02 per share increase resulting from NOI contribution from our 8 developments in lease-up; a $0.02 per share increase resulting from the normal third to fourth quarter seasonal increase in revenue from our Camden Miramar student housing community; and a $0.02 per share decrease due to our net acquisition and disposition activities as the contribution from our $63 million recently completed acquisition will be more than offset by the impact of the approximately $300 million of dispositions in the fourth quarter. This $0.05 per share increase in FFO resulting from growth in property and net operating income is being partially offset by a $0.02 per share decrease in FFO as a result of our third quarter capital markets activity. Regarding the Capital Markets, based on our 2014 estimated development spend plus debt maturities, we required approximately $535 million in new capital for the year. Net disposition activity is now anticipated to provide $235 million. Of the remaining $300 million needed, $250 million came from our third quarter 3.5% coupon bond transaction, and the remaining $50 million came from third quarter ATM activity. Of our 2014 capital needs, less than 10% has been funded year-to-date through ATM activity. Our current ATM program has $31 million in remaining availability and was filed under a shelf, which will expire on November 9. As a matter of corporate practice, we intend to keep an active ATM program on file. Therefore, we plan to add the remaining $31 million to a new ATM, which we'll file next week. At the end of the third quarter, we had no outstanding balances under our $500 million line of credit, and we had approximately $66 million of cash on hand. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the REIT sector, with debt-to-EBITDA in the mid 5x, a fixed charge expense coverage ratio of 5x, approximately 75% of our assets unencumbered; and 92% of our debt at fixed rates. At this time we'll open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes today from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wonder if you can touch on Houston and expectations going forward, especially if the price of oil remains below where we've seen it in the past.
Richard J. Campo: Absolutely. We definitely get -- been getting a lot of questions about that. And I think it's interesting, the energy executives that I talked to, and I talk to them a lot, the -- their view is that it's actually a good thing for now, because what was happening was the industry was just white hot, and people were getting out of control, sort of a bubble, if you will, in the shale plays and what have you. If you think about Houston specifically, beginning of the year, 2014, most folks thought we would have 70,000, 75,000 jobs and that would be a -- that was a decline from the previous year, which was several hundred thousand. And just to put in perspective, Houston has had 100,000 jobs a year for the last 4 years running. The year-over-year numbers for September were 119,000 jobs created in Houston. And in Texas in general, over 50% of all the jobs created since the downturn have been created in Texas, not necessarily because of high oil prices, but just because of great business environment, all the things that create jobs, low taxes, great work environment, that kind of thing. So when you think about oil prices today, what it will do is, it will shake out the highly leveraged smaller companies. But the big companies like Chevron and Exxon and others are sort of rethinking their development plans for 2015, but they're not -- it's not a big sort of a knee-jerk reaction. So on the one hand, the white-hot oil business will probably slow. On the other hand, that's good. What we have going on in Texas is a shortage of workers, massive traffic issues, and so that's putting pressure on all of the workforce from a construction perspective and even within our corporate ranks. Low oil prices aren't necessarily bad for Texas, and especially Houston in the Gulf Coast, primarily because of the petrochemical business. Because obviously, lower oil prices, or I mean, lower feedstock prices for the petrochemical business. There's over $10 billion of petrochemical plants under construction along the Gulf Coast right now, and a lower feedstock means that their profit margins expand. When you look at lower energy costs overall for the country and for Texas included, I read a report this week that said there was $129 billion of excess cash for people to spend at Christmas this year, because of oil -- of gas prices being under $3 a gallon. So on the one hand, they may not drill as much. But on the other hand, the benefits from low energy cost both in the manufacturing area and in the petrochemical business is a boom for those businesses. So we don't think it's going to be a major hit or anything like that. And the oil pricing, it's very different than it was in the past, probably in the '80s they used to talk about oil -- the price of oil being a huge contributor to employment. Here, it's just a different animal today, because of all the sort of benefits that low oil prices create for consumers and for the petrochemical business. I think Chevron actually announced their earnings this morning and they beat the Street. Most people thought they were going to be below because of oil prices. And they -- and I believe Exxon Mobil also reported this morning, have the same beat, and they beat because of their downstream businesses and they are refining in their petrochemical businesses while their sale of crude went down. There -- it was more than offset by the increase in their downstream production.
Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then I guess, I recognized it was a modest amount. But what are your thoughts around issuing ATM equity below consensus NAV versus using the other capital sources?
Richard J. Campo: Well, the -- so we announced at the beginning of the year that we had a $500 million worth of, plus or minus of capital requirements. And when you look at the components of that capital, it was $0.25 billion in bonds, $200 million of dispositions net, and then $50 million of ATM. And when you look at the component of the capital, we look at our weighted average cost of capital based on our sort of model balance sheet. And when you look at the weighted average cost of capital and you include a small portion of common stock into that weighted average capital -- cost of capital, it doesn't change it very much as long as you're using a small portion of it. And when we're making investments that have 200 to 300 basis point positive spreads to our weighted average cost of capital, we look at it as a reasonable thing to do as long as it's not a huge portion of the capital pie.
Operator: The next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Alex, I just wanted to clarify on the FFO guidance. Did that already include the land sale gain?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: The FFO guidance for the fourth quarter or the third quarter?
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: The third quarter and year-end.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Yes. So the year end guidance that I just gave includes the land sale gain that occurred in the third quarter.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: But was that anticipated?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: No, it was not anticipated. No, it was not. And so when we walk -- when I walk through the components of the beat, that was the first component, which was the $1.8 million positive from the gain on sale of land, which was not in the original third quarter guidance.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. And then I'm just -- I was wondering if you can comment on Washington, D.C. It looks like it's showing a bit of improvement maybe for your properties specifically.
Richard J. Campo: Yes. I think most people have continued to report negative revenue growth in D.C. And we've been able to kind of hang on to this very modest amount of growth, 1.2% for the quarter. We're up right at 1% for the year. And we were basically up a tiny amount last year. I think most of the people's numbers have been quite a bit more negative than that. And a lot of it has to do with the composition of our portfolio. We have a good mix of assets both in the district and then in the outlying suburban areas that have held up a little bit better. They're exposed to a little bit less of the new supply competition. So while it's -- the bottom line is it continues to be the worst-performing market in our portfolio for 2014, which it also was in 2013. We hope -- that we hope that, that shifts in 2015. But we're in the middle of doing our sort of bottom-up budget roll ups, and we'll see where that comes out. But yes, I think our teams have done a great job of managing to maintain some positive revenue growth in what has been a very difficult environment.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Two questions. First, on occupancy. I think historically, you guys have been sort of in the 94 to 95 range. And now, you're just over 96%. So is this sort of the new Camden? And going forward, we should expect that you guys are going to try do like the 96 to 97 the way Essex does? Or do you think that it will go back to the 94 to 95?
Richard J. Campo: Alex, this is certainly not a new, any shift -- particular shift in our strategy to operate at a much higher occupancy. I think over the long term, you can still expect us to see -- see us operate around the 95% mark and maybe slightly above that. The one thing that we specifically did that has helped our occupancy rate in the third quarter, and it looks like it's going to continue into the fourth quarter, where it showed up in our metrics was in the turnover rate. So the turnover rate for the third quarter was actually down about 6% from what it had -- where it was at this time last year. And that was a specific initiative that we undertook to take some of the pressure off the renewal increases. We did things like capping the renewal increases at a 15% maximum and some other things. But all of that combined to lower the turnover -- our turnover rate for the quarter. And obviously, that kind of flows through naturally to your occupancy rate. But it's not a shift in strategy. It's just more of a shift in tactics, given where we were last year at this time. We were operating at pretty high occupancies then as well. So I think it's -- from our perspective, it just sets us up pretty well going in to the fourth quarter, which is historically our weakest traffic quarter. And we want to -- just wanted to maintain as much cushion as we could.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then second question, and maybe this fits with Halloween and scary ghoulish thoughts. Ric, you're the sort of resident real land [ph] expert on Fannie Freddie. So last time we had 3% down payments, it didn't end well. Now, for some reason, I think that it's going to work better this time. So, one, your thoughts on -- do Fannie Freddie really believe or does Watt really think that this is going to work differently? And two, given the torture that the banks have gone through in getting completely hosed this past go around, why would banks participate in this next go around?
Richard J. Campo: Well, I think that clearly, they're trying to stimulate housing. And I actually think that's a good thing for the economy overall. And I know people generally think that multi-family does -- don't like single-family and they don't want their people to move out. But actually, I would rather see a robust housing market that has 1 million single-family houses built a year and go back to a more normalized housing market, because you don't have that today. I mean, we're not building the same kind of housing stock, and we actually have shortages of single-family homes in a lot of markets. So -- and that's creating what some people worry about as a bubble in prices. With that said, I don't think the 3% down was the real problem last time. The real problem was liar loans. It was people who didn't -- they didn't ask whether they had credit. And a lot of those -- and if you think about Freddie and Fannie, they -- Freddie and Fannie had a fair amount of that, and they bought a lot of CMBS that was like that as well. And with that said, the banks today are -- all they're doing, when you think about single-family conforming loan, is they are doing exactly what Freddie and Fannie want, they're checking all of the boxes, they're not holding any of the mortgages on their own balance sheet. They're just packaging them and selling them off to Freddie and Fannie. So I don't think it's going to have a material impact. I think we just need to get back to a more normalized housing market. We don't think it's going to have a huge impact on move-out rates. And if it did, and we went from the low rates we have now to 18% plus or minus, which is our historical average, we would have more job growth, we would have people buying furniture and things for the houses, and we would have more people walk in the door of our apartment projects looking to lease as opposed to walking out the door. So I'm for helping the housing market get more stability in it and get back to its normal job creation, which is like 1 in 7 jobs are created because of housing. And right now, that leg of the stool for the economy has just not been working.
Operator: The next question is from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Keith, the assertion that you made earlier that move-out to buy is generally dictated by lifestyle rather than financial reasons makes a lot of sense. But how is your portfolio positioned? For example, how -- what share of married couples make up your portfolio today relative to the long-term average?
D. Keith Oden: We think it's less than 1/3 are married couples in our portfolio. We can get you the exact number, but it's certainly not anywhere close to even a majority.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. We'll follow up on that. And last quarter, you suggested that you were under discussions with your joint venture partner thinking about restructuring that relationship. Can you update us on that?
D. Keith Oden: Sure, we are -- those discussions are ongoing. It has taken longer than we thought it would. But the -- our partner has been -- they've been busy beavers for the last 2 quarters. And we've been mindful of that and respectful of that. But we are -- we start -- we are having ongoing discussions, and I hope to be able to update you by the end of the year.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And last question for Alex is just on the unsecured maturity coming up, I believe, in the second quarter of next year. Where could you price tenure money today?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Yes. So we probably could price a deal pretty close to what we just did, sort of call it 3.5% to 3.6%. What's happened is that treasuries have rallied, but spreads have actually gapped out at a comparable level.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: One market specific theme this earning season has been Southern California improvements. Wonder if you can comment on what you're seeing there?
D. Keith Oden: Southern California is performing really right in line with our expectations, Rich. It was not -- it wasn't projected to be at the top, even in the top half of our markets for the year. But it's performing as expected. So relative to our budgets in Southern California, we're basically right online with revenues. Not gangbusters, but we are seeing improvement.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. When you were talking about something -- some mention about a 10% cap on rent renewals to maintain or to reduce turnover. Is that what was said?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, it was 15%. And then we just within our revenue management system. If you go back to last year, we did not have that policy in place. And we literally were seeing renewals as high as the low 20s. And we did a lot of math and study around the behavior, and discovered that there's sort of a magic point at which people will almost no matter where that increase puts them relative to market, above which they just move out. And so we think that breakpoint is somewhere around 15%, and we capped renewals at that. And that's been the biggest single difference that we can identify to our renewal rate in the third quarter versus last year.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Boy, you're not going to get any Christmas cards for that.
D. Keith Oden: Rich, remember it depends on -- what they tell me is their lease rate was way below market for the prior year.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then a lot of talk about the reasons for move-out. And an issue that I brought up a few quarters ago was reasons for move-in. Do you guys track that? And if you do, is there anything interesting that's changing there?
D. Keith Oden: We -- to my knowledge, we've never asked -- other than anecdotally with our -- as part of our sales process asking people why are you moving -- why are you leaving your other place. But we don't -- we've got a lot of anecdotal evidence, but nothing that would be statistically provable as to why people move into our apartments. I -- my guess is, it's the inverse of why we lose people, which is it's a job transfer or a -- or moving closer to work.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Talk just a little bit about the yield on the current pipeline there just given that you moved your revenue forecast up for the quarter. And then also as you think about additional starts, where should we be expecting yields on new commencements there, particularly in the fourth quarter?
Richard J. Campo: So our current development pipeline is yielding just over a 7% yield. And our pipeline, the foreseeable pipeline, we think, is going to be somewhere in the $250 million to $350 million per year range. And we're still sort of hovering high 6, low 7.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So those types of returns are still sustainable on the development basis?
Richard J. Campo: They are on our pipeline. I would say that anything new in the pipeline is less than that because of land price and construction costs. And we are still seeing pressure on construction costs. But we have locked in some very attractive land prices in our portfolio that we have in the pipeline for the next couple of years.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then just my follow-up question. Can you just talk a little bit about supply. I mean, we've seen supply, it seems like it was pushed out a little bit more to '15 there. Just curious as to what your expectations are for supply in '15? And what you think the impact could be just going forward here?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, Michael, there's no question that the -- if you go back and look at where we thought deliveries and completions would be, we've probably moved the entire pipeline in our markets back probably 3 to 6 months. And that's strictly a function of the inability of people to get enough labor on their jobs to stay on budget. It certainly affected our -- a couple of our direct communities, and I know it's affecting our competitors probably much worse than it is us, because they don't have the depth of relationships with their subcontractors that we've had in these markets that we've been building in. So yes, we're -- we are -- so if you think about -- we have said and still continue to believe that the peak for starts will -- you'll look back and say the peak was still in 2014. We believe that the peak for completions will be late in '15. So we're -- a lot of the wood to chop on the supply side is still in front of us. But it's uneven as it always is. Some markets are going to be more impacted than others, and we'll just have to slug our way through it in 2015.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: Well, we appreciate you being on the call today, and have a happy and safe Halloween. We'll see you at NAREIT next week. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan. Please go ahead.
Kimberly A. Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete second quarter 2014 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for one hour. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Good morning. Our teams turned in an outstanding quarter again. Based on our first half performance and an improved outlook for the second half of the year, regarding our original guidance for the full year, we expect to, as Michael Jackson sings, just beat it. We have raised our 2014 full year same-store net operating income estimates by 50 basis points from 4.25% to a revised midpoint of 4.75%. The change in guidance is driven by stronger revenue growth in most of our markets. Demand for apartments in our markets continue to be greater than the new supply that's been delivered this year. We expect this to continue for the next several years, keeping the supply boogie man in check. New apartment deliveries are likely to peak late this year or early in 2015. Population growth and job growth in our markets continue to outpace the nation. Jobs are estimated to grow by 2.8% this year in Camden's market compared -- markets compared to 1.7% for the U.S. overall and 2% for the coastal markets. It continues to be a very good time to be in the apartment business. Our development properties continue to lease up at or better than expected, creating value for our shareholders. In the current apartment transaction market, our development pipeline should add $4 per share to our net asset value when completed. I want to give a big shout out to our Camden teams for their continued focus on delivering living excellence to our customers. Keith -- we're going to go ahead and turn the call over to Keith now.
D. Keith Oden: As Ric mentioned, our operating conditions across our portfolio remain quite strong. Our operating teams continue to outperform their markets and our expectations. Our same-store revenue growth for the second quarter was 4.5% and was up 1.6% sequentially. 10 of our markets had 5% or better revenue growth with the top 5 markets, Atlanta at 8.1%; Corpus Christi at 7.5%; Denver, up 7%; Houston, up 5.8%; and Austin, up 5.7%. D.C. continued to be our weakest market, but still managed a 0.9% year-over-year as well sequential revenue growth. Our new leases for the second quarter were up 3.6% and renewals were up 6.2%. For July, new leases were up 3.1% and renewals were up 6.6%. August and September renewal offers went out at roughly 7.5%, and we're renewing leases in the 6.25% range. Our same-store occupancy rate averaged 95.7% for the second quarter, up slightly from 95.6% in the first quarter. Our net turnover rate was 58% in the second quarter, down from 60% for the same period last year, year-to-date. Net turnover rate year-to-date was 53%, the same as last year. Move-outs to purchase new homes remain historically low across our entire portfolio at 14.6% for the quarter, which was slightly up from the first quarter rate of 13.7%, but the same as we had in the second quarter of last year. Over the past few years, we've focused our efforts on improving the quality of our traffic and ensuring that we are buying only the traffic we need to maintain occupancy and drive rents. In addition, our in-house contact center, which we established in 2009, allows us to maximize the conversion rate of the traffic that we do generate. Last year, we began operating our contact center 24/7. Our contact center is staffed by 32 full-time professionals, 85% of whom have a college or advanced degree. Our platform allows our agents to upsell, as well as cross-sell across all Camden communities, which is extremely important because many times we have multiple communities in the same submarket. We can also record and review all calls, whether they're handled by on-site teams or our contact center agents, which is a great tool for ensuring accuracy and improving technique. In the first 7 months of the year, the contact center took 209,000 calls and answered 60,000 e-mails. Through July, the contact center created 82,000 guest cards and converted 52% of those into on-site appointments, all of which were subsequently confirmed by the contact center. They also handled 25,000 emergency maintenance requests. If you ever find yourself longing for a great customer service experience, call any Camden community and inquire about leasing an apartment. If our outstanding on-site team members are busy helping others or if it's after hours, after 2 rings, you'll get our contact center and experience truly outstanding customer service. But be forewarned, there's a 52% chance that you'll end up with an appointment to visit a Camden community. Having Camden team members handle our customers in a professional, consistent manner has been a game-changer in our continuing quest to provide living excellence to our residents. We are continuing our discussions with our joint venture partner regarding a possible restructure of our partnership. Pending the outcome of these discussions, we have delayed marketing the JV assets, which were assumed to be sold in 2014, and as a result, we removed the 2014 joint venture dispositions from our 2014 guidance. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the second quarter of 2014 of $94.2 million or $1.05 per diluted share. Included in our results for the quarter were 2 nonrecurring items resulting in a net positive impact of $300,000. First, we sold 4.7 acres of land adjacent to our 904-unit Camden Farmers Market community in Dallas, Texas for 80 -- for $8.3 million, recognizing a gain of $1.4 million. And second, based upon a pending sales contract, we recognized a $1.2 million impairment on 2.4 acres of additional land, also located adjacent to our Camden Farmers Market community. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the sale of this parcel to a for-sale townhome developer, recognizing no gain or loss from the newly impaired value. Regarding our development pipeline. During the quarter, we completed construction at Camden NoMa, a $101 million community in Washington D.C. This community is currently 75% leased. Average rents are in line with our budget, while leased percentage is approximately 10% ahead of plan. We are currently at or above 95% leased at both of our joint venture development communities, Camden's South Capitol in Washington, D.C. and Camden Waterford Lakes in Orlando. And we recently began leasing at 5 new communities: Camden Flatirons in Denver, Colorado; Camden Lamar Heights and Camden La Frontera in Austin, Texas; Camden Paces in Atlanta, Georgia; and Camden Foothills in Scottsdale, Arizona. And finally, during the second quarter, we acquired 7.6 acres of land in Montgomery County, Maryland for $23.8 million for the future development of approximately 457 apartment homes. We have begun the marketing process for our $300 million of wholly owned dispositions that we are forecasting for the fourth quarter. The pool is made up of 7 communities located in North Carolina, Florida, Georgia and Texas with just under 3,000 total units. The average age of the portfolio is 29 years, and our hold period will be just be over 17 years. Our anticipated disposition yield is in the high 5% range. But due to the capital intensive nature of these older communities, their AFFO disposition yield is anticipated to be approximately 5%. Portfolio operating performance continues to be strong, as same-store revenues increased 4.5% in the second quarter and 4.6% year-to-date. These increases were driven primarily by increased rental rates and improved occupancy. Each of our markets registered positive sequential revenue growth in the second quarter. Occupancy for our same-store portfolio averaged 95.7% for the second quarter of 2014, 40 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2013. This improved occupancy creates additional pricing power as we head into our peak leasing season. Based upon our strong year-to-date operating performance and our expectation of continued outperformance for the remainder of the year, we have revised upwards and tightened our 2014 full year revenue and NOI guidance. We now anticipate full year 2014 same-store revenue growth to be between 4% and 4.6%, expense growth to be between 3.4% and 4% and NOI growth to be between 4.25% and 5.25%. As compared to our prior guidance ranges, our revised revenue midpoint of 4.3% represents a 30 basis point improvement. Our revised expense midpoint of 3.7% represents a 5 basis point improvement and our revised NOI midpoint of 4.75% represents a 50 basis point improvement. As a reminder, our expense growth comparisons become more challenging in the second half of 2014 as compared to the second half of 2013. Expenses for the second half of 2013 only grew at 2% on a year-over-year basis as compared to 4.1% for the first half of 2013. Property operating expenses continue to track in line with expectations. On Page 15 of our supplemental package, we provide a closer look at our same-store expense growth for the quarter and for year-to-date. On both the quarter-over-quarter and sequential basis, our largest increases come from salaries and benefits for on-site employees due to the timing of various employee benefit costs. And our largest decreases come from property insurance due to a successful policy renewal and lower claims under our self-insured retention. Regarding property taxes. The vast majority of our assessments are now in. And although many of our initial taxes assessments were higher than we had originally anticipated, we have been very successful with many of our protests and appeals. Last quarter, we told you that we expected property taxes to increase 7% on a year-over-year basis. At this time, we remain comfortable with that estimate. We have also revised our full year 2014 FFO per share outlook. We now anticipate 2014 FFO per share to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.30 versus our prior range of $4.10 to $4.30, representing a $0.05 per share increase to the midpoint. The primary components of this $0.05 per share increase are as follows: first, $0.025 in same-store outperformance as indicated by our 50 basis point increase to the midpoint of our full year 2014 same-store net operating income guidance. Part of this outperformance has already occurred year-to-date and we anticipate this outperformance to continue throughout the year; second, the $0.01 in net gains from land sales recognized in the first half of 2014; and third, an approximate $0.02 per share increase related to lower-than-anticipated joint venture dispositions. Our revised full year 2014 FFO guidance is based on the following assumptions for the remainder of the year: $300 million in wholly owned dispositions and $100 million in wholly owned acquisitions, both occurring in the fourth quarter, with acquisition yields in the low 5% range and disposition yields in the high 5% range; $133 million in new on-balance sheet development starts in the fourth quarter; and no further 2014 joint venture dispositions. Due to the timing of our discussions with our joint venture partner, we will likely not sell any more communities in 2014. Year-to-date, we have completed $66 million of joint venture dispositions. The midpoint of our original 2014 FFO per share guidance range assumes $450 million in joint venture dispositions during the year. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2014. We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.04 to $1.08. The midpoint of $1.06 represents a $0.01 increase from the second quarter of 2014. This $0.01 per share increase is primarily the result of the following: a $0.02 per share increase in FFO due to growth in property net operating income resulting from an approximate 1% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI as revenue growth from the combination of rental rate increases, higher occupancies and increases in fee income as we move into our peak leasing periods more than offsets our expected increase in property expenses due to the normal seasonal summer increase in utilities and repair and maintenance costs; and positive NOI contribution from our 6 developments and lease-up. These positive variances are being partially offset by a $0.005 decline in FFO as a result of the net $300,000 positive impact from landholdings recorded in the second quarter of 2014. Turning to the capital markets. On the last call, I told you that based on our estimated development spend in 2014, we anticipate needing approximately $500 million of new capital during the year. Net disposition activity is anticipated to provide $200 million. For the remaining $300 million needed, we anticipate utilizing the capital markets opportunistically. The final composition of our 2014 capital activity depends upon a variety of factors including capital market conditions at the time we go to market. Therefore, we do not intend to give specific items regarding the exact composition or timing of our capital markets activities. In the debt capital markets, we estimate that we could currently issue a 10-year unsecured bond at approximately 3.7%. At the end of the second quarter, we had $180 million outstanding under our line of credit and other short-term borrowings. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in REIT world with debt-to-EBITDA in the mid-5x, a total fixed charge expense coverage ratio of almost 5x, approximately 75% of our assets are unencumbered and 86% of our debt is at fixed rates. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Could you talk about what you're saying in terms of the volume of product on the transaction market today and if there's any large portfolios?
Richard J. Campo: Sure. The volume is pretty robust in most markets, and we have seen a few large portfolios lurking around or moderate-sized portfolios. It is a very robust transaction market, both on the sell and the buy side with a lot of properties getting multiple, multiple bids. So it's very robust.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then you mentioned supply. I'm wondering if you could walk through kind of your larger markets' relative expected supply in 2015 versus 2014 levels.
D. Keith Oden: Yes, so if -- we'll look at completions in 2015 versus 2014, and I'll just hit some of the larger markets and the highlights that -- so we'll start with Atlanta. In 2014, we project roughly 9,000 completions and that moves to 9,800 in 2015. Dallas moves from 13,000 in -- or excuse me, from 12,800 in '14 to 14,000 in '15. Houston, we show completions in '14 of about 16,000 units and flat again with roughly 16,000 apartments delivered in 2015. D.C. is the other one that I'll give you and then we can give you some of these other ones off-line if you're interested. 2014, we show deliveries of 11,000 apartments and that drops to about 9,400 in 2015. So it's a mixed bag overall, but I think you have to put all of that in the context of the kind of job growth that those markets are seeing. With the exception of Washington, D.C., every one of those other markets has sufficient employment growth, we think, that we'll end up still with net absorption in all those other markets relative to job growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Could you remind us where the development pipeline yields are sort of churning today as far as initial stabilized yields and how that compares to when you're underwriting developments?
Richard J. Campo: Sure, the developments are -- stabilized yields are trending at 7%, plus or minus. Lower in sort of California, higher in Florida, but on a portfolio average around 7%. And today, properties haven't been -- we've been on the land and we're underwriting today, the yields are definitely coming down because of the spread between construction costs are growing faster than revenue at this point. Now that's a real challenge in the market. I mean, the good news is I think when we talk about starts and slowing down at the end of this year and the beginning of next year, it really is a function of it's much harder to underwrite transactions today than it was given the current sort of peak land prices and construction cost increases.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then the 7% that you're thinking about today on the pipeline versus 1.5 years ago when you're starting on some of these, I mean, was -- were you also expecting 7%? Or it's gotten better than you expected?
Richard J. Campo: Well, it's interesting. 1.5 years ago, we were making -- we were developing higher than 7%, 7.5% and some of the early projects we developed, for example, in Houston were double-digit returns and some of the Florida properties were 8.5%, 9s. And early on in the cycle, it was just out-of-control good because people -- construction costs hadn't peaked and you had massive rental growth and people -- construction folks were sort of working for food in those days. So clearly, development trends -- development yields have trended down and they continue to trend down. But we sort of think at a stabilized 7% and maybe the next round is perhaps 6.5%. But you're still creating a tremendous amount of value when you look at the spread of -- today acquisitions, if you can get for the core markets and core urban locations, the spread is still pretty attractive from a development perspective, somewhere in the 150 to 200 basis point positive spread between acquisition and development costs -- or development yields.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then, Ric, just -- had a question on your thinking about possible M&A, buying maybe a larger sort of portfolio if it becomes available in the market in the Sunbelt for the next year. One, I'm wondering if you think your stocks has attracted enough currency to compete for a large portfolio, and again, I'm thinking I'm not a public company but a private portfolio. And two, what is your appetite to get larger, expand in markets that you're in, maybe buy some newer assets in bulk and -- but if you had to do it in a way that maybe might not be FFO or NAV accretive in year 1, but has some longer-term strategic benefits. I mean, how would you think about that? Is it kind of worth it? Or you're better off sitting back and let someone else buy it and maybe it shows that your portfolio is not priced right by the public markets?
Richard J. Campo: Sure. When you look at M&A in any case, I think higher stock prices, if you're going to use your currency to buy -- to fund an acquisition is obviously important when you think about the accretion dilution aspect of trying to have an accretive NAV transaction. So we, obviously, do lots of math on that and we have been opportunistic over the years buying big portfolios. We can do that. I think that when you get down to the size question, so I think we are a very good size. We're sort of a small large-cap and that means that our development activity is very accretive to NAV and you don't have to do billions and billions to move the needle. So on the one hand, we are big enough where we can buy products and supplies and compete effectively with anybody in the space and then -- and our stock is liquid, our bonds are -- spreads are very tight relative to our competitors. In terms of the quality issue, if you think about Camden's portfolio and the capital recycling we have done over the years, we have definitely moved our portfolio more urban. We've moved up our average rent per unit. We have improved the quality of the portfolio through selling older assets and either buying or developing newer assets and that's just a core competency we've been doing forever. I remember looking back at we moved our offices here last year and we had to kind of purge a lot of old papers, and I was looking back at some investor presentations we did in the '90s. We talked about what percentage of our portfolio was built in the '80s and now that was a positive thing, that we had a lot of '80s product. Today, we have very few '80s product. And so the idea of quality is important. So the question of whether we would -- when we look at large transactions, I think it has to be strategic and it has to really improve our -- the quality of our portfolio. And if we -- if the numbers work from a long-term perspective and improves our quality, then I think we'd be positively inclined to do something like that. As far as other markets, for 21 years we have been moving in and out of markets. And we like the markets we're in, we like them because they have the best job growth. And when you look over a long period of time, these markets that have pro business, pro growth, good weather, young population, they have the best job growth in the country. And yes, they do have ability to create supply and that's what actually drives the economy as well. Over the last 10 years, you haven't seen any of those markets get incredibly oversupplied. They get a little oversupplied from time-to-time, which slows the growth, but it's not terrible. And so we like our markets, and so I wouldn't really reach to get out of our markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Ric, let me just carry that a little bit further. If you look at the efficiencies that EQR has gotten out of the Archstone portfolio, is that change -- does that change your view as far as, if you think about M&A, the synergy potential beyond just simply looking at another P&L merging it in and then saying, we eliminate G&A, et cetera, that maybe there are a lot more synergies than meets the eye just simply by having that clusters of properties?
Richard J. Campo: I'm not sure it's clusters of properties, but I think, clearly, the synergies of G&A and things like that are clearly an area that we can improve on. When you look at our sort of G&A as a percentage of revenue or percentage of assets, we aren't as efficient as EQR, obviously, because of size. But when we look at any transaction, we look at the operational synergies as well. And oftentimes, what we find and when we've done large portfolios, we found that by putting sort of the Camden secret sauce on a property, we get better outcomes from net operating income growth. A good example would be when we bought the Verde portfolio. I mean, it was amazing the same-property NOI growth that we got just by putting in Camden systems. And so I do think that there's -- when you have -- when you look at any kind of transaction, a large transaction where you have the ability to improve operational activities, there -- that you have to look at that aspect of the business, for sure. It's going to be not only G&A, but operational and procedural changes that could, in fact, either have the NOI grow quicker and squeezing out those kind of efficiencies are definitely part of any deal.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. Because it just seems -- I mean, whether it's EQR or Essex, it does seems like there's getting to be a size where you get enough of a concentration and you sort of supercharge the synergies, which is maybe why it's more than, historically, the transactions you've done, maybe future transactions to the extent you're bulking up even more in the market. So it would almost seem like the same thing, that there are synergies beyond what any of us from the outside could model. That's why I'm curious if you think that the -- that it's changed.
Richard J. Campo: Yes, I think there is some validity to that issue, for sure.
D. Keith Oden: Alex, this is Keith. That the -- I think that in -- when we do acquisitions, in particular when we're buying something from the private market as opposed to merger at the public level, the improvements that we get from NOI from implementing the Camden platform, which is from revenue management to our cable program, all throughout the entire suite of things that we do at the property level, that private companies are just not positioned to do. They don't have the scale, they don't have the resources and they don't have the intellectual capacity in their organization to pull the stuff off. So I think that when we buy private assets, the operating synergies are relatively minor compared to the operating performance that we get out from those properties. So when you flip over that thought process and go to what about a public-to-public scenario, yes, there's always going to be G&A synergies in that. But the reality is that the public-to-public operators and there is, what, 11 of us left, if you're going to pencil out the top 15 multifamily operators in the country, every public company would be in the top 15. And so when you move away from that into the private companies, whether it's Verde or whether it's one-off operations that -- on assets that we acquire, the opportunities for just improvement at the site level of how we conduct our business, both customer service and the programs that we add value to and therefore get value from, far outweigh the relatively minor operating synergies that go with the combination. So I think it's -- in a private world, it's actually -- it actually becomes more meaningful for us, I guess, any kind of a public-to-public merger.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then the second question is, on condo activity, I mean, obviously, you can see what's happening in Miami or New York, but given that move-outs to homes are still low and land prices are escalating, as you commented on, are you seeing folks increasingly look to target that sort of upper income renter -- single renter to swap them into a condo? Are you seeing increased condo activity to go after that, sort of your renter demographic?
D. Keith Oden: We are not. We track move-outs to home purchases, which also includes for-sale condos and you can see the numbers that we've been reporting for the last 3 or 4 years. We're just still, from a historical standpoint, well below what we really should be if we had a robust recovery in the housing market from a homebuyer perspective so -- and actually, the whole condo phenomenon, Alex, outside of South Florida and New York with very limited stuff in California, it's just -- for-sale condos have not come back to be a meaningful part of the overall picture on the supply, and there are a lot of reasons for that, not the least of which the liability that comes with a condominium regime where it's a virtual certainty that at some time in the first 10 years, which is the statute of limitations, you're going to get sued as the condominium as the developer or if you're ever in the chain of title. It's just a fact of life and it is -- I think it has been a huge deterrent at the margins of people wanting to build condominiums. Now nothing's forever and that mindset may change. But I think, by and large, that's kind of what the state of play in the condominium business is today.
Operator: Our next question is from Derek Bower of ISI Group.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: With regards to revenue guidance for the year, can you provide what you're assuming in the second half on renewal rates as well as occupancy to achieve the midpoint?
D. Keith Oden: On revenues, we were at 5%, 4.5% for the first -- excuse me, 4.6% for the first half. Our guidance for the year is 4.3%. So that math would imply, what, 3.9%?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: 4%.
D. Keith Oden: 4%.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And just in terms of occupancy, your 95.7% for the quarter. Where is it today, I guess? And I guess, where do you see it ending by the end of the year?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, we're actually a little above 96% right now. The last report was 96.2%, which is historically high for us, although that is a last week -- that's a last week of the month trend, which is always -- throughout the course of a month, there's about a 30 to 40 basis point swing between first week and last week. So my guess is by this time when we report next week, we'll be back down below 96% but still trending in the high 95%. So that's clearly about what our original guidance was, and it's clearly above what our expectations were. My guess is that probably -- that occupancy rate probably moderates in Q3 and Q4, but I wouldn't be surprised from here to the end the year at something in the high 95s.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then could you also maybe provide some color on the various options that might be explored today with Texas Teachers? I imagine there are some assets in that fund that you guys would like to own outright.
D. Keith Oden: Well, actually, there's probably a lot of them we would like to own outright, but that's -- with regard to the status of our conversations, we're -- the original conversations were around the notion of just lengthening the partnership because we both recognize that these assets have -- that we've created a ton of value for the teachers of Texas. But more importantly, from a cash-on-cash return standpoint to the equity, we're at about an 11% cash-on-cash return and so that's a great state of affairs for us as well as Texas Teachers. And where we go from here is certainly the -- that's what we're discussing and we -- and when we get something more concrete, we'll be able to share that with you.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson of Mizuho.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Two questions on your 2 top markets, first, on D.C. At 16.5% of the portfolio, how do you feel about that? Are you willing to let it ride now that we're kind of maybe beyond the worst of it in that market? Or do you see that percentage coming down naturally over time?
Richard J. Campo: I love D.C. That's why we have a big concentration there. If you look at the mid-Atlantic in the D.C. region, it's one of the top -- the counties around D.C., I think, 2 or 3 counties around there have the highest net worth, the highest percentage of people with both graduate degrees and undergraduate degrees. I mean, it's -- the Mid-Atlantic is an awesome market long term. Obviously, the government has had some issues and a market has -- every market goes through its up and downs. But long term, I think it's an awesome market. The percentage that we own there probably comes down a little naturally just because we're developing in other cities and we're selling outfits in other cities. The interesting thing about D.C. is that there is really never sort of a great exit point in terms of pricing. So for example, asset prices really haven't changed much there in the sense that since people have been talking poorly about D.C. and it's definitely one of the lowest growth or negative growth markets out there for some companies, the value of the real estate continues to go up, not down and there aren't any bargains to go buy in D.C. or anything like that, which is kind of interesting. But for the -- I think investors generally think D.C. is a great long-term market.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Your story has always been like no market 10% or greater of NOI, though. I mean. . .
Richard J. Campo: Yes, but you look at D.C. and you have to bisect them -- you have to slice the market up out there.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then second, on Houston, I'm just curious what you think about the Super Bowl coming there in 2017. Do you think that has any kind of economic benefit to you, the business? Anything in particular on Houston on that issue, specifically? Or is it just too much of a onetime event?
Richard J. Campo: Oh, I think the Super Bowl is an indication of just the robust economy. And if you think about the Final Four is there in '16, the Super Bowl is in '17, the Super Bowl actually does create a lot of momentum and it's sort of this deadline for people, so for -- and especially for governments. When you start thinking about improving roads, improving mobility, improving sort of beautification of the city, getting projects jump-started so that they do get, in fact, finished before the Sup Bowl, there's a lot of inertia around that. And I can tell you that having been the Chairman of the 2017 Host Committee and Keith being the Vice Chairman of the Host Committee, we see that every day when I talk to people, to the mayor and to the county governments, they're all fast-forwarding projects which obviously help the economy to try to get things done by '17. I think the other thing that's sort of driving Houston when people think about Houston besides the Super Bowl is just that it's really coming into its own. I mean, when you look at some of the investor groups that are buying there now, AFIRE, the Association of Foreign Real Estate Investors (sic) [ Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate ], that control $2.5 trillion of capital that gets invested all over the world has Houston as the #4 city to invest in, in the world in 2014. And it's all related to the sort of the secular change in energy with frac-ing and Houston is the center of the universe for that business. And when you look at the cities above Houston that foreign investors are looking at, it'd be New York, London, San Francisco and Houston and that's the order. Last year, for example, in '13, Houston was #5 on that list. Prior to '13, Houston was maybe in the top 15, but below 10. So I think there's just this big change going on because of the fundamental changes that are going on in Texas with our new energy -- with the new sort of energy dynamic.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: And just as where the rubber meets the road from a REIT perspective, I mean, how much time do you think it'll take up, the whole Super Bowl thing, with you guys relative to the REIT?
Richard J. Campo: Well, the good news is, is that we have full-time staff that does it. So it's like any other civic job that I've done over the years, which is I'm really good at delegating. So the Chairman makes sure that you set the direction, you set of the budgets, you hire the right people and then you get out of the way and let them execute. So the Super Bowl is not going to take any time away from Keith and my running Camden that way we've always run Camden because I've always been involved in -- for the last 15 or 20 years, we've been involved in Super Bowl-like things in Houston and it's done okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Going back to your conversations with your JV partners, what are the range of possibilities as you see them now in terms of potential size?
D. Keith Oden: In terms of potential size?
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: How large would they like to be -- how much larger would they like to be in multifamily? And -- with you and what's your interest in...
D. Keith Oden: Yes, so they have a -- they do have an interest in increasing their allocation to real estate. You -- they get to play in all real estate sectors. They have a pretty decent bet in the multifamily sector at this point. They have indicated an interest in the conversations that we've had with them about increasing their exposure to multifamily and specifically with Camden. So they're a $110 billion, $115 billion pension fund and they have -- over the years, they've been increasing their allocation to real estate. So I think that, without putting a number on it, they do have an appetite for growth, both in real estate generally, in multifamily in particular. And like I say, as far as range of possibilities of outcomes, we're not far enough along in the process to even put a fence around those, but I would expect that we will get there in the next quarter.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. At the beginning of the year, you suggested that revenue-enhancing repositions could contribute 50 basis points to NOI growth. Now with the upward revision to your expectations, what contribution are you expecting from that activity?
D. Keith Oden: David, it's still in the range of 50 basis points. I mean, the upward guidance -- we independently look at what we're doing. The budgets that we have, the projected returns that we're getting on our pool of redevelopment assets and those are really unchanged on the year. We're still in the 11% range as far as return on incremental costs.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: And the last question is on Las Vegas, which appears to have finally outperformed the broader portfolio. Can you just talk about that market?
D. Keith Oden: Well, when we started out the year, I had Las Vegas as a C+ and improving. I think as I look back on it, maybe the C+ might have been a little bit light. It's clear that things are getting better in Las Vegas. All of the relevant metrics that drive the business out there, including getting back to job growth but also on the gaming side of things, have improved pretty materially. And you sort of -- things kind of run their course. All the folks that were going to leave have left. There's no new construction going on. Any incremental job growth kind of flows through to the bottom line and it's finally showing up in our results. So yes, it was good to see Las Vegas outperform the midpoint of the portfolio. And I think it's -- there's a pretty decent shot that that's going to continue into Q3 and Q4. So I think we sort of indicated that we believe that the bottom was some time in the third quarter or second, third quarter last year. I think looking back in the rearview mirror, that still feels about right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Ric, you talked about moving the portfolio more urban over the last several years there. Just as you look at the portfolio today, can you give us just an update -- there's been a lot made of urban versus suburban neighbors. Can you talk about what you're seeing across your portfolio today and kind of what you expect over the next 18 months?
Richard J. Campo: Sure. The urban side of the equation is... [Technical Difficulty]
D. Keith Oden: Mike, go ahead and restart -- your question was regarding urban and suburban and the direction that we're heading?
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Yes, just the noticeable trends that you're seeing in the portfolio today and then kind of what you expect to happen out over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months.
D. Keith Oden: Yes, so as you look at our portfolio and our development pipeline and without looking at assets and you can't look at accounts, you have to look at dollars invested, well, it's obviously within our $1 billion development pipeline, easily 3/4 of that would qualify as being "urban projects" and a lot of it has to do with just the scale of those communities. Our 2 assets in California that we have under construction, between the 2 of those, it's $200-plus million in both clearly urban mid-rise and high-rise products. So on a dollar -- from a dollar cost standpoint, it's in the 70% to 75% range of our current activity. That happens to be, right now, we believe, that there is a long-term trend towards more urbanization and people moving back into the urban core. In Houston right now, we have 2 relatively large communities in our development pipeline, both urban. But again, there's -- that's where people want to be and they're willing to pay the rent premium that goes -- that's associated with that. So I think that trend will continue across -- because of the nature of the markets that we operate in. But you're also still going to have the sweet spot for us, our transactions in Orlando and Tampa that are just traditional suburban closer in, but suburban, 3-story walk-up, surface-park communities. So the range of our product will be from the 3-story walk-up surface park. We'll continue to do the 4-story type wrap product that we've done very successfully. But in these larger cities in the urban core, you're really driven to, because of the premium on land cost, to go more vertical and that's -- we're going to continue to do that. And as you do that, the dollar costs associated with those investments goes up pretty significantly. So I mean, over time, yes, given the $1 billion that we have in play, once that's stabilized, that's going to be a meaningful impact on the overall mix of our assets. But it doesn't mean that we're less enamored with the returns that we're getting on our suburban products, which, by the way, are, in most cases, significantly higher as a going-in yield than what we're getting on our urban product.
Richard J. Campo: It's all about balance and being both geographically diverse and product diverse.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Across our portfolio today, though, are you seeing those urban -- is that urban portfolio still outperforming the suburban? Or have you seen a more improvement in the suburban portfolios relative to the urban as you're seeing supply come online?
D. Keith Oden: So on the year-to-date numbers, when we kind of look at urban-suburban, the suburban portfolio actually has an outperformance of 2 -- 20 basis points to the urban. So I mean, it's surrounding areas. They're both performing extremely well. One of the reasons for that is that as the new supply comes on, it will -- going -- as we go forward, it will more and more be concentrated in the urban core and there's just been less competition in the suburban market. So we -- in some cases, we've been the only game in town in suburban Florida, suburban Tampa. The 3 jobs that we have in Phoenix right now, one of those would qualify as urban, the other 2 would clearly be suburban. But there's virtually no competition for those jobs. And on a yield basis, because the costs are much less than the urban product, on a pro forma basis, we've got higher yields going in on those jobs.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just in terms of redevelopment, obviously you've got the 3-year plan kind of working through right now. As you think about the completion of that plan, is there a thought to roll out another plan across the portfolio and you see enough opportunity across the portfolio?
D. Keith Oden: We do have another group of assets that we've identified as kind of in the -- would be the Phase 4 of that program. But on a -- as a matter of scale, the first 3 phases were added up to about $220 million. The third -- the fourth group is probably closer to $30 million to $40 million. So in terms of scale, most of what we believe is appropriate for redevelopment will have been done -- 90% of it will have been done when we finish the first 3-year plan.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just wanted to go back to some of the numbers that you had provided for the 2014-2015 completions. It looks like about 48,800 units in the 4 markets you talked about in '14. Just curious, how many of those have already delivered and how many are pending in '14? And then we've heard from a couple different folks that it seems like some of the '14 completions slipped into '15. I'm just curious if that's also what you're seeing.
D. Keith Oden: Yes, so I think that the -- in terms of what's been delivered to date versus what's pending, I don't have the details of that. We can get you that. But I will tell you that the anecdotal evidence would suggest that if someone, at the beginning of the year, said that they were going to have a delivery in Austin or Houston or even South Florida, if they believe that they were going to have a delivery in the November-December time frame, it's probably not going to happen till 2015. The reality is that because of the shortage of workers and skilled laborers in these markets, it's -- you've got fewer people than you would like to have on your jobs, it's a catfight to get subcontractors to fully staff at your jobs. And the result of that is it's just taking longer. We've had good experience on -- where we've been able to move up the stabilization dates, it's because our lease-ups are going faster, not because the construction is going faster. It is a -- it's a -- it's hand-to-hand combat. And if it's hand-to-hand combat for a company like Camden that's been doing this for 30 years and has an incredibly stellar reputation with all of our subcontractors, I can only imagine what it's like if somebody kind of doing a one-off or 2-off deal that doesn't have the kind of capacity and the track record that we have.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. I mean, do you think that some of those delays that are happening here is benefiting you in terms of the outlook versus the original? And how much of it is do you think is coming from maybe stronger job growth than you had previously anticipated?
Richard J. Campo: I think -- I really think that it's job growth and not delays. I mean, there's plenty of supply that's coming to the market in all of our markets. But when you look at the kind of job growth that we're getting, especially when you see most of our portfolio has better than 5:1 job-to-completion ratios, that's what's really driving the market. It's not delays in construction and all of a sudden you're going to have a bunch of product come in and hurt the market. It's jobs that are helping. Also when you have to -- when you think about the nature of the jobs, the 34 and younger cohort, the millennials, those folks are getting more than half the jobs. They've got more than half the jobs in the last 8.5 million jobs that we've -- that have been created. And so the demographics are really interesting because when you put the jobs on and then you start thinking about who's getting the jobs and thinking about what that demographic does, the millennials are late to marry, late to have kids, not buying houses. Even the housing market, for the starter homes, continues to be very difficult where the market is actually reasonable and the housing market is to move upmarket in the very high end of the market. That first-time buyer has a hard time getting a loan and a lot of them don't want to get a loan. A lot of our Sunbelt markets like Houston, Dallas and others are -- just gets to that urbanization, sort of the urban product question, they're becoming more urbanized. Just to give you a sense, we did a study on the sort of different age groups and where they live and where they work in Houston. And people who work downtown, for example, in the urban core in the Greenway kind of inside the loop area, if you look at millennials, 68% of millennials live within 9 miles of their work in the downtown area. The same number of 50- to 59-year olds, they live within 20 -- say, over 30 miles from their workplace. So what's happening is the older people are -- and then when you get actually 60, they start coming back into the city. It's just sort of interesting. So the demographics are pushing for this, the higher absorption rates and the higher demand that we've been seeing pushed by the jobs, but also by the demographics that are very, very strong for this business.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: We appreciate you being on the call today, and I'm sure we'll see a lot of you when the September, after Labor Day, conference season starts. So thank you very much, and we'll talk to you later.
Operator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan. Please go ahead.
Kimberly A. Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2014 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. Since we are one of the last multifamily companies to report, and our numbers are pretty straightforward, we'll keep our prepared remarks to a minimum today. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Thanks, Kim. AC/DC reminds us that it's a long way to the top, which is certainly how it felt in 2010 when Keith and I were telling anyone who had listened that 2011, '12 and '13 were going to be the best years -- best 3 years of our net operating income growth in Camden's history. As always, our Camden team delivered on that promise and made us look smart. Camden had the highest net operating income growth in the multifamily sector over the last 3 years, and we're on track to have another great year in 2014. Our geographic and product diversification has served us well. Washington, D.C., which led the recovery markets out of the recession, has slowed, and our growth has come from other markets, including Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte, Austin and Phoenix, with net operating income growth above 6%. Our markets continue to produce outsized job growth, keeping development leasing robust and the threat of oversupply, not an issue. We expect the next several years to continue to produce above long-term trend revenue and net operating growth for Camden. I'd like to turn the call over now to Keith Oden.
D. Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. We're off to another solid start this year. Although our NOI growth rate has certainly moderated from the extraordinary levels of the last 3 years, from a historical perspective, our growth rate's still very strong. All of the data that we review with our on-site teams continue to indicate that 2014 is going to be a very good year in Camden's markets. For the first quarter, same-store average rents on new leases were up 1.8%, and renewals were up 6.8%, and that compares to 1.5% on new leases and 6.7% on renewals last year. For April, new leases were up 2.7%, renewals up 6.5%, and again, that compares to 3.3% and 6.7% last year. So if you take all that together, it still looks like our initial guidance is going to be where we need to be for the year. Same-store revenue growth was 4.7% for the first quarter of '14, and that was up 0.6% sequentially. 10 of our top -- of our markets had revenue growth of 5.5% or higher, and the top 5 markets this year are the -- for the quarter in revenue growth were Atlanta at 7.3%; Corpus Christi, 7.1%; Charlotte, 6.7%; and Houston and Austin, both at 6.5%. Washington, D.C. was the outlier, but still positive at 0.7% revenue growth. Our other 5 markets were in the 3% to 5% range. Overall, our same-store portfolio averaged 95.6% occupancy for the first quarter. We stood at 95.6% for April, and we currently still stand at 95.6%, which leaves us very well positioned as we head into our peak leasing season. Our occupancy rate for the first quarter was roughly 30 basis points higher than planned, which was the main component of our outperformance in revenues. Our budget contemplated rising occupancy rates into the second and third quarters, so the occupancy-related gain in revenue is not likely to recur in future quarters. Qualified traffic remains strong across all of our markets, and despite our aggressive renewal rate increases, our net turnover rate was 48%, compared to 47% in Q1 of last year. Our residents' financial health continues to improve, and our current average rent as a percentage of household income is 17.2%, and that's down from 17.7% this time last year. 13.7% of our residents moved out to purchase homes in the quarter, and that compares to 12.3% for all of last year, but down from 15.5% in the fourth quarter, as we saw a spike in move-outs to purchase homes. All of this is still well below our long-term average of roughly 18% of residents moving out to purchased homes. Now I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2014 of $94.8 million, or $1.05 per diluted share. These results represent a $1.3 million, or $0.01 per share improvement from the $1.04 midpoint of our guidance range, and a 9% increase from the first quarter of 2013. This $0.01 per share positive variance primarily resulted from $600,000 in better-than-expected operating performance from our communities; $350,000 due to the timing of corporate expenses; and a $350,000 gain on the sale of 3 acres of land adjacent to our Paces development in Atlanta. The sale of this outparcel was part of the original development plan for the site. The $600,000 better-than-expected performance from our communities is the result of the following: property revenues from our consolidated communities exceeded our forecast by $1.1 million, due primarily to the combination of slightly higher average rental rates and occupancy, lower bad debt expense and higher fee income. Property expenses from our consolidated communities came in approximately $500,000 worse than our expectations, resulting almost entirely from increased insurance costs at one of our non-same-store communities, which sustained damages during the recent earthquake in Southern California. At our same-store communities, property operating expenses were slightly positive to plan, due to lower repair and maintenance expenses resulting from lower-than-expected unit turnover rates, and the movement of certain expensed exterior projects from the first quarter to the second quarter. In the first quarter 2014, same-store net operating income increased 6.3% as compared to the first quarter of 2013. These results were approximately 110 basis points ahead of plan, with revenues increasing 4.7%, approximately 50 basis points ahead of plan, and same-store operating expenses increasing 2.1%, approximately 20 basis points better than plan. On Page 14 of our supplemental package, we provide a closer look at our same-store expense growth for the quarter. On both the quarter-over-quarter and sequential basis, our largest increases come from property taxes, which make up approximately 30% of our total operating expenses. Last quarter, we told you that we expected property taxes to increase 7% on a year-over-year basis. At this time, we are still comfortable with that estimate. Also on Page 14 of our supplemental package, you'll note that same-store property insurance decreased by 14.6% as compared to the first quarter 2013. This is primarily the result of higher-than-usual same-store insurance expense in the first quarter 2013 relating to prior year hailstorm damages. One last thing on our first quarter results. I'm sure many of you noticed the large sequential increase in Phoenix same-store operating expenses this quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, one of our Phoenix communities received a very favorable property tax refund in the fourth quarter of 2013, driving this unusual comparison. Although we are encouraged by our first quarter results, we are maintaining our full year same-store guidance ranges, with net operating income between 3.25% to 5.25%, driven by revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5%, and expense growth of 3.25% to 4.25%. As a reminder, our expense growth comparisons become more challenging in the latter part of 2014. Last night, we also affirmed our prior full year 2014 FFO guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share, and provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2014. We expect FFO per share for the second quarter to be within the range of $1.02 to $1.06. The midpoint of $1.04 represents a $0.01 decrease from the first quarter of 2014. This $0.01 per share decrease is primarily the result of the following: a $0.015 per share increase in FFO due to growth in property net operating income as a result of an approximate 1% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, as revenue growth from the combination of rental rate increases and increases in fee income as we move into our peak leasing periods more than offsets our expected increase in property expenses due to the normal seasonal summer increase in utilities and repair and maintenance costs. The NOI contributions from our non-same-store communities will be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, as the additional NOI contribution from our one community and lease-up and the positive sequential impact from the first quarter earthquake-related insurance expense at our non-same-store California community, is being offset by revenue lost at our lone student housing community in Corpus Christi, Texas. Occupancy declined significantly in May through August of this community. The growth in our property net operating income is being offset by: a $0.01 per share decrease in FFO due to lower net fee and asset management income, resulting from lower levels of third-party and joint venture construction and development activities; a $0.01 per share decrease in FFO due to higher general and administrative expenses resulting from delayed first quarter corporate overhead expenses, and the timing of our annual trust manager grants; and $0.005 decline in FFO as a result of the $350,000 in landfill gains recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Turning to the capital markets. On the last call, I told you that based on our estimated development spend in 2014, we anticipate needing approximately $500 million of new capital during the year. Net disposition activity is anticipated to provide $200 million. For the remaining $300 million needed, we anticipate utilizing the capital markets opportunistically. The composition of our 2014 capital activity depends upon a variety of factors, including capital market conditions at the time we go to market. Although we do not intend to enter the capital markets in the immediate term, we believe that we could currently issue a 10-year unsecured bond at 3.75%, based on a 2.6% Treasury and a spread of 115 basis points; a 7-year unsecured bond at 3.2% based on a 2.2% Treasury and a spread of 100 basis points; and a 5-year unsecured bond at 2.4% based, on a 1.65% Treasury and a spread of 75 basis points. Unsecured 5-year term loan pricing for us would be LIBOR plus 105 basis points. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $425 million of availability under our $500 million unsecured line of credit. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk about the decision to reposition and backfill the development pipeline. Why sell the land in Atlanta, and what was attractive about the acquired land in Houston, Maryland?
Richard J. Campo: Well, the land in Atlanta was always part of a development plan, it was an outparcel, and we always planned on selling it. It's a great retail site, so it really enhances the value of the multifamily, when you have serviceable retail in front of it. And so that, that was the reason for that. And then in terms of development pipeline, we added 2 downtown Houston blocks. There's Renaissance going on in downtown Houston, where the city is incenting developers to build downtown, and there's really sort of a urbanization that's been going on across the country for the last 10 years has finally caught up in downtown Houston, and we think it's a very reasonable and profitable way to play in that. And then the project in Maryland, we have been working on for a long time. We -- it's been under contract for a couple of years, and we've been going through the entitlement process. And I think if you think about our development pipeline, with everything that's going on at this point, we need to continue to fill our pipeline for the future. Otherwise, we think it's an important part of our business.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Then in terms of the remaining $300 million in capital markets, where does equity fit into that? And would you issue equity below consensus NAV?
Richard J. Campo: Well, we have always been focused on making sure that we take advantage of capital markets as they manifest. And it doesn't make a lot of sense to us to sell equity below what we think our NAV is, and it makes sense to sell assets instead of equity. But if our average cap rate that we can sell assets at is higher than our -- than the average cap rate on our stock, we issue stock. And so at this point, we are not in that mode, but when the stock price is high and has an average cap rate that is lower than our -- than we can dispose of, then we issue stock. We're not there yet though, obviously.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Schaffer at Sandler O'Neill.
Andrew Schaffer: In your markets, have you seen strong growth as Texas -- Is there a disparity in growth between asset classes? And are you seeing your lower price point assets accelerating and driving growth?
Richard J. Campo: We have not seen a big differential between A and B properties in Texas, and I think it's primarily because the supply -- generally, when you see B is doing better than A is, when there's pressure on the supply side of the A, and then people really don't have an alternative in the B. But we have not seen any pressure on the supply side of the equation in Texas right now, because of the buoyant job growth that is -- that Texas has enjoyed. Ultimately, you might see a differentiation between A and B, and we just haven't seen it yet, and that's why we keep a product diversification in our portfolio, so we have some A and some B. And today, we don't see much differentiation.
Andrew Schaffer: And does the same apply for Atlanta?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, across our portfolio, we just don't think we're in a position yet, as Ric talked about, when you get supply pressure at -- coming from new development. If you don't have the job growth to soak that up, then merchant builders tend to get very antsy and aggressive with their pricing. And prices come under pressure, at the A end of the market and not so much of the B end of the market. But across our portfolio, we've not seen that. The only market where you have an imbalance right now is in Washington, D.C. And even in D.C., our -- the makeup of our assets is -- footprint's a little bit different than most of our competitors, and we just haven't seen the differentiation, even in the D.C. market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico at UBS.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Ric, I was hoping you could talk about, we're hearing that, it's a little early, but that people are, some in the real estate community, and others, might be pushing for like a limited type of zoning in Houston. Have you heard anything about that? Could you talk about that a little bit?
Richard J. Campo: I have heard a lot about it. The -- yes, there was a big project that was being built in a very high-end neighborhood. And it's called the Ashby High Rise. And there was a big neighborhood revolt, if you will. They sued the developer and this developer sued the city, and so it's been a big problem. The civic homeowner group won a lawsuit that, I think, gave them somewhere around $1.5 million worth of damages, which is very interesting when you think about it, awarding damages for a prospective development that hasn't been built yet, it's fairly unique. So the lawsuit has created a lot of discussion about whether Houston ought to have zoning. The zoning fight in Houston has been going on for 30 years. And it's kind of interesting, because on the one hand, a company like Camden would welcome zoning, because it really helps the people who are entrenched, that have the capital to deal with those kinds of issues and to basically makes development more expensive, and therefore harder to do and harder for entrants to get involved in. So we actually support more planning than less planning. Houston may be at a point where the urbanization and the litigation around people not wanting to have high rise buildings built in their backyard could put pressure on civic leaders to revisit the issue.
Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, we'll stay tuned on that. It sounds like it could be interesting. One other question I had was you cite the 50 basis point benefit to your same-store revenue growth from redevelopment. I was wondering if you could break that out a little bit more into the contribution in say, Texas or Florida, which are some of your better markets, versus say, Washington D.C. or other markets. I mean, how much are the -- is the redevelopment program this year and last year has been in your more Sunbelt markets?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, we can -- we've not calculated it that way, but the reason for it is, the way we look at it is, the return on the incremental investment at each community. So whether it's in D.C. or whether it's in Charlotte or the Texas markets, we expect to get not only a market rate increase, but an increase over that, that's somewhere in the 10% to 10.5% range. We don't have a single redevelopment underway right now that is less than the 10% threshold. We had some as high as 12%, so that on an average basis over the entire portfolio, we're somewhere around 10.5% return on incremental cost above a market rate increase. So whether -- we could do the weighted average of where it's occurring, but if your question is, is it getting a pickup because you're doing a bunch of repositionings in Houston, that's not true. We're getting the pickup everywhere that we're doing the repositioning.
Richard J. Campo: Yes. Also, the 50 basis points is in net operating income, not in revenue, because when you ramp up a redevelopment, you actually get hurt in revenue, and you get your 50 basis points from expenses until -- and you don't get the pickup until it's after a year at least, plus or minus, because of the downtime that you're experiencing in lease-up. But we can send you off-line where the redevelopment is without any trouble.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Bragg, Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Thanks for quantifying for us the impact of the rehab activity on same-store growth. But could you also quantify the impact of the expansion of the same-store pool, looks like it's about a 16% expansion, happens to take down your D.C. exposure, your Houston exposure goes up a little bit. So as it relates to your NOI growth outlook for 2014, what impact does that expansion have?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Dave, when you look at the approximate 7,000 units we added to same-store this year, they are performing about 100 basis points ahead of the prior same-store pool without them in it.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question relates to the disposition environment. Can you update us on what you're seeing and what your plans are for the remainder of the year?
Richard J. Campo: Sure. The disposition market is still very robust. With interest rates where they are and the expectation for a reasonable growth above trend in multifamily, we see no shortage of buyers in the market to acquire our dispositions.
D. Keith Oden: Yes. So the other point I would add to that is that we gave a pretty wide range of guidance for dispositions in our joint venture pool, and we did that for a specific reason. We are in the process of conducting some preliminary talks with our large joint venture partner, that if they are successful, the net effect would be that those get put into a longer-term hold. So that the upper end of the guidance would indicate that we don't get something done on a longer-term basis, in which case we'll be active -- we'll be actively putting some of the joint venture communities into the sales bucket in the summer, with an expectation of closing in the third and fourth quarter, which is what our original guidance was always predicated on. And if we do end up with putting those into a longer hold period, which would be our preference, then we would be much closer to the low end of the guidance of $100 million on JVs. But the market itself is still, as Ric mentioned, is still extremely strong, and we would expect that both for the balance sheet assets and to the extent that we do additional dispositions out of the JV, we're going to meet a lot of really solid demand for all those assets. They're all very high-quality assets, and they happen to be located in markets where we're still experiencing the best growth.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just going back to that last question, would there be an interest in expanding the relationship then with your JV partner, to take in additional assets? And then also, the predevelopment costs during the quarter went up a little bit on several predevelopments. Was that a change in design or cost escalation? If you could comment on that as well.
D. Keith Oden: Yes, on the first question, we do have and have had conversations with our JV partner about the possibility of doing something on a larger basis. But that would be predicated around the notion of a strategic transaction. They've indicated an interest in getting additional exposure in multifamily, and they've also indicated a strong interest in doing it with us. And to the extent that there was a strategic transaction that required a significant amount, infusion of capital, something that Camden -- it's something we would entertain for sure, and it's something that they would be very amenable to.
Richard J. Campo: On the development side, the predevelopment pipeline, there were a couple of projects that did go up in cost, one of which is the most significant would be the Camden McGowen Station in Houston. Originally, the project was budgeted to be a 251-unit wood frame development. Now it is a 320-unit, 8-storey concrete development. So the development totally changed, so those numbers are sort of apples and oranges, and that's why the big change there. In terms of the other significant ones, would have been Camden Buckhead and Camden Lincoln Station. And what's going on there is we're just refining the models and refining exactly what we're going to do, and so the unit counts have changed, and the construction cost has been updated with the current environment. Now the good news is, our yields are pretty sticky there because the rents have gone up as well.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. Then just as a follow-up to another previous question, you talked about A versus B. Can you talk about just in the portfolio what you're seeing in some of the urban infill locations versus the suburban portfolio? And then just curious if you could relate that to D.C., what you're kind of seeing inside the Beltway in D.C., versus the majority of our portfolio outside the Beltway there?
D. Keith Oden: Very little difference in the D.C. portfolio. You know, there was a time, up until probably 18 months ago, where the inside, the D.C. proper assets were significantly outperforming the suburban assets, and then that's almost completely gone away over the last 18 months. So very, very little difference in the D.C. portfolio. Interestingly enough, in the markets where we have the strongest job growth, which right now happens to be in Houston, Atlanta and Austin, a lot of that job growth is being pushed, probably not by choice, but just by the lack of availability of units in the more urban setting. Now, yes, there's supply coming and maybe this time next year, we're having a different conversation, but our suburban assets in Houston, Austin, Atlanta and Dallas are just killing it. So I would -- I don't have the exact breakdown, we can provide that to you. But based on the last set of numbers that I saw, we were actually outperforming in the suburban assets in those locations versus the urban.
Richard J. Campo: Yes, the thing I think is that people need to remember in this whole equation is that during the financial crisis, we were -- we as a country were in a position of negative supply, meaning we're tearing down more properties than we were building. So what's going on in these markets that have great job growth is they actually needed supply a lot sooner than they got it. And because of the sort of hole in the market, if you will, that was created as a result of the financial crisis, there's no place to go. Houston had 125,000 people move here last year, 120,000 jobs a year before, 80,000 last year, and they're thinking 70,000 to 80,000 this year. And the challenge is occupancies are 96%, and people are moving in every day and there's no place for them to go. And so it's a great time to be a multifamily company in markets like this, but it really has to do with the sort of remnants of the lack of supply during the financial crisis, and it's manifesting itself by no room for people to move into when they're moving.
D. Keith Oden: And just to follow up on that point, the percentage of residents moving out to buy homes ticked back down pretty significantly in the first quarter, which we kind of expected it to. The fourth quarter was a spike, but so it spiked up to 15.5%, but for all of last year, it was 12.3%, we start out with 13.7% this year. We're still so far below what we think is a sort of a market-clearing set of facts, which would be, in our portfolio, somewhere around 18% or 19%. If we -- if trend is going back down to 13% or 14%, to Ric's point, people are just -- they're not capable, our residents in many cases are not financially capable, of qualifying for a mortgage. So even the people who are here who -- if they're in a multifamily apartment, they would be in a condition right now, from a family status standpoint, to want to move to a home. They're just, in many cases, can't do it. It's just a lot more pressure on multifamily.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Karin Ford at KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: You mentioned a couple of times the job growth in Texas. Do you expect that the recent announcement of the move of headquarters of Toyota to Plano to have an impact on North Dallas in the years ahead?
Richard J. Campo: Absolutely. I mean, that's what it's all about. You got to move people here, they're going to have good jobs. And most of the time, when people come do -- when they move to a new city, they rent an apartment to try to figure out where they're going to be, and then they end up buying a house if they have a kid -- have kids and have that scenario. So the whole job growth market in a lot of these Sunbelt cities are companies that are exiting higher-cost and higher-tax environments for a bit more business-friendly type of environments, which is what the Sunbelt markets tend to be.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then second question. I'm sorry if I missed it in your expense discussion. Did you mention if you had any extraordinary expenses due to weather in the quarter?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: I did not mention it, but we did not have any.
D. Keith Oden: So Karen, we really tried hard to have a conference call, after looking at some of the other folks, without mentioning the word weather. So we weren't going to mention weather at all, but now that you brought it up, it's lovely here today in Houston. It's about 82 degrees and sunny.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just out of curiosity, how did you not have an impact in D.C.?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, I mean, so our above plan snow removal in D.C. was about $40,000. So again, is it not worth mentioning? But yes, there was some additional snow removal, but it wasn't meaningful.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Bennett at Zelman & Associates.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Just on your current development pipeline, could you give an update on how you're seeing your lease-up relative to expectations on NoMa and any changes in your rent projections across the development pipeline?
D. Keith Oden: We are on plan for all of our developments at this point, including NoMa. And we're feeling pretty good about our yields and our lease-up velocity, and our rents have not changed.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay, got it. And then just one point of clarification on McGowen, you talked about this structure being different, and now contributing to the increase in cost and the unit change. What will you expect, I guess, in terms of the higher rents now for that asset?
Richard J. Campo: Well, that -- the area in midtown Houston is, in downtown, is just on fire. And so we're expecting probably $2.30 a square foot in rent. And this product, because it's concrete construction and just to kind of give a little history, we've owned this land for 12 years, and we've been working with the city and the local tax increment reinvestment zone to really develop this 6-acre tract in a major way. And part of the deal that we made on this is we're building a 400-space parking garage underneath our building, and then there's retail that is owned by the TIRZ on the corner. And then we -- south of the property, we have a 3-acre city park that also fronts on our Camden Travis Street product. So we think that this is going to be one of the most desirable locations in Houston. It's also -- the property is adjacent to a -- to the light rail stop, so you can get on the light rail, go downtown or go to the medical center. So we think our rents are going to be much higher than we originally pro forma-ed in the sort of 5-storey or 4-storey sort of wood product, so we're really excited about getting that project started finally.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Dye at Robert W. Baird.
Stephen Dye - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: This is Stephen standing in for Paula today. Most of my questions have been answered so far. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Vegas. You saw some acceleration there in same-store. How well is that market closing the gap to its pre-recession peak? Is that on schedule in your opinion?
D. Keith Oden: So Vegas is the 1 market out of our 15 that is still below the previous peak in terms of rent. Although we're clearly off the bottom, we've clawed our way about halfway back to the rental rate loss that we saw during the downturn. So making good progress, but still a fairly long way to go to get back to where we were on peak rents. Like I said, it's the only 1 of the 15 that has not fully recovered. A lot of positive things going on in terms of the metrics that matter to Las Vegas in terms of visitor, visitor days, inbound flights, all of the -- it's all pointing in the right direction, but it was a pretty deep hole.
Stephen Dye - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And I assume still no real hint of supply there at all?
D. Keith Oden: None. I think there was a 400 apartments permitted in the second half of 2013.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Chao at Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just wanted to go back to the conversation about the home-buying impacts. I know you said that a lot of your tenants are not necessarily financial capable of getting a mortgage. But just curious what percentage of your tenants are sort of in that home-buying demographic, families and that kind of thing?
D. Keith Oden: So from what used to be the home-buying demographic was 25- to 34-year-olds, that represents about 50% of our -- about 45% of our entire demographic. I'm not so sure it makes much sense anymore to even think about age and cohorts that go with that. You just have people making very different decisions. I -- we don't have really great data, but eventually, I suspect it will -- somebody will figure out how to get this data. And when they do, I think what you're going to find is that anecdotally, you hear it all the time, 25- to 34-year-olds are delaying when they get married. They are getting married later, and they're having fewer children and having their children later. Both of those are -- have historically been triggering events for, "I'm going to move from multifamily to single family somewhere." And I think that, that entire demographic has shifted probably 2 to 3 years at a minimum in terms of the overall impact to, "I'm going to buy a home because my family status has changed," as opposed to the period we went through before the crash, where people were buying homes for the wrong reasons, and not necessarily for family status reasons, but for speculation. The speculation's gone, we've probably gone too far in the other direction, with regard to people being averse to home ownership. We know that over some period of time, that'll come back, but we're a long way from even getting back to the average of home ownership, people moving out of our apartments to buy homes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Bower, ISI Group.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to touch on the overall transaction market. Are you seeing any change in appetite from investors for portfolio deals or single assets? And then maybe just as a follow-up, has there been any change in cap rates and where do you think buyer IRRs are today?
Richard J. Campo: I don't think there's been any change in appetite for portfolios or for individual assets, and the -- so if you're thinking about institutional investors that actually look at IRRs, which there are many of those, but there -- and those IRRs are probably in the 6.5% -- core holders in the 6% to 6.5% range, value-adds probably in the 7% to 7.5% range of IRR, unleveraged IRRs. But I will tell you that there are probably, over half the investors, if you ask them what their IRR hurdle is, they'll go what IRR hurdle are you talking about? And I've asked that to many buyers that have bought Camden properties, and they don't look at IRR hurdles, they're looking at cash on cash returns to equity, they're looking at price per unit, price per square foot. And when you can buy an asset today, and half the buyers that are buying assets today are buying with short-term floating rate debt, because they want the optionality of being able to sell their -- the asset without having to worry about prepayment penalties and the like. And when you think about that, that's LIBOR plus 200 today, so somebody's buying an asset in Japan, 2% and then what, 2.15%, plus or minus, so their cash on cash returns when they buy a 5% or a 5.5% cap rate are pretty substantial, you have this massive positive leverage. And so their cash and cash returns are, most of the time, double digits, so that's why they don't even think about terminal IRRs.
Operator: At this time, we show no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Campo for closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: We appreciate your time on the call today, and we will speak to you next quarter and at NAREIT. Thanks.
Operator: . The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan. Please go ahead.
Kimberly A. Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2013 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour, as another multi-family company will begin their call at 1 p.m. Eastern Time. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Thanks, Kim. So with a little help from Led Zeppelin, one of my favorite classic rock 'n roll bands, we closed out 2013. It's been a year of good times and bad times for partner REIT investors. After a whole lot of love in the first 2 quarters of the year, the second half of the year turned out to be a heartbreaker. Multifamily investors began to see the glass half empty, with the catalyst for higher share prices seemingly over the hills and far away. We continue to do all that we can to increase our earnings in 2014 as we seek a stairway to heaven, which will get Camden's share price back to premium to NAV or at least NAV. We closed out 2013 with the highest FFO in our company's history and exceeding our original plan by $0.16 a share or $14 million. 2013 same-property net operating income increased 6.2% over 2012, which was actually slightly less than our expectations in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the continued deterioration or deceleration of the Washington D.C. market, especially in the last 2 months of the year. 2014 looks like will be another year where NOI growth is well above our long-term trend. We expect 4.25% net operating income growth for 2014. We ended the year with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. During 2013, we were a net seller of properties. We expect to be a net seller in 2014 using the proceeds from the sales of older noncore assets and using those proceeds to fund our development pipeline. We expect to start between $150 million and $300 million of new developments in 2014. Supply and demand fundamentals continue to be positive in most of our markets, with nearly all of our markets having at least 5 jobs projected for every apartment delivered. New development has become more challenging with costs rising and increased competition. However, development returns continue to be more attractive in acquisitions. Team Camden continues to outperform our competitors in our markets by providing living excellence to more than 100,000 residents. Social media is increasingly becoming a key component of our marketing success. I'd like to give a special shout out to our Camden team members, Kim Boritz [ph] Project Manager in our corporate office in Houston; and Kyle Jones [ph], a member of our maintenance team at Amber Oaks in Austin, who both won tickets to the Super Bowl this weekend by winning a Twitter Vine video contest, which helps engage our Camden employees in the fascinating and important world of social media. We understand that we are probably preaching to the choir on this call, which means there's no need for me to ramble on, as Led Zeppelin says. So at this point, I will turn the call over to Keith Oden.
D. Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Consistent with our years past, I'm going to use my time on today's call to review the market conditions we expect to encounter in our largest markets for the year. I'll address each market in the order of the best to worst by assigning a letter grade to each one. And as well, we'll give our view as to whether we think that market is likely to be improving, stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview, I'll provide additional details on our operations. Starting with an overview of Camden's markets, our #1 ranking for 2014 goes to Atlanta, that is assuming that they can get their freeways open soon. We rate it -- the market as an A with an improving outlook. Atlanta placed third in same-property revenue growth last year, trailing only Houston and Charlotte, and posted 7.1% revenue growth for the second year in a row. Supply remains well below historical levels, with 7,000 to 10,000 new apartments expected to be open this year and nearly 60,000 new jobs should be created. Overall, we expect Atlanta to be a top performer again in 2014. Denver and Houston are in the next 2 spots as they did in 2013, holding onto A ratings with stable outlooks. These markets have done well for us, averaging over 7% revenue growth for the past 3 years. While deliveries are ramping up in both markets, demand should remain strong, providing another year of solid growth. Around 37,000 new jobs are projected for Denver in 2014, which should easily absorb the 7,000 units coming online this year. Houston's expected to remain a leader in job creation during 2014, with forecast averaging roughly 75,000 new jobs to be created. We expect over 15,000 completions this year versus 12,000 last year, but that's still well below the peak deliveries of 17,000 to 18,000 units that we saw in Houston during the last few cycles. Austin and Dallas once again round out our top 5 picks, remaining at A- ratings with stable outlooks. Like Denver and Houston, these markets averaged over 7% revenue growth for the past 3 years and are expected to post above-average results again in 2014. Job growth remains very strong across the state of Texas, with around 33,000 new jobs projected in Austin and over 65,000 new jobs in Dallas. New developments have been coming online steadily in both of these markets, particularly, Austin. In 2014, estimated completions are a little over 9,000 in Austin, but not all of these deliveries will compete with our communities. Approximately 12,000 new units will open in this year in Dallas, but they should face fairly healthy demand, given the continued strength in the Dallas economy. Southern California barely misses our top 5 this year, rising to a B+ with an improving outlook. Southern California struggled a bit over the past few years, placing in the bottom third of our same-property rankings. Things seem to be pointing in the right direction for 2014, and we expect to see good results this year. The outlooks for job growth in the Orange County, L.A. and San Diego markets are all favorable, and new supply remained at very manageable levels. Phoenix and Charlotte both earned a B+ with a stable outlook. The Phoenix economy is poised to do well, with nearly 60,000 new jobs expected during 2014. And supply remains well below normal levels with only 4,500 new units being delivered this year. In Charlotte, we've seen above-average revenue growth for the past several years, but as we all know, trees don't grow to the sky. Projections for job growth remain steady, around 25,000 jobs in 2014, but with another 5,000 units being delivered this year, many located in the urban submarkets of South End and Uptown, rent growth will definitely begin to moderate in 2014. South Florida also rated a B+ with a stable outlook this year. Completions are estimated around 7,500, with 40,000 new jobs projected. New supply should be easily absorbed, given tight market conditions and ample job growth. Our South Florida portfolio is currently over 97% occupied versus 94.5% last January, providing a very good starting point to the year. Our next 3 markets are Raleigh, Tampa and Orlando, all maintaining the same B rating with a stable outlook as they had last year. Raleigh is faced away with new supply with around 6,000 completions last year and a similar amount projected for 2014. Job growth continues at a moderate pace, 15,000 to 20,000 new jobs are expected, but absorption will likely be challenging given those -- given these numbers. In Tampa and Orlando, projections for 2014 job growth and completions are similar, with approximately 30,000 to 35,000 new jobs in each market, and around 5,000 new units expected -- of new supply expected in each market, providing a balanced level of supply and demand. Las Vegas actually moves up one place this year after ranking last for the past 3 years, earning a C+ rating and an improving outlook. After posting sub-2% revenue growth for the past 2 years, we think 2014 may yield 3% or better growth. Supply is clearly not an issue in Las Vegas, with less than 2,000 new units being delivered this year. We think the 25,000 projected new jobs in 2014 should provide for positive absorption and improving occupancy rates over the course of the year. It will surprise absolutely no one on this call that Washington D.C. is our lowest-ranking market this year with a C rating and a declining outlook. Revenue growth has steadily declined in D.C. over the past few years and is expected to be flat or slightly down in 2014. Estimates for 2014 completions in D.C. are -- vary widely, depending on the data provider, but we believe that somewhere in the 10,000 to 20,000 units will be delivered in 2014, and we think that the job growth numbers will be somewhere in the 25,000 to 40,000 range for the D.C. metro area. Whatever the numbers end up being, we know that D.C. -- the D.C. market is going to be challenging in 2014, and same-property revenue growth will be the lowest of our 14 major markets. If you put all those results together, overall, our portfolio would rank slightly below the B+ grade that we had for the overall portfolio in 2013, which we think puts us in a great starting position to this year. Now a few details on our operating results. Same-store revenue growth was for 4.8% for the fourth quarter. We saw strong performance in Houston, up 8.2% followed by Atlanta, up 7.1%; Charlotte, up 6.9%; Dallas, Raleigh and San Diego, each up 6.2%. And despite all the concerns that I think are well founded about new supply in Austin, the revenue growth held up very well at 5.8% for the quarter. Overall, trends for the fourth quarter in January are very similar to last year. Fourth quarter leases were up 0.1% and renewals were up 6% versus 0.5% and 7% last year, respectively. In January, new leases are up 1% and renewals are up 6% versus the 1% and 7% last year, so roughly in line with where we started 2013. January and February renewals are coming in with roughly 6% increases. Occupancy averaged 95.8% for the fourth quarter at 70 basis points higher than last year. And the average occupancy rate in January in our portfolio was 95.5%, which is where it stands right now. Net turnover for the fourth quarter was 49% versus 52% in the prior year. And year-to-date turnover actually fell from 2012 to 56% from 57%. Overall, traffic continues to trend down slightly, but that's okay with us, because we're getting a much higher quality of traffic through better marketing. And we -- all of our markets, we believe, have sufficient traffic to maintain our portfolio at the current occupancy levels and meet our objectives for 2014 rental growth. Moveouts for purchased homes was -- were 15.5% in the fourth quarter, and that compares to the fourth quarter of 2013 of 13.3%. It's a little over 2.5% up over the year. We expect this trend will continue to move back closer to our historical norm of roughly 18% of our moveouts lost to home purchases. Finally, I want to thank all of our Camden team members for making Camden a great place to work, a distinction recognized by FORTUNE Magazine for the seventh year in a row, placing us at #11 this year. Being included on the list in the Top 100 companies to work for is an honor that we claim on behalf of our team members and all of the other outstanding real estate investment trusts. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Last night, we reported results for the fourth quarter of 2013 and provided guidance for both the first quarter and full year of 2014. Before I provide further details on each of these, a few general observations about 2013. In 2013, we delivered FFO per share of $4.11, beating the midpoint of our original guidance by $0.16 per share or $14 million. We delivered same-store net operating income growth of 6.2%, likely to be near the top of the peer group. We continued to improve the quality of our portfolio by disposing of approximately 3,900 wholly-owned apartment homes with an average age of 25 years and disposing of nearly 3,700 joint venture apartment homes with an average age of 19 years. We used the net proceeds from these dispositions to fund, in part, the acquisition of approximately 1,100 apartment homes, with an average age of 5 years and to start $425 million of well-located, quality developments, including what will become our flagship California community, The Camden, located at the corner of Selma and Vine in Hollywood. The Camden will be a mixed-use development with 287 units, over 40,000 square feet of pre-leased retail, with concierge services provided by sbe Entertainment Group. And we did all of this while maintaining the lowest leverage in the multifamily space as measured by net debt to EBITDA. By any measure which we can control, 2013 was a very good year. During 2013, the $329 million of 25-year-old dispositions were sold at an average FFO yield of 6.8%, but an average AFFO yield of 5.2%. The difference between the FFO yield and the AFFO yield being the inclusion of $1,350 per door in annual capital expenditures. The $225 million of 5-year-old acquisitions were purchased at an average FFO yield of 5.25% and an average AFFO yield of 5%, after including annual capital expenditures of $600 per door. On a real cash flow basis, we were able to significantly improve the quality of our portfolio with only 20 basis points of dilution. Additionally, the $329 million of wholly-owned communities that we sold in 2013 delivered to our shareholders an unleveraged internal rate of return of 10.5% over a 16-year hold period. Moving on to financial results and guidance. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of $96.9 million or $1.08 per share, representing an approximate $3.2 million or $0.04 per share outperformance to the midpoint of our prior guidance range. This outperformance resulted primarily from: $1.2 million of lower-than-anticipated interest expense due almost entirely to a slight inflator and better-priced fourth quarter unsecured bond offering; $900,000 in higher-than-anticipated property net operating income; $300,000 in higher-than-anticipated joint venture income due to continued outperformance from our joint venture communities; $300,000 in lower-than-anticipated income tax expense due to the benefit of a current year tax loss, which resulted from the final wind down of a technology investment we had previously written off for book purposes; and $200,000 in higher-than-anticipated net fee and asset management income, primarily due to higher third-party construction fees and fund development fees. Of the $900,000 in higher-than-anticipated property net operating income, approximately $900,000 came from our non-same-store communities and approximately $300,000 came from later-than-anticipated dispositions. These 2 positive variances were offset slightly by our same-store revenues coming in $300,000 below the expectations that were contained in the midpoint of our fourth quarter FFO guidance. The positive variances from our non-same-store communities were primarily due to continued outperformance from the 3 communities we acquired during 2013, combined with higher levels of occupancy at many of our other non-same-store communities. The negative variance to same-store revenues was entirely driven by the D.C. market. One last thing on the fourth quarter results. I'm sure many of you noticed the large reduction in Phoenix same-store operating expenses this quarter. For 2013, we only had 3 operating communities in our Phoenix same-store portfolio, and one of those communities received a very favorable property tax refund in the fourth quarter. We knew that this refund was coming, and we had taken it into consideration when we provided our prior guidance. Moving on to 2014 earnings guidance. You can refer to Page 26 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2014 financial outlook. As detailed in our supplemental package, our 2013 reported FFO per diluted share of $4.11 included $0.075 of non-routine items. Excluding these non-routine items and adjusting for the year end 2013 share count, our base 2013 FFO per diluted share would have been $4.03. We expect 2014 FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 with a midpoint of $4.20, representing a $0.17 per share increase over our adjusted 2013 results. The major assumptions and components of this $0.17 per share increase in FFO at the midpoint of our guidance range are as follows: a $0.22 per share or $20 million increase in FFO related to the performance of our 47,915 unit same-store portfolio. We are expecting same-store net operating income growth of 3.25% to 5.25%, driven by revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5% and expense growth of 3.25% to 4.25%; a $0.13 per share or $12 million increase in FFO related to net operating income from our non-same-store properties, resulting primarily from 3 communities acquired in 2013, 3 development communities which stabilized in 2013 and the incremental contribution from our development communities in lease up during 2013 and 2014; and a $0.05 per share or $5 million increase in FFO related to reduced interest expense, primarily as a result of the payoff of an unsecured note in 2013, the favorably priced issuance of $250 million in unsecured debt in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $6.5 million in additional capitalized interest expected in 2014 related to our 2013 and 2014 development starts. These above positives are partially offset by: a $0.15 per share or $14 million decrease in FFO related to lost NOI from 2013 completed dispositions. As a reminder, we sold $329 million of operating communities during 2013; a $0.03 per share, worth $3 million decrease in FFO, related to lost NOI from 2014 anticipated net disposition activity; and finally, a $0.05 per share or $4 million decrease in FFO related to reduced equity and income of joint ventures and associated net management fee income, of which $0.01 is related to the April 2013 disposition of our Las Vegas joint venture communities; $0.02 relates to fund communities currently under contract for disposition; and $0.02 relates to additional pro forma fund dispositions throughout 2014. Likely, many of you on the call did not have the $0.04 of dilution from the fund dispositions or the $0.03 of dilution from our 2014 pro forma net dispositions in your current forecast models. Taking a closer look at our same-store expense growth of 3.25% to 4.25% for 2014, we are once again expecting the largest increase to be in property taxes, although at a more moderate level than 2013. Property taxes are approximately 30% of our total operating expenses and are projected to be up 7% in 2014. 6% is core, the result of anticipated increases in assessments for our properties in 2014 due to continuing increases in real estate values. 1% is due to a year-over-year reduction in anticipated refunds from prior year tax protests [ph]. The remaining categories of same-store property expenses are projected to grow at about 2.5% in the aggregate. Page 26 of our supplemental package also details our expected ranges of acquisitions, dispositions and development activities. The midpoint of our 2014 FFO per share guidance range assumes the following: $300 million in on-balance sheet dispositions and $100 million in on-balance sheet acquisitions anticipated to occur in the latter part of the year; $450 million in joint venture dispositions spread throughout the year; and $225 million of on-balance sheet development starts. We have also provided guidance on the same-store net operating income impact from our 2014 revenue-enhancing repositions. Our guidance assumes we will reposition approximately 5,500 units in 2014 at an average cost per unit of approximately $10,000, contributing 50 basis points to our same-store net operating income growth. Based on our anticipated development spend in 2014, we anticipate needing approximately $500 million of new capital during the year. Net disposition activity is anticipated to provide $200 million. For the remaining $300 million needed, we anticipate accessing the capital market opportunistically. The composition of our 2014 capital activity depends upon a variety of factors, including capital market conditions at the time we go to market, but will likely include an unsecured bond offering or term loan in the middle of the year. As a reminder, at the end of 2013, we had full availability under our $500 million unsecured line of credit. For the first quarter of 2014, we expect FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.06. The midpoint of this range represents a $0.04 per share decline from the fourth quarter of 2013. The $0.04 per share decline is primarily the result of the following items: a $0.02 or $1.6 million decline in sequential same-store net operating income, resulting from a 2.4% increase in same-property operating expenses, mainly due to higher property taxes, partially offset by a slight increase in same-property revenues due to continued improvements in rental rates; and a $0.02 or $1.5 million decrease in FFO related to lost NOI from our fourth quarter 2013 disposition activities. As a reminder, we disposed of 8 communities with an average age of 24 years for $171 million during the fourth quarter of 2013. I will now open up the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Derek Bower of ISI Group.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Just taking what you've learned from the weaker 2 months of 2013. As you said, I think, mostly, it was in D.C. Is there anything that makes you feel more comfortable or confident in your guidance range for 2015? And even though D.C. was still positive for the fourth quarter, when would you expect revenue growth to turn negative?
Richard J. Campo: Yes. So Derek, if you look at our -- kind of our game plan for 2014 as it relates to 2013, out of our 15 markets, we have an increase in revenue projected in 5 -- in 4 of those markets, and we have a decrease projected in 11 markets. Now, obviously, these are from very high levels, markets like Charlotte, where we had a '13 revenue growth of 8.3%. Those are clearly going to be moderating. So we think that we've properly captured the deceleration that we expect to occur across all of our portfolio. Clearly, the one that we've had to wrestle with the most is D.C. We think that it'll be flat to slightly negative in 2014. We have a different mix of assets in that market from suburban to urban, different price points than many of our competitors do. And I think if you look back over 2013, that's one of the reasons why the timing of the effect on our D.C. markets was very different than most of the other reporting companies that have D.C. exposure. So the D.C. market was interesting. We kind of felt like it would hold together throughout 2013. But if you look at the sequential numbers and most of this occurred in the November, December time frame, in our entire portfolio for the third quarter, our occupancy actually went up by 40 basis points, which is, as you all know, very unusual for us. While in D.C., our portfolio there actually dropped 30 basis points. So a net swing between our overall results in the broad portfolio and what happened in D.C. And if you look at that, and drill that down to rental rates, again, sequentially, in our entire portfolio, we were up 6/10 or 60 basis points in rental rates, and yet we were down 30 basis points just in the D.C. market or a delta swing between those 2 of 90 basis points. So those are pretty big swings from 3Q to 4Q. Now, obviously, we had some of that baked into our forecast for the deceleration that we thought was going to happen in the fourth quarter, but it was just more than we thought it was going to be. But I think we felt -- feel comfortable with the guidance that we've given. We know that some of our markets are going to moderate from the very, very high levels that they have been, but we're also very constructive about the fact that we think we're going to deliver a 4.25% same-store NOI growth next year which is still above trend for our long-term portfolio.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then are there any other markets, in particular, that are going to be driving that 50 basis point of redevelopment NOI this year? And what do you think the impact is from the 7,000 units that will be rolling into same-store in 2014?
Richard J. Campo: There's really no specific markets scattered around the country. We -- when we look at redevelopment, we look at the assets within each market and pick the best ones from a redevelopment perspective. And then in terms of the second part of your question, we roll in all of those properties into our portfolio and then start sort of capturing the NOI growth in the base portfolio. And so it's hard to sort of go through and say, okay, how much of it is -- how much of the NOIs or revenue growth is -- was specifically related to one property that was sort of -- or these units that were actually put in play throughout the year.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Derek, you're asking about the additional same-store units that we have in '14 versus '13?
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, I'm just trying to get a sense for the 7,000 units. Did that pool of assets outperform in 2014 from your same-store pool, I guess?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Yes. If you look at them, most of them are located in Houston. There's one in Dallas, and there's a couple on the West Coast, so they are better performers. There's -- none of them are D.C. assets, which is, obviously, are going to be our lower performer for 2014. So yes, there should be some slight incremental increase due to those new same-store units.
D. Keith Oden: Yes. So just a little bit of additional information around that. Our non-same-store communities for 2013 actually outperformed the original forecast by about $2.5 million. So same-store pool came in slightly below where we thought it was going to be, primarily as we talked about in the impact in D.C., so the total number is about $700,000 to $800,000 light on the same-store portfolio, offset by $2.5 million positive on the non-same-store. So it's developments leasing up faster, it's acquisitions outperforming. And so I think that, that's -- it's fair to say that some of our stronger -- the profile of those apartments both in the market that they're in and the product types that they are should be additive and will be additive to our 2014 same-store.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: First, just want to go to California. And not to suggest that you guys are going to get into the nightclub scene out there -- Rock of Ages comes to mind. You guys have now started 2 deals, and, clearly, it's been there that you haven't done much in before but, Keith, you spoke about Southern California jumping up in your list as far as markets in 2014. Should we expect to see more investments from Camden in Southern California over the next 12 to 18 months?
Richard J. Campo: Well, we definitely like Southern California. I think it's a great market, and it's moving up on our list, and we've been in California for a long time. And the reason you hadn't seen us develop more there was in the last cycle, we just couldn't stomach the yields. People were developing at 5 pro forma yields, which we didn't think made a lot of sense. And so today, with the sort of the recalibration of land costs and construction costs, the 2 properties that we have today are going to yield in the mid-6s, so it's very attractive. We are working on other transactions in California, and it is definitely a long-term core market of ours. So yes, you can see us making more investments in California.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: And when you say mid-6s, that's a trend that's not on current, right?
Richard J. Campo: I think the trended ones are -- that is trended, that's right. It's mid-6 to 7 trended and probably -- and there's not a lot of trending going on there. So it's probably 50 or maybe 75 basis points less than that if you use current rent.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. Second question is the markets like Vegas, Phoenix, Tampa, Orlando, when do you think that we'll see these markets return to their prior peaks? Do you think that's a '15 or that's a '16 and beyond? What would be your guess?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, I think the only one that's still meaningfully below the peak is Vegas. And even after what we think happens in 2014 we'll probably still be in 13% to 14% below the prior peak in Vegas rents. All the other markets that we operate in are either at or back above peak rents. In our portfolio, the one big gap that still exists is in Vegas.
Richard J. Campo: Just to make sure we understand, peak rents are 2007, right? So I know inflation's low, but when you go back to peak rents in 2007, and you say they're peak in 2014, that means that -- and when we look at our tenant profile, our resident profile, and their incomes have grown pretty dramatically during that timeframe, maybe not the people that started in that property. But when you look at our growth and income, so people are basically getting today a 2007 rent with a 2014 income, which relates to about a 17% of household income for rent. So there's room in those rents even though they are "peak".
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So I'm curious if you think that where we're at right now from a deceleration standpoint on a same-store basis -- is this kind of, in your mind, the trough of this current cycle? In other words, when you look 3 or 4 or 5 years in advance, do you think this is kind of where we'll be for a while? Or what are the circumstances where the numbers can go decidedly in a different path, even negative, from an absolute growth perspective?
D. Keith Oden: So Rich, over -- if you take our numbers back over 20 years reported as a public company, you can even go back beyond that, and we got closer to 30 years data, the average rental increase over that long period of time across our markets, product types, cycles, et cetera, is around 3%. And so as we kind of think about 2014 at being 4.25% and keeping in mind and perspective that, that kind of comes on the heels of progression of NOI that had us at 7.1%, 9.2%, 6.2% last year and then 4.25% this year, in a long-term NOI growth in our portfolio is 3%. So would it -- at some point in this cycle, or as we play out the next couple of years, do you trend back closer to that 3%? I mean, statistically, you could make a pretty good case for that. The difference is that there really are some very different dynamics in play. Still, we came out of a very, very deep hole and we dug very quickly up out of the hole. And yet, if you look at the level of new supply that's coming, and you contrast that with where we think the demand is both demographically and in new jobs, you can still look at in 2015 and 2016 and say, these -- those could be very constructive years for this business. And by that, I mean, above trend.
Richard J. Campo: Let me just add to that, that the dynamics today are -- we haven't added all the jobs back that we lost during the recession, so it's been anemic job growth. Most people talk about how the financial crisis created this very long-term recovery that we're experiencing. There's still 2 million missing people that are doubled up -- young people that are doubled up in either roommate situations or in parent homes. You have 1 million missing households out there when you start looking at normal household formation that just haven't come back yet. And I think that's a function of the anemic job growth that the market has had. So if you have the same sort of job growth over the next couple of years of 200,000 jobs a month, perhaps that will release that excess demand, if you will, that should allow this business to be a good business for the next 2 or 3 years. And until that demand is all taken up, so -- and if you have job acceleration as opposed to sort of go-along, get-along jobs then you could be -- you could have an acceleration of revenue and NOI growth, because the amount of rent that people are paying is still very low relative to historic norms in terms of what they have to pay out of their paychecks to pay for rent. So you could argue that we could have an accelerating market, starting in 2014 and '15 and '16 if we unbundle this excess demand and if we have better job growth.
D. Keith Oden: Rich, the 2 data providers that we look at very closely and when we're kind of laying out our game plans and test for reasonableness, are Witten and AXIOMetrics. And if you look at their 2014 forecast for net effective rents and you averaged the 2 of them, it's right at 3.1%. We'll do better than that, but a lot of that -- some of that is because of our repositions in the markets. And they've got their forecast for 2015, and by the way, the reason I think this is important is they capture in there -- Ron Witten captures in his models many of the many of the things that Ric just kind of laid out as far as the demographic trends and the longer-term view of supply and demand. They've got -- their 2015 forecast that we're -- that we have access to, is right on top of 3% net effective rent growth. Now if we can get a little bit of break on expenses, 3% net effective rent growth could easily turn into another 4%, 4.5% year in 2015. So I would probably -- as I sit here today, I would take that.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So I mean, the reason why I ask is in the third quarter conference call, you kind of targeted a same-store revenue number and then November and December, you missed on things, very short-term stuff that you would normally be able to see coming. And we're talking a lot of long-term stuff, but what about in the very short term? What could go wrong -- like what went wrong in November, December in D.C. relative to your expectations? What could go wrong in the here and now? I mean, or do you feel like you're kind of in the bag, at least, for the first half of 2014 with what you're seeing today?
Richard J. Campo: Yes, I think that what happened in the fourth quarter is that we were definitely surprised by November and December in D.C. And, so far, this year, D.C. is -- has performed exactly according to our budget. It's basically flat for the first part of the year. And, obviously, the -- it's very -- it is unusual for us not to see something like that in D.C. But when the markets turn, they turn really fast and really hard, then you kind of look at it and go, "Ooh, maybe I should've seen that." Bottom line is though, we just missed our projections in November and December, but we're right on top of them now, and we feel pretty confident that our budgets going forward for the first half of the year are reasonable.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then my final quick question is on Atlanta, top of your list. Would you be more inclined to be a net buyer or seller in that market, given what you're seeing today?
D. Keith Oden: We made one really significant investment acquisition in Atlanta last year and we think we caught it just about right. It was about an $80 million investment and then we've got our development at Buckhead [ph] that's underway right now and that's a very significant development opportunity for us. So we're putting capital to work in Atlanta and we think we've done it at the right point in cycle. We're looking at a couple of other opportunities right now in Atlanta. So wouldn't surprise me to see us to be continue to be a net acquirer of assets in Atlanta in 2014.
Operator: The next question comes from Nic Joseph of Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Given that your stock trades at a discount, how do you internally weigh new development starts versus repurchasing stock?
Richard J. Campo: Well, we clearly look at that, and we -- if you go back to the last cycle, we were a big buyer of our stock and -- or 2 cycles go, I guess, in the early part of -- or late part of the 90s. And what you have to do is look at your capital allocation. And the developments you can't just start and stop, you have them under construction, and there's a development [ph] spend there. And so the key issue is how do you allocate your capital? And right now, we do analysis that shows our rate of return relative to our developments. And then we, obviously, look at buying or look at what the relative value of the stock is. And the constraint you have is how much can you sell versus staying inside the tax aspects of REIT land, and then how much can you -- how much do you have to fund in your development side that's already under construction, and then how much would you have left in capital then to buy stock, because that's the balance. And I've said for a long time that if the stock price stays persistently at a significant discount to NAV, then we would be a buyer of the stock. The bottom line though is -- for us is how long is that persistent, and then how long does the development market or the acquisition markets stay buoyant for us to be able to sell assets? With all these constraints, it's all about capital allocation, obviously. And we look at what the best investment is in the -- it doesn't make sense for us to buy a lot of net acquisitions today because of the development spend that we have.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then for the development starts expected in 2014, what markets are you looking to start those from your pipeline?
Richard J. Campo: If you look at our pipeline, which is in our supplement, that's pretty much the order of which we could start these developments. The very first one on the list is...
D. Keith Oden: One in Phoenix, 1 in Denver and the 3rd is a toss-up, it depends on some permitting issues, but very potentially, another start in Houston. So the low end of the range, we start 2 of those, the high end of the range, we start 3 or 4.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just going back to the development question. Can you talk about the timing of starts? And also, as you think about acquisitions today, I realize you guys are liquidating fund 1. Would there be a thought about potentially putting a place in another fund at this point, given where you're trading at relative to NAV?
Richard J. Campo: Timing of development starts are likely to be sort of one in the first quarter, and then most of the other starts will probably be towards the end of the year in terms of development starts, middle of the year to the end. And then in terms of additional funds, we really enjoy our relationship with our -- with the fund -- with Texas Teachers. And I would say that the idea of -- we clearly could have had a great success with our fund and great success on make -- creating a lot of value for our partners. And it's one of the things that we continue to look at and could be that we expand our relationship or do another fund. But at this point, we're sort of studying those issues. One of the big things that we -- they did coming out of this financial crisis was make sure that we cleaned up our balance sheet and made our balance sheet much more clean and simple. And so this is the only joint venture that we have today and the only fund. And you will not see Camden doing a lot of different structured finance transactions. We want to keep it simple and stay in that zone.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: As my follow-up, Alex, you went through the other components of expense growth, very helpful. Can you talk a little bit about the components of revenue growth? What you guys are kind of underwriting in terms of rents versus occupancy, as well as kind of the component from other income contribution there? And then also how much of the 50 basis point lift is actually in the revenue number versus the expense number?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Sure, sure. So if you look at the revenue side, we're anticipating occupancy to be relatively flat for 2014 versus 2013. So the incremental growth is going to be on the rental rate side. Other income for us pretty much grows at a 3% rate. And if you look at -- I think your last question was on repositions, most of the impact for repositions -- the positive impact for repositions in 2014 is actually expense-driven. There's probably about 10 basis points that's on the revenue side.
Operator: The next question comes from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: The apartment REIT sector has seen plenty of consolidation over the last year or so. And given Camden's historical track record in that department, I want to ask you how important you think that scale is today? How do you feel about the size of the Camden franchise, especially relative to the public peers now?
Richard J. Campo: Well, clearly, there has been consolidation, as you point out. We, over the years, have been actively involved in that. I think from a scale perspective, Camden is a very good size from a scale perspective. We -- I don't think bigger is better. We can buy the same -- we have the same buying power and very, very similar cost of capital to the much larger companies. So I don't think it's a huge issue. I think the only area would probably be on the G&A side, the bigger than you are, the more efficient your G&A portfolio is. I also think you have to be careful that and make sure you understand the components of fund business and how the G&A needs to be managed that way -- at least analyzed that way. So I don't think that there's any compelling reason to be bigger. And I don't think bigger has been better in a lot of cases, as long as you're big enough to have liquidity in your stock and liquidity in your bonds. And we seem to have plenty of that. I think we're -- the last deal we did compared to the much bigger companies on bond deals was actually tighter than -- a tighter spread than our large competitors. There likely will be more M&A in the space, and we have no problem with M&A as long as it's the right transaction with the right additive value to the portfolio and to our earnings.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And my second question is on the spread between renewals and new move-ins, which seems to continue to be wide, if not -- if it's not widening even more over the last year or so. As you think about the next couple of years, how long can this spread be maintained before you have, especially in today's day and age with very good visibility, on what you're charging on new move-ins before you have more pushback from existing residents?
D. Keith Oden: You know, Dave, that when you look at the trends, the gap is almost -- you can look at it cyclically over what happens over a year. The gap narrows, and then it widens back out again. I don't think that the gap that we're at right now in terms of new leases, if you got to think about what our game plan is for 2014, we're probably somewhere in the range of 2% to 2.5% on new leases in terms of new lease rates. And we'll probably end up somewhere in the range of 5%, 6% on renewals, which that's in the -- within 100 basis points of where we've been for the last 4 years. So how long it can continue to go on? I think as long as we continue to have constructive demand in our markets, which we still do, as long as we continue to operate at above -- at around or above 95% occupied, which we are, then I think you can continue -- we will continue to see that kind of a spread. A lot of it has to do with when you're analyzing the renewal piece, it's -- what was that person's lease on move-in, which gets to, in our world, because we use revenue management, what was the lease term that they executed? There's just a whole lot of variables that go into that. But it doesn't -- as an operator, when I look at that, and I see 300 or 400 basis point spread new leases to renewals, as long as our residents are continuing to grow their income, and they're at a relatively low percentage of their disposable income to pay their rent, that doesn't really bother me. And it wouldn't bother me to see that continue into 2015.
Operator: The next question comes from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: When we visited Austin last in September, there was some conversation that one of the reasons there was -- you were still able to push rent growth on renewals is that even folks who wanted to buy houses and move out couldn't find enough inventory. And now we see your homeownership -- moveouts to home ownership is starting to tick up. Can you just talk a little bit about what the homeownership inventory looks like in some of your markets? And are there any that you're particularly worried about or not?
D. Keith Oden: Paula, we don't have -- I don't have the numbers at my fingertips on the inventory of the single family, but I can tell you that from macro perspective, everything that we see and everything that we looked at indicates that we are in a very constrained inventory condition. So if you just -- if you spread that -- since that data is coming from all of the major metropolitan areas, and we operate in 15 of them, there's clearly a part of the story that is just inventory constrained. I would say that in our case, in Austin, it's also -- our footprint in Austin is very different than where some of the pressure has been with regard to new supply. If you think about all the -- most of the new development that's being done, it's in and around the university and south of there in the downtown area. And honestly, we just don't have any exposure in that market. We are currently under development on an asset that's north of campus. It's kind of on the fringes, probably, of where the big slug of new supply is coming. And that's not to say that at some point, it matters what the -- how many rocks you're throwing into the lake as far as level of rents, but I think our portfolio was just a little bit differently situated. So I think our performance in Austin, as evidenced by the 5.8% rental revenue or increase in revenues in the fourth quarter has held up pretty well. But I think it don't have the numbers market by market, but my guess is that we do have -- it is part of the story.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a question going back to the tax expense, I think, 7% up this year. Can you just break that down in terms of like the range of gains you expect to see across your markets? And did the larger gains tie -- or does it matchup with the list of markets that you highlighted at the beginning, in terms of which ones you would see the greatest tax increases?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Yes, absolutely and it does. I mean, so we look at it in our Texas markets, we're assuming that they're pretty much up 7%. And obviously, they are very property tax-focused. Our mid-Atlantic regions are up about 4%. Our West Coast is up about 2%, and then our Florida regions are up about 6%.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, plus 6%. Okay, actually, I mean, so if only one market's at plus 7%, I know it's a big one, but wouldn't it be coming in lower than 7% total?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Well, we also have -- we've got -- sorry, California markets are up 9%, California and Arizona. Part of our Arizona challenge is that favorability we had in the property tax refund in the fourth quarter that I'd spoke about on the script. Obviously, you have the double effect the next year.
Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Got it, okay. And then just going back to your comments about Southern California that, that's moving up in the rankings there. I was just wondering if you can break that down a little bit more between sort of San Diego expectations, Orange County and L.A. And, specifically, L.A. seems like slow a little bit in terms of same-store revenue growth from last quarter.
D. Keith Oden: Yes. So if you think about those markets, and I mentioned earlier that there were 4 markets that were -- if you look at revenue growth year-over-year, that we're actually getting better in the 11 markets that we're moderating. San Diego, Inland Empire is increasing by almost 200 basis points over the prior year on revenue growth. L.A. and Orange County is up about 120 basis points, and those were -- so that of all the markets that we have and are increasing, Las Vegas is up about 240 basis points. Everything else -- Atlanta up 35%. Everything else in our portfolio was is down year-over-year. So if you're looking at it year-over-year, San Diego, Inland Empire, L.A., Orange County represents most of the positive variance in reported -- or what we think will be projected revenue for '14 over '13.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just had a question about the Kitchen & Bath contribution. You guys mentioned 50 basis points to NOI. Is that just the $55 million roughly at, call it, an 8% return, happening ratably over the year, which is a couple of million bucks or so, and then that compared to the baseline NOI? Is that the 50 basis points?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: That's correct.
Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Then I'm just trying to understand by the same regard, wouldn't you then have to pull in the full impact of the $85 million spent last year? It seems like if you did that, it would be more like 125 basis points. Is that -- am I looking at that right?
Richard J. Campo: Well, the spend last year definitely went into your base number, into the -- into your base same-store pool, so the increases that those rents got are embedded in the same-store NOI growth. So if you try to pull them out and say well, how much of it was from the repositioning of those dollars, then your math is probably pretty close. But we just embed those into our base and then draw them forward into the NOI growth.
Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. But then -- so then if you didn't do it in either year though, would that mean that your NOI growth would be around 3%?
Richard J. Campo: Well, I think the issue there is the question -- and we debate that all the time here. And you can do this math 100 different ways. The question then becomes what would -- what impact did the repositioning have on the existing leases, because you're moving people out to refurbish the units. And then what would the growth rate have been on those existing leases that you did rehab. So I guess you can technically go through a math and say, "Gee, if you didn't have repositionings, you would have much lower NOI growth," and -- but on the other hand, the question will be -- the question is, what would those leases have been if you hadn't done it in the future years? So at some point, the bottom line is that you end up with taking out -- or you end up with growth from those units, and they do fold into your NOI growth going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Bennett of Zelman & Associates.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: I know we're running up against the 1 p.m. deadline here. But just quickly, on the disposition guidance that you guys provided for 2014 on your consolidated assets. I'm just curious how you're looking at that source of dispositions as a cost of capital? And where those assets kind of sit in the same-store NOI range that you provided for the overall portfolio?
Richard J. Campo: Well, we haven't decided which assets are going to go into that portfolio yet, because what we do is we force-rank them based on their budget and based on CapEx and based on what we think the future growth rate is going to be. So by definition, they should be at the lower end of our same-store NOI growth, because that's why we would sell an asset is if it had high CapEx and low return on invested capital going forward. We are in the process of going through the analysis of which properties we will sell, but generally speaking, they're at the low end of the growth range.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: And, I guess, just as a follow-up what is the type of demand out there that you're seeing for lower growth assets that you might be -- that you're putting out in the market?
Richard J. Campo: Well, the interesting thing is that there's a lot of -- there's very high demand for these assets, because if they have higher CapEx, then somebody sees something different in them than we do, and they become value add plays for a lot of these B buyers out there. So there's still very high demand for them. As Alex went through the numbers earlier, they were still getting very, very good prices on these properties relative to their real cash flow. And knowing the buyers of the last group of assets that we sold, they look at it as -- they look at these assets as they can improve them and run them theoretically on a lower cost basis than we do as a public company. And that's part of the game that they play in terms of deciding -- trying to figure out whether they can actually get a value add proposition. So oftentimes, we don't -- we aren't going to improve these properties to the point where somebody looks at them and says, "Gee, I can't add value to them." So they're really value add plays, and there's a high demand for them.
D. Keith Oden: And the buyers are playing a very different game in the leverage markets, and the financial instrument markets. And if you're willing to go very short-term or floating rate debt, you can get incredible financial leverage by buying 6 FFO-yielding assets from us that we think are very attractive to trade. And they can financially engineer them in a way that doesn't make sense for us on our balance sheet, but obviously makes sense for them.
Operator: And the last questioner for today will be Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Ric, a question for you on the GSEs. Does the appointment of Mel Watt [ph] as the head of the FHFA going to have any impact on either the multifamily or the single-family market with respect to Fannie and Freddie, do you think?
Richard J. Campo: Yes, most people think that the Watt appointment is positive for the GSEs. DeMarco was definitely not doing what the administration really wanted him to do, which was to keep Freddie and Fannie going, and to -- that he was trying to constrain the amount of loans and the types of loans and pushing fees up. And I think Watt is definitely much more constructive of trying to keep the housing market going. So I think it's definitely a positive for the GSEs and a positive for single-family and multifamily mortgage finance.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: We appreciate your time today, and we'll talk to you on the next quarter call. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly A. Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. As you may recall, Rod Petrik of Stifel, Nicolaus was the first person to correctly guess the theme of last quarter's hold music, earning him the opportunity to select the music for today's call. The theme he chose for us was Texas legends. Well done, Rod, and we hope you enjoyed all of those songs. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete third quarter 2013 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Good morning. To quote that legendary Texas songwriter George Strait, I don't have any exes but, "Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be." That definitely describes our Texas markets today. Camden had another solid operating quarter, with 12 of our 16 markets exceeding 5% net operating income growth and 9% with revenue growth higher than 5%. The apartment business continues to exceed long-term trends and we expect that to continue. We continue to be active at recycling capital, selling older, slower growing properties and buying and developing new generation properties. We completed property sales of $174 million so far this year, with an average age of 26 years. We held these properties for 16 years and realized an 11% unleveraged IRR in these property sales. We expect to close sales of an additional $175 million in the fourth quarter. We have acquired $225 million of new generation properties during the year, with an average age of 6 years. We do not expect to acquire any additional properties this year. Sales prices and cap rates have held reasonably stable for our disposition properties. We will likely be a net seller of assets going forward and using the proceeds to fund development. During the quarter, we started 3 new development properties with a total cost of $156 million. We expect to start 2 additional properties by the end of the year, with a total cost of around $200 million. While there's a lot of concern about new supply, we think that job growth will create enough demand to absorb new completions during 2014 and '15. I would like to give a big shout-out to our Camden teams in the field and our support teams, who continue to outperform their markets and continue due to make Camden a great company and a great place to work. I'll turn the call over now to Keith Oden.
D. Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. I'm mindful of the fact that we're one of the last apartment companies to report for the quarter, and many of the themes have been beaten to death, so I'll keep my comments brief. Our third quarter results were solid and in line with our expectations. Our team is focused on finishing the year strong. After last year's sector-leading same-store NOI growth of 9.2%, we're determined to achieve our original guidance of 6.5% same-store NOI growth for this year, which would be the second-highest in the sector this year, giving us a 2-year total of 15.7% growth in NOI. Can I get a "why so" [ph] anyone? And our same-property portfolio rental rates were up 4.9% year-over-year for the third quarter, with a slight dip in occupancy of 20 basis points. We are still getting strong growth in Texas and Charlotte, both with 6.4% revenue growth, followed by Atlanta at 6.2% and Denver at 5.9%. Perhaps surprisingly, Raleigh was up 5.2% despite being closely watched for the impact of new supply. Our weakest 3 markets were D.C., Vegas and San Diego, all with less than 3% revenue growth. Sequentially, our revenue was up 1.7% following the 1.8% increase in the previous quarter. Sequential NOI growth was up 2.2% versus the 2% that we discussed on our last call. In mid-August, we made the decision to push up occupancy in our portfolio for 2 reasons: first, to offset the seasonally weaker occupancy rates we historically experienced in the fourth and first quarter; and second, to help offset the additional days vacant caused by the ramp-up in our reposition program. On average, the additional days vacant for a reposition versus a normal turn is 14 days. In order to accomplish this, we increased our occupancy targets in YieldStar by roughly 1% across the entire portfolio. The result of this decision is that we currently have an occupancy rate -- same-store occupancy rate of 96% or 90 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. Based on our current pre-leasing rates, it looks like we should be able to sustain a 95%-plus occupancy rate through the fourth quarter, which was exactly what we intended to have happen. Raising the sustainable occupancy rate results in incrementally lower new lease rates. Our new lease rates for the quarter were up 1.5% while renewals were up 6.8%. We got slightly more than the occupancy gain we expected, and we've since reduced our sustainable occupancy rates by the 1%. Based on current and projected occupancy levels, we should see new lease rates increase for the fourth quarter, above the fourth quarter 2012 new lease increases. Our turnover rate in Q3 was 70% versus 71% last year. And as we expected, our percentage of move-outs to purchased homes dropped to 13.3% from 14.6% in the second quarter. This puts us roughly halfway between the move-out-to-purchased homes rate at the bottom, which was just under 10%, and our long-term average rate of 18%. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of $93.3 million or $1.04 per share, representing an approximate $2.5 million or $0.03 per share outperformance to the midpoint of our prior guidance range. This outperformance resulted primarily from: $1.2 million of additional promoted equity interest received in conjunction with a May 2013 disposition of our 14 joint venture communities in Las Vegas, Nevada; $1 million in higher-than-anticipated property net operating income; and $200,000 in higher-than-anticipated fee and asset management income. The $1.2 million of promoted equity interest received during the quarter is in addition to the $3.8 million previously received in the second quarter. The venture has now completed its final accounting and we anticipate no further income. Of the $1 million in higher-than-anticipated property net operating income, approximately 1/2 came from acquisitions that occurred in the third quarter but were forecasted to occur in the fourth quarter, and approximately 1/2 came from higher net operating income from our non-same-store communities. The positive variance from acquisitions is the result of our purchase of 2 communities in September, for a total of $116 million. Our prior guidance was based on these acquisitions occurring at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The positive variance for our non-same-store communities was primarily due to lower unit turnover costs and lower-than-anticipated levels of self-insured insurance claims. And finally, the $200,000 in higher fee and asset management income resulted from the accelerated construction timing of select third-party construction jobs. Same-store net operating income continues to be in line with our expectations. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our weighted average same-store rental rates increased by 4.9%, and our revenues increased by 4.3%. The large delta between rental rate increases and revenue increases for the third quarter resulted from unusually high utility rebilling income recorded as other property income in the third quarter of 2012. We have revised our full year 2013 FFO-per-share outlook. We now anticipate 2013 FFO per share to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.09 versus our prior range of $4 to $4.08, representing a $0.03-per-share increase to the midpoint. This increase is a result of our third quarter outperformance. Our revised full year 2013 FFO guidance is based on the following transactional assumptions for the fourth quarter: $225 million in new on-balance sheet development starts and $170 million in additional dispositions, with no additional acquisitions. $34 million of these dispositions have closed subsequent to quarter end. Based on a $200 million unsecured debt maturity in December of 2013, and a current line-of-credit balance of approximately $180 million, we will likely access the capital markets in the near future. The exact timing and composition of our capital markets activity will depend upon a variety of factors. As a point of reference, we currently anticipate that we could issue a 10-year unsecured bond in the 4% area and a 7-year unsecured bond in the 3.25% to 3.375% range. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the fourth quarter 2013. We expect FFO per share for the fourth quarter to be within the range of $1.02 to $1.06. The midpoint of $1.04 represents a $0.01 increase from the third quarter of 2013 once you exclude the nonrecurring promoted equity interest. This projected $0.01-per-share increase is primarily the result of an approximate $0.03-per-share increase in FFO due to higher same-property net operating income, as our normal third to fourth quarter seasonal decline in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover and personnel expenses should be combined with a nontypical third to fourth quarter improvement in revenues resulting from our current occupancy push that Keith mentioned. This positive variance is projected to be partially offset by an approximate $0.02-per-share decrease in FFO due to our net acquisition and disposition activities, as the contribution from $116 million of acquisitions in the third quarter will be more than offset by the impact of the $225 million of dispositions in the third and fourth quarters. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: When you're looking at the D.C. market, is there any reason, given what you're seeing on the ground there, to believe that revenue growth isn't going to turn negative in the fourth quarter and early '14 and then stay there for a while?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, Rob, I think that it's likely, that based on where our portfolio is currently, even though we were able to eke out a small positive number in the third quarter, early results in the fourth quarter look like it's certainly likely that they could be flat to slightly negative in the fourth quarter. So I think, as you look forward to next year, it would certainly be reasonable to forecast that you may get some slight negative in our portfolio. We've got a different aggregation -- or different geography of assets than some of the other companies do that, I think, have taken an earlier and bigger hit. But I think that the overall story in D.C. continues to be one of slowing down and fighting our way through some additional supply. So, yes, I think that's fair to say, but we'll give you specific guidance on that after we do our property level budgets and get them all rolled up for you in the first quarter.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then the other question is you talked about 2 fourth quarter starts, roughly $200 million or so. I mean, how are you guys feeling about new developments, sticking shovels in the ground today, in general? And are there any of your sort of pipeline communities where you've gotten more pessimistic on over the last quarter or so about starting those?
Richard J. Campo: I would say that our development pipeline -- we feel good about what we started and we feel good about our near-term starts. But I would say that we are definitely tapering off in terms of adding a lot to the pipeline in certain markets. Clearly, we're far enough into the cycle now where some properties are being impacted by construction costs and just availability of labor to get projects done. So I think that the whole industry is starting to taper off. We started seeing permits start falling in August and I think you're going to see sort of the flattening of starts, and we're going to be included in that group.
Operator: Next question is from Al Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just going to the capital markets, as you guys think about -- I think you said, Alex, you have about $170 million of dispositions. You have the $200 million bond coming due. Are you thinking about just doing like an index eligible or would you do more than that or would you look to maybe, as you said, be net sellers of assets, so you'd rely more on disposition proceeds in the coming year to help fund things? Just trying to figure out -- because, obviously, apartment prices are still pretty healthy. The debt markets have settled down. So just trying to see where you see better pricing for funding your activities.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So, to be index eligible, you have to do a $250 million bond size, and likely, we'll be closer towards that than doing a larger transaction. Obviously, we continue to evaluate it, but we'll probably -- more towards the index-eligible size.
Richard J. Campo: And as far as net selling, the market is really holding up well for these older assets. People look at them as value-add, and so the bid for them is still very strong, the cap rates are still very solid and it makes a lot of sense to sell those assets in combination with some bond proceeds to fund our business going forward.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then as far as property taxes, now that we're almost towards the end of the year. Year-to-date they're up 12%. Do you think that most of the communities have marked your properties to market so that next year that property tax reassessment should moderate or you think, next year, there's still going to be some pain in there?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: No, I think you're right. I think it should moderate. We anticipate we'll probably finish the year close to 12%, which is where we had been year-to-date. And if you think about -- most of that increase came from large increases in Houston and Dallas, which were really a catch-up for the prior 3 years. So we're certainly not anticipating that either municipality will hit us again for a large number next year.
Operator: Next question is from Nicholas Joseph with Citi.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Going back to the development pipeline. What are the expected yields on the new starts and how does that compare to transaction cap rates today?
Richard J. Campo: The yields on our new starts are 6.5% to 7%, continue to be in that zone, 6.5% for the coastal properties and 7% is in the interior. And when you look at cap rates for like properties, they're in the 5% zone, so we still are having a 150-basis-point to a 200-basis-point positive spread to the development yield. On the coast, it's actually better because you have -- cap rates are still very, very low in Southern California. And so in those markets, the spread is still pretty wide.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then just looking at the Texas markets, can you talk about what you're expecting going forward, in terms of supply and demand?
D. Keith Oden: Yes. Actually, the only market of the 3 Texas markets that is screened, if you look at 2014 job growth to deliveries, it screens less than the 5:1 that we kind of consider equilibrium, is Austin, and it screens at about a 4.2:1. Houston and Dallas still screen well above the 5:1, based on 2014 estimates on employment growth versus deliveries. Obviously, there's a lot of communities in the pipeline, but when you reflect on the kind of growth that Houston and Dallas are both seeing on the employment side, it still looks pretty manageable to us. And you've still got ratios in Houston and Dallas in the 6s and 7s. So I think, through 2014, given we have really good visibility on what's going to happen on supply, if the job growth holds up the way it's currently forecast to in AXIOMetrics, then we should be okay.
Operator: The next question is from Nic Yulico of UBS.
Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research: If I look at your year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, I mean, it dropped off pretty substantially from where it was in the first half of the year. How should we think about that? I mean, is this -- are you now starting to finally see more of a supply impact in markets, and even putting aside D.C. for a second?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, I think if you're thinking about the slowdown and what the root cause of it is -- I mean, clearly in D.C., there's a supply consideration there. If you look at the other 2 markets that screen on our 2014 numbers at below a 5:1 ratio, which would imply that you're getting net supply pressure, that's Raleigh and Austin. And we really haven't seen it yet in Raleigh, but my guess is that 2014 we will see some supply-related pressure, and I think you're going to see some in Austin as well. Fortunately for us, a huge percentage of the new construction in Austin is happening south of the university, in the downtown area, and that we just don't have assets that would be directly impacted by that. Not to say that when you have a large spike in supply, it kind of hits all submarkets. So I think, in those 3 markets, you could think of the slowdown as, into 2014, more of a supply story. But in the rest of our markets, it's kind of the math. I mean, we did 9.2% same-store NOI growth last year in the portfolio, and we guided to 6.5% this year and -- I mean, there's just no getting around the fact that, at some point, you're going to put up numbers on a quarterly basis that are less than what they were the previous year. But I think we're pretty well-positioned going into the fourth quarter, with an occupancy rate of 96%, and that's directly related to a specific tactic that we undertook to make sure that we got our occupancy rate up. And hopefully, we can sustain that through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, which are historically our weakest 2. But I think it's more just a natural progression of trees don't grow to the sky and 9.2% becomes 6.5%, and 6.5% becomes something that we -- in 2014 that's probably still well above trend.
Richard J. Campo: Yes. If you look at a 20-year average for apartments, you get about a 3.1%, 3.2% revenue growth over a long period of time. And so this is sort of an inflation plus a little bit growth business. So when you have the kind of growth that we've had, post recession, obviously it has to come down some. And it's coming down now, but it's still way above trend and it should be above trend for the next couple of years.
Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research: Okay, that's helpful. Just one other question on the guidance. You didn't change your same-store guidance for the year, yet year-to-date you're essentially tracking sort of right between the bottom to midpoint on NOI and revenue. I mean, is there any chance, at this point, to still get at the top end of the ranges?
D. Keith Oden: There's always a chance or it wouldn't be in the range.
Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research: And what gets you there?
D. Keith Oden: Here's what I would say. We didn't tighten the range. You can do that, but at the end of the day, it probably doesn't make much difference. People take the midpoint. We still see a path to get to the midpoint of our range or we wouldn't have it there. If you think about what's not -- so what's different and what's unknown, in terms of modeling the fourth quarter, would have been -- I would guess, for most people is -- we have roughly 100-basis-point positive variance on occupancy, relative to both our plan and probably most people's model. And that's a meaningful piece of revenue that we think we're going to be able to sustain throughout the fourth quarter. So if you think about the delta to where we are in the third quarter, we actually -- it looks like our revenues will be up for the fourth quarter over the third, which is very unusual for us.
Operator: Next question is from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: "Why so?" [ph], a broken clock is right twice a day, just FYI. So the occupancy push that you talked about, it contradicts back -- I think it was 2009, Rick, when you mentioned -- when you undertook a strategy to let occupancy slip. I'm wondering what changed or what's different about the 2 timelines and strategies that are causing you to look at occupancy with a little bit more of a defensive mindset.
D. Keith Oden: Rich, I'm just glad that there's somebody that's survived long enough to remember what "why so?" [ph] was. So the difference is 2 things: one, we really did want to see if we could gain some occupancy going into the fourth quarter so that -- our traditional pattern is fourth quarter falls off into the mid-94s and then that carries over to the first quarter. So we think we had sufficient strength in our markets that we could push occupancy, sustain it through the fourth quarter. But in addition to that, and in addition to that -- so I will tell you there's a little bit of let's see what can happen if you increase the sustainable occupancy rate within the pricing model. Well, guess what, it works. And I mean, within 2 to 3 weeks, our occupancy rate across our entire portfolio was up almost 200 basis points. So, that's number one. The other thing that really led us to, let's try this, are the repositions. I mean, repositions are awesome. The returns that we're getting are incredible. We have ramped up the program very significantly from what we kind of thought at the beginning of the year, because of the success we've had. But the reality is that it takes you, incrementally, 14 more days to turn a unit that's a reposition versus just doing a normal unit turn. So we didn't want to put that additional pressure in the fourth quarter without having something supplemental. So we decided -- made this conscious decision to change the sustainable occupancy rate and we're very pleased with the results.
Richard J. Campo: What I would say, just to add to that is that different times require different operating methods. And that's the great thing about having a flexible system is you can say, here's what I want to do today and here's what I want to do tomorrow, and it's just all about trying to get the best fit you can to maximize the revenue that you're trying to produce.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then, secondly, on the talk of a capital raise. I'm wondering how much of that has changed over the past 6 to 12 months, in terms of how you're financing the development pipeline? I mean, you obviously are less inclined to use equity now, but do you think, 12 months ago, when you were thinking about financing in the period ahead, that you would've been using more equity than you're willing to do now. Is that a fair statement?
Richard J. Campo: I think that's a very fair statement. You have to respond to the market, right? And we are nimble enough to respond to the market. So we have a strategic plan that we put forth to our board, that's a 3-year plan, and we toggle that plan depending upon where the most efficient source of capital is, in terms of when we need capital. So bottom line is when the stock price volatility, obviously, has changed the metrics on whether it makes a lot of sense to issue equity versus making sense to sell assets as opposed to issuing equity. And so bottom line is we're being responsive to the capital markets and it doesn't make a lot of sense to me to sell equity at $62 a share, which is below most people's NAV, to go out and build NAV and have it be discounted by the market. So it makes a lot of sense to sell assets for $1 on Main Street and reinvest that $1 into assets for our balance sheet.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, the question was really -- that was the easy part of the question. But I mean I was thinking in terms of balance sheet capacity to go this route for how much more do you think you have, and also layer into that balance sheet question stock buyback. Is that an option, too, for you?
D. Keith Oden: Rich, one of the things that is very different, for us, in this part of the cycle, from where we were in the last go around, is the fact that we have the lowest leverage in the entire sector. So it creates a lot of flexibility for us to do things that make sense at the time. Obviously, we don't want to be selling equity at these kinds of prices, and we don't have to. We have great capacity on our balance sheet because of where our leverage is, and if we have to supplement our disposition proceeds by tickling our leverage in order to fund our development pipeline and not have to sell equity to do that, then that's obviously an option that we have. As far as repurchasing shares, again, I think it gets back to the flexibility. We have more flexibility than anybody in our sector, to be able to make those decisions when, and if, we think it makes sense. So, yes, that's something that at some point you have to consider when you have the disconnect that is continuing to persist between what our assets that we're selling, then we know the valuation of those are, versus our stock price and NAV. So it's all part of the mix but we're fortunate to be able to have the flexibility to look at all those options.
Richard J. Campo: The only thing I would add to that, on the stock buyback scenario, is that I believe we're the most aggressive buyers of our stock when the stock was persistently below NAV for a reasonable period of time. That would have been 1999 through 2001. And in those days, for people who weren't around then, everybody wanted click-throughs and so real companies that have real dividends and real earnings, no one wanted them. And our stock was trading at $0.75 on the dollar and we sold assets on Main Street for $1 and bought back those assets from Wall Street for $0.75 on the dollar to the tune of almost 16% of our total market cap. So we are definitely -- we know how to do it, we know when to do it, hopefully, and it's not something that we're afraid of. It's just trying to figure out what the opportune position is.
Operator: The next question is from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Ric, in your opening comments, you characterized asset pricing on dispositions as reasonably stable. Can you elaborate a little bit on that, what you expect the dispositions in 4Q to come in at versus your initial expectations?
Richard J. Campo: They're right on target of our original expectations, and as a matter of fact, they're maybe slightly higher, but not a lot. We had put this disposition program in place in the sort of -- figured the assets out right in the first quarter, put them in the market sort of at the end of the second quarter and then marketed through the summer, and then the fall has been picking buyers and doing the contracts and all that. And we are right on where we thought we would be in pricing, and the pricing was done before the May taper tantrum that was created in the market. So, with that said, we still have a number of bids on -- more bids than we thought we would get, and we were all nervous about cap rates and what would happen to these assets because they're 26 years old. But what we found is that the buyers are not using the 10-year, number one, they've never been using the 10-year. So, number one, when the 10-year was 1.6% and now it's 2.5%, that increase didn't really affect them because they didn't really use 10-year financing anyway, they used shorter-term financing. And what we found is that about half of the buyers are using floating-rate financing and they're doing floaters and all kinds of different ways to create, really, high cash-on-cash returns for their investors. Obviously, we would not do short-term financing and floating in this environment. But there are a lot of investors doing that. So they've either stayed short on the curve or they've used floating-rate debt, and the yields that they're getting are still very substantial, so there really hasn't been any material move in sort of the B+ asset base from a cap rate perspective.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: That's helpful. The next question is just on the full year revenue guidance. We're struggling to get to this 5.5% midpoint that you're expressing confidence in, given the fact that you're at 5.2% year-to-date. Can you just talk a little bit more about the fourth quarter? How much of a favorable occupancy comp do you expect to have?
D. Keith Oden: Right now, we're just at a little bit over 100 basis points favorable to plan. So I think that is likely to hold. Because if you look at the pre-lease percentage that we're currently at and project that forward for 6 weeks, which gets you out in the middle of December, it implies that we're still going to be right in the 96% range. So that's probably a big piece, from a modeling standpoint, which you might not have in your numbers. But I would just say that we've reaffirmed our 6.5% midpoint and we think we've got a way to get there.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: And the last question is when you provided initial 2013 guidance, you suggested that revenue enhancing repositioning would have a 50-basis-point positive impact on same-store NOI. Where do you expect that to finish the year? Will it hit that target or will it be more impactful?
Richard J. Campo: We think it's in that zone. The thing that has been interesting about these repositionings, and Keith alluded to it in his previous comments about how we have been managing the occupancy, is that we're getting the premium in rent. The challenge has been that the process of getting the premium rent has had some disruptions on-site with contractors moving in and out and people working above somebody's apartment or adjacent to somebody's apartment. And the logistics of getting it done expanded the days to get it done from 9 days to 14 days, so we had a little more vacancy than we anticipated, a little more disruption to the existing tenants. But we're actually getting a little bit more than we thought we would in premium. So, with that said, I think we're sort of in the original zone that we talked about.
Operator: Next question is from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just as a follow-up to that last question. Can you just talk about what the spend is? I think you guided to $50 million to $60 million, but it sounds like there's some upside to that this year. And then as we think about '14 and '15, how big is this program going to get?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, the total size of the program is $200 million, plus or minus. And we're about halfway through that, a little bit more than halfway through that program. So, in terms of spend for the balance of the year, we're at a run rate now of about 900 apartments turned per month and they're running $11,000 per door, something like that. So, call it $10 million a month. So, balance of the year, call it $20 million and then that leaves roughly $80 million for next year if my math's right.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then second of all, just a bookkeeping issue, the 2 predevelopments, Hollywood and Victory Park. You saw a pretty substantial budget increase, but you didn't see a change in the unit counts. What was that related to?
Richard J. Campo: Well, the Hollywood transaction was related to a lease that we did. Originally, we were planning on doing -- there was roughly 25,000 square feet of retail that was required by the city, and then there was also some live/work units. And we're able to make a lease that we think really enhances the value of the property with Equinox, which is a high-end fitness group. And so we had to reconfigure the retail space to accommodate Equinox, add some more parking. So the majority of the increase was -- or a large part of it was Equinox lease in Hollywood. We did have, both in Hollywood and in Victory Park, construction escalation costs. It was probably in the 6% to 7% range. And we did have to reconfigure the garage a bit in the Victory Park as a result of requirements from the city to get that there. But at the end of the day, there was some higher inflation in construction costs, and we also added a little bit higher-end interior finishes. One of the things that we're doing now, and this is costing more for some of these properties, is we're focusing in on a problem that's been inherent for stick-built apartments forever. And that is sound transmission, being able to hear people above you or to the side of you or what have you. And we have been adding dollars, from a premium perspective, to try to improve the sound issues in these projects. So when you combine all those things, we've increased those budgets. The good news is the rents in all those areas have increased above our original projections as well. So we're pretty intact on our yields.
Operator: The next question is from Tom Lesnick of Robert W. Baird.
Thomas J. Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Standing in for Paula today. I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but could you discuss the expense growth, specifically in Houston, if there was one main item there?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Are you looking at the quarter-over-quarter?
Thomas J. Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Yes, it's all property tax-driven.
Thomas J. Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: All right, that's helpful. And are you guys seeing higher move-outs for home purchases in some markets than others?
D. Keith Oden: Market-by-market, the range would be probably at the high-end, in the 18%, 19%. Some markets still as low as high-single digits. I think the better way to think about it is kind of where we are versus our long-term average. For the quarter, we were at about 13.3% move-outs to purchased homes, which was down from the previous quarter of 14.6%. And we actually predicted that last quarter, that we thought we were going to get some pull forward just based on the level of existing home sales that were happening. I think there's a lot of impetus for people to -- as they thought mortgage rates were going to get away from them, there was a lot of impetus to get off the fence and go ahead and make a trade for a house. So we did see that and then we did get the bump up in the second quarter at almost 15%. But as we thought, it's back down to 13.3%. Now, from the standpoint of where that puts us against the long-term average, our long-term average for move-outs to home purchases is about 18%. So we're -- at the very peak of the housing boom, we were 24%. At the very bottom of the trough, we were high 9s and we recovered to about 13%. But we're still well below the long-term average. And we've been saying for some time now that we don't think that there's a race to get back to that. It's probably still a couple of years away before we see -- I think, before we see 18% again.
Thomas J. Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That's very helpful. What were some of the markets at the high-end of that range and what were some of the markets at the low-end?
D. Keith Oden: So, at the high end of the range, Denver, 24%, and this is for third quarter; Charlotte, 17%; Raleigh, 16.8%. Those are the ones that jump out at me on the high-end. On the low-end, Las Vegas, 8.5%; Southern California, 8%; Phoenix at 11.7%; Florida at 9.5%, and that would be the roll-up of Tampa, Orlando and South Florida. So those would be the ones that jump out on the low-end.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: It's actually Derek here with Steve. Can you just talk about if there's any markets where it doesn't make economic sense any longer to continue to put renovation dollars into? Rehab dollars?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, it's not market-specific as much as it is community-specific, Derek. Our underwriting, it kind of starts with what's the competitive set look like in terms of quality, age and interior finishes, and whether or not -- if we were to go through a renovation process and make our interiors, to the consumer's eye, essentially look like new construction, whether the rent premium that the new construction's getting is sufficient to justify that. So it's really more of a submarket consideration for us. So if you think about these assets, the average age of the assets that we're repositioning is about 10 years, 11 years. So it's not like we're taking 20-year-old assets and trying to turn them into something they're not. In many cases, these are assets that are incredibly well-located. But if you think about the interior finishes that were put in place 8, 10 years ago, to the consumers, to our customer's eye, it's a very different product offering than what new construction is offering today in terms of interior amenities and finishes. So if you have the opportunity to take what is an incredibly well-located asset, with a long useful life, maybe another 15 to 20 years in our portfolio, spend $11,000 per door and have the consumer, both on the exterior, because of our standard of care of how we maintain our communities, but also when they walk in as they're out shopping the new construction versus us, and we have a price point that's just below what the new construction is to the consumer's eye, it's an apple and an apple. So all of those considerations are done, really, at the submarket and the community level, rather than saying does it make sense to do it, not in Vegas but yes in Phoenix, et cetera. But, obviously, the markets where we're able to get those premiums also happen to be the markets that have had much higher growth rates and rental rates for new construction in the last couple of years.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then just thinking about that 50 basis points or so of lift this year, do you expect that to be a similar amount going into next year of what's baked in from what you spent this year and most of that 200 spend over the next year? Could it be more than 50 basis points or would you experience a similar boost?
D. Keith Oden: I think it's going to be on the same zone. We've gotten a lot more experience now, at how many days vacant, and we're I think better at turning them -- the challenge, again, is this issue of the negative impact that you do have on the existing product, and then how do you calculate what that value is and offset it against the income that you're getting from the rehab. So, we're going to do a lot more work on that and we'll provide better guidance in the first quarter.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then just lastly, with the supply that everyone's sort of worried about in Raleigh right now. Are you doing anything proactive there to mitigate it? And then just thinking about what the next few quarters were like. You haven't seen the impact yet, but would you imagine it's sort of a slow decline like D.C. has been, or is it going to be a material drop off, say, from 5 one quarter to 2 or 3 the next or maybe even 1?
D. Keith Oden: Well, point 1a is we're not building in Raleigh. So we're doing that part of it. But obviously, we're subject to -- if we get this big run-up in supply, we think it'll affect everyone. So, offsetting that, we increased our occupancy targets in Raleigh, just like we did everywhere else, and we had good results with that. So I think we're about as well-positioned as we can be. Fortunately, a lot of the new construction are in 2 submarkets, where we don't really have a lot of exposure. But that's not to say that when the whole -- if the whole market is getting turned upside down, it certainly will have an impact on us. But I think we're not as exposed as some of the other operators are to those particular submarkets.
Derek Bower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And so would you expect it to be a pretty sharp drop during one quarter or, again, just sort of a slow seasonal unwind throughout the next year?
D. Keith Oden: No, the way our leases roll, you just very rarely see anything that you would consider sharp. I mean, obviously, where that could occur would be if you had some material falloff in occupancy, and we just don't see that happening. And again, from a new construction standpoint, geographically, we're not as exposed as some folks. And then from a product standpoint, we're probably different price point than what the new developments are. So I think you're going to see, like anything else, you would see that rollout as we started to see impacts on new lease rates.
Operator: Next question from Karin Ford of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: At least one of your peers mentioned seeing some renter fatigue this quarter. Just given your comments on trees not growing to the sky earlier, are you seeing any of that and is that sort of what's behind perhaps that view?
D. Keith Oden: Well, I don't know if it's renter fatigue as much as it is just sort of the math catching up with you on 15% same-store NOI growth in 2 years. The good news in our portfolio is that even though our rental rates have moved -- and we've moved them pretty aggressively, the ability of our residents to pay, as measured by what percentage of their income the rent payment is taking, has continued to fall. Which is kind of interesting and it tells me that we're getting -- a, the folks who do have jobs are continuing to get increases in their disposable income. And overall, we probably got a little bit better demographic in our communities today than we did 4 or 5 years ago. So, look, I tend to look more at -- for sustainability of increases, at the income-to-rent ratio, which is right now in our portfolio running at about 17.2%, and it's been as high as 21% in our portfolio. So, by looking at that, I don't get that concerned about it. But I just think it's -- as you look forward and you start thinking about rental rate increases that we've seen over the last 2 years, yes, that's probably going to continue to moderate. But, as Ric mentioned, we're talking about moderation, but still well above long-term trends.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question is from Ryan Bennett of Zelman & Associates.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: I just want to follow up on your comments about development just real quick. You noted, I guess on the starts, that there's still a healthy spread between -- or you expect the development yields to kind of pencil out versus where cap rates today. And then you also spoke about how you expect to see a deceleration in permanent activity, which would suggest spreads are narrowing across other projects. Is it just a function of your projects that you're currently starting right now with the better land basis or in terms of the construction costs, particularly the markets where you're starting projects? I'm just trying to get some color around that.
Richard J. Campo: Yes, absolutely. Properties that were in the pipeline, where we had -- half the plans done, we're buying jobs out today, are definitely better off and have better construction costs, better land basis. If we had to go out and get a brand-new piece of land today and at today's prices -- because prices are over peak prices in 2007 for land today, and construction costs are back to or higher than 2007 peaks as well. So in order to underwrite new transactions that aren't in your pipeline already, it's just more difficult, there's no question. The other challenge, I think, is that as you develop the pipeline further, and this is happening to merchant builders more than it is us, but if you think about 85% of the construction starts in America are done by merchant builders. And the merchant builder model is to build and sell, and they have to believe that, that spread, that spread that they're measuring today, which is the difference between, on an untrended basis, what you're going-in yield is versus what you're acquisition rate is, right? So the question is, if you think about what's going on the public markets, the partner REITs are selling at below NAV because people are worried about rising interest rates or worried about too much supply, they're worried about single-family homes taking share from apartments, and so the same investors that are investing in apartments stocks are also investing in merchant builder development deals. And when you start going forward and saying, "If I'm going to build a property today and it costs more for land, it cost more for construction," and even though the spread today is really good, what the public markets are telling people is, or at least inferring today is that, that's not going to last for a while. And, yet, to deliver that product into 2016, '17, I think that people are getting more nervous about '16 'and '17, not so much '14, '15, but further out. So, even though the spread today is reasonable, overall, you're seeing starts decline. That doesn't mean they're going to go down to $150,000, but they're going to stabilize probably into that $250,000 zone. I think a lot of folks have been thinking that the multifamily starts are going to go -- a progression of $150,000, $250,000, $350,000, $450,000, because people like to draw lines that fit well, right? I think, today, even though spreads are good it's not going to shut the business down, but it's definitely going to moderate the business.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Great. And then just one question. I know Phoenix is a small part of the portfolio, but I noticed that revenue growth declined sequentially in the third quarter for the first time in the third quarter since '09. Just curious what you're seeing in that market, given that you had 2 starts in the Arizona markets this quarter. If it's something specific going on that we might need to be concerned about or what might have caused the sequential decline?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, I think you've just got such a small same-store pull that you're looking at that it gets jerked around by any -- you get 2 or 3 points of occupancy in a community and you're going to get that kind of a differential. It's hot in Phoenix in September. It's not a good time of year to be renting apartments. But overall, Phoenix, we really like. There's tremendous economic activity going on. The job growth, we think, will be there for 2014. And the reality is, is that there are -- because of where Phoenix has come from, there's so little under construction that we feel really, really good about our -- the 3 development communities that we have teed up in Phoenix.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: Well, we appreciate the call today and we will see a lot of you in NAREIT in the next couple of weeks. So thank you very much for being on the call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly A. Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. So how did you like our hold music today? A little different than our usual rock mix. Well, actually, all of the songs we played have something in common, and there's a specific reason we chose them. If you know the answer, please send me an email at kcallahan@camdenliving.com. The first person with the correct answer gets a shout-out on the call and the opportunity to help select music for next quarter's call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete second quarter 2013 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Alex Jessett, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Thanks, Kim. Good morning. We announced strong quarterly performance last night. Apartment fundamentals continue to be stronger than long-term trends, and we believe this above-trend performance will continue for the foreseeable future. This is a great time to own apartments. Job growth is improving, along with the single-family for-sale home market. We're excited that our move-out rate to buy homes has started to move up towards its historical average. A recovery in the for-sale market will increase demand for multifamily as it did in the 1990s and continue to support strong revenue growth. The latest multifamily supply report showed slowing permits and starts activities, which is exactly what we expected, a plateauing of the development starts that have been increasing over the last couple of years. We expect multifamily demand to exceed the supply for the next few years, continuing to support higher than long-term trend revenue growth. We continue to find opportunities to improve the quality of our portfolio through dispositions and recycling that capital into newer acquisitions and development. There's no better time to be in the multifamily business. I want to give a big shout-out to our Camden team for another great quarter. Keep it up. And I'll turn the call over to Keith Oden.
D. Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Our Camden team produced another solid set of results...
Richard J. Campo: Keith, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to interrupt you here. We have a winner to our pre-conference music connection challenge, and it's Rod Petrik. Good job, Rod. We -- the 1993 was an interesting year for music. We think some people think a pretty bad year for music, but based on the hits that we played, which were hits from 1993, '93 was a great year for a company like Camden to have its initial public offering. So we connected the music with our IPO debut. I think it's always important to take time to reflect back on where you've been so that you can apply past learnings to ensure a bright future. So just a couple of stats. In '93, we were in 1 state. Today, we're in 10. We were in 3 cities. We're in 17. We had 7,000 apartments. Now we have 65,000. We had 20 properties. Now we have 189 properties. Our development pipeline was $25 million. Today, it's $750 million. The company's market cap was $193 million in '93, $193 million, and we're now at $9 billion. We had 245 Camden team members and now 1,804. Our revenues grew from $33 million to $800 million. And I think one of the interesting pieces was our average monthly rent was $471 a month, and now it's $1,130 a month. Definitely a strong 20-year run and we think we'll be able to keep this strong performance going. We are celebrating this 20-year anniversary and our 80th conference call today with the ringing of the bell opening in the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, so watch for the opening. And hopefully, we'll open to a strong session on Tuesday, July 30. Keith, you can continue.
D. Keith Oden: Thanks. Rod, good job. Rod, I'm not sure what that says about either your taste in music or maybe it's a generational thing but well done on ferreting that out as quickly as you did. So Ric mentioned that operating conditions are still quite strong across our entire portfolio, and the results keep us on track to deliver 6.5% same-store NOI growth for the year, which is the second highest in the sector based on current guidance. This is particularly noteworthy as it follows our sector-leading 9.2% NOI growth last year. For the second quarter, rents on new leases were up 5.1%, and on renewals, they were up 7.3%. In July, activity is trending very similar to the second quarter numbers. August renewals are trending up 7.7%, with about 40% completed. For our entire portfolio, we are roughly 8% higher than previous peak rents. The overall strength of the market is shown by an average 5.4% growth in revenues for the quarter. Houston had another double-digit revenue gain, and Charlotte just missed double-digit growth at 9.7%. Denver, Atlanta and Corpus Christi round out the top 5 markets for revenue growth in the quarter, and DC Metro was in line with our expectations for revenue growth at 3.1%, up for the quarter. Vegas remembers -- remains the one soft spot with flat revenue growth. Sequential revenue growth was also strong, with Denver and Charlotte above 3%, 7 other markets greater than 2%. Our occupancy rate was 95.4% for the quarter. It's currently just north of 95%, which is right in line with our expectations. Despite the fact that we continue to push rents, our net turnover rate was 60% for the quarter versus 59% for the second quarter of 2012. Move-outs to purchase homes did tick up in the quarter, as Ric mentioned. They were 14.6% versus 12.3% the last quarter and an average of 12.3% for last year. As you recall, our move-outs to purchase homes bottomed just under 10%, so we've come a way back but we still got a long way to go. This is something we've been expecting to see for some time. We're still well below the long-term average of 18% of move-outs to buy homes. Our top reason for move-outs continues to be moving out of the city or moving closer to work at 21%. Regarding new supply, we continue to believe that current levels of new permitting relative to projected job growth in Camden's markets will not be a major obstacle to continue rental increases. We believe that the peak in multifamily completions will occur in 2015, with roughly 270,000 apartment homes delivered nationally. This translates to completions in Camden's markets of 114,000 apartment homes. The projected job -- the job growth projected for 2015 for Camden's markets is 823,000, which, if you apply the ratio of 5:1 of job growth to apartments completed that's generally required to maintain equilibrium, would imply a shortfall of almost 50,000 homes across Camden's markets in the year of peak completions. So Ric mentioned that we will be celebrating our 20th anniversary in ringing the bell on Wall Street next Tuesday, and we've seen a lot of changes over the last 20 years. Over the last 20 years, the multifamily industry has changed dramatically in many ways. This change has been driven primarily by the public companies, which have completely reshaped the way our industry serves our residents. One of the most important changes has been the emergence of large, financially strong, vertically integrated national and regional multifamily companies as opposed to the loose aggregations of assets with external advisors and third-party property management that existed prior to 1993. The evidence of this transformation is that the best managed multifamily companies today operate in the public arena. Camden has been recognized as a great workplace not just among REITs but among the best companies in the country. This year, for the fourth straight year, we were included in the top 10 for FORTUNE's list of 100 Best Places to Work. This has only been done by 11 companies since FORTUNE started compiling their list. Rarefied air indeed. So on our 20th anniversary, we say thank you to all of our Camden teammates who have helped make our company a great place to work. At this point in our quarterly call for the last 40 quarters, I have said, "Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer." As you all know, Dennis proceeded with his long-standing plan to retire this quarter, and he will be missed by all of the Camden team. The better news is that, as with all great leaders, Dennis planned carefully for his succession. So today, one streak ends and another begins. On the call with us today is Alex Jessett, making his debut as a speaker on our call. Alex just celebrated his 14th year with Camden, so most of you already know him. What you may not know is that since 1999, Alex has participated in every material transaction Camden has completed. From mergers to equity and debt offerings, joint ventures, acquisitions, dispositions, development and operations, he has been involved in every aspect of Camden's business. In some cases, he played an important supporting role, but on many cases, Alex took the leading role, working directly with Ric or me in bringing some of Camden's largest and most complex transactions to closure. Therefore, it is with great pleasure and well-placed confidence that I turn over to Alex Jessett, Camden's Chief Financial Officer.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Thanks, Keith. Last night, we reported FFO per share of $1.02, exceeding the midpoint of our quarterly guidance by $0.04 per share. This $0.04 per share positive variance is a result of a promoted equity interest we received in conjunction with the May 2013 disposition of our 14 joint venture communities in Las Vegas, Nevada. As a reminder, we owned a 20% interest in this venture. This joint venture was formed in 1998 in conjunction with our Oasis Residential merger and delivered an annual internal rate of return of 16% over a 15-year hold period. Who says you can't make money in Las Vegas? Excluding this promoted equity interest, FFO per share for the quarter would have been $0.98, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. We had 2 other nonrecurring items during the quarter which offset one another. First, we received a $1 million payment recorded as other income to release a deed restriction placed on a parcel of land which we sold in 2006. This parcel of land is adjacent to our Long Beach, California community, and we have previously restricted multifamily development on this site. And second, we incurred an approximate $1 million separation expense in conjunction with the retirement of our prior CFO. This amount is recorded as a general and administrative expense. Although this separation expense was unfavorable to plan for the second quarter, there is no significant net impact for the year as the payment was an acceleration of remaining full year budgeted compensation expense. Portfolio operation performance continues to be strong as same-store revenues increased 5.4% in the second quarter and 5.6% year-to-date. These increases were driven entirely by increased rental rates. Of note, each of our markets registered positive sequential revenue growth in the second quarter. On the expense side regarding property taxes, the vast majority of our assessments are now in, and our Texas markets were the only markets where assessed values materially exceeded our expectations. We contested many of these valuations with varying levels of success. In Dallas, initial valuations were reduced from a 33% increase to a 19% increase. And in Houston, initial valuations were reduced from a 38% increase to a 31% increase. We now expect same-store property tax expense for 2013 to be approximately $1.5 million above our original plan and 12% above the prior year. On a same-store basis, we expect the remainder of the year to track as anticipated. We narrowed our revenue and NOI guidance and modestly increased our expense guidance to account for the higher property taxes. We now expect same-store revenue growth to be between 5% and 6%, one of the highest in the multifamily sector, expense growth to be between 3.25% and 4.25% and NOI growth to be between 6% and 7%. We have also revised our full year 2013 FFO per share outlook. We now anticipate 2013 FFO per share to be in the range of $4 to $4.08 versus our prior range of $3.89 to $4.05, representing a $0.07 per share increase to the midpoint. The primary components of this $0.07 per share increase are as follows: first, the $0.04 in promoted equity interest we recognized in the second quarter; second, the $1 million payment we received in the second quarter to release the deed restriction. Although this amount was offset by the severance expense in the second quarter, for the full year, it will be a positive variance as the severance expense was merely a timing issue with no significant full year impact; and third, an approximate $0.02 per share increase related to both the timing of our remaining pro forma acquisitions and dispositions and better-than-anticipated leasing results at our development communities. Our revised full year 2013 FFO guidance is based on the following assumptions for the remainder of the year: $350 million in new on-balance sheet development starts spread between the third and fourth quarters; and $200 million in additional acquisitions and dispositions, primarily occurring in the fourth quarter, with acquisitions at a 5% yield and dispositions at a 6% yield. Based on our planned third and fourth quarter 2013 development activity and a $200 million unsecured debt maturity in December of 2013, we anticipate needing approximately $300 million of new capital for the remainder of the year, and we anticipate utilizing the capital markets opportunistically. The composition of our remaining 2013 capital activity depends upon a variety of factors, including capital market conditions at the time we go to market. As a point of reference, we currently anticipate that we could issue a 10-year unsecured bond at 4.15% based on a 2.55% 10-year treasury and a spread of 160 basis points. Last night, we also provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2013. We expect FFO per share from third quarter to be within the range of $0.99 to $1.03. The midpoint of $1.01 represents a $0.03 increase from the second quarter of 2013 once you exclude the nonrecurring items. This $0.03 per share increase is primarily the result of the following: first, an approximate 2% expected sequential increase in same-property NOI, as revenue growth from the combination of rental rate increases and increases in fee income as we move into our peak leasing periods more than offset our expected increase in property expenses due to normal seasonal summer increases in utilities and repair and maintenance costs; second, an approximate $400,000 decrease in core general and administrative expense due to the removal of budgeted compensation expense for our prior CFO; and third, an approximate $400,000 increase in NOI from our 1 development community remaining lease-up. Of note, this 1 community is Camden City Centre II, which is profiled on the cover of our second quarter supplemental package. This Houston development is now 84% leased and is expected to stabilize a full 3 quarters ahead of our original pro forma, with rental rates 25% higher than projected. We anticipate delivering this development at a 10% yield. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Derek Bower of ISI Group.
Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I'm not sure if I missed this, but where is occupancy today? And can you talk about how new leases trended throughout the quarter? At NAREIT, I think you said that new leases at that time were about 6%.
D. Keith Oden: Yes. Right now, occupancy is just north of 95%. We were 95.4% for the second quarter, and that's exactly in line with where we would expect it to be this time of year. New leases, 5.1%. And then subsequent to the quarter, it's been in line with that. Renewals are 7.7% for the quarter. And in July, they've continued that trend.
Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So June new leases were 5%?
D. Keith Oden: No, no. For the quarter, new leases were up 5.1%. In July, new leases are up in line with the 5.1%.
Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Got it. And then just which markets faced the most risk from new supply in your portfolio? And what impact do you think the 20% supply increase in uptown Dallas, you think, is going to have in that market in your view?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, I think the 2 markets where we've got the imbalance right now with regard to projected employment growth with new deliveries would be Austin and Raleigh. Those are the 2 that would be -- that would screen the most risk with regard to new supply. Actually, yes, uptown Dallas, there's a lot of new stuff coming, but the job growth in Dallas is all -- if you take that relative to what the total new supply is, there's not nearly enough new supply coming for the job growth. Obviously, if you -- in any particular submarket, if you've got 2 lease-ups going on right next door to you, there tends to be pressure because lease-ups act differently than stabilized communities. In particular, if it's a merchant builder, they have a tendency to sprint for the barn. And if they're not hitting their numbers exactly, they get real aggressive on concessions. And there's no way you can avoid that in a -- someone that's immediately -- immediate proximity to your communities. But I don't think that -- Dallas certainly isn't on my radar screen of the markets that I'm worried about. Rent growth, either this year or next year.
Richard J. Campo: I think the other thing that's supporting uptown and also supporting Interloop [ph] Houston in Texas, in general, in these urban markets is that you've seen a real increase in the urban population moving from suburban to urban. And that trend was sort of starting to happen before the recession. And then after the recovery side of the equation has come about, you've seen that accelerate where young people want to be where everything's happening. They want to be inside the loop in Houston, they want to be in downtown Austin, they want to be in uptown in Dallas and in those urban markets. So not only are they going to have great job growth in these markets, but you also have excess demand generated by the idea of these young people getting jobs. And they want to be where the action is, which are those markets.
Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just lastly, looking ahead to your NOMA development, given the supply that's going to be in that immediate area, what's the risk that there's a change to your initial yield there in the first year, whether it comes from additional concession usage or longer lease-up time?
Richard J. Campo: Right now, we still like the NOMA market. As a matter of fact, the interesting part of NOMA is that if you go back 4, 5 years ago, there was nothing going on there, and it was really a very transitionary neighborhood. And now with all the new development, it's really hot area. So I think the addition of NOMA will be great for our portfolio. We will obviously watch the market and make sure that we -- that the numbers that we are underwriting are good. And I think long-term, it's a great market, and we'll just have to see. But I don't think it's affecting our numbers at this point. The rents are actually higher at NOMA I than we had originally anticipated when we opened it up in the first quarter of 2014. So we're a ways away from pulling the trigger on NOMA II, obviously. But our numbers for NOMA I are fine.
Operator: And our next question will be from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Which cost pressure you're seeing on construction? And how did the projected yields differ for the developments delivered in the next few quarters versus what you're underwriting for the developments that you're starting today?
Richard J. Campo: Well, there definitely is construction cost pressure. When we bought out our first round of jobs, we had significant construction savings in those jobs, and that definitely helped yields. The good news though is that I think rental rates have gone up enough to offset the construction cost increases so far. It does make newer deals harder to pencil, and I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing a plateauing of the starts, if it is just more difficult to make the numbers work. Early yields that we had were sort of out of control as good. As Alex pointed out, our City Centre project here in Houston is at 10% cash-on-cash yield. We aren't going to be able to do deals like that in the future. But the properties that we are going to start this year and next year, even with construction cost increase, the rental rates have offset the construction costs or increased rental rates have offset this. We're still in the 7% zone in terms of returns on these starts for this year and early next year.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And you've talked about all the changes you've seen over the last 20 years at Camden. So looking into the future, what markets would you like to increase your presence in? And where could you see yourself decreasing?
D. Keith Oden: We're pretty comfortable with our allocation currently. We have -- we're pretty meticulous about modeling how much exposure we want to have, and it has to do with the size of the market and the projected NOI growth rates long-term in those markets. So we're actually pretty comfortable with it. We are not currently investigating or doing any footwork in any markets beyond our existing platform. We just think the opportunities in the 17 markets that we're currently in are substantial now and will be over the next 20 years. So I think that we're comfortable with our portfolio. There's clearly opportunities in some of our less-represented from a percentage standpoint, the Phoenixs of the world. We're only -- we're somewhere around 3% or 4% of NOI in Phoenix, and that's probably going to trend up over time. We've got -- we just think there are significant opportunities in these markets that we serve. The other thing is, is that our footprint is so different from the other public companies in the sense that we've got entire markets where no other public companies are represented in any meaningful way, one of which is Houston, by the way. But that also happens in Phoenix. It's true for the most part in Raleigh. There are a couple of -- there's a small amount of -- small presence in -- public presence in Tampa. So we're in markets where other -- we just don't have a great deal of overlap or have opportunities to develop and acquire and transact where we still run into the public companies, and I think, for the most part, that's a good thing for us.
Operator: And the next question will come from Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Keith, when you're sending out lease renewals, what's the spread these days between what you're sending out and what you're actually achieving?
D. Keith Oden: Not much. About less than $10. There have been times on the $1,000 lease -- average lease rates, so certainly less than 1%. That hadn't always been the case. That number moves around quite a bit, but in today's environment, as we apply our revenue management, we've got plenty of traffic, we've got plenty of qualified traffic. And if -- and so there is a small spread, but it's not meaningful.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then Houston's been sort of king of the hill for a long time now for you guys. I mean, how much longer -- when you take a look at the runway between wages, supply, et cetera, how much longer do you think Houston stays there before a Charlotte or an Atlanta starts bumping it off in terms of year-over-year revenue growth, just simply, if nothing else, because it had been so strong for so long?
Richard J. Campo: I think it can be strong for a long time and here's why. There's a secular change going on in the energy business. Shale gas and shale oil is going to change the U.S. energy view or the energy complex dramatically. Just a couple of interesting numbers. There are 13 million square feet of office space under construction in Houston right now, all right? 83% of that office space is 100% -- or is leased, so there's only 17% spec space out of that 13 million. All those buildings being built are energy companies that are going to house very high-paid folks. And so what's going on here is that the energy companies who are continuing to invest in shale, given that Houston is the energy capital of the world, all of the activity that's going on around the world is all handled through Houston, not only the technology aspects of managing flows and mud and things like that but also the financial side of the equation, M&A, financial services that relate to the energy sector. So this is not a blip in Houston's growth. This is a long-term massive shift going on for U.S. energy dominance, and it's based in Houston. So I don't see a scenario where unless there's some dramatic shift in the shale gas and oil and gas play, which most people don't think -- I think in the early stages of this production, that, that's going to change much for Houston. So a Charlotte doesn't have energy like this, and you don't have a secular change going on in the banking system or at Raleigh or -- the energy business is here to stay in Houston, and it is as strong as I've ever seen it. These jobs are incredibly good, too. They're good jobs, $150,000, 25-year-old technicians working Internet systems, stuff like that. So I think it's a long-term play here.
D. Keith Oden: And Rob, Witten's forecast for employment growth in Houston for the next 3 years, this year, it's right at $100,000; next year, it's $70,000; and the year after that, about $72,000. And the history of this series has been upward revisions every year. So it can be really good in Houston for a long time, although honestly, Charlotte at 9.7% for the quarter is not very far behind.
Operator: And our next question will come from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just 2 really quick questions. First, just going to the -- you said that you have permits sort of leveling out. Just sort of curious, with a backup -- with rising interest rates and rising construction costs, are you seeing the private guys get impacted or just everyone's redoing their pro formas to make the numbers work and it isn't really impacting their plans from what you can see?
Richard J. Campo: I think it's impacting everyone. I mean, we have canceled projects that we had that we are working on in California, for example, and elsewhere that we had under contract and we've spent dollars on. I don't think it's just private guys getting impacted by construction costs. I mean, anecdotally, it's affecting everyone. I will say that there were a couple of surveys that have come out from NMHC and also from the National Home Builders apartment groups that show expectation of private and public developers are that their starts are slowing down because of these issues. And I know people -- we know a lot of these private guys, and they're -- while they're plateauing, keep in mind, a lot of these people had Legacy land deals just like we did. And so when the market turned and you were able to then build those out, they built them out, and that's why it ramped up so fast. And so today, if you're going to add to that pipeline that you had, you have to go out and pay above peak prices for land and rising construction costs, rising interest rates in an environment where it's much more difficult to make your numbers work. And so most people are not cutting their pipelines, they're just keeping them very stable, but they're not increasing their pipelines. And I think that's the challenge, and the worry that everybody had in the market was that you saw the straight line going up from $200,000 to $300,000 to $400,000 because the apartment business was so good. But I think that -- so I think it's going to plateau, and that cost issue is definitely part of the equation.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then the second question is, Ric, given that you are the unofficial spokesman of Fannie, Freddie, what's your take on what the government does? Right now, they seem to be getting a free lunch by confiscating all the profits from Fannie and Freddie without compensating the private investors. Do you think they just continue that because of the budget wars and this is essentially free money for the administration or you think that something will actually get resolved with the 2 entities?
Richard J. Campo: I think the answer is yes to the first part. At the beginning of a crisis, they said they're going to wind it down in 5 years. They didn't do that. And now there's another 5-year plan. It is free money, and they have bigger fish frying in the government than Freddie and Fannie. And when they're printing money the way they're printing, they're just going to keep collecting those dividends. And then until something dramatic happens with either tax policy or some grand compromise or whatever, I don't think anything's going to happen. I think you're just going to go along and get along.
Operator: Question is from Jeremy Metz of Deutsche Bank.
Jeremy Metz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: You talked about being comfortable in your current footprint. Obviously, you sold big JV exposure in Las Vegas, and you talked about Phoenix exposure trending up over time. Can you just give us your long-term view on Vegas? And is that one where we should expect to see the percentage churn down over time?
Richard J. Campo: Well, Las Vegas has been the only market in America that hasn't come back very strong, primarily because of -- the bust in Vegas was sort of double. You had a casino hotel oversupply, and then you also had a single-family oversupply. So it's a double hit, and it's just starting to come back. Some of the analysts and market trend folks believe Vegas will be in the top 5 growth, from a revenue perspective, markets in 2015, '16. Over the long term, Vegas has been actually a very, very good market. It just happened to be one of the biggest bust markets, obviously. But I think it's instructive. Based on what Alex said earlier, we sold the portfolio there that we owned for 15 years after -- when we bought Oasis because we want to lower our exposure in Vegas, and we made a 16% compounded IRR on that asset, so in spite of the ups and downs that Las Vegas had in the last cycle. So we like Las Vegas long-term. And it doesn't make sense for us to sell down our core position there before the market turns because I think it's going to have a nice run, and it makes sense for us to keep that piece of the portfolio through that period. Long-term, I'm not sure what we'll be doing there, but it's a great long-term market.
D. Keith Oden: 6% of our total NOI contribution at this level. And as Ric mentioned, it's the only one of our 17 markets that has not, in any way, participated in a recovery. In fact, we're still about 18% below peak rents in Las Vegas. And that's not true -- I mean, every other market in our portfolio is either at or past peak rents, and markets like Houston are up double digits. And so it's -- we think its time will come, and whether it's '14 or over into '15, long-term, we think it's -- there'll be a good opportunity to grow cash flow there.
Jeremy Metz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: All right. I appreciate the color there. And then second question. Just -- it was interesting, earlier, to hear you talk about the positive move-outs for home increasing this quarter. Just -- if you -- which markets are you seeing the highest move-outs for home? And are any of them above historical averages at this point?
D. Keith Oden: Yes. We'll get that number to you, but I will tell you that at 14.6% across the portfolio, with the long-term averages 18%. And so on average, we're well below that. I mean, I see some low 20s in Colorado, which is still below the long-term peak in Colorado. The rest of them were in the low-teens.
Richard J. Campo: The key issue and the reason I brought that up is because we continue to get a lot of conversation and not so much from dedicated REIT investors but from non-dedicateds. And they can't understand how our business is so good in spite of single-family houses being cheap and the interest rates being low. And that all of these companies that are renting houses, they just have this view that the commodity of a house is directly competitive with an apartment. At the end of the day, we've seen cycle through cycle through cycle that single-family and multifamily can do well in a growing economy together, and one doesn't have to suffer versus the other. And I think that the idea that people are just financially driven from an apartment to a home because it's cheaper is just not the case. It's very demographically-driven. If you look at ages of age cohorts, the people from 25 to 30 have a lower propensity to own a home than people from 30 to 35. And as you go up higher in age, the higher propensity to own a home, and that has to do with the ability to save money for down payment. Their social situation, people getting married later in life, having kids later in life all are good things for our business. And I've always been fundamentally -- a fundamental proponent of a strong housing market, in general, including single-family and multifamily.
Operator: And next, we have Jana Galan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jane Wong: This is Jane Wong for Jana. Just a quick question. If you could go over what happened in L.A. expenses during the second quarter. And then my second question was just if you could comment on what's going on with your portfolio in D.C., kind of what kind of changes you've seen in the last few months.
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Absolutely. Well, I'll take the first part of that question. So L.A. expenses at 15.6% up on a quarter-over-quarter basis is almost entirely due to some favorable property tax adjustments we had in the second quarter of 2012. If you took out those favorable property tax adjustments in the prior year period, the expenses will be up right around 4%.
D. Keith Oden: Yes. On D.C., trends in the last couple of months, I mean, if you look at the numbers for the quarter, we're at 3.1% revenue growth. And if you kind of drill down into that a little bit, we think of the -- our exposure is 3 separate markets. We've got the Maryland exposure, the Northern Virginia and the district. If you kind of parse those out, the strongest of those 3 is actually Northern Virginia at about 3.6%. Maryland's hanging in there at 3%. And the weakness that we've seen has been in the district. And we -- our portfolio was basically flat in the quarter in the district. So you mesh all that together and it's 3.1%, but it's definitely a tale of 3 different markets. Overall, the 3.1% revenue growth is exactly where we thought we would be when we laid out our plan for the year. So it's -- in any year where we weren't having 6.5% portfolio-wide NOI growth, 3.1% would look pretty good, but by comparison, it's weak. So the only market that we have that's weaker than that really is the Las Vegas market, but that's -- from a historical perspective, that's a really strange place to be, to be us lamenting about 3.1% NOI growth in the market.
Jane Wong: But do you think the year-over-year growth will continue to slow this year in D.C.?
D. Keith Oden: I think we'll -- I think our plan for the entire year was about 2% to 3% NOI growth, and I think that's where we'll end up.
Operator: And the next question is from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So I was kind of following the transcript and the most profound comment that was made today was we'd expect the remainder of the year to track as expected, which isn't the most profound comment I've ever heard from you guys. And so I'm wondering if you could be a little bit more profound. And if you could think about -- a lot of things are -- kind of completed the property tax issues kind of known now. What is that -- what are the hangs in the balance for the second half of the year and into 2014 that could change things directionally one way or another? Is it a government action? Is it rising interest rates that maybe fuel some activity in the transaction market? What do you think can happen that's kind of unknown at this point?
Richard J. Campo: I'm not sure it'd be profound, it might be profane. But -- so I think when you talk about -- I know everybody wants to have something with wow, right, OG, we're going to increase our guidance, we're going to increase revenues or -- I'm not sure what the wow factor is, but bottom line is, is that we are going to make our numbers this year. If we hit those numbers, it will be one of the top same-store NOI growth companies in the sector. We're clearly looking at a lot of transactions. It's a very interesting market out there, the uncertainty about the 10-year and what that's going to do to the private side and all that. But who knows? I think we're very -- positioned very well to do lots of interesting things.
D. Keith Oden: Yes. I think, Rich, if you think about our plan for the balance of the year, we are where we are. From the standpoint of what we think we're going to accomplish on revenue growth and control expenses, we've always done a great job of doing that. This year, we've been just absolutely crushed by property tax increases, and those are -- it's always problematic when you lay out a plan at the beginning of the year and you don't have valuations or tax rates. So -- but other than that, we're trending in really comfortable position on expenses, and we think we're in really good shape on revenues. On the -- if you think about our plan, what has to happen in the next 5 months to kind of hit these numbers in the variation is on acquisitions, dispositions. And it's a wildcard right now because we have assets in the marketplace right now that we're currently going through the marketing process on. We're not far enough along where we've got meaningful feedback on price discovery, but we think we'll have that the next 30 to 45 days. And that is -- it's a little bit of a wildcard now because you can't -- we haven't seen through the cycle from deals put on the market in light of the new 10-year. But we do know that the assets that we're selling, which tend to be the older assets in our portfolio, those are more likely to go into the hands of leverage buyers and leverage matters. And 100 basis points on a 10-year and -- or the 5 year is a pretty big deal. So that's -- in terms of exposure, we'll see what comes back out of this marketing process. And on the acquisition side, it's very competitive. You think -- you would kind of think that with the uncertainty and the interest rates, that you might be seeing a little bit of softness on pricing. But the reality is on the assets that we're interested in from an acquisition standpoint tend to be more core assets, and they tend to be in markets that people want to be in right now because there's tons of job growth and rents are going through the roof and it's all good. And so people are still running pretty big rental increases through their projections, and it's -- you've got to get in there and get after it. But it's very, very competitive for the stuff that we want to buy. And for the stuff that we want to sell, it's pretty rate -- interest rate-sensitive.
Richard J. Campo: Remember, this is not a sprint, this is a marathon.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Right. But you think rising rates or the threat of rising rates prompt some sellers that have been on the fence to move a little bit more quickly and fear of that happening in front of them?
Richard J. Campo: I think there's some of that out there, for sure. We have -- you've seen in the acquisition market, as Keith points out, that it's very competitive, and there's still a wall of capital, that's private capital primarily driven. And bottom line is whenever -- I think it's sort of like single-family houses, right? As interest rates go up, people go, "Oh gee, I better get in." And so you have kind of a spike up in people entering the market. I think the same thing is going through certain sellers' minds as well. So there may be a spike in properties for sale between now and the end of the year or portfolios to sell as well. So I think it's uncertain as to what happens, but we just have to see.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then last real quick. I have this on the Avalon call. Do you think single-family rental business, do you think that's a good business? Do you think it will work for everybody, some people or not at all? What is your thought about how that's going to play out?
D. Keith Oden: So the debate is whether it's a business or a trade?
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Right.
D. Keith Oden: I am clearly in the -- it's a trade stamp. And we spent a lot of time and energy about -- early in this process about 1.5 years ago, trying to make sure we completely understood what the economics were, both from a, is that a risk to us, number one; and number two, is there an opportunity there for us. And after all the machinations and spending a lot of dollars and intellectual capital, we came down on the side of that -- if you buy $100 for $50, you can make money. But it's an IRR play, not a cash flow play because the -- and if you look at these -- the models that people are trooping around and not to get in a big argument with people who think -- who are doing IPOs in single-family homes. So if you just look at the internals and you see that they're using $500 for CapEx for a single-family home turn, that's just astonishing. I mean, the number could be 5x that by the time you rip the carpet out and replace the sheetrock. And you're going to have 10% or 15% skips and evictions, there's no way you're not. And how do you know when they left? And how do you know what they took? I just think the numbers are silly on the CapEx side. So from a holding -- long-term holding standpoint, I don't think it makes much sense. But if you bought $100 for $50 and you turn it once or twice and you catch a little air under your wings in the market, yes, absolutely, some people can make money doing that.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just a quick question. I mean, if you look at the supply in D.C., Raleigh and Austin, a couple of the markets seems to be back-end-loaded. Can you just give us your thoughts in terms of leasing strategy for the back half in a couple of those markets where you are facing a decent amount of supply?
D. Keith Oden: Yes. The supply -- again, even in a market like D.C., right now, if you just look at the aggregate numbers and you say, "Okay, job projected, job growth versus total supply," you would come away not too -- not that worried about it. The challenge though is that supply doesn't happen ratably across all the markets. And so, for example, our D.C. portfolio, on our call with our leadership team there the other day, the folks who have directly competitive lease-ups, I'm talking about across the street, right next door, yes, they are feeling anxiety about that because these people are -- they're coming in. They got -- they start out with 300 apartments to lease, and we only have -- at any given time, we only have 20 apartments to lease. So it's a different game that they're playing. They have to play it very differently, and we have to respond to that. So the communities where we are having direct lease-up competition, sure, we are and, sure, we're responding to that. And we're being more aggressive, and we have to take that into consideration on our pricing. And you can't just blindly say, well, revenue management, yield starts had to do -- this is the price and that's the end of it. We do a lot -- we have a lot more handholding and a lot more overwriting of lease recommendations on those communities. That's how you respond to it. But once that lease-up gets out of the way, then I think you're back to a more normal market condition in D.C. There will be some pressure, which explains why they're at 3.1% revenue growth and not 6% like the rest of our portfolio is.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Fair enough. [indiscernible] follow up. I'll put the -- I'll try to combine 2 questions into 1 here. As you look out kind of capital planning starting for '14, what's kind of the -- obviously, big redevelopment plan this year. What's kind of the redevelopment spend you're looking at for the next couple of years? And then also, Alex, in your comments, you gave great color on real estate taxes. I'm curious if you could talk about the insurance in a couple of the other areas as well?
Alexander J. K. Jessett: Yes, absolutely. So we'll drop the insurance part first. So we actually just went through the renewal of our annual insurance premium. We had originally anticipated that the insurance premium will be up about 5%. It actually ended up about 10%, primarily due to the Sandy impact. So even though we're down here in Texas, we had the impact as well. And so that, coupled with -- in the first quarter of the year, we told you we had some additional insurance losses due to a fire in California and some hail. That's actually ending up with our total insurance. It's marketably up over our original plan. And we'll be in line with the increases that we're seeing on the tax front for the full year basis.
D. Keith Oden: And on reposition spend, we'll probably going to be in an equivalent amount next year and this year. It's roughly an equal split. We had 2 different pools of assets that are kind of running through the numbers probably in the $75 million range.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: How much redevelopment do you potentially do you estimate within the portfolio currently in total?
D. Keith Oden: What we've spent to date? The total program, and this started really last year, but '13 and into '14, is about $200 million.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: You touched on the topic I wanted to ask about a little bit earlier, but I just wanted to circle back and make sure I understand your viewpoint on this. On the transaction market, with debt costs up 100 basis points or so over the last quarter, you are active both acquiring and selling. You're seeing no movement in cap rates on the stuff that you're buying, which is probably Class A. And it seems as though you expect a potential movement on the assets that you're selling, which tends to be Class B, but no evidence yet. Is that correct?
Richard J. Campo: That is correct. And I think the question will be, will investors who have capital to spend, they were getting outsized returns. And most of the private guys that I know were just giddy saying, "Gee, I expected 7% cash on cash and got 12%." So the question is, is 12% the expected rate of leveraged return that a private guy wants just because you were getting 12% and they expected 7%? So the question becomes, did the 100 basis points wipe out the 12%? Probably. But they still can get 7% or 8% or 9%. And the question will be whether the market adapts to that. You look at our fund, for example, that we did with Texas Teachers, and we're making cash-on-cash returns, I think, over 10%, 10%, 11% cash-on-cash returns. And our budget was like 8%. And so does that mean that we would then adjust our underwriting saying, "We will not do a transaction unless we get 11% cash-on-cash -- or leveraged cash-on-cash return." So I think there's going to be some -- it's uncertain now in terms of how these private guys are going to react. But I think when you look at unleveraged IRRs, which most people look at unleveraged IRRs before they're leveraged, those haven't really changed that much. And that's getting to the Class A unleveraged IRR kind of analysis that pension funds and people like us do. But the leverage buyers don't even calculate what unleveraged IRRs are. They don't care about that. They just care about what their actual cash leveraged IRR is. And so I don't think that the rate going up from an incredibly low number to still a pretty incredibly long-term low number is going to have as big an impact as some people think.
David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay. And then just on the -- maybe more so on the types of assets that you're trying to sell. Any evidence out there of leading indicators of cap rates so far, deals getting dropped or retraded?
Richard J. Campo: Well, clearly, there's a retrade. Everybody tries to retrade when there's some major change. And we have a lot of activity on these assets that are being marketed today. So at least the number of buyers, the number of people that are doing tours, the number of confidentiality agreements is at the same level it was prior to the increase in rates. So it will just be interesting to see how it all plays out. But right now, we don't have any bids on these assets yet, and we'll just have to see.
Operator: And next, we have a question from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: As you are underwriting new development projects for backfilling the pipeline, how are you thinking about the product mix that you would like to have? Are your new projects gravitating toward all luxury Class A high-rise? Or -- just walk us through how you're thinking about the product mix that you want to have, given the demographic shift ahead of us over the next, let's call it, 10 years.
Richard J. Campo: Well, the product mix is a function of where the asset is, okay? So if we're building -- for example, we have a development site in Houston in Midtown that we've owned for a long time. And that's going to be a high-end urban small unit, highly concentrated efficiencies and 1 bedroom, very few 2 bedrooms because that's the market. Now on the other hand, when you build in Tampa, for example, in the suburbs, you're going to have a higher mix of 2 bedrooms and fewer efficiencies and larger -- sort of on average square footage perspective, larger apartments relative to an urban play. So we have always liked to have a mix between suburban and urban and high-end versus sort of more call it instead of A+++, it's A- or something like that so that you can have a price point that people can afford. And we've done really well in our suburban stuff in Florida. And we've done really well in our urban product, too. So it really depends on the actual merchandising mix that we're trying to get for a specific market.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And any thoughts about creating brands specific to those, much like Avalon is doing?
Richard J. Campo: No.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo, CEO, for any closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: Great. Well, we appreciate everybody on the call today, and we will look forward to waving at you on Tuesday -- next Tuesday when we open the stock exchange on our 20th anniversary. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly A. Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2013 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Keith Oden, President. Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer, will not be on the call today as he is attending to a family medical need. As such, the financial section of our prepared remarks today will be covered by Keith. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour, as another multifamily company will begin their call at 1:00 p.m. Eastern. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Thanks, Kim. Good morning. As Marshall Tucker, in their -- in our pre-conference music lyrics suggest, the sun is definitely shining in our Texas markets. Same-property revenue increased 5.9% and net operating income increased 6.7% for the quarter. It looks like 2013 operating fundamentals will be again well above our long-term average. The continued above-trend performance is driven by macro factors that should keep growth above trends through at least 2016. Apartment fundamentals in our markets continue to benefit from above-average job growth compared to the rest of the country. Supply concerns are in most people's minds, we know that. The new supply that's being delivered in and started in 2013 doesn't come close to meeting new demand and filling the supply deficit that was created during the financial crisis. REIT advisers estimates that the multifamily supply deficit created during the 2009 and -- through 2012 period is nearly 500,000 apartments. The single-family housing market has finally started to improve, with home prices and new construction rising. We welcome the improvements in the single-family home market as it adds jobs and creates more rental demand than move-outs to home purchases takes away from rental demand, so we end up with net new rental demand as a result of the stronger economy. The single-family housing market has been a drag on the economy, so far in their recovery, hopefully that is turning around and will provide a boost to the economy. We continue to focus on improving the quality of our portfolio through recycling older properties, buying and developing new generation of properties. Our balance sheet is one of the strongest in the apartment sectors and was confirmed by a recent investment grade rating upgrade from S&P. This puts Camden in the S&P top 10 strongest rated companies in all of REIT land. A big thanks goes out to our on-site and corporate support teams for another great quarter. Keith, I'll turn the call over to you now.
D. Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. We're off to another solid start this year. Although our NOI growth rate has moderated from the extraordinary levels of 2012, from a historical perspective, our growth rate is still very strong. All of the data that we review with our on-site teams continue to indicate that 2013 will be a very good year in Camden's markets. For the first quarter, same-store average rents on new leases were up 1.9% and renewals were up 6.9%, and that compares to 3.1% and 7.9% last year. For April, new leases were up 3.3%, renewals up 6.9% and May renewals are also trending 6.9%, with 42% completed. Revenue growth year-over-year was strong across almost all of our 16 markets, with double-digit increases in Houston and Charlotte. Houston continues to see exceptional strength, with an 11.6% increase in same-store revenue over last year, and we currently maintain a 96.6% occupancy rate throughout the quarter. This trend is likely to continue throughout the year. Although weak by comparison to our other markets, Las Vegas and San Diego did have revenue growth of 1.7% and 2.7%, respectively. Our same-store portfolio averaged 95.2% for the first quarter, 95.4% for the month of April and currently stands at 95.6%, which leaves us very well positioned as we head into our peak leasing season. Our occupancy rate for the first quarter was roughly 50 basis points higher than planned, which was the main component of our outperformance in revenues. Traffic remains strong across all markets. Despite our aggressive renewal rate increases, our turnover rate was 47% compared to 48% in the first quarter of last year. Our residents' financial health continues to improve, and our current average rent as a percentage of household income stands at 17.7%, a very healthy number. Also, our reported move-outs for financial reasons or job loss fell to 5.1% versus 6.1% a year ago. 12.3% of our residents moved out to purchase homes in the quarter compared to 11.5% a year ago and 13.3% in the fourth quarter. This is still well below our long-term average of roughly 18%. Moving on to first quarter results. We reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2013 of $86.6 million or $0.97 per diluted share, representing a $2.8 million or $0.03 per share improvement from the $0.94 per share midpoint of our guidance range for the first quarter that we established at $0.92 to $0.96 per share and an increase of 17% per share from the first quarter of 2012. The $2.8 million in FFO outperformance for the first quarter relates primarily to a 2.2% -- $2.2 million in better-than-expected results from our consolidated and joint venture communities and approximately $700,000 in land sale gains we recorded in the first quarter on the sale of 2 outparcels of undeveloped land adjacent to our development communities in Houston and Atlanta. The $2.2 million better-than-expected results from our communities is a result of the following. First, property revenues from our consolidated communities exceeded our forecast by $1.3 million, due primarily to the combination of slightly higher average rental rates and occupancies, lower bad debt expense and higher fee income from stabilized communities. Additionally, we experienced higher-than-expected leasing velocity at each of our 3 lease-up communities and our development pipeline. As an example, Camden City Centre II in Houston, which began lease-up in the first quarter of this year, is already 46% leased and 33% occupied at rental rates over 20% above the original pro forma. Property expenses from our consolidated communities came in approximately $700,000 better than our expectations, with the controllable expense categories of salaries and benefits, utilities, repairs and maintenance and other property expenses coming in $2.4 million below our first quarter expectations. This favorable variance was primarily the result of: first, lower salaries and benefits due to lower medical benefits claim cost and slightly lower base salary and bonus payments; second, lower utilities expense due to a mild winter in the majority of our markets and the absence of budgeted rate increases for electric, water and gas utilities; and third, lower repair and maintenance expense due to lower-than-expected unit turnover rates for the portfolio in the first quarter. The positive variance in controllable expenses was partially offset by unfavorable variances of $1.1 million in property insurance expense and $600,000 in real estate tax expense. Property insurance expense was $1.1 million higher than anticipated, entirely due to our self-insured deductibles related to a 37-unit fire at one of our communities in California and hailstorm damage at one of our communities in Atlanta. Barring any significant property claims in future quarters, we expect same-store insurance expense to drop back down to the $3.2 million range for each of the last 3 quarters of 2013. Property tax expense for the first quarter was $600,000 higher than planned, entirely due to revised expectations for valuation increases at our Houston, Dallas and Austin communities, based on preliminary assessments we've just received. We now expect same-store property tax expense for 2013 to be approximately $2 million above our original plan due to the revised valuations for our Texas communities. As a result, 2013 same-store property tax expense is now anticipated to be 13% above 2012 levels. Based on all of the above, we still expect 2013 full year same-store expense growth to be in the range of 3.2% to 4%, but we will probably be in the upper-end of that range due to the change in our property tax expectations. The last component of outperformance from our communities in the first quarter is a $200,000 favorable variance in FFO contribution from our joint venture communities. Like our wholly-owned communities, our 37 operating joint venture communities experienced similar positive gains in revenues and slightly lower-than-expected expenses. Turning to earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2013. We expect projected FFO per diluted share within the range of $0.96 to $1 per share. The midpoint of $0.98 per share represents a $0.01 per share increase from the first quarter of 2013. This $0.01 per share increase is primarily the result of the following. A $0.02 per share increase in FFO due to growth in property net operating income as a result of 2 things: first, an approximate 1.9% expected sequential increase in same-property NOI as revenue growth from the combination of rental rate increases, higher occupancies and increases in fee income as we move into our peak leasing periods more than offsets our expected increase in property expenses due to the normal seasonal summer increase in utilities and repair and maintenance costs; and second, the NOI contribution from our non-same-property communities and development communities. And lease-up will be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter as the additional NOI contribution from our communities in lease-up and net acquisition disposition activity completed so far this year will be offset by revenue lost at our student housing community in Corpus Christi, Texas. Occupancy always declines significantly in the May through August period at this community. The positive impact of growth in property NOI is being partially offset by a $0.01 per share decline in FFO as a result of the $700,000 in land sale gains recorded in the first quarter of 2013. No land sales gains are expected in the second quarter. We've not changed our same-store growth or projected transactional assumptions for 2013, but we have increased the bottom end of our 2013 full year FFO per share guidance range by $0.04, primarily to reflect our FFO outperformance in the first quarter of this year. We now expect full year FFO per share to be in the range of $3.89 to $4.05 per diluted share. At this time, we'll open the call up to any questions that you might have.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nicholas Joseph of Citi.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You mentioned that traffic remained strong, but can you give the actual figures for traffic relative to last year and then for D.C. specifically?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, actually, our traffic, the way that we have historically calculated, is -- on a year-over-year basis is down about 7%. Although it's kind of interesting because in one of the things that we are in the process of doing is taking a hard look at whether we should redefine how we historically have counted traffic. The incidence of Internet traffic has gotten to be such a huge part of how people go about finding us and us transacting business, where we can literally sign leases online without someone ever actually physically coming to the community and filling out a guest card. So we are in the process of rethinking that. Clearly, we've got enough traffic in our communities because we're -- I think we're doing a better job of targeting the traffic, and we've got plenty of traffic to maintain our occupancy for the quarter, above 95%. And right now, we stand at about 95.6%, which is really high for our portfolio, from a historical standpoint.
Richard J. Campo: I think what I would add to that is that we are now utilizing a very sophisticated big data analysis of our traffic and our spend on advertising. And one of the questions that you have when you have high occupancy and high lease conversion rates, it's, "Why have the traffic if you don't need it?" We don't need the traffic right now. So looking at traffic numbers year-over-year, I would say if you're an efficient operator and using big data and you're analyzing this with all the smart MBA types that we have looking at this data, I got to tell you, I'd rather have it go down substantially more, have occupancy go up and have our spend from an operating cost go down. So I think if you -- you got to be very careful about looking at traffic trends in this sort of big data Internet environment because I think they're meaningless.
Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of your development pipeline, how much cost pressure have you seen from increasing costs, and how does this affect your assumed stabilized yields?
Richard J. Campo: Cost pressure is definitely out there, and it really depends on the market. But we've seen cost pressure in markets, primarily Texas for now, because the market is so strong. We're also impacted by the oil plays in South Texas. But we're seeing anywhere from 5% in some markets to 10% or 12% in others. The good news, however, is that yields haven't really been negatively impacted yet because rental rates have risen faster than anybody projected or that we had projected in our numbers. The sort of a good news is, is we've got a lot of development in before the cost increases. As a matter of fact, we saved somewhere in the $30 million range of construction costs that was under budget in the last cycle, and our developments leased up at an average of 10 months early because of the strength of the market. So what's happening now is that costs are definitely under pressure. And in some markets, South Florida, for example, we're not seeing much cost pressure; in Atlanta, not much cost pressure. But clearly in Texas -- D.C.'s got some pressure because of all the construction going on there. But I think that the cost pressure is actually a good thing for the market because people are having to really sharpen their pencil, and the easy deals and the low-hanging fruit is over. So you have a situation where it's much more difficult to make the numbers work because of this cost pressure.
Operator: The next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Keith, can you just talk a little bit about the D.C. market and where you're seeing pockets of strength, where you might be seeing pockets of weakness and what the operating strategy is as you face the big deliveries here in '13?
D. Keith Oden: Yes. So let's talk about the -- let's kind of set the stage, first of all, on the deliveries. We think that this year, we're going to get somewhere in the range of 10,000 apartments completed in the D.C. Metro area, and obviously, that's spread out all the way from Maryland to Northern Virginia. In places where you have concentration of activity, that's where you're going to see the impact because on a macro basis, if you think about the deliveries that we had last year in D.C., we delivered roughly 5,000 apartments. So add 5,000 to 10,000 we're going to get this year, you got 15,000 apartments. And yet in D.C. last year, we had about 40,000 jobs, and this year, the numbers are in this 35,000 to 40,000 range again. So kind of using the 1:5 ratio that we have used historically, that's really not that out of kilter from a supply and demand standpoint looking at it over the 2 years combined. So our operating plan this year, we've got a target of -- NOI target of roughly 4%. That's about what we did in the first quarter in D.C. So we think we're on track to deliver somewhere in the 4% same-store NOI growth rate in D.C. this year. Now that's not to say that there aren't individual pockets where if you've got 3 deals that are all trying to get through the door at the same time that there's not going to be some pressure on the lease-up, there certainly will be. The good news is, is that most of our portfolio is not located in those markets that -- our stabilized portfolio is not in the markets that have the most development activity. We do have -- we just opened our -- the doors and began lease-up on our South Capitol project, and that's leasing up, we're having great traffic, we're having good conversions, and it's well above our original pro forma rate for rent. So, so far, so good. The second -- the other community that we have is under construction. I don't think we deliver units there until 2014, and that's North of Massachusetts or NOMA. Those 2 are both in the district proper. As you get out beyond that, it gets pretty spotty as to whether we think there's going to be specific impact to our communities. But overall, D.C. feels like a market that, again, in certain submarkets, you're going to have some pressure, but overall, I think we're going to be okay.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Have you guys -- in any of the submarkets where you're likely to face meaningful supply, have you guys been sending out renewals even earlier than you otherwise would to try to lock these people down before they get the opportunity to move out into a new project?
D. Keith Oden: No, Rob. We haven't -- we're not -- a lot of this 10,000-unit supply that's coming on this year is backloaded because it got started in the middle of last year. So we're not to that point of having to make any kind of strategic pricing or renewal decisions based on the supply, not to say that we won't at some point in this year, but not so far.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just lastly on the development. You guys have sort of said this year, 250,000 to 400,000 of starts. Is that still -- given what you're seeing out there, still about where you expect to be? And the -- is the schedule in the supplemental likely to be the sort of ordering at which stuff comes out?
Richard J. Campo: We're still comfortable with the 250,000, 400,000, and yes, the supplement is sort of in the order it will come out.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Just 2 questions. The first question is, as Texas is clearly benefiting from the oil boom and energy, how are your thoughts about future investment in Texas relative to other areas? How are you thinking about that? Are you thinking that you want to grow your exposure to Texas? Or does this mean as you're investing more in Texas, we should expect more selling of older assets to keep the exposure constant? And as part of that, just was curious about the land sale in Houston, just given -- I didn't know if that's factored in here or if that was sold for different reasons.
Richard J. Campo: Well, first of all, we love Texas. I mean, it's an awesome market. And when you think about what's going on in the energy complex with frac-ing across the country, but -- not only across the country, but across the world.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Not in New York, though, we don't have it here.
Richard J. Campo: Well, perhaps. You have it pretty close, though, in Pennsylvania, right? So with that said, there's a lot of discussion about how the frac-ing is going to create energy independence over the next 10 to 15 years. All that activity is happening right here in Houston. All those mining jobs or technology jobs, they're basically running all this activity around the world here. So we think that Texas overall is going to have a multiyear run that might look like the sort of oil rush in the 70s, if you will. And so with that said, we love Texas, we want to continue to expand our portfolio. Now we also have a view that you don't want to have all your eggs in one basket and you should be geographically diverse and market diverse and product diverse. So with that said, we're going to balance our portfolio over time. And we've just acquired a large property here in Houston and sold -- we funded that with 2 sales outside of Texas. But bottom line is, we'll continue our geographic focus, we'll continue to recycle older into newer and into better locations. As far as the land sale goes, the land sale was an outparcel in our Andrau parcels. I think we have 1 or 2 additional sites out there that we could develop on. But we do have a pretty high concentration of properties out there now, so we're just selling some excess land at a pretty good price.
Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then the next question is, given, Ric, you're sort of a spokesman for the GSEs. Your view of Mel Watt, do you think that this, in any way, affects the exit or the accelerated exit for multifamily for the GSEs? Or you think his main focus is going to be single-family and really should not impact the exit of the multifamily, the pace of the exit for multifamily?
Richard J. Campo: I don't think it has any effect. I think if you just remember, multifamily is the very tail -- the tiptop of the tail of the GSEs and not the dog. And until they figure out a way to exit the overall single-family situation, multifamily is going to just continue down the trail. And I think that the broader thing on multifamily, it's interesting when you think about the GSEs related to multifamily, today, the GSEs are still a big player in multifamily, but they're the biggest player. If you look at market share overall, it's in the 40%, 50% range. But if you take it and you look at the market share of the GSE relative to the top-tier markets -- to the top-tier properties and top-tier markets, they're very small. It's dominated by life companies and REITs. And where the GSEs are dominant are in secondary and tertiary cities with older, smaller, more complicated assets that none of the investment groups like publicly traded REITs or top-tier investors actually go to. So when you get there, mostly individuals and local players who play in that, and that's probably 90% funded by the GSEs. So I think with that said, there's going to be a lot of sort of grassroots pressure to make sure that there's a GSE-style entity out there to handle that -- those tertiary and secondary cities. So I think that's going to be a big political deal once they come to some resolution, which I don't think there's any political will to create a resolution any time soon.
Operator: The next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: What was the cap rate on Post Oak in Houston?
Richard J. Campo: The forward cap rate is around 5% and some change.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: How did that transaction come about? Was that marketed, or did that come to you?
Richard J. Campo: It was marketed to a select group, and we had a relationship with the seller. We actually sold -- the seller of this property, we sold them our Philadelphia property. So we sort of just changed the names and the numbers and executed the contracts. So we had a relationship with the seller. They didn't market it, but because of our relationship, we were able to capture the transaction. It's definitely a trophy asset in Houston.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about Austin? I know it's a small market for you, but I guess, the concern in Austin is there's about as much supply coming on as there is in Houston, but the job growth numbers don't look quite as strong. Is that a market that you think sort of underperforms over the next year or two relative to what you're getting in some of your other markets?
D. Keith Oden: Austin is probably at the top of our list for watching, in terms of the effect of new supply. You've got roughly 14,000 apartments under construction in Austin. We think about 9,000 of those deliver this year and about 5,000 of that spills over into next year. So it's going to be really important in Austin to keep an eye on the permitting activity. Austin is -- so the broad thought is, 14,000 apartments is a lot, I don't care where your assets are located in Austin, and so it's -- we're likely to see some impact into 2014. But like everything else, all real estate is local, and a big chunk of that 14,000 apartments is being built in the CBD and just south of the university. So if you kind of stratify what's going on in Austin, you've got almost 6,000 apartments that are being built in that, what we would call the south university and CBD submarket. And unfortunately for the folks who are under construction in that part of town, virtually all of them are targeting very high-end rents, a lot of high-rise construction. I just think there's a real -- there's a real question in my mind as to how many $2.10 per square foot apartment rentals are going to be in demand in the CBD south university submarket. So fortunately for us, we don't really have anything that competes in that submarket. The closest thing that we have is -- we have one deal under construction on North Lamar, which is north of the university. You're probably going to get some collateral damage there from the 5,000 or 6,000 apartments. But we don't really have anything in the downtown market that's currently under construction or lease-up. So I think there's good room for some healthy skepticism over what happens on permitting in Austin from now through the end of the year, and that's something that we're going to be looking at very carefully.
Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then last question is on Vegas. As you know, we were just there, and it was surprising to see the pretty substantial increase in home prices over the last 6 to 9 months, 20%, in some case, 30% in some of the submarkets there. Do you think that, that spike in home prices is going to translate through to a pickup in rent growth over the next year in Vegas?
Richard J. Campo: I think it will. I think that they're related somewhat. Part of the challenges in Vegas in the single-family home market is that Nevada implemented a legislative, I guess, procedure or law, whatever you want to call it, that has sort of masked the ability of -- or limited the ability of people to foreclose on homes, and they're trying to fix that now. So part of the problem is as you've got this sort of phantom supply of homes out there that are basically zombie homes where people are living in them, not paying the mortgage and the lender can't foreclose. So that needs to be resolved. But I think when you look at Las Vegas, you look at supply and demand fundamentals, there's been nothing new built. Demand has been increased. They do have had reasonable job growth. The casinos are starting to add more people, and the sort of employment per hotel room is starting to rise. We look to Las Vegas to actually be in one of the top 10 growth from a revenue perspective over the next 2 or 3 years. And if you sort of use Phoenix as an example, Phoenix went from -- we lost maybe, I think, 18%, 19% of our revenue there, and we've replaced -- that's all been recouped since the downturn, plus or minus a few. And I think Las Vegas will do the same thing. It's just a year or two behind or maybe 2 or 3 years behind the rest of the market.
D. Keith Oden: Yes. And -- so on the multifamily side, in 2013, we're forecasting total multifamily completions of less than 1,000 apartments. If you roll that over into 2014, which we -- you would have fairly good visibility in at this point, our forecast is for about 1,100 apartments now. My question is, who's -- who in the world build the 900 or the 1,100, but the reality is it's a drop in the bucket relative to the total embedded base. We think that we'd get 25,000 apartments -- excuse me, jobs this year, and the forecast for next year is about 35,000. If you get those 2 numbers, it's not going to -- what's happening on the housing markets will be an aside story to what's happening in employment growth relative to multifamily completions.
Operator: The next question comes from Karin Ford of KeyBanc.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: On the property tax side, are you guys through the assessment process in all your markets, or could there be any other surprises on the tax side?
D. Keith Oden: No. We're through the part of the process where we got the bad news. But we're -- we have not yet begun the fight of where we end up from the standpoint of what the final valuations are. These are preliminary numbers. We are very aggressive and assertive in how we deal with our property tax valuations that we have been historically. We've gotten very good results over the years. We have dedicated resources in-house. We use the best local property tax consultants and we fight tooth and nail. Because it's -- you got valuations -- preliminary valuations in Dallas, a 33% increase over last year and preliminary valuations in Houston, 38% increase over last year. These are crazy numbers, and we'll fight like heck. But in the meantime, the prudent thing to do from our perspective is to sort of roll those through the process and see where that puts you and reserve accordingly, which we're going to do.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Second question is on new rent -- new lease rent growth. So it accelerated from 1Q to April. Can you talk about what your expectations are, given the increasing occupancy level on your ability to keep pushing on the new rent side?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, I think at 95.6% occupied, which is kind of where we are right now, as we roll over into the peak of our leasing season, you're going to see that accelerate. Our same-store guidance this year is roughly 1% below where it was last year for revenues, and it would make sense that our new leases, as well as renewal rents, would trend below where they were last year. But yes, in order to get to our guidance that we laid out for the year on revenue growth, we're going to have to see an acceleration on the new rent side, which we always do in the second and third quarters. So I think we're -- we still feel like we're in pretty decent shape relative to plan. And again at 95.6% occupied, it tells us that we've got a fair amount of room to continue to push on not only new leases but renewals as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Spector of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Jana for Jeff. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the development questions, and particularly, how you were thinking about the size of the development pipeline in 2014 and '15 as we approach a more normalized level of supply entering the market?
Richard J. Campo: Sure. The development pipeline, we've talked about for a while being -- we're comfortable starting $250 million to $400 million annually. But with that said, you have to evaluate where you are at any point in time. And I think the point to keep in the development pipeline in a moderate level is that we're sort of finishing properties and then starting properties, finishing properties and starting properties, so that your overall exposure is managed in a reasonable way. We're also making sure that we fund these developments as we go, either through dispositions or other capital market activities. So we feel comfortable as long as we can continue to get yields that are 150 to 200 basis points over the untrended yield and cap rate that you can buy in a new asset and we're going to continue to develop. But we -- clearly, we'll watch each submarket and each property within that -- within the development pipeline gets analyzed 100 different ways as you can. And we'll make decisions as we go, depending on the micro aspects of the submarket for each development.
Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And do you like the size of the landholdings, or would you potentially be looking to sell a bit more of land this year? Or are you, on the other side, seeing attractive opportunities and could potentially buy more land?
Richard J. Campo: The land market is at fever pitch right now and really hasn't come down. I mean, land market is higher now than it was at the peak in 2007 for new development. So we have not seen any "value" in land at this point. We do -- we have a land bank that is a reasonable size, and we will -- we manage that land bank. We don't really have assets -- land that we're -- that we want to sell right now because we don't want to develop. But we'll keep -- sort of the land bank is going to be kept at a reasonable size sort of like the pipeline starts just so that if -- when the market turns -- because this is a cyclical business obviously, and if the market turns hard against us, we don't want to be sitting on a bunch of nonearning land. But on the other hand, we want to keep our pipeline robust enough to be able to take advantage of the opportunities, so there's a balance there.
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Ric, you said through 2016, you thought business would be good. I missed it. Did you say that about yourself or about the overall industry?
Richard J. Campo: I think the overall industry because you have this -- I think a lot of people don't realize how big a hole the market created in supply during the 2009, 2012 timeframe. And between the echo boomers that are still doubled-up, we still have a 7.5% unemployment rate, and the real one's supposedly 10% when you think about underemployment and things like that. So you have a deficit of supply; you have high occupancy. Most markets are -- I mean, Houston for example, to be as high occupied as it is, it's just way over trend. So you have -- you've got just a lot of great fundamental factors that should drive our business above trend for the next 2 or 3 years. And I think that, that's -- I feel pretty good about that nationally. I feel a lot better about it in our markets because we get oversized job growth relative to other markets. So that's why -- I think it's going to be good for the industry overall, but I think it might be better for us.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, fair enough. And then my second question is, with the strength that you're seeing in some of your Texas markets and maybe some of the pullback you're seeing in D.C., is there a point in time where you'll see an opportunity to be a seller in Texas and a buyer in D.C.? And when do you think that time might come to think a step or 2 ahead of where fundamentals are currently?
Richard J. Campo: That's an interesting question because we debate it all the time, should we sell here, buy there, and it's just a balancing act. And when you're 100% long apartments 100% of the time, timing markets is a really tough thing. And the great thing about the REIT world is if you want to time apartments, you just sell the apartment REITs, right, and buy somebody else. Well, the way we look at our portfolio, it's really hard to move assets around and make any big difference when you think about it on a market basis because the assets are -- you have to sell a lot of assets to move the needle. So we try to -- what we try to do is in our normal disposition program, which is, let's look at -- rank our -- force rank our assets for future growth rate, CapEx, what our return on invested capital will be for those assets in the future, we then rank those by just pure return on invested capital growth for the future. And what happens is slower growing markets tend to then come to the top of the disposition area. The challenge you get to when you start thinking about, "Well, Texas is hot, so let's sell our best assets in Texas," is that the reason they're the best assets is because they're in the best markets and best submarkets, and while somebody will pay you a very low cap rate and a very high price, the question then is, "Where do you reinvest that, and how do you get the exposure you want in those markets?" So with that said, we sort of do sell -- serve the slower growing markets quicker than we do the hottest markets. But it's always trying to balance where you are overall in your portfolio.
Operator: The next question comes from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Ric, just sort of a qualitative question. All this new supply we keep talking about ultimately will need staff to run them. Are you at all worried about pressure on payroll costs and increased employee turnover? Or do you think Camden's 100 Best Places to Work culture will actually diminish that risk by helping your retention?
Richard J. Campo: Well, I think that clearly being on the Best Places to Work list helps us recruit talent, and when you have a great workplace, people want to stay in a great workplace. So we have one of the lowest turnover rates in the industry. I don't think that just having new construction and new development and new supply puts huge pressure on the wage side of the equation. In certain markets like Texas, you do have wage pressure that's being put on by virtue of all the activity and just the buoyant economy. And so we do have some rent wage pressure there, and we feel that in our corporate office a lot, not just for on-site workers, but -- I think that we will see sort of normal wage pressure, but I don't think that -- I think that, that -- the whole idea that you're going to see a spike in job costs, I don't think you're going to see that. Keith, you want to add to that?
D. Keith Oden: Yes, Paula, that's a great question. Our turnover rate last year on-site at our communities was something just short of 20%, which is, as anybody knows, this industry knows, that's a kind of a crazy low number. And that's a combination of a lot of things. It's creating -- allowing people to be able to work at a great workplace, but it's also making sure that from a compensation standpoint, both in base salary, benefits, plus annual incentives, that we keep people at very competitive salary levels and from a total compensation standpoint. So yes, Houston is a very competitive job market right now. There are a lot of opportunities out there. But I can tell you this, it is a rare day that we lose a Camden team member to go to another multifamily company. We lose them to go leave the business, we lose them to change -- go different paths in their career. It is rare that we lose a Camden associate to another multifamily employer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky of RBC.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of operating questions. Keith, first question, you gave renewal and new lease statistics for the first quarter. What was the blended increase on rents signed in the quarter? And then, how does that compare to the first quarter of last year? How much moderation have you seen in rents, blended rents, on a year-over-year basis?
D. Keith Oden: Yes. Well, so if you think about the -- you're down roughly 1% on renewals, as well as new leases year-over-year, which is exactly where you would expect to be, given our revenue guidance, revenue actuals last year and our guidance this year. I'll get you the math on it, but it's pretty -- you can do it with me here if you want to. Your renewal increases, we're up 6.9% on renewal increases, and that's -- and our turnover rate is 47%. We're up 1.9% on new leases. So whatever that math works out to, I'll get it to you after the call. But if you think about it relative to last year, we're down 1% on both new lease rates, as well as renewals. And the blend of the two would put you down 1%, which would be right in line with our guidance.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And the second question is also an operating question. You guys are obviously ramping up redevelopment slash revenue-enhancing spending. What was the benefit in the same-store revenue number from that? And how should we expect expenses to play out over the balance of the year?
Richard J. Campo: Sure. On same-store revenue, it was about 25 basis points of pickup in same-store revenue because of the repositioning program. And we think overall through the end of the year, the NOI piece of that equation will be about 50 bps.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then finally just in terms of the units that are being turned. What kind of bump in rents relative to market are you seeing on the redeveloped or renovated units?
D. Keith Oden: So our estimated return on the incremental dollars is roughly 11% is what we're targeting. We're putting in roughly on average $9,000 to $10,000 per door and getting an 11% increase on that. That's in addition to whatever the market rate increase would be in whatever submarket that happens to be in. Roughly $105 -- about $105 per door if you take the entire program into consideration.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Ric Campo, CEO and Chairman of the Board, for closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: Great. Well, thanks for being on the call today, and we'll see you at NAREIT.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-02-01 12:00:00) =====
Executives:  Kim Callahan – Vice President of Investor Relations Richard J. Campo – President and Trust Manager D. Keith Oden – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Steen – Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer 
Analysts:  Eric Wolfe – Citigroup Kana Gallen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets Andrew McCulloch – Green Street Advisors Paula J. Poskon – Robert. W. Baird & Co. Jeffrey J. Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities Thomas C. Truxillo – Bank of America  Good morning and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) after today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kim Callahan:  Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden’s fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden’s complete fourth quarter 2012 earnings release is available in the Investor Relation section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for one hour. As another multifamily company will begin their call at 1 PM Eastern. As a result, we ask that you limit your questions to two and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Thanks, Kim and good afternoon to those of you on Eastern Time and good morning to the rest. We actually have 15 other people in the room that we didn’t name, but for support here, which we often times need. So, it’s time to turn to page on 2012, and look forward to another great year for 2013, but before we turn the page on 2012 I want to highlight what has been one of our best years in 20 years. Same property net operating income increased 9.2% over 2011 finding the high water mark in our history as a company, and one of the best in the multifamily sectors for the year. We continue to improve the quality of our property portfolio through capital recycling, redevelopment, and new development. We sold $529 million of properties in 2012 with an average age of 21 years, average rents of $800 per month, at an average capital rate of 6.3%, which resulted in an unleveraged IR of 11% for the whole holding period which is an average of 14 years. We acquired $904 million of properties with an average age of 13 years, the average rents in a $1024 per month, at a 6% capital rate based on 2013 budgets. We continue to create long-term value to our development program, and stabilize four properties producing yields in excess of 8%. We continue at $300 million to $400 million of new development starts annually. We strengthen our balance sheet during 2012 by reducing the leverage and improving all financial metrics. 2012 was a year where we spend a significant amount of time simplifying our balance sheet as well on our capital structure by reducing the number of joint ventures and partners. The only remaining joint ventures that we have are with Texas Teachers and Sierra-Nevada. A big thank you and a job well done goes out to our real estate investment construction and finance teams for their flawless execution in this endeavor. 2013 looks to be another strong year for Camden as our 6.5% increase in same property net operating income guidance adjust, our markets continue to produce more jobs than the nation as a whole, while new starts are up in every market. We expect that job driven demand will be more than enough to absorb new supply, and allow rents to continue to rise. While job growth has been steady, there continues to be a pent-up demand for an estimated $1.7 million young adult households that are still doubled up and living at home, and we know that most of those folks want to move out and want to rent an apartment at some point. Our rent to income ratio of 17.7% is well below the long-term average at 21% indicating that our residents can afford to pay more on rent for the Camden living excellence experience that they receive from our Camden operations teams. We are excited about turning the page to the opportunity that 2013 will present. We are celebrating our 20th year as a public company in July, by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange. We hope to see many of you in New York when we do that, as we begin the next 20 years in this great industry that provides quality housing to many Americans. Keith, I will turn the call over to you now?
D. Keith Oden: Thanks Rick. And consistent with prior years, I’m going to use my time on today’s call to review the market conditions that we expect to see in our core markets for 2013. I will address the markets in the order of highest to lowest ranking by assigning a letter grade to each one, and give our view as to whether we believe that market will be improving, stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview, I will provide additional details on our fourth quarter operations, and before I get to the 2013 grades, I’ll share the two biggest surprises related to our 2012 grades, and as you might expect they are both upside surprises. Last year I rated Phoenix as a B-minus improving market, and I was right on the improving part but with the 15.3% NOI growth for the year, Phoenix probably deserved a better starting grade than a B-minus. I also rated Denver as a B+ but stable market, but there is nothing stable about the 13.1% NOI growth our Denver teams posted. Moving on to 2013, our number one ranking this year goes to Charlotte, which we rate as an A+ market, with a stable outlook. After placing second in same-store revenue growth last year with a 10.8% trailing only Houston, we expect strong growth this year in Charlotte as well. Charlotte will see some of these supply this year from an estimated 4,400 completions, over 18,000 job growth expected, and our portfolio at 96.5% occupied today. We believe Charlotte will be one of our top performers again in 2013. Houston is the close second with an A rating and stable outlook. Houston is expected to remain a leader in job creation next year with a forecast of 77,000 new jobs. The energy sector continues to add jobs in consolidated operations here a trend which are showing the signs of slowing down. We’ll see 12,000 new units delivered here this year, which seems pretty normal to us as Houston averaged a 11,000 annual completions from the year 2000 through 20009. Next on the list will be Denver, which also are in an A, with a stable outlook for the third consecutive year, we expect Denver to be one of our top five performers, and market fundamentals there remain solid. Over 29,000 new jobs are projected in 2013, which should easily absorb to 6,200 completions expected to come online. Rounding out our top five spots for 2013 are Austin and Dallas, both ranked as A-minus with stable outlook, these are the only two markets which received the lower grade this year than last year, and moving from an A-minus versus an A, mainly due to competition from new supply expected during 2013, Austin and Dallas recorded 2012 same-store revenue growth of 9.5% and 8.7% respectively and are expected to post above average results again in 2013. Job growth estimates remained strong across the state of Texas with over 32,000 new jobs projected in Austin 56,000 in Dallas. New developments are beginning to come online in both markets with estimated completions of 9,700 units in Austin and just over 11,000 in Dallas, but those new unit should face solid demand over the course of 2013. Phoenix and Atlanta both get a grade of B+ with an improving outlook; we’ve seen above average revenue growth in Phoenix for the past two years and expect the same in 2013. Rents in Phoenix fell nearly 18% from peak to trough, but we’ve since recovered nearly all of that. The Phoenix economy is doing well with over 52,000 new jobs expected during 2013, and supply is virtually non-existent with a total of 1,500 new units being delivered this year. Another market expected to see strong job growth and minimal supply in 2013 is Atlanta, estimates go for 49,000 jobs and fewer than 4,000 completions in that market, which should provide us with an other very good year in Atlanta. South Florida holds on to its rating of a B-plus with a stable outlook again this year, completions were estimated around 2,900 apartments, with 21,000 new jobs being projected. New supply should be easily absorbed given tight market conditions and pretty decent job growth. Washington DC are in the B rating with a stable outlook, after several years of out performance growth in DC slowed during 2011 and 2012, and will probably continue to moderate in 2013, nearly 9,500 new completions are expected in DC this year, which will increase competition for new residents, and they provide us a challenge on some of our renewals. However job growth is projected at nearly 40,000 this year, which will certainly help, but we do expect to see revenue growth in DC moderate a bit more during the year. Next is Raleigh, also with a B rating and a stable outlook. Raleigh is projected to see the highest level of completions relative to job growth of all of Camden’s markets next year, with nearly 7,000 new units coming on line, and the creation of 16,000 new jobs will increase demand. That said, we expect Raleigh to be in the middle of the pack this year in terms of revenue growth, posting results around the mid point of our overall guidance range. Tampa and Orlando scored B ratings with stable outlooks as well, projections for 2013 job growth and completions in those markets are very similar, with approximately 25,000 new jobs, and roughly 2,000 new units supply expected in each markets providing solid demand with limited supply. The success of our recent developments in both Tampa and Orlando were testament to the solid fundamentals in those markets as leasing velocities and rental rates were well above expectations at all four of our lease up communities.  The final market rated a B with a stable outlook is Southern California. Southern California struggled a bit over the past few years with economic indicators seem to be pointing in the right direction for next year. Over 65,000 new jobs were expected. It’s definitely a step in the right direction for the California economy, projected completions are 12,400 units in 2013, and that should not materially impact the market conditions, is probably no surprise that Las Vegas place is last again this year with a C rating, but improving outlook, Las Vegas is still our most challenging market, we think it may have finally bottomed for real this time. 2012 market return to positive growth with 1.8% revenue growth in our same-store portfolio, and we expect 2013 to be marginally better. Supply is clearly not an issue on Las Vegas with fewer than 800 new units being delivered this year, 27,000 new jobs are projected in 2013, which should allow for positive absorption and improving occupancy rates over the course of the year. Overall our portfolio would rank as a B+ again this year, which puts us in a great starting position for 2013. Now, I’ll give you a few details of our same property results. Overall trends for the fourth quarter in January looked very similar to last year. Fourth quarter new leases were up roughly 0.5%, renewals were up about 7.3% versus 0.5% and 7.5% last year respectively. In January new leases were up about 1.2%, renewals up 7.2%, January and February renewals are trending at 7%, with 56% and 44% completed respectively, currently our portfolio is roughly 5.3% above the prior peak rents on an overall basis. Occupancy averaged 95.1% in the fourth quarter, and ended the year at 94.6%, the average occupancy in January was 94.8%, and the current occupancy is 95.1%. Net turnover was 52% for the fourth quarters of both 2011 and 2012 completely flat year-over-year. Year-to-date turnover was 57% in 2012 versus, 56% in 2011. And overall traffic has declined, but still remains very strong levels in all of our markets. Moveouts to purchased homes were 13.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus 11.2% in the prior quarter of 2011. Moveouts rental homes actually fell during the quarter to 3.6% versus 4% for the full-year, and the top reason for moving out of one of Camden’s apartments was either moving out of city, or the state, or closer to work, at 18%, and transfers to other units of Camden Property’s were second at 13.5%. Finally I want to thank all of our Camden team members for making Camden a great place to work, a distinction recognized by Fortune magazine for the sixth year on a row, and our fourth straight top ten finish. Being included on the list of the top 100 companies to work for is an honor that we claim on behalf of our team members, and all of the other outstanding real-estate investment trust. At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Dennis Steen Camden’s CFO.
Dennis Steen: Thanks Keith. I’ll start today with a few comments on our fourth quarter results, and then move to 2013 earnings guidance. Camden reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of $85.9 million or $0.97 per share diluted share, $0.01 per share above the $0.96 midpoint of our prior guidance range of $0.94 to $0.98 per share. Result come in $0.01 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range resulted primarily from two items; first property net operating income exceeded our forecast by $1.6 million, approximately half of the positive variance was due to the NOI performance of our operating properties as both property revenues and expenses performed slightly better than expected producing a 9.2% year-over-year growth in same-store NOI, slightly above our expectation of 9% growth. The other half was due to NOI pickup from the slight delay of several dispositions into the later of half of the fourth quarter, and the disposition of Camden Live Oaks moving into January of 2013. This positive variance in property NOI was partially offset by higher property management and G&A expenses primarily related to higher bonuses paid to non-executive employees in recognition of 2012’s out performance. All other components of income and expense were generally in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. Moving on to 2013 earnings guidance; you can refer to page 26 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2013 financial outlook. We expect 2013 projected FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $3.85 to $4.05 with a mid point of $3.95 representing a $0.33 per share or 9% increase over 2012. The major assumptions in components of our $0.33 per share increase in FFO at the midpoint of our guidance range are as follows. A $0.29 per share or $26 million increase in FFO related to the performance of our 44,395 units same-store portfolio. We are expecting positive same-store net operating income performance of 5.5% to 7.5% driven by revenue growth of 4.75% to 6.25% and expense growth of 3.2% to 4%. A $0.32 per share or $29 million increase in FFO related to increased net operating income from our non-same-store properties resulting primarily from the 20 communities acquired in 2012, and four development communities were stabilized in 2012, and the incremental contribution from development communities currently in lease up. We’ll also have an $0.09 per share or $8 million increase in FFO related to additional net operating income from expected 2013 acquisitions of operating communities, and a $0.05 per share or $4.5 million increase in FFO related to reduced interest expense primarily as a result of the pay-off of various secured notes in 2012, but favorably priced issuance of $350 million in unsecured debt in the fourth quarter of ‘12 and $3 million in additional capitalized interest expense expected in ‘13 related to our 2012 and 2013 development starts. Additionally, we’ll expect a $0.04 per share or $4 million increase in FFO related to reduced minority interest expense resulting from the redemption of our preferred units in the first quarter of 2012, and our 2012 acquisition of our partners interest in two consolidated joint ventures, we expect no minority interest expense in 2013. These above positive are going to be partially offset by a $0.29 per share or $26 million decrease in FFO related to lost NOI from both 2012 completed dispositions, and 2013 anticipated disposition activity, and in a $0.11 negative impact from common shares issued in 2012, a $0.02 per share or $1.7 million decrease in FFO related to reduced equity in income of joint ventures resulting primarily from the seven joint venture community sold in 2012, and our consolidation of Denver West as result of the purchase of our partners 50% interest in the fourth quarter of 2012. And a $0.02 per share or $2 million decrease in FFO due to an increase in G&A expenses resulting primarily from cost related to the move of our corporate headquarters later this year, and higher incentive compensation expense resulting from the amortization of awards granted in 2012, a year with great performance, which are replacing the amortization of awards granted for 2008, a year challenged by the great recession, that have now become fully amortized in 2012. Additionally we anticipate a 3% increase in base compensation. Taking a closer look at our same-store expense growth, a 3.2% to 4% for 2013, we are expecting the largest increases to be in property taxes and in insurance expenses. Property taxes are projected to be up 10% in 2013 6.5% as a result of anticipated increases in assessments for our properties in 2013 due to continuing increases in real estate barriers. And a 3.5% is related to a higher level of favorable tax settlements of protests that were completed in 2012, thus reducing our 2012 expense. Actual settlements were $3.2 million in 2012, and we are forecasting approximately $1 million of settlements for 2013. Same-store property insurance expenses are expected to be up 17% in 2013 after declining 3% in 2012, and 7% in 2011, the declines in insurance expense for 2012 and 2011 resulted from lower levels of self insured property in general liability insurance claims. Our projection for 2013 insurance expense assumes a 5% increase in policy premiums, and a return to a more normalized level of self insured office. The remaining categories of same-store property expenses are projected to be relatively flat to 2012 amounts, which was dated by a 2.5% reduction in repair and maintenance expense resulting primarily from a reduction in unit churn costs as a result of our increased level of repositioning of units in 2013, which I will discuss in a minute, and a reduction in our door-to-door thrash removal costs due to the successful renegotiation in 2012 of our thrash removal contracts. Page 26 of our package also details our expected ranges of acquisitions, dispositions, and development activities. The midpoint of our 2013 FFO per share guidance assumes the following, $300 million in on balance sheet dispositions, $53 million of that has already occurred in January, with the sale of Camden Live Oaks, and the reminder is spread throughout the year. $300 million in acquisitions, also spread throughout the year, and $325 million of on balance sheet development starts. We’ve also provided guidance on the impact of the ramping up of our reposition program to upgrade interior finishes at 39 of our communities over the next two years. Our guidance assumes we will reposition approximately 5,500 units in 2013 at an average cost per unit of $10,000, generating an estimated $95 per month rent premium and an estimated return of 10% on our investment up on stabilization. These communities will remain in our same-store portfolio, and the 2013 projected impact from the revenue enhancing repositions included in same-store NOI guidance is estimated to be 50 basis points as read premiums and reductions in churn costs, will be partially offset by increased space vacant on the reposition units. Based up on our planned 2013 transaction activity and the $200 million in unsecured debt maturities for the fourth quarter of ‘13, we anticipated needing up to $350 million of new capital for 2013, and anticipate accessing the capital markets opportunistically. The composition of our 2013 capital activity depends up on a variety of factors including capital market conditions at the time we go to market, but will likely include an unsecured bond offering in the second half of the year. As a reminder we currently have full availability under our $500 million unsecured line of credit. For the first quarter of 2013, we expect FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.96 per share. The mid point of this range represents $0.03 per share decline from the fourth quarter of 2012. The $0.03 per share decline is primarily the result of the following items, a $0.02 or $1.5 million decline in same-store NOI resulting from a 3.4% increase in same property operating expenses almost exclusively due to increases in property taxes and insurance expense for the reasons I previously discussed, which is only partially offset by a slight increase in same property revenues due to the continued improvements in rental rates, partially offset by a slight decline in other property income due to expected seasonality, and $0.01 or $900,000 decrease in FFO related to a decline in NOI resulting from the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activities. NOI lost on our fourth quarter 2012 dispositions, and the sale of Camden Live Oaks in January this year is greater than the NOI gained from our fourth quarter of 2012 acquisition. I will now open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) And our question is from Eric Wolfe of Citi.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Hey good afternoon. One of your peers call yesterday, they talk about supply being more of factor in the markets in 2013 versus 2014, the basic thesis being that investors first look to the costal markets, and then sort of begin to broaden their basis out to the Sundale markets, just wondering weather you see this trend happening, and if there is some concern about the fact that companies like Lennar and others are trying to built out there a multifamily business?
Dennis Steen: So I think that I guess my view is that starts in the non-coastal markets we’re pretty limited to the sort of the urban core and they still are fairly light in the suburban part of these markets, so I would say that ‘13 I don’t have any concern about ‘13 having trouble with supply at all. I think ‘14 when you look at some of the projections out there for some of the folks that we follow like Ron Witton and others, they show ’14 and ‘15 actually accelerating, but it’s not supply issue, it’s really job growth. Most folks believe that ’13 is going to sort of be a goal along get along here from a job growth perspective 150,000, 200,000 jobs, but after all of the sort of government issues are dealt with this year that ‘14 and ‘15 actually accelerate job growth wise and supply does not really tick up dramatically in ‘14 or ‘15, we think the supply is going to stay on a national basis somewhere in the 220,000 to 250,000 units a year. We need 300,00 a year to meet demand after you take out the obsolescence so, we haven’t seen any major increase in the non-coastal markets and aren’t really worried about ‘13 or ‘14.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup:  Great that’s very helpful, and second question is just as you kind of sit back and look at how your markets have performed over the last couple of years, and obviously there has been a lot of talk about whether multifamily and singe family can coexist, but have you seen any correlation between how the single family markets have performed in your markets, versus the multifamily has the strongest single family have been also the strongest multifamily or vice versa or is the relationship not really been a strong relationship between the two.
Richard J. Campo: I think it’s a pretty good relationship if you look at Texas for example you had which is one of the best markets in America for multifamily and jobs, Texas didn’t have a housing burst for say no big run up in prices and no big decline in prices, but from a start perspective there is starts in single family homes have been doubling here in Texas, and their spending more for houses and that sort of thing, so that clearly has had a beneficial correlation to multifamily, because you’re in a situation where you’re adding construction jobs, and adding all the activities that happens in single family market, and that’s better for the economy overall, which drives multifamily demand as well. So I think the idea that a single family home the single family market improves the multifamily can do well in that environment, it’s just not or not the case, and if you look the ‘90s as a good example, call as the home ownership years when everyone was buying a home and the home ownership rate went from 64% to almost 70%, a multifamily did incredibly well during that time frame, and we had net positive absorption big job growth, and big revenue growth as well during that time frame. So I think unless something happens where you have a bubble caused by incredibly low interest rates, and credibly easy access to home loans, which I don’t think it’s going to happen, then I think that the correlation between strong housing markets in general including single family could drive multifamily as well.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Make sense thanks for the detail.
Operator:
 of :
Kana Gallen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you, good morning.
Dennis Steen: Good morning.
Kana Gallen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Your DC results were very strong in fourth quarter, I was wondering if you could comment given the concerns of the new supply DC of the year portfolio maybe because of the sub-markets, where you are located or perhaps of the price average price points let it do a little bit better than some of the peers there reported thus far.
Dennis Steen: Yeah. I think that if we think about our portfolio in DC Metro, it’s all the way from Northern Virginia up through Maryland we have two operating assets in the district and a couple of others under construction there now, but when we look at a submarket level we just don’t think that we’re likely to be very much impacted by what the new supply that’s coming in the DC Metro area, I think that some of that it’s get down to, we just had a great execution from our teams in DC, if you think about same-store last year, we were in the 4.2% range, and I think our game plan for 2013, is somewhere in the 3% to 4% range again on the same-store. So I think we’re looking for a year that we look a lot like 2012, yeah you’re going to have some more supply, but we’d also, we’re forecasting about 50,000 new jobs that puts a little bit of pressure on the overall ratio, it’s from the standpoint of the new deliveries to job growth. It’s slightly below the five times level that we think is equilibrium. But it’s foreign change, so I think it’s the margins that’s not going to be a huge issue for us as long as we get the 50,000 jobs that are forecasted in the DC Metro area.
Kana Gallen – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator:  Next we have a question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O’Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill:  Hi, good morning down there.
Dennis Steen: Good morning, Alex.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill:  Dennis on the capital front, on your $350 million of capital needs this year, you stated unsecured, but you didn’t talk about equity, are you guys planning on using the ATM, are you planning any equity issuances part of that $350 million, and part of where that it’s going is developers post credit crisis have been using a lot more equity than pre-credit crisis, so given that you guys are pretty active developer just want a better understand what we should expect on that front?
Dennis Steen: Just kind of look at what we did this past year, we did a lot of de-levering this past year and also prefunding a lot of our developments that are going to be coming out of the ground in 2013, so as we look at it today, we are $200 million maturing in the fourth quarter, I think we are going to have the significant piece of this capital need funded by debt as I mentioned, and you might have a minor piece with ATMs, but once again we will just have to see based up on the conditions at the time, so I can go back $350 million you see there, I would think you would definitely think of at least $250 million of that would be debt.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay, and so if we are modeling the other $100 million we can just do ratably on the ATMs throughout the year.
Dennis Steen: Yeah, you can see some combination of ATM an additional debt.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay.
Dennis Steen: Will not make that much of a difference to your numbers, I don’t believe.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. Second question is yeah just going to the earlier questions about supply and everyone jumping into the states including Lennar, all that said, supply is still well below I mean Atlanta for example is forecast to be well under supply versus historic. What do you guys seeing, are the banks just have they really learning the lesson or regulators just being very tough on them. It just seems hard to believe that with the under supply and the favorable dynamics of apartments that we’re just not seeing the supply ramp up even quicker than what it is right now?
D. Keith Oden: I think there is a couple of things driving that Alex, first of all Lennar, it’s interesting that they announce $1 billion multifamily deal when Lennar has been a competitor of Camden for the last 10 years. Okay, Lennar isn’t doing anything new other than trying to capitalize on the hard multifamily market and drive investors think about them in that way, but Lennar has been building apartments from at least for a 10 or 15 years, they just didn’t publicize it, so they are not a new competitor which I think most people don’t realize. Second the issue on supply is this, we started 211,000 units this year, 2012 I mean and so when you look that compared to the bottom, we had 75,000 unit start at the bottom of the cycle and now next year, I think we’ll probably add from 211 to maybe 220, 230, so what’s going on in the marketplace is that I think people have sort of learned some lessons in that the merchant builder model has changed dramatically, the sort of big [Bahama] 30,000 units under construction, 20,000 units under construction, merchant builder model is done. They might do 5,000 units, but not 20,000 units and part of that has to do with the capital structure that the banks look at, in the past the merchant builders used to guarantee the debt, generally the 70% debt, 30% equity scenario, and thanks really didn’t look at sort of what their tangible capital was on their balance sheets. And today they are, and so I think there is a limiting factor, which has to do with just the size of the company. And then second, investors the equity side of the equation, I think is in probably more cautious than the lending side of the business, and you sort of have a group of equity investors, who have a place there investments, and they have two or three in Houston for example, two or three in various markets in there, sort of waiting to see what happens in that environment. The other thing that sort of coming into the business today, which could have a dampening effect on starts is construction costs. The construction costs, went down from peak to trough probably 30% in type 1 construction may be 20%, for stick and now that has been reversed, so there is a lot of discussion and anxiety about what kind of numbers you are able to produce with construction costs, and folks have had some pretty rude awakenings on building projects out having 10%, 15%, 20% increases in the cost to build. So you do have some pressure on the cost side of the equation and investors on the equity side are definitely being more cautious than they were last time.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill:  Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator:  And the next question is from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets:  Thanks good morning down there. So just following on that development question as it relates to you guys, so (inaudible) is increasing their development pipeline primarily through (inaudible), but obviously they made a commitment to development and grow the development portfolio, are you that’s in mindset, I mean it looks like from third quarter to fourth quarter, you just kind of transition from your development pipeline to your under construction pipeline, but what do you think about the growth of your development effort in 2013 and 2014?
D. Keith Oden: Well, we have been pretty consistent with that, we’re going to add to the portfolio $300 million to $400 million a year, and if you take the entire pipeline that we have, it’s over $1 billion, but the bottom line is that we are not going to start $1 billion in any one year, we are going to manage it prudently the real when you think about the last cycle, we had too much development pipeline, and we had too big of a land pipeline, and we are not going to do that again, we will be more prudent in our development endeavors, we have unlike the last cycle been prefunding our development through the combination of equity and debt, and we think that’s the right strategy. So in terms of development you can count on $300 million to $400 million of development that annually through the next two or three years, and if the market continues to be buoyant from that perspective, we’ll get the numbers that we like we’ll continue to do it.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So if you thought that it was going to be a better an accelerating market next year, and the year after, I’m just trying to extrapolate development expenditures, and confidence in management, is there such a thing with you guys, or are you kind of just stick into that $300 million to $400 million and not showing your cards.
Dennis Steen: So Rich it’s more an issue of the way we view the development pipeline, which is unlike merchant builders or folks that we are kind of in the market, and out of the market, they got a catch lightning in a bottle twice, which is once when they start, and once when they exit on valuations. And that’s not the way we view it, what the way we view it is, we are producing product at a wholesale rate, and locations that we want to own for the next 20 years. So ramping up dramatically, you’re dialing back dramatically is more of behavior, I think it’s a little bit more consistent with the merchant build model. I don’t think as Rick said, I think we’ve given guidance that will add $300 million to $400 million to the pipeline this year to go with what we started in 2012, and assuming conditions still a favorable in 2014, and I think you could probably expect somewhere along that line as well. Project lease up and roll off of that which gives us the steady state development pipeline at an aggregate level that we are extremely comfortable with, given our debt metrics, and our commitment to prefunding, so I think it’s a core confidence of ours, we have to renew and refresh our portfolio across 15 markets, and we’ll continue to do that through both acquisitions and new development.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: And then the last follow-up question is on the dividend increase, how much of that was a function of having to do with taxable net income issue or you just woke up one day and said I want to raise the dividend by 12.5%.
Dennis Steen: Yeah, it was definitely not mandated by a need to deal with our tax characteristics, it was just simply a dividend increase based up on our increase in cash flow.
D. Keith Oden: And also Richard long-term stated policy has been to increase the dividend of roughly 50% of the FFO growth rate, and if you take what we actually did in terms of the dividend increase forgetting, what our guidance was at the beginning of the year, we saw significantly beat our guidance relative to last years dividend increase, that’s the reason, why it looks like its above the 50% level, but if you take – what we actually delivered in 2012 plus what we expect to deliver in 2013, we are pretty close to that 50% metric.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Sounds good, thanks.
Richard J. Campo: Okay.
Operator: And the next question is from Rob Stevenson, Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities:  Good afternoon guys, just a couple of quick questions on cap rate, can you talk about what the cap rate was on the 12 acquisitions excluding the joint venture purchases and then also what it was on the disposition, and where you guys are on the expectations for stabilized yield on the current development pipeline?
Dennis Steen:  Okay, so the first one on the acquisitions, the 2013 budget has the 6% cap rates, we bought those during the year, so it’s probably in the mid volumes in terms of cap rates. On the dispositions the cap rate was 6.3% on average, so it was mid sixes call it. And which I think, it’s interesting when you think about that 23 year old assets or 20 plus year old assets, and there wasn’t a huge spread negative spread between the two and that’s something we are capitalizing on right now, we think it’s really good time to sell all and then buy new, because both cap rates present just not as wide as they tended to be in the past. On the new development, we have 6.5% to 7.5%, so call it seven and some change on new development that we started.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities: Okay, and at this point I mean, is 150 basis point enough for you guys on development from a risk reward standpoint, I mean that seems low relative to sort of historical norms.
Dennis Steen: The average has been from 100 to 200, we’re comfortable with the 150 basis points of positive spread to the cap rates we’re buying now.
D. Keith Oden: And also Rob it’s probably, you’re talking cap rates on acquisitions, dispositions, which are in one case, with 21 year old assets, and other case with 13 old assets, if you are talking apples-to-apples cap rates on new construction core product, you probably go four handle on it, today versus a 7% that we’re developing, we are probably north of 250 at this point on apples-to-apples.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities: Okay, and then just lastly Keith, I mean just in terms of your market outlook, which is the market that you would feel least confident, betting your total comp for 2013 on the performance of?
D. Keith Oden: Least confident.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities: I got to believe that you guys are sandbagging a little bit right, as normal I mean a little bit of sandbagging in there to, so that you’ll have beating all the numbers, but I mean which one is the one that sort of the least amount of confidence in continuing to be an A or a B as we go throughout ‘13.
D. Keith Oden: I think to me the market that has the most potential variability in it, there is two; one is Raleigh, based on the new amount of construction relative to the size of that market and the projected job growth, so you might have some fresh air there, I think we properly capture that in our little forecast for 2013. The other is just at a 20,000 foot level is California. And the uncertainty of the couple of things the overall fiscal situation and how that plays out in terms of what real job growth is going to be, the out migration of Phil Mickelson not withstanding him changing his mind, I think it’s a real issue in terms of the tax structure in California. And then on top of all that, if you want threatened about something Prop 13 is certainly something to threat about, if what happens what they are currently talking about is a surplus. We’ll see if that actually happens, if it doesn’t, and they have to go back to the well on revenues. I think they are some risk associated with the – they end up getting it through revisions to Prop 13, since they now the Democrats now have a super majority in both House’s so I think that’s real.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities: All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question is from Rose (inaudible) of UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks it’s Derick on for Rose. Circling back on your outlook for DC, can you comment if you have seen or expect to see any change in cap rates, inside and outside of the circuit.
Dennis Steen: We haven’t seen much cap rate, changes in DC at this point. I think that the transaction activity has been consistent, and there hasn’t been a very anytime major change in cap rates at this point.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay thanks. And then I think you mentioned, you’re still about 350 bps below historical rent to income. Is there any markets where you’re actually above the respective historical average.
Dennis Steen: We’ll have to get back to you, I don’t have the detailed market information. We’ll be happy to do that offline.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay fair enough, and then just lastly did you give the moveouts for financial reasons?
Dennis Steen: We’ll get back to you in one second. Financial reasons in 2012, was 5.2%.
Unidentified Analyst: And for the quarter?
Dennis Steen: The quarter was 5.5%.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. Great thank you.
D. Keith Oden: All right.
Operator: And the next question is from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning, guys.
Dennis Steen: Good morning. Michael.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Talk a little bit about what your market rent growth expectations are for ‘13, relative to ’12. I mean I think you said, you kind of wants the market, how does that compared to any markets where you expecting a significant drop up or drop off or a significant pick up there. And then just curious, on the redevelopment spending that’s included in the numbers. You’ve talked a little bit about the plans to roll that out, what’s kind of that, what that’s going to kind of entail? What kind of drag you expect a little bit how the benefits picking up in the back half of the year, just walk through the program a little bit more.
Dennis Steen: So without going market by market through the 2012 revenue versus 2013 kind of same-store projections across the board, if you think about where we were in 2012, we were at 6.5%. This year guidance is 5.4%, just kind of eyeball in it, I don’t see I see maybe two or three of the markets where we are slightly better in revenues than we were in 2012, but as you might expect across the board we are down 1.1% on top line revenues versus where we were on 2012, don’t see any big declines in terms of year-over-year, 2% in the Charlotte and the Houston of the world on revenues, Las Vegas actually picks up; DC I think I gave you earlier, it’s that we were 4% - 2% last year and we are in the 3% to 4% range this year, so not big swings across the Board, but overall, just a little bit of moderation from the 2012 levels.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then could you just walk a little bit through – in terms of redevelopment, how that’s going to impact the numbers when you expect to see the benefits?
D. Keith Oden: I will let Dennis give you the redevelopment, because it really doesn’t drag the portfolio.
Dennis Steen: Yeah, ultimately if you look at well we are going to give you guidance on the 5,500 units and we expect to do that kind of ratably over the year, kind of ramping up by the mid year to get to a steady state, so if you kind of look at the impact of this year, if you take $95 a unit and you kind of say the 5,500 units come in ratably during the year. We think the net impact to revenues after knocking out 9 days to 10 days worth of incremental vacancy is about $1.3 billion or 20 basis points on revenues.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: And that’s on the same-store?
Dennis Steen: Yeah.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, that’s helpful. Yeah, that clarifies a bit more and you want to disclose that I am assuming correct, the amounts you spend in the quarter.
D. Keith Oden: Yeah, let me disclose every quarter.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And this is a follow-up question. Does the Sierra-Nevada, the debt on the Sierra-Nevada joint venture mature this year and if so can you talk about kind of what the plan is for that joint venture long-term?
D. Keith Oden: Sure, the debt does mature this year, it’s a Freddie Mac loan and we are working on either on two plants; one is to either extend the loan or the other is to sell the assets.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question is from Andrew McCulloch of Green Street Advisors.
Andrew McCulloch – Green Street Advisors: Hey guys. Following up on that CapEx question, on the recurring and revenue enhancing CapEx spend for 2013. Is it pretty big numbers compared to what you’ve done historically? How much of the spending in your mind is really deferred maintenance?
D. Keith Oden: None, it’s all kitchens and baths, the interesting thing is that most people say, you are going to rehab a 10 year old property. If you think about, I was thinking about my wife and my home and how many times I have redone my kitchen and what we are doing is, we are updating to current market needs, your market taste if you will perfectly good kitchens and baths, but people are willing to pay more for granite, pay more for cherry cabinets and the lights. So there is zero dollars involved in CapEx that would be described as deferred maintenance and it’s all improving the quality and the customer experience, which they ultimately pay a higher rent for.
Andrew McCulloch – Green Street Advisors: Okay, thanks. Same question on single family rentals. That industry continue to gain theme and we saw you know the first company recently come public, I know this is the business you guys in particular have followed very closely. Happy that first of all little bit here, but you sit here today and look at the single-family rental landscape, what do you mean the probability that Camden at some point get’s into that business?
D. Keith Oden: Very low probability. When we looked at it multiple times in the cycle and we still fundamentally believe and I think it remains to be seen whether these companies that are in this business now can get any large scale, because I don’t think they know what operating processes are in large portfolios or how that really works. And so I think that’s the big if, the question ultimately is, I do think people are going to make money in that business, don’t get me wrong there, but I don’t think it’s a long-term institutional public REIT sell business that 20 years from now you are going to have large public companies and on single family homes. There is too much competition between Mom-and-pop. And Mom-and-pop have no overhead expenses, they do the maintenance themselves, they rent the properties themselves and so it will be – it’s a little different animal than a multi-family business. So if I thought that there was a) way to scale it and b) a way to make it long-term viable business, we would have been in the business in 2008, 2009 or 2010, but I haven’t been able to figure that out. And maybe I am wrong and somebody will figure it out, but Camden won’t.
Dennis Steen: Andrew, we spent a lot of time, effort, energy, and intellectual capital looking at a buy in whole strategy and we could never figure out how to get the numbers, the buy in whole rental strategy anywhere past about 4.5 and 5 and that was using what we thought were pretty aggressive. Speaking of CapEx, Rick is right, I don’t think that folks know what the long-term operating costs are in this model for running 500 single family houses, strong out all over Phoenix, but I certainly can assure you that I have no idea what the CapEx costs are when you have to turn a single family home that’s been under somebody’s rental for a year and leasing in the middle of the night. So you think apartment CapEx numbers are spooky, try to do a unit turn on single family home, it’s been trashed.
D. Keith Oden: It’s tough. I thought it was telling the other day, it went from what everybody is talking about to I was listening the other day and heard Barry Sternlicht on one of the morning talk show say that the game is already over and like Rick said, I think some people obviously are going to make money, but they are going to make money, because they bought houses at $0.50 on $1 and they are going to sell them at $0.80 on $1 and they will make money, but buy in whole single family home is a long way off.
Andrew McCulloch – Green Street Advisors: Great. Thanks for the color.
D. Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: And the next question is from Paula Poskon of Robert. W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon – Robert. W. Baird & Co.:  Thanks. I just have a follow-up on your disposition strategy. Is the pool of assets based more on the asset quality themselves or more about sub-market migration?
D. Keith Oden: It’s both actually, it’s really asset quality within the sub-market and how that sub-market is performing over the long-term. It’s definitely about all those three issues of the equation that we look at. And we do have sort of a quantitative analysis at the headquarters here in Houston and then we sent it out to the field and make sure that it’s not just people looking at numbers, it’s people sitting on the ground, working with the properties every single day and they are making very, very subjective decisions based on what’s going on in the real world.
Dennis Steen: Paul, the metrics in the starting point for all of that as Rick said is, we use the five year rolling return on invested capital, ROIC calculation for our entire portfolio and so you think about what it’s capturing, it’s capturing rental rate growth, what’s getting to the bottom line and NOI and it’s capturing the reinvestment required in CapEx. So on any given day, if you take our portfolio and string it from 100 to 200 on that metric, you just go Canada this will come out of the bottom 15.
Paula J. Poskon – Robert. W. Baird & Co.: Thanks very much.
Dennis Steen: You bet.
Operator: And next we have a question from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: Yeah, I guess maybe two questions for Keith. One is, I guess what are the odds at Las Vegas could produce I guess like a Phoenix like experience that you saw in 2012 or it surprises, your upside maybe triggered by that outward migration from California?
D. Keith Oden: What are the odds? That’s a great one for Las Vegas. So if you think about where Las Vegas is right now, we are forecasting roughly 30,000 new jobs. There are a total of 800 apartments. They are going to be delivered – new apartments delivered in Las Vegas. So the normal metric if you would think about is 30,000 new jobs could absorb 6,000 apartments that are 5:1 ratio of job growth to completion. So there is going to be pressure, we know there is going to be upward pressure on rents. The question is, are we far enough long to where that really turns into rental rate growth. If most of the – the unemployment rate is coming down, the 29,000 is going to help that, but you are still in an unemployment rate in the city of somewhere in – after all that set and done, you probably end the year at 9% to 10% unemployment. I think you could catch a year, next year in Vegas with 30,000 jobs if that sticks and 800 new apartments, I think you could catch it a year where it’s up 5%, 6%. I think we are sort of in the 2% to 3% range guidance for next year. And if think about to, so go out 2014 and the year beyond on that, on witness two, she has got Las Vegas being a top buyer market, so we will see.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: Yeah, so for – last question is, I know you are not in these markets, but do you watch the Boston, or San Francisco, or New York close enough to assign a letter grade to them and I guess if you were there, do you think they would alter the rate, the rankings of the markets that you are in?
Richard J. Campo: Honestly, I have my impression, but it’s not worth sharing on a conference call. So I guess this is not something that we follow, not the kinds of metrics that we look at for our own portfolio.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities:  Yeah, that’s helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question is from Tom Truxillo of Bank of America.
Thomas C. Truxillo – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks. Like the first Alex’s question on capital from a little different point of view, you guys have obviously done a great job to delever and simplify the balance sheet. Are you comfortable where your metrics are now or do you plan to continue to see improve this balance sheet metrics or do you think you kind are having so point that we could actually add a little bit of leverage?
D. Keith Oden: We are very comfortable with where we are now, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we don’t want to continue to improve it, because we do. We think fundamentally that I think this is just the – I don’t know if you want to call it hang out from the great recession or the realization from the great recession, that lower leverage is better than higher leverage and we are in a cyclical business. While we have been in this business long enough to know that you make hay while the sun shines and you feed the ducks when they are quacking to quote Sam Zell, but bottom line is, we will operate going forward with lower leverage than we have in the past and we will make sure that when the next cycle comes we can take advantage of it on a much larger scale than we were able to on the last cycle. So lower leverage is better, we would – you cannot expect us to add incremental leverage from where we are today. I would think that we would be continuing to lower our leverage rather than increasing.
Thomas C. Truxillo – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. And then second question on the comments on sources and uses, I appreciate that. And in fact, you said you probably will be in the market with an unsecured note in the second half of the year. Given where the moving rates has gone since the beginning of the year, have you thought about kind of tapping the market now and prefunding or perhaps just putting in like an interest rate hedge to kind of lock in the rates, because they maybe significantly higher than they are now when you actually do need the money?
D. Keith Oden: I see a scenario every single day.
Dennis Steen: Yeah, its one of those things where you sort out the balance, what you do with the cash and it sort of hurts my head to put cash in a 0.1% interest bearing account and paying even the rates are incredibly low. I know there are some hedge opportunities as well. We look at that all the time and when we look at our capital structure and decide whether we are willing to buy that insurance if you will and how much that insurance costs.
Thomas C. Truxillo – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks for the comments.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: Great. Well, we appreciate your attention on the call today and we will see everyone at the next conference and this summer at our 20th anniversary bell ringing. So thank you very much and this will end the call.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-02 12:00:00) =====
Executives:  Kim Callahan – VP, IR Rick Campo – Chairman and CEO Keith Oden – President and Trust Manager Dennis Steen – SVP-Finance and CFO
Analysts:  Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill Eric Wolfe – Citigroup Nick Elko – Macquarie Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates Anthony Paolone – JP Morgan 
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden’s third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden’s complete third quarter 2012 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for one hour. As a result, we ask that you limit your questions to two with one follow-up and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Rick Campo: Thanks, Kim and good morning. Borrowing from the names sake of our pre-conference music, our steely-eyed Operations and Support teams continue to hit our operating results out of the park. We continue to take advantage of a very good apartment market with operating fundamentals improving. We think the fundamentals will be strong for the foreseeable future. There isn’t much discussion and concern that the uptick in the single family markets will have a negative effect on our business. We think that an improving single-family market is a good thing for the apartment markets and the economy as a whole. Single-family and multifamily markets have done well at the same time during many economic cycles. The economic expansion beginning the 1994 through 2002 is a good case study on the solid coexistence of the single-family-multifamily markets. During 1994 and 2002, eight-year period, the homeownership rate actually increased from 64% to 68% creating 4-plus million new homeowners. During that same timeframe multifamily construction averaged 250,000 apartments per year. Multifamily demographics were actually pretty poor during that time with the 18 to 30-year old cohort declining. During the same period, Camden had 45% NOI growth and our stock price more than doubled. The game changer was 23-million jobs. Single-family market improvements will help expand job growth and will lead to a stronger business environment for all of us. It’s all about job growth and it always has been. I’ll turn the call over to Keith Oden now.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. Let me begin by recalling a conversation that Rick and I had roughly 20 years ago as we were preparing for our first quarterly earnings call as a public company. We were fortunate enough to be able to get some advice from the founder of an iconic retail REIT that also happens to be based in Houston. We talked to him for a while about strategic matters and then turned to some very, very tactful topics including this one. How long should our prepared remarks be on our earnings call. This was his advice. If you meet expectations which if you’re both good and lucky will be 90% of the time, your prepared remarks should be 15 to 20 minutes long. If you fail to meet expectations, you should take longer because number one, you have a lot of explaining to do and number two at least less time for those pesky analyst questions. Finally, if you’re fortunate enough to beat expectations, keep it short. Your results will speak for themselves; you know the results were good, your audience knows it and anything beyond brief opening remarks will be viewed as boastful. So, as Stanford Alexander’s advice in mind, I’ll be brief today. For the third quarter in a row our on-site teams have outperformed our original plan and our reforecast, leading to our third straight FFO and same-store guidance upward revisions. Obviously, the market fundamentals are still very good. Less obvious to outside observers is the fact that our on-site and support teams are executing brilliantly. A few highlights from the quarter include, we had the highest quarterly NOI growth in 20 years. We had double-digit NOI growth in nine of our 15 markets. We had the second-best sequential revenue growth in our history, behind only the second quarter of last year. And finally, five markets had better than 3% sequential revenue growth. Those markets were Charlotte at 4.6%. Denver and Atlanta 3.3% and Houston at 3.1%; those four probably come as no surprise to anyone however, Washington DC at 3% and might surprise us both. The strong third quarter trends in leasing and renewals were similar to last year. New leases were up 4.4%, renewals up 7.9% versus 3.9% and 8.5% last year. November and December renewals are up roughly 7% with 43% and 25% completed respectively. Overall our portfolio was 4.4% above prior peak rents from 2008. Our occupancy rates for the third quarter averaged 95.6% and currently stands at 95.3% versus 94.6% in October of last year. Our net turnover rate was 71% for the quarter versus 73% last year, and during the quarter, moveouts to purchased homes actually fell from last quarter’s 12.6% to 11.8%, breaking a string of three quarterly increases. Moveouts to purchased homes is still well below our long-term average of 18%. Being mindful of Stanford’s advice, I’ll turn the call over to Dennis Steen, Camden’s Chief Financial Officer.
Dennis Steen: Thanks, Keith. I’ll spend my time this morning with a few comments on our third quarter results and our updated 2012 full-year earnings guidance. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of $82.1 million or $0.93 per share, representing approximately a $3 million or $0.03 per share improvement from the midpoint of our prior guidance range. The $3 million in FFO outperformance for the third quarter resulted primarily from property net operating income exceeding our forecast by approximately $4 million, offset partially by $1 million and higher than expected Property Management, Fee and Asset Management and G&A expense. The $4 million and better-than-expected property NOI resulted from the following. Property revenues exceeded our forecast by $3 million due to higher than anticipated revenue growth across our same-store, non-same-store, and lease up communities, driven primarily by continued rental rates increases, slightly higher occupancy, higher realization rates on other property income and better than anticipated rental rates and leasing velocity at our six development communities, which are in lease up during the third quarter. Three of those communities stabilized during the third quarter, well ahead of their original stabilization dates. Property expenses came in approximately $1 million, better than our expectations. This favorable variance is primarily the result of lower utilities expense due to a milder and wetter summer than in the prior few years, reducing both electric and water cost and the successful renegotiation of our trash removal contracts reducing our door-to-door trash removal cost combined with lower than anticipated property insurance expense due to the lower levels of self-insured property and general liability insurance claims. A $1 million unfavorable variance in Property Management, Fee and Asset Management and G&A expense was attributable to expensed acquisition cost relating to the three stabilized communities we acquired in the third quarter, higher incentive compensation expense as we adjusted full-year accruals to reflect our actual 2012 outperformance, and slightly higher miscellaneous public company costs. Moving onto earnings guidance, we’ve revised our 2012 full-year FFO guidance from $3.59 to $3.63 per diluted share with the midpoint of $3.61 representing $0.07 per share increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Approximately $0.06 of this increase is a result of higher-than-expected property net operating income over the second half of 2012 due to better-than-expected revenue growth across our same-store non-same-store and lease up communities and slightly lower property expenses primarily due to the reasons I previously discussed. We now expect 2012 same-store revenue growth between 6.2% and 6.7%, expense growth between 2% and 2.5%, and NOI growth between 8.75% and 9.25%. The remaining $0.01 per share increase in our FFO guidance is primarily the net result of the timing of our acquisition disposition activities as acquisitions occurred slightly earlier than forecasted and dispositions slightly later than originally forecasted. This positive was partially offset by higher-than-anticipated expensed acquisition cost and higher incentive compensation expense resulting from our 2012 outperformance. Our revised fourth quarter 2012 guidance assumes $270 million in new on-balance sheet development starts in the fourth quarter and $300 million in additional dispositions spread throughout the quarter with no additional acquisitions. Our FFO guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $0.94 to $0.98 per share with the midpoint of $0.96 per share representing $0.03 per share increase from the $0.93 per share we reported for the third quarter. The expected $0.03 per share increase is primarily result of the following. A $0.02 per share projected increase in FFO due to higher same property net operating income, primarily due to expected seasonal decline in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover and personnel expenses. We expect same property revenues to be relatively flat from the third to fourth quarter as continued improvements in rental rates will be offset by an expected slight seasonal decline in occupancy and lower other property income due to lower levels of leasing activity in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we expect a $0.01 per share projected increase in FFO due the additional contribution from the lease up progress achieved by our development communities in the third and fourth quarters. Our acquisition and disposition activities will not have a significant net impact to the fourth quarter FFO, as the contribution from the acquisition of the four communities and the remaining 75% interest in one joint-venture we acquired in the second and third quarters is being offset by the impact of the two communities we sold in October, and dispositions expected to close later this quarter. We currently have approximately $420 million of disposition assets being marketed for sale or under contract, of which our guidance assumes, we will close $300 million during the fourth quarter. At this time, we’ll open the call up to questions.
Operator: We will now being the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question today is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O’Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Hi, good morning.
Rick Campo: Hi, Alex.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: How are you? I should actually say, well, good afternoon up here, good morning down there. First question is, development. Speaking to the private guys and department developers, you still need real equity in deals. Give the reluctance of developers to do that, are you seeing a big inflow of people of MEZZ, people looking to provide MELF to help bridge the gap between the construction loan and the total cost of development or because the MEZZ guy would have to potentially backstop the developer, they’re just not, it’s not really worth to risk or there’re not enough people willing to play in that space?
Rick Campo: I think it’s – the answer to that question is both of what you just said. We aren’t seeing much MEZZ business out there now. And what you’re seeing in the sort of merchant-builder space is that the construction financing is plentiful and cheap but what’s really holding back starts today or at least starts in the next round of development is the equity side of the equation. And so, equity investors have sort of made their bets if you will and they are waiting to see what’s – what happens with those existing starts. There is clearly a lot of concern about starts and how fast starts are ramped up. And so I think the – so it’s not really a gap between what an equity investor puts in versus a construction lender. It’s really the equity investors pulling back. We’ve seen projects that were supposed to be getting done by merchant builders, land deals for example that have come back to us and we’re starting to see that sort of across the country. And it really is more the equity investors sort of taking the breath and worrying about what happens in the future.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. And then the second question is for Dennis. A lot of talk about property tax and insurance and the cost pressures there, as we look at your numbers year-to-date, the increases are minimal, you’ve posted comment that it was sort of aggregate up 14%. As we think about 2013 I realized you aren’t giving 2013 guidance, but we obviously are refreshing our numbers as we’re updating them. Should we be thinking about greater pressure on these line items or any other cost items or are these sort of the run rates that we should expect.
Dennis Steen: Let me take insurance first. Over the last couple of years, we had a pretty decent increase in insurance and the favorable variances that we’re seeing – from a premium perspective, we saw some decent increase, as the favorable variances we’re seeing this year is really due to less losses within our property portfolio and that’s why you’ve seen a negative insurance expense for the quarter. So we’ll wait to see what happens post the Hurricane Sandy and what that does to insurance right next year, but I think time will just tell on that, but so far we’re being favorably impacted because of lower losses. On the real estate tax side, our numbers are little out of the ordinary for the first nine months of this year, we’re up 2.3% in real estate taxes. We expect the full year to be up in 3% to 4% range as there were significant downward accrual adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2011. And additionally as we mentioned in the last call, 2012 has benefited from an unusually high amount of settlements of prior year protests and a number of our communities, and if you excluded those from our numbers, we would actually be reporting a real estate tax expense up for 2012 in the 6% to 7% range. Some of the markets that with biggest piece of that were the once you might expect the Texas markets that had a major increase in rental, Austin was up 19, Houston 12, Dallas 11 and then followed by kind of our Florida markets with Orlando up 11 and Tampa up 8. So, we have had some pressure, but it averaged out to our portfolio excluding those settlements to be 6% to 7%. I think we are all sitting here today and expecting that there will still be some pressure as we go into 2013, something in that 4% to 7% range is probably somewhere close to what we might anticipate for 2013.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Eric Wolfe of Citigroup.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Hey, good afternoon. You spoke in your remarks that seen the best growth you’ve seen nearly 20 years, so obviously you’re doing pretty fantastic from a growth perspective, and then you think about the debt markets being sort of historically low interest rates. Transaction market obviously cap rates are quite low. So it seemed like your equity is probably the most expensive form of capital for you today. So, I guess, I’m trying to understand on your ATM, obviously been a pretty active issue, can you just help us sort of understanding going forward whether we can expect you to see like $100 million a quarter, and how you’re thinking about that, are you just going to be active as long as in development pipeline or does eventually going to shut it off if your stock price doesn’t match your growth?
Dennis Steen: Well, we’ve set along during the slough cycle that we’re going to pre-fund our development pipeline and make sure that we kept our debt to EBITDA in the 5.5 to 4.5 times zone. And we’re in that zone now, and obviously the outperformance in the net operating income side of the equation drives your EBITDA up, so that continues to help with keeping us in that zone. After the last call, we really haven’t been as active as on the ATM program, and so we haven’t done a bond deal in a while. So, I think you’ve to look at first of all getting into that zone where we are now with respect to debt to EBITDA targets and then you look at the various sources that we could access., and we evaluate each source independently and then relate them to each other and understand what the highest cost of capital is, generally as your common stock, we have increased our disposition pipeline pretty dramatically from a previous year. So, we will use a combination of ATM debt markets and dispositions to fund the development pipeline going forward. We – given if you just take a sort of the transaction we did at the beginning of the year plus the ATM program year-to-date, I would definitely expect it – our acquisitions to be a lot less than that going forward.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Okay, that’s helpful. And then second question earlier in your remarks, you talked about the uptick in single-family housing, I’m just trying to understanding that how great of an uptick that was maybe I know it’s tough to sort of generalize, but how much home prices were up in your markets over the last year versus rents? And just more broadly, how you think about affordability of single-family housing in your markets relative to renting?
Rick Campo: Yeah. There is no question that on the last report, on the – on housing prices, it was up pretty much across the board in our markets although most of them were pretty modest increases. Some of the larger increases were in the Texas markets. And that’s not to be unexpected given the collapse and housing prices that almost all of our markets experienced. So, we do expect to see housing prices going up. When it gets to the question of affordability, just because the housing prices are started to pick up, mortgage rates are still very low. The impediment to most of our residents being able to and – willing and able to purchase the home is first of all a change in the philosophy of do you want to own a home other than your life circumstances require that you or dictate that you move out of an apartment into the single-family home, which for the last 30 years that we’ve been in this business, that was what drove – primarily drove the housing versus rent decision. We sort of got away from that in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, and that impetus was replaced to a large extent with more of an investment philosophy. And that was predicated mostly on a lot of experience that folks had about buying a house, so their neighbor bought a house, moved out of an apartment, bought a house, sold it, six months later, flipped it and made a profit. And so there was a very different mentality of the home buying cohort in that period than there historically has been. And I think that’s flipped around and it’ll eventually go back the other direction, but I think you’re looking at years, not quarters for that to happen. So, that’s one continuing impediment that we see at home ownership, the second is just the overall difficulty of getting a mortgage, you actually have to have a down payment, you have to have – show the proof that you have the ability to make a sustained mortgage payment, those clearly were things we were missing in the last go-round. But when you put all that together, the statistic I think is most telling in our portfolio with regard to not only propensity but capacity to purchase homes, it’s the percentage of residents that are moving out buy homes and – but for 30 years of keeping that stacked in our portfolio, it ran around 18%, we hit a high watermark in 2005 of about 24%, and we hit a low watermark of just slightly below 10% about two years ago. We’ve worked our way from that high-9% move outs to purchase homes to the point where we’re about to something below – still below 12%. So and – we did, we have seen a pickup, but the last – we actually saw it tick down in this quarter over the last quarter. So, I don’t – I’m not even prepared to say, yeah that the trend is in place, that we’re on the way back to 18%. Obviously, at some point we expect, we will hit there, but I think you’re talking years and not quarters.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from the Nick Elko of Macquarie.
Nick Elko – Macquarie: Hi, thanks. I was hoping a little bit more info on the dispositions, the assets you’re marking for sale right now. If you could just talk about how expected cap rates and other pricing metrics are for that – for those assets today?
Rick Campo: Sure. One of the reasons we’ve increased the volume to 450 million in total at this point is because pricing has gotten a lot more aggressive on those kind of assets. What’s happened is, the assets we’re selling have an average year age of 26 years, they have high CapEx, they tend to be in probably our weakest submarkets within the markets that we’re reselling in, and what we’ve seen over the last year is cap rate compression in that product type of at least 100 to 125 basis points. And so what’s happened is core properties have compressed and continue to compress and the markets like Houston and Dallas, core properties that are in sort of best locations are in the 4.5% cap rate range, on the coast obviously, there in the 3.5% range. So, you have a situation where the older assets have compressed down to six and of high fives, and so when we look at dispositions and say (inaudible) we can sell 26-year-old asset for call it a sub-six cap rate. We can then redeploy that capital into development where we’re developing to 7 to 7.5 with un-trended yields of sort of six and some change 6.5. I mean that makes a whole lot of sense from capital allocation perspective to us so. So we are definitely more aggressive on selling assets. We’ll probably add to that pipeline next year and then redeploy both through acquisitions and through new development.
Nick Elko – Macquarie: Okay, great. And then on the development pipeline, I mean can you just talk a little bit about where you achieved sort of stabilized yields are on the communities and lease up right now. I mean you’re sort of surpassing targets in, I think the Tampa and Orlando projects, can you just talk about how where sort of current stabilized yields are for some of the assets and where you’re underwriting for today for the under construction portfolio?
Dennis Steen: Sure. The assets that are under construction today are in lease up today have all come in below original construction cost, leased up faster and at higher rates. The yields are 7.5% to 8% on that book of business. The balance of the portfolio, the $300 plus million we’re starting this year and properties that we have slated for next year are in the 7% to 7.5% range. You’re still – your starting to see construction cost go up and it depends on the market. There is some labor shortages of skilled trades and what have you, contractors are now not willing to work for food, they actually want an operating margin. And so they’re – there is definitely some pressure on cost. So I think the days of cost coming in below budget are probably over, but costs still have not gone up to the point where they’re at or even close to peak levels at this point. So, we still expect to have very robust yields on the pipeline that we’re starting now and that we’ll start next year.
Nick Elko – Macquarie: And I think Camden Phase I Atlanta was one of the projects, you’re, I think, saying you would start probably this year, I mean are there any other ones you can tell us about right now on that list.
Rick Campo: We’ll start a project in Glendale California. That should start by the end of the year and we’re also planning out starting our Camden Boca project in Boca Raton. And the total of those are about $300 million...
Keith Oden: $270 million...
Rick Campo: $270 plus or minus.
Nick Elko – Macquarie: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Thanks. Good morning. So, just looking at some of your recent activity here, we see the project you just mentioned and another Southern California development moving up on your pipeline list and the relatively large acquisition in Ontario during the quarter. Is it fair to say that your appetite for incremental investment in Southern California is increasing relative to the opportunities in other markets?
Rick Campo: Well, I don’t know that our appetite is increasing. I think that the – on a risk adjusted basis by market, the yields that we’re purchased the Ontario project out relative to yields that we are currently active in end markets like Charlotte, Houston, and Denver, the differential in the yield is probably the narrowest that we’ve seen in the last 10 years. So, on a relative attractiveness – basis of attractiveness, the California stuff is just – it’s certainly more attractive now than it was three or four years ago. So, we’ve been active in Southern California the entire time, that as you know takes long time to bring some of these projects to provision. So, I think you can – with those two, certainly on an invested dollar basis, California is going to be a bigger piece of our book of business in 2013 than it hasn’t been in some time. But, it’s not because we haven’t been interested in expanding in California, but more targets of opportunity have just been fewer and farther between.
Dennis Steen: The other piece of the equation is, we’re improving our strategic focus on where our properties are located and part of the $430 million worth of acquisition or dispositions that we are doing includes a 40 years old property in Fullerton, California. And we’re in essence trading that, that’s under contract right now. The – we are basically trading that ultimately for the – for the Ontario, so we’re selling four year old asset and buying a six year old asset, improving the sort of lifecycle of the portfolio and we think the Inland Empire which hasn’t had a lot of growth yet is bottomed out, and when Southern California starts hitting on all cylinders in the next couple years the Port of LA and Long Beach, we ship all their products through Ontario, and the area will do really well.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: And just on that point as you think about criteria of the potential dispositions and compare that to where you are developing and acquiring. What else are you focused on besides just the average age and therefore CapEx needs, what else are you looking at, is it submarket positioning, is that increasingly important?
Dennis Steen: Yeah, it’s two things Dave, it’s we run – we have a model that we are constantly updating it, we look at return on invested capital by everyone of our assets. On a three and a five year rolling basis and that incorporates what has your loan growth been, and obviously what are your CapEx expenditures required to maintain that loan growth. And so the first screen is, if you’re in – if you screen out of our 200 communities, if you screen in the bottom 25, then you’re certainly going to get lot of scrutiny for – are there any insinuating circumstances is to why we should continue to own that asset, so that’s we start with that. And secondly we go to submarket attractiveness and in that regard we’re always looking at five years out, 10 years out as the submarket likely to be better same or worse than it is today. And if you combine those two things together, that drives probably 80% of our decision process, there is always some other qualitative factors in there as well. But that’s basically our methodology for identifying the disposition candidates, and it shouldn’t come as any surprise that tends to be the older assets and they tend to be in submarkets that are weaker. So, I think that would characterize the 14 assets that we have in the marketplace today.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: That’s helpful. And last question is on paces specifically. It looks like you reconfigured your Phase I, took up the unit size, but also the average cost per unit. Could you talk about what’s going on there?
Rick Campo: Yeah, exactly. That’s what we did in phases. We have actually three distinct product types and because of its incredible location, Buckhead, we have a townhouse of three-story, direct access quartz townhouse product and then we have a sort of urban wrap product, which should be a traditional urban wrap product and then we have a midrise podium product that where the average square footage is somewhere around 2,000 square feet and 1,800 square feet, something like that, the largest, but the average is probably 16 to 15 something like that. So, the idea is to be able to have three distinct products, one very high-end, another one sort of step down from that high-end, being the townhouses and then the sort of the urban wrap product. And we’re able to improve the density on the project by working those three uses together.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Okay. So, that’s not reflective of higher construction cost that you talked about earlier?
Rick Campo: No, it’s more and more units basically.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And next we have a question from Anthony Paolone of JP Morgan.
Anthony Paolone – JP Morgan: Thanks. So just curious you have about a 300 basis point spread between some of the developments you’ve got going on in where market cap rates seemed to be, so it implies like I don’t know like 60% type profit on the development. So, is your land basis just that lowered, you think it’s do you think a core buyer will come in accrue and accrue that much value to land or put another way pay that for above replacement cost, just trying to tie that together a bit because it just such a wide spread.
Rick Campo: Well, I think there is two things. One is the legacy land cost is probably lower than land cost today, because the land cost definitely has increased. We’re at above sort of peak 07 land prices across all of our markets with exception maybe Las Vegas. But so that’s said land prices are higher and we definitely have lower land prices. I think the other piece of the equation is construction costs are going up and in some markets we’re seeing anywhere from 8% to 10% increases in construction, if we were actually buying the product today and most people are putting in 5% to 8% inflation beyond that. So, I think there is the buyout in the projects that we have completed now or that have been bought out already is significant. So, there’s a lot of value, value just from the cost being much higher than they would be in the future and then the run rates were just obviously substantially higher.
Dennis Steen: Also, Anthony just where we’re delivering this group of the assets, Orlando, two assets in Orlando and two in Tampa just put that in perspective. In Orlando, this year the Whitten forecast for multifamily completions for 2012 is a total of 1,000 apartments. Of that about 700 were Camden’s. In Tampa, the total forecast for completions in the entire market is 1,600 departments and of that about number about 600 were Camden. So, there are literally is no new product to speak up in this markets. So, you’re sort of the own, because of our footprint and because we had the capital to go into these markets at a time when it was really counter cyclical to most investors, we just – we think that we’ve delivered over the time, that’s very conducive to being able to raise rents.
Anthony Paolone – JP Morgan: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Rick Campo for any closing remarks.
Rick Campo: Great, well thanks for being on our call. This probably was our record in terms of time on the call because I think with the last, one of the last ones reporting and I know that people in the Northeast also still having trouble, we hope that the gas lines get shorter and recovery comes quicker to the Northeast. We know how that is, having been through it in Florida and Texas. So, with that said, I will see you at (inaudible) REIT and talk to you at the first of year. Thanks.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Camden Property Trust Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions). Please note, this event is being recorded and I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Vice President Investor Relations. Ms. Callahan, please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning. And thank you for joining Camden's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete second quarter 2012 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for one hour as another multifamily company will be doing their call right behind ours. As a result, we ask that you limit your questions to two with one follow-up and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Good morning to most of you on the call, except these close folks. The band Train's hit Maybe This Will Be My Year was surely on the minds of our onsite teams as they prepare their 2012 operating budget. After the first two quarters, I suspect most of them, if not all, have dropped the Maybe part. The apartment business is great. In spite of slower job growth than we'd like, our markets are growing jobs faster than the national average keeping demand strong. New supply is not a threat. Camden residents are doing very well. Their incomes have increased from $63,000 to over $71,000 annually over the last year, reducing the percentage of rent income from 18.4% to 17.7%. Our residents have the capacity to pay more rent, even with the large increases that they have already experienced. Half of our markets have yet to reach peak rent levels that we achieved in 2008. Rents are still a bargain in many of our markets. I salute our teams for making the most of a very strong environment. It's easy to get complex in an environment like this. During the quarter, we acquired two properties for $100 million, at cap rates in the low 5s. The exclusivity period for acquisitions has expired for our fund. These properties and future acquisitions will be wholly owned by Camden. Our capital recycling program for the rest of the year will include sales of $350 million of properties, with an average age of 23 years, and cap rates in the 6s. Our $551 million development communities in lease-up and under construction continued to outperform our expectations. We expect the stabilized returns to be in the 7% to 8% range, which is 50 basis points higher due to higher rents, faster leasing, and lower construction costs. We plan on starting 1,237 apartments in four properties, totaling $290 million by the end of the year, of returns in the same range as the communities that I just previously discussed. The plan on continuing prefunding our development investment, with the combination of ATM equity issuance and unsecured debt. We have raised $233 million of equity through the ATM program during the second and third quarters. We have a target range of 4.5 times to 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. We will continue to strengthen our balance sheet, and improve the quality of our portfolio as we go forward. I would like now to turn the call over now to Keith Oden, our President and Chief Operating Officer, I guess.
Keith Oden: Chief President.
Ric Campo: Chief something.
Keith Oden: I always wanted to be Chief of something. Thanks Rick. Compared to our expectations so far this year, our onsite teams have gotten off to a remarkably good start. After a quarter like this, it's kind of tempting to just acknowledge our team members for a great quarter and move on to Q&A. With that in mind, my comments today will be brief. Virtually every metric that we use to monitor the conditions on the ground that our community remains either very good or excellent. For the second quarter, same store average rents on new leases were up 6%, and renewals were up 8.4% for a blended increase of 7%. August renewals are trending up 8% as well, with 40% completed so far in the month. Revenue growth for the second quarter was strong across our entire portfolio. We saw double digit revenue increases in four markets, Houston, Austin, Charlotte and Phoenix, and double digit NOI growth in seven of our 15 markets. Sequentially, the top six markets for revenue growth were Houston, Charlotte, Austin, Dallas, Atlanta and Denver, all with greater than 3% sequential growth. Our occupancy for the quarter averaged 95.3%, up four-tenths from the first quarter. We currently stand at 95.6% occupied. Our budgets assume that our occupancy rate would rise gradually over the year, but as it has turned out, we were able to increase occupancy aggressively in the first and second quarters, while continuing to raise rents. Our occupancy rates budgeted for the balance of the year look achievable, so the occupancy related gain in revenue in the first and second quarter, will likely not be a recurring variant to our plan. Compared to a year ago, our traffic is slightly down, but it's still sufficiently strong to allow us to raise both occupancy and rents. Despite the aggressive renewal increase, we continue to see manageable turnover rates of 59% in the second quarter, this compares to 57% in the quarter a year ago, and 48% last quarter. The percentage of residents moving out to purchase a home did move up to 12.6% in the quarter. It looks like this percentage have finally found the bottom. The financial health of our residents continues to improve. The percentage of our residents listing move outs for financial reasons or job loss dropped to 4.8% versus 9.3% a year ago. Also our bad debt expense for the first half of 2012 totaled 4% of total revenues, and that's well below our budgeted level of 0.6% of revenues. At this time I will turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Dennis Steen: Thanks Keith. I'd like to spend a few minutes this morning on our FFO guidance. We have revised our 2012 full year FFO guidance range to $3.50 to $3.58 per share, with the midpoint of $3.54, representing $0.09 per share improvement from the midpoint of our guidance range issued back in April. $0.08 of the increase is the result of higher than expected property net operating income, where $0.02 of the $0.08 reflected in outperformance to the midpoint of our guidance range for the second quarter of 2012, and $0.06 related to our projected increase in property NOI for the second half of 2012. The improvement in property NOI is primarily due to higher revenues from the lease-up communities in our development pipeline, as lease-up velocity and rental rates achieved are both running well ahead of our original expectations. Higher revenue growth from our same store portfolio, resulting from the continuation of higher than expected rental rate and other income increases across our portfolio. We now expect same store revenue growth between 5.5% and 6.5%, up from our prior guidance range of 4.75% to 6.75%. Lastly, property expenses are trending slightly better than expected. We have revised downward the midpoint of our full year 2012 same store expense growth to 2.75%, down 25 basis points from our original estimate. The favorability and property expenses is due to slightly lower than anticipated utility, repair and maintenance and leasing cost, partially offset by higher property and casualty insurance premiums, resulting from our insurance renewals completed in May. As to property taxes, we have been expecting property taxes to rise more dramatically, as assessors recognize the leasing improvements in apartment values. We originally anticipated our property taxes to be up approximately 4% in 2012. The vast majorities of our assessments are now in and our Texas markets were the only markets where assessed values materially exceeded our expectations  However, the negative impact of our higher assessed values in our Texas market has been entirely offset by favorable settlements of prior year tax protest for a number of our communities, and as a result, we anticipate property tax expense for 2012 to come in generally in line with our original budget. The remaining $0.01 per share increase in our FFO guidance is primarily the net result of the timings of our capital market and acquisition disposition activities. The favorable impact from the delay in expected disposition timing, has more than offset the dilutive impact of increased ATM issuances in the second and third quarters, as we continue to reduce leverage and pre-fund the equity requirements of our upcoming development activities. Our current 2012 guidance is based upon the following assumptions for the remainder of the year; $290 million in new own balance sheet developments starts in the third and fourth quarters. $150 million in additional acquisitions and $350 million in additional dispositions, all expected to occur in the fourth quarter at a negative cap rate spread of 100 to 200 basis points, between acquisitions and dispositions, and no additional shares issued under our ATM program. Our FFO guidance for the third quarter of 2012 is $0.88 to $0.92 per share, with a midpoint of $0.90 per share, representing a $0.01 per share increase from the $0.89 in FFO per share we delivered in the second quarter. This $0.01 per share increase is primarily the result of the following; a $0.03 per share increase in FFO due to higher property NOI, as the continuation of revenue growth from our same store portfolio and the additional contribution from the lease up of our development communities and recently completed acquisitions more than offsets our expected increase in property expenses due to the normal seasonal increase in utilities and repair and maintenance costs. The favorable impact from the growth and property NOI is being partially offset by $0.02 per share in dilution, resulting from the full quarterly impact of the 3.5 million shares we previously issued under our ATM program in the second and third quarters of this year, as we continue to reduce leverage and pre-fund the equity requirements for our development activities. At this time, we will open the call up to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Michael Bilerman at Citi.
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Hey it's Eric Wolfe here with Michael. I just wanted to follow-up on your last comments on leverage. I am trying to get a better understanding, because obviously you have issued a lot of equity so far this year. If you are designed to operate sort of at lower leverage levels going forward or if this is just sort of a short term lowering of leverage, the pre-funded development pipeline, and we will see that leverage come back up as you going into 2013, 2014?
Dennis Steen: As I said we are definitely issuing equity to pre-fund development pipeline and our target range is 4.5 to 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. But generally, we clearly are operating at lower leverage levels than we have in the past. In the last cycle, the funding of the developments side of the business was done very differently than it has been done today. We used to draw on our lines of credit, give them up to about 50% or 60% of the available balance, and then we would do an equity offering or an unsecured debt offering to fund that. The challenge today though is that, we want to lock-in our financing costs with these new developments, so that we don't have a financing risk in the future associated with funding the development. So I think we are doing both. I think we are definitely operating at a lower debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio than we have in the past, and we are definitely pre-funding the development.
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Right. So if you are going to be out, I guess, you said 4.5 to 5.5 times, that would I guess, would imply that you are going to keep sort of deleveraging further? I mean, is that a fair assumption I think you are at 5.7 times today?
Dennis Steen: I think that fair 
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Then second question. Obviously your results are very strong and it's sort of weird to be talking about a slowdown in apartment growth. But that's what -- obviously just looking at analyst reports, that's what the fear is right now, that we have reached sort of this inflexion point that net growth is on the decline. So I am just curious, from your point of view, do you feel like things are slowing down, and your tenants are becoming more unwilling to pay sort of a higher share of their income or for you right now, it's just sort of continuing the strong growth that you are seeing for the last couple of quarters?
Ric Campo: I don't think that we see a slowdown. I think it's about a strong a market as we have seen in five or six years, and I don't think we are in the late stages of the game, I think we are in the -- sort of the middle part of the game. The part of the issue you have out there is that we haven't built anything for three years. So the building that's going on right now, is just filling a hole in the market that was created by the financial crisis. So our residents, while they don't typically like to get rental increases, they have the cash to pay it and half our markets are still below the peak in 2008. So I think there is a fair amount of runway left in this business. I think we all get caught up in the second derivative slowing -- and you keep in mind, this is a seasonal business. So last year, I know in September, everybody freaked out when most of the apartment companies started slowing down and getting ready for the seasonal slowdown in traffic. Our customers they move around a lot in the summer, and then they slow down in the fall, and slow down in the winter for obvious reasons, and then they kick back up in the spring. So I think we are going to see the same seasonal patterns, but I think what happened last year, is that the market looked at it and said, oh my god, the apartment run is the over, and it was really the seasonal factors that we have every year for the last 25 years that I have been in this business. So I don't think that -- we don't feel like anyway that our resident campaign we are in, that they are pushing back so hard and don't want to pay a larger percentage of their income.
Eric Wolfe – Citi: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jana Galan at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Hello. I was curious if you could give us some more detail on the D.C. market and kind of how it's been trending better or worse in your expectations at the beginning of the year, and then kind of your outlook for the back half?
Keith Oden: Sure. The D.C. metro for year-to-date posted about 3.7% on revenues and a lot of growth of about 6% and in any other -- in most other environments that we've ever operated in, those will be considered really strong results. But when your overall portfolio is cranking along at something closer to the 9% same-store NOI growth, people look at that and it certainly feels like it's weaker than the rest of the portfolio, which it most certainly is. But for those kinds of numbers, it's just not relative to historical norms, that it's still a market that I think of is, is really quite healthy. We are -- relative to our expectations not only is D.C. -- will D.C. exceed our original budget, but by the end of the year we expect that every single one of our 15 markets will have exceeded our original plan, including D.C. So we think we set our expectations appropriately for the D.C. market. We think when it's all said and done there, we'll hit slightly above our original targets for the year. There's a lot of conversation about new supply, and while there certainly is some new supply coming in D.C., we think the deliveries this year will be in the 5,500 to 6,000 apartment range. But if you juxtapose that with the projected employment growth of about 50,000 this year and about 40,000 next year, if you take the deliveries expected plus the employment growth expected, we're still in a ratio of employment growth to new supply coming online that feels very comfortable with us at about a 8.5 times employment growth to new deliveries. So I think it's -- there is a tendency to want to look at D.C. as a weak market, because if you rank it against our other ones it would be, but I -- and we just don't see it that way. Again, I think the 3.7% revenue growth year-to-date is quite good and I think that we see that continuing without a lot of disruption from the new supply that’s laid in.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford at KeyBanc Markets.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Markets: Hi, good morning. First is just a clarification. Keith, did I hear you say that traffic was down on a year-over-year basis in the quarter?
Keith Oden: Yeah, year-to-date it's down about 2%, which is -- we had a great traffic year last year coming out of the 'O9 timeframe. It doesn't surprise me that it's down slightly. The greatest -- the best tell is whether or not, with regard to traffic, is whether or not you have sufficient traffic to both raise occupancy rates as well as push rents, and we've done that for the last two quarters. Statically speaking, I wouldn't even call it significant but it is down by 2% from the prior year. 
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Markets: And did that continue into July as well.
Keith Oden: I don't have the July traffic numbers, but I can get them to you.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Markets: That's fine. My second question's just on Las Vegas. I think a couple of calls ago, you said you had some hope for that market to turn around this year. It looked like it made a pretty nice sequential move this quarter, both in occupancy and revenue. Just talk about what your outlook is on Las Vegas going forward?
Ric Campo: Yeah, I don't think our view has changed much. We think that we're probably just off the bottom. All the metrics that we see, even though on a sequential basis it did move up a little bit, I think we're still in a slow grind, out in Las Vegas. There certainly is a better, if you look at all the economic -- macroeconomic factors in Vegas, whether it's visitor traffic, whether it's revenues on the strip, clearly there is a marked improvement from where we were two years ago. And that translated into a bunch of new job growth, not really in the real challenge that Las Vegas has with regard to employment growth, is that during the downturn, not only did their -- were there lay-offs, but as they got to a -- as casinos got to the point where they just literally couldn't lose any more bodies, they started cutting back work hours. And so what has to happen first is they have to build back to the point where you're working a full 40-hour week before you're going to start hiring new folks. So I -- I still don't think we're back to that point yet. But I think you can probably see it from here. It's the point when Las Vegas kind of gets to that tipping point, starts adding new employment then I think you can see the -- you could see the game change pretty quickly. But I think we're still -- that's probably still a 2013 story.
Keith Oden: Wind has Las Vegas moving into the top ten employment markets and revenue growth markets by '14.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Markets: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb at Sandler O’Neill
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Good morning down there.
Richard Campo: Good morning.
Alexander Goldfarb –Sandler O’Neill: Just two questions, the first one is, going to taxes, you guys had said that the increase in taxes was offset by winds from prior year's -- agreement taxes. Going forward, is it reasonable to think that the legal wins and reducing taxing will diminish such that the increasing of taxes is going to start to be the driver and you're not going to be able to have the two offset each other, is that fair as we think about 2013?
Dennis Steen: Yeah, I think as you go further into the recovery, you're going to have less of an impact from prior year settlements and that should kind of give you kind of a scope of what that was this past year. Probably if you took that out of our number instead of us being up close to our budget of 4% would probably be up closer to 5.5% and 6% range for taxes for the current year.
Ric Campo: We have always had very aggressive litigation and tax strategies and I don't think there's been a year in the last 10 years that I can imagine that we -- that I remember that we haven't had some good wins on that subject. But obviously the market today, governments need capital and it's no secret that property values have increased. So it is definitely more difficult to win those battles and -- but we will be very aggressive on that front.
Alexander Goldfarb –Sandler O’Neill: As far as timing of those wins, the wins that you settled this year, those are relating to what years? Last year, two years ago, three years ago?
Dennis Steen: It was actually last year, all last year.
Alexander Goldfarb –Sandler O’Neill: Okay, okay, that's helpful.
Ric Campo: You never know when you're going to get that win because you protest and then you litigate and then you settle or you go to court. And you have to remember taxes, it's very interesting. People think that property taxes are a function of what the market value of the property is, but it really isn't that simple. Property taxes are a function of the relative value of your property and how it is assessed compared to your neighbor. So for example, if we think the property's worth $25 million and it's actually worth $25 million, but it's assessed at $15 million, it's not about whether it's really $25 million, it's what the properties across the street are assessed at and the relative values. So that's where the litigation comes into effect because it gets into a fairness issue on how your property is valued relative to others. So that's kind of an interesting nuance of the whole property tax game.
Alexander Goldfarb –Sandler O’Neill: Okay, that's helpful. And then Dennis, second question is as we think about the $190 million that's due in the fourth quarter this year. Just to your general thoughts, the unsecured debt markets have obviously been very good but the bank unsecured term loan markets are each -- are equally competitive. So what are your thoughts between weighing one market versus the other for the upcoming maturity?
Dennis Steen: Well, if you kind of look at what our costs of that would be as we sit here today for an unsecured bond offering, we're probably looking at a 10-year that's probably in the 3.3% to 3.4% range and unsecured debt with 55% leverage would be somewhere -- I'm sorry secured debt with 55% leverage would be somewhere around that same ballpark. So we are still very much an unsecured borrower. We like the unencumbered aspect of our properties with using unsecured debt. And as we look forward, we're probably more on the side of an unsecured offering versus secured.
Ric Campo: But you would prefer the -- just the straight 10-year corporate versus the bank term loan.
Alexander Goldfarb –Sandler O’Neill: Yes, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Good afternoon, guys. Keith, you're starting -- going into the third quarter of '12 with 50 basis points higher occupancy than you went into the third quarter of '11. Is that enough occupancy to allow you to keep pushing rental rates for harder -- for longer before you start backing off, because of the seasonality?
Keith Oden: Rob, our -- we're basically at our plan right now. I mean we had a -- we have a fair amount of seasonality to our occupancy rate and always have. So I think you could expect that all things being equal, we'll continue to get pretty healthy rental increases. We are probably going to give up some occupancy in the second half of the year, just because we always do. And again, we model our portfolio and have consistently tried to stay right around that 95% range. And we've consciously made some decisions to let the occupancy rate drift up this year over what we did last year and because we definitely had a dip in the third and fourth quarter. We are going to see that again, but I think as we trend our portfolio down relative to our original plan, it probably get back down to, high 94s, mid-94s in the fourth quarter. So yes, I think you will see that as we typically have in the past, but I still believe that we are going to be able to get the rental increases that we've got in our plan.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. And then – and I guess the other question I have is, give me your commentary on development starts in the back half of the year acquisitions. Why not sell more assets to fund that given how good that market is right now, and my guess is that you're probably looking at, at least the 100 basis points of margin differential between the bottom part of your portfolio and the average, so you'd have a significant addition by subtraction?
Ric Campo: Well, we are if you – our disposition program is $350 million between now and the end of the year. We probably have more like $470 million, that's in the pipe to be sold, but a lot – the sum of that's going to spill over into 2013. So this is the biggest disposition pipeline that we have had in the last four, five years. So we definitely view that as a disposition program in the capital recycling side of the equation as a major source of capital to fund the development as well. So it's really just a balance between how much you're willing to sell versus how much ATM issuance and secured – unsecured debt that you're willing to do. So we definitely are doing that and we think it's a great move.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson at BMO Capital Markets.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. I am here with [Jeremy Lynn].
Ric Campo: No, he is here in Houston.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: No, he is not.
Ric Campo: Not yet, yes. No, he is gone I know. He was permitted, right?
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So question on the topic of Houston and you just mentioned asset sales being – our disposition pipeline being and is biggest ever being in four years, with Houston being one of those markets given all operations being where they are and maybe if anything that market starts to dwindle down a little bit if (inaudible) in the future?
Ric Campo: Well, the way we look at our acquisition – our disposition program is we try to improve the quality of the portfolio. And so, we are really focused on sort of the bottom part of the portfolio from a sales perspective and there are some Houston assets in there. But I don't look at the market and say Houston is having a great run, therefore we ought to slowed up on selling assets in Houston. It really gets down to the quality of the portfolio and where that asset is vis-à-vis submarket. And I think execution is going to have a long run on this oil issue because when you think about what's going on, the nature gas fracking that's going on across the country is being run in Houston. A lot of people don't realize that the mining jobs in Houston that you see when you see the nature of the jobs, the mining jobs are actually high tech jobs. They are 25-year-old to 30-year-old tech people monitoring flows and the fracking business. So, it's I think execution is great long term and I wouldn't want to sort of sell my best assets in Houston. If it's worldwide, I want to sell sort of my worst which is what we are doing.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, excellent. And my second question is Ric early on your commentaries of the exclusivity period is over for the fund and so that everything else you acquired will be 100% on balance sheet. But I m curious what is the – is there any leftover buying, I assume there is, I don't know the number is that the fund could buy if you want them to?
Ric Campo: No, fund, the only – we do have some excess capital left in the fund and it could be used for development but not acquisitions.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great. That's good. Thank you very much.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Bragg at Zelman.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Hi, good morning to you. I did want to just revisit the question from couple questions ago about the relationship between your answer on relationship between dispositions and starts. And seen as your start plans for the year appear to be pretty consistent with your initial expectations, but your disposition plans have really picked up as the year has progressed. Can you talk about that?
Ric Campo: Sure. The whole funding, when you think about funding our balance sheet, we have a lot of ways to fund it via equity insurance, unsecured debt and dispositions. And so, what we have ramped up the dispositions and part of it is just that balance between capital sources. And the other part of it is, is there going to be a significant narrowing of cap rates on older assets versus cap rates on newer assets. And what happened is, well cap rates have gone in places like Charlotte, Houston and elsewhere, the core assets now are all selling in the force and so, because core assets are sold in the force you are pushing buyers of properties in those markets in the older assets or non-core middle, maybe secondary locations or assets that aren't on the corner of main domain. So what's happened is that spread that used to be 250 basis points wide is like a 150 basis points wide. So, you've got a really interesting opportunity to sell assets at lower cap rates and the higher prices than you did say 12 months ago. And that's one of the reasons we are ramping up our disposition program because we think that the opportunity to capture those lower cap rates and lower the negative spread that we have between our acquisitions and our dispositions is pretty attractive today.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: That's interesting. Thank you. And then just, as you think about the group of assets that you are planning to sell, you certainly touched on their asset quality, but can you talk about the market mix and your thought process behind that part of it?
Dennis Steen: Yeah, Dave, for the assets that we have for sale, I think Ric mentioned in his comments, have an average age of 23 years versus our average portfolio age of about 11.5 years. Though they are on average, they're twice as old as the average asset in our portfolio. They go across probably seven of our markets though it's pretty widespread from the standpoint of where the dispositions are going to come from. But more importantly, it's not -- as Ric mentioned, it's really not about market -- making a market call, it's about making an asset in the submarket call and we have a very, very detailed ROIC tracking metric that we look at and when assets fall to the bottom of the three- and five-year return on invested capital, ranking within our 200 assets which obviously takes into account the higher CapEx requirements on older assets, if you find yourself in the bottom 20 assets, then you're very likely to be on a disposition list and then it gets down to what's the appropriate timing. And as Ric mentioned, this happens to be what we view as a very attractive time to be selling these older assets because the cap rates that are being attached to them. And obviously that's -- a large part of that's being driven by the available financing that's Fannie & Freddie are still very active and individual investors or small groups of investors can put together a club deal on these assets, get a Fannie & Freddie loan. If they're willing to go shorter on the yield curve at 2.5%, 3% and even though what looks like a relatively low cap rate to us in the sixes, when you marry that up with 60% or 70% levered on these what the worst assets in our portfolio are still quite good relative to all multifamily. Now these folks have the opportunity to put together a capital stack that produces 8%, 8.5% cash on cash return to their equity. And today's yield starved environment, there are a lot of people that find that very attractive.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: And just the last question on that point. You mentioned that half of your markets are below prior peak range. What's the relationship between cap rates at the market level and where rents are relative to peak or just -- for example, Las Vegas where rents are well below peak, what's the relationship between cap rates there and some of our other markets.
Dennis Steen: There are very low even in Las Vegas. Last -- beginning of the quarter or beginning of the year, we sold a property in Phoenix, for example. That was a 25-year-old asset that nearly at a 5.1 or 5.2 cap rate and we were just shocked by that. But it goes to the issue, the key problem about the financing availability and then the expectation of rent growth. So Las Vegas as an example if the assets are trading there in the low fives because there's an expectation that there's going to be a big rent pop in Las Vegas, we are still down 18% so we have very little recovery, so we lost 18% of our revenue in Las Vegas during the downturn. And so when investors go to Vegas, it's sort of the last place that people can buy property that have that kind of upside. Now most of the other markets, Phoenix is getting back some of theirs, but maybe about half of what they lost. But Las Vegas is getting back zero, so people are buying by the pound and buying by -- which drives the cap rate really low.
Keith Oden: So Dave from -- just to put some macro touch on that, on those comments from where we are today portfolio wide across 15 markets, rents are 2.4% higher than peak in our entire portfolio. Now obviously there's a pretty big dispersion there and Ric mentioned seven markets where we're still below peak. But were those -- other than Las Vegas where that occurs, we're down in the 2% to 3% range in terms of distance from peak. So I would guess that within the next six months, absent Las Vegas, we'll probably be close to -- back to peak in virtually every market expect Las Vegas. And as Ric mentioned, we've still got a lot of room to recover there from where we were in the peak.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Okay, great. Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paula Poskon at Robert W Baird.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: Thanks. Good morning, everyone and good afternoon. A question on the field staff. Are you seeing any increase in fleet turnover at the properties? And as job growth improves broadly in your markets, how do you sort of think about staying ahead of that in terms of retention strategies?
Ric Campo: Paula, that's a really good question and we have -- I would hazard to guess that we have the lowest turnover rate not just this year, but going back over a period of 10 years in the multifamily business. Our company-wide turnover last year was less than 20%. Obviously it's lower than that in the corporate office than it is on sight, but it's -- we have a remarkable track record of being able to retain our employees and that -- there are a whole lot of things that go into that. But obviously competitive compensation and benefits, but we also do a lot of things that I think none of our competitors do and most of the product companies are not able to do. For example, our community managers every year get a grant of Camden shares that's five-year besting and which is a 100 shares per year and we've been doing this for almost 15 years now. So we've got a lot of community managers that have been with us for a long period of time that have a decent stake in the Camden game by virtue of share grants. So there's a whole lot of things. But at the end of the day, we have not seen any increase in our turnover rate nor would I expect us to do so. I will say though that one of the places that we definitely have seen pressure and that we're not dealing with and haven't dealt with in the last five years is in Houston with regard to our corporate staff, the oil companies, the demand for talented, financial either two-year, five-year or seven-year people is off the charts and why you might not think that there would be much translation from the real estate business to the oil business. If you're a talented financial professional, there are -- it's crazy what the oil companies are doing in terms of making offers to folks. And in particular, we've had to deal with that and we're making adjustments where we need to and have to, but that's definitely an area of pressure. Maybe unique to Houston, because we're probably going to create in Houston probably close to 90,000 jobs again this year and it maybe also unique to the oil patch. But we just happened to be headquartered here, so it's an issue for us, but others might not be the only one.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: That's helpful. Thanks.
Ric Campo: Yeah.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: And sticking with the Houston discussion, I recall from our navy dialogue that you'll be in the market for new office space. Have you started that process yet? And if so, how's it going?
Keith Oden: Yeah, we've started the process and that means that we're just kind of looking at alternatives. We have -- back to the old business, for those that may not be up to speed on this, but we have a lease that expires in 2015. We had a right to an extension, but it was subject to a prior right of Occidental and Occidental has basically told everybody in this building that as their lease expires, they intend to exercise their prior right and eventually occupy 100% of the building that we're in. So we got -- kind of good news is we got time to deal with it. The bad news is moving is never -- it's a lot of moving parts. In our case, it's kind of good news, bad news frankly because we've grown so much over the years from being less than a full floor user to almost three, four floors and we've done it by dribs and drabs and frankly our configuration and stacking right now relative to what we would do in an ideal world is pretty abysmal, so -- and we've got people kind of -- some people kind of sitting on top of each other. So it will be a good opportunity for us to rethink our -- how we should be organized and take a fresh look at things and the good news is we got a few years to deal with it.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: Thanks very much.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky, RBC Capital.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning, guys. Ric, in light on your comments on the job's front they're not being quite up to what you had hoped but still having good rent growth? Can you give us an update on the -- how you feel on supply? [Rene] went through some statistics before kind of talking about job creation for supply. I wonder if that's still holds true and how you feel about the supply situation kind of going forward?
Ric Campo: Sure. As I said in my initial comments, supply is not a threat in any of our markets right now. I know that people worry about supply because when you look at the low levels that we had during the ugly part of the recession where we dropped supply down to 75,000 units a year, which is not enough to offset obsolescence of about 125,000 units. Now we're backed up to maybe nearly 200,000 units. So with that said, the supply that's coming now is really stealing the whole. You look at places like Houston, you are 97% occupied which is basically full. So there's really no place to go. So, what's happening is the supply that's coming in play now in most markets, especially in markets where you can build and you build because you need it. The units that are coming in, not next year, end of this year and into next year are really just filling the hole that will balance the market. It's the supply that will come in 2014 and '15 that you have to worry about not 2012 and 2013. So when you look at the jobs that are created and the demand that those jobs are producing in apartments, I thinks it's more skewed towards apartments primarily, because when you think about the jobs that have been created, nearly 60% of the jobs have gone to the people 34 and younger. So a lot of these jobs that are created are going to our customers as supposed to people that have a lower propensity to rent and the higher propensity to buy homes and live in a single family environment. So I'm not worried about supply things. There's plenty of jobs to be able to able to absorb the supply that's in the market between now and 2013. The question will be, if we had total 250,000 jobs a month, our business – if you can imagine would be a lot better because there is just no place for people to go and they are competing big time for few of – few spaces to go.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: I appreciate the color. Then Dennis just a question what the [debt or credit] you guys recently received, does that change any – does that make any changes to the credit facility or do you guys benefit any way from them?
Dennis Steen: No, we were already split graded and we've kind of been trading from a debt perspective at that higher split grades of having Fitch kind of move us up really didn't do much to the change in the cost by debt.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Karin Ford at KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Hi, just wanted to ask a bigger picture strategy question, As you guys are doing some of the portfolio recycling here and asset sales and then buying and developing, do you have plans to urbanize the portfolio more within your market, is that a goal as you look towards sites that you're buying and things that and assets that you're acquiring?
Ric Campo: Generally, I think the answers yes. And primarily because the demand of the customer is for urban product in most markets and this is a trend that has been going for quite a while. The issue of – and you have to think about sort of the Millennium, the [Genwires] that we are – that are our customers, they want to be closer in, they want to be closer to the action where they can deal with – get involved with all the social things that are going on in their cities. And so there has been definitely a move towards a more urban. Now on the other hand, our suburban properties are doing really well. And so it's – even though urbanization has definitely been get them going on and will continue to go on, our portfolio has definitely been getting newer and closer in over the last five or 10 years and it will continue to do that over the next five or 10 years because that's where the customers really want to be. And I think that's not new, but it's just a continuation. One of the things that I think is interesting in the development side, is that the apartments are actually getting smaller, and so what's happening is the apartments are getting smaller and the social statuses are getting bigger. So people want -- and that gets to affordability, where you are trying to get people in. Most people want to live on their own. They don't want to live with a roommate situation. So if you get a small space that's relatively affordable for those folks, they are willing to do that and to live in that. There's an article that the Houston Chronicle did a while back in one of our projects, Camden Travis Street and the reporters were shocked that somebody would live in a 535 square foot unit and pay $1,200 a month in midtown Houston, and when you go out into the suburbs pay the same price for a two bedroom. The person that lives there really wanted a small unit and they wanted to live in that location. Its right on White Whale and they were willing to pay that price, in that space. So urbanization continues, the development business is definitely shrinking in terms of unit size and becoming more social space oriented, as opposed to big apartments, which I think is a really interesting trend. But you got plenty [wealth] to be more urban.
Keith Oden: Now I think they just went to see that and see what Ric's talking about is in our supplement on page 40 where we lay out the development pipeline and land. We referenced eight communities on that schedule, representing about 2,900 apartments and by our characterization of those, roughly 2,100 of those would be urban and 800 would be suburban.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That's interesting. Okay. Then just finally, as you are bidding up the new starts coming up, are you seeing any upward pressure on construction costs?
Ric Campo: We are definitely seeing some upward pressure, and I think the days of that subcontractors who worked for food are over, and they are now actually requiring a profit margin. So we are definitely seeing some accretion -- nothing dramatic. 1% or 2% in commodity prices or 3 or 4. So we are putting a modest price inflation into our budgets where we didn't do that last year, and then the interesting thing is, our construction costs in our existing pools, in lease-up and the under construction right now are cutting in below our original budgets. But we are definitely putting some price inflation in the new budgets.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thank you very much.
Operator: At This time we have no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks. 
Ric Campo: Great. Well, we appreciate your interest in Camden and it's nice that we ended before [Amko] starts. So with that we will talk to you next quarter, and if anybody has any questions or follow-up, go ahead and get a hold of Keith or Kim or Me and we will be happy to answer those. So thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-27 12:00:00) =====

Analysts:  Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Eric Wolfe – Citigroup Seth Laughlin – ICI Group Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird Rob LaQuaglia – Wells Fargo 
Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to the Camden Property Trust First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. All participants will be in listen only-mode. (Operator Instructions) After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kimberly Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC, and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden’s complete first quarter 2012 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures which will be discussed on the call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Oden, President, and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for one hour and as a result we ask that you limit your questions to two with one follow-up and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. If we’re unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’ll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Richard Campo: Good morning. The strength of the multi-family fundamentals of Jackson Brown thinks about stay a little bit longer. We think that nation has lead to a great start to the year for Camden and will stay much longer without having to ask please, please, please. Same-property revenue increased 6.8% with every market contributing including Las Vegas for the second consecutive quarter. Same-property NOI increased 9.6% over the first quarter of 2011 which was only exceeded by the first quarter of 2006 as the best quarterly NOI growth rate that we’ve had in the last 15 years. Strong operating fundamentals continued to be driven by broad macro factors, pushing more consumers into rental markets. 60% of the new jobs are going to our customer’s, people of 34 years and younger. Homeownership rate continues to fall, while new home mortgages are harder for consumers to fallback for. New supply is not read to at least 2014. In spite of rising rental costs for our customers, their ability to pay higher rents has been consistently improving. Annual incomes for our customers have increased from $62,400 in the first quarter of 2011 with $69,200 today nearly an 11% increase. A percentage of rent income has declined from 18.4% in the first quarter of 2011 to 18% today in spite of significant rent increases. Historically, our customers have paid between 22% and 24% of their incomes for rent, but you will not believe that the rental increase cycle has peaked. We are riding a monster way that has a long way to go before getting to shore. I commend our revenue management teams and our on-site teams for getting as much out of this way that they will give. We continued to focus on external growth and improving the quality of our portfolio through acquisitions, dispositions and our development programs. Our 10 active development programs will deliver 2,800 new apartments for a little over $500 million and are leasing up at a faster rate and at higher rates with no concessions then we expect in our original underwriting. We anticipate starting seven additional properties this year, which will add another 2,061 apartments for an investment of around $400 million. We plan on acquiring $250 million of properties and disposing of a like amount this year. Our real estate investment group and support groups will be very busy. It’s a great time to be in the apartment business. I’ll turn the call over to Keith now.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Compared to our expectations, we are off to a great start in 2012. This is one of those quarters that makes me reluctant to talk much about for fear of jinxing any subsequent quarters. With that in mind, my comments will be brief today. Virtually every metric that we used to monitor the conditions on the ground at our community is either very good or excellent. For the first quarter, same-store average rents on new leases were up 3.1% and renewals were up 8% or blended increase of 4.9%. More importantly in March, new leases came in with a 6.3% increase and renewals averaged 8.4% for a blended increase of 7.1% for the month of March. Revenue growth year-over-year was strong across 14 of our 15 operating – reporting markets. We saw double digit revenue increases in 5 of our 15 markets, Houston, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas, and Denver. And double digit NOI growth in 7 of our 15 markets. The most amazing turnaround was here in Houston. In the first quarter of 2011, Houston same-store revenue declined by eight-tenths of a percent and in this quarter revenues were up 12%, approximately a 1,300 basis point improvement over the year. Sequentially, the top four markets for revenue growth were Phoenix, Houston, South Florida, and Dallas. And while every market had positive sequential revenue growth, clearly the leadership in our portfolio is shifting. Our occupancy for the quarter averaged 94.9% up four-tenths of a percent from the fourth quarter. At 94.9%, we were roughly 1.5% higher occupancies in our original plan and this was a large component of our outperformance on property revenues for the first quarter. Our budgets assumed our occupancy rate with buyers gradually over the year but as it turned out we were able to increase occupancy aggressively in the first quarter while continuing to raise rents. Our occupancy rates budgeted for the balance of the year looked achievable. So, the occupancy related gain in revenue in Q1 not likely be a recurring grant to our plan. Compared to a year ago, our traffic has remained roughly the same, which is great, since last year traffic was up significantly in all four quarters. Despite the aggressive renewal increases, we continued to see manageable turnover rates of 48% in the first quarter and this compares to 42% a year ago and 52% last quarter. In addition, the percentage of residents moving out to purchase a home did pick up slightly to 11.5% in the quarter. It looks like this percentage may have finally found the bottom in the 10.5% range. The financial help of our residents continues to improve. The percentage of our residents listing move outs for financial reasons or job loss was 6.1% versus 9.3% a year ago. Also our bad debt expense for the quarter was 38 basis points and that’s well below our budgeted level of 65 basis points. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Dennis Steen: Thanks, Keith. I’ll begin today with a few comments on our first quarter results. We reported funds from operations for the first quarter of 2012 of $68.6 million or $0.83 per diluted share. Representing a $3.1 million or $0.04 per share improvement from a $.079 per share midpoint of our guidance range for the first quarter of $.077 to $0.81 per share and it was an increase of 15% for diluted share from the first quarter of 2011. The $3.1 million in FFO outperformance for the first quarter relates primarily to $2.6 million in better than expected results from both our consolidated and joint venture communities. Additionally, we experienced a combined $400,000 favorable variance related to lower than expected property management, general and administrative interest and tax expenses. And we had a $100,000 net benefit from three non-recurring items. The $2.6 million and better than expected results from our communities is the result of the following. Property revenues from our consolidated communities exceeded our forecast by $1.5 million due primarily due to the combination of higher occupancies, lower bad debt expense and higher fee income from our stabilized communities and higher than expected leasing velocity at each of our six lease-up communities in our development pipeline. Property expenses from our consolidated communities came in approximately $800,000 better than our expectations. The capable variance and expenses is primarily the result of lower than expected salaries and benefits due to lower benefits costs and open positions. And lower repair to maintenance costs resulting from lower than expected unit turnover rates for our portfolio. The last component of outperformance from our communities for the first quarter is at $300,000 favorable variance in FFO contribution from our joint venture communities. Like our wholly-owned communities, our 44 operating joint venture communities experience similar positive gains in revenues and slightly lower than expected expenses. As I mentioned earlier, we had a net benefit to FFO of a $100,000 during the first quarter from three non-recurring items. I want to provide details on each as there are significant specific line items on our income statement. The first item is an approximately $400,000 benefit related to income allocated to our preferred units. Our prior guidance assume that we would redeem our $100 million 7% preferred units on March 1 and that we would incur a $2.1 million charge on the redemption. We actually completed the redemption February 10 resulting in an approximate $400,000 benefit to the first quarter. As you can see from our income statement we did incur the $2.1 million charge on the redemption. The second non-recurring item is an approximate $400,000 benefit related to additional rental revenues recorded in the quarter as the result of the purchase accounting treatment for the 12 unconsolidated joint ventures we acquired in January. As with any acquisition with real estate estates you are required to set up an intangible assets for the value of any above or below market leases and amortize that intangible to rental revenues over the expected life of the underline leases. For the 12 communities acquired we reported a $1.2 million intangible for the value of below market in place leases acquired. $400,000 of the intangible of amortize to rental revenues in the first quarter and $600,000 and $200,000 will be amortized in the second and thrived quarters of 2012 respectively. To isolate this non-cash amortization we have included it in the other category of property revenues in the components of property net operating income summary on page 11, of our supplemental package. The third non-recurring item was an approximate $700,000 charge included in other income in the first quarter related to a mark to-market loss on our $500 million interest rate swap that we de-designated last year upon the payoff about $500 million term loan, the loss as a result of the declines in forecasted interest rates through the remaining life of the swap which matures in October of 2012. We do not anticipate material charges in future quarters. Turning to earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2012, we expect projected FFO per diluted share to be within the range of $0.85 to $0.89 per diluted share. The midpoint of $0.87 per share represents a $0.04 per-share increase from the first quarter of 2012. This $0.04 per share increase is primarily result of the following. A $0.02 per-share increase in FFO due to the growth in property net operating income as a result of an approximate 1% expected sequential increase in same property NOI as revenue growth from rental rate increases and occupancy gains more than offsets our expected increase in property expenses due to normal seasonal summer increases in utilities and repair and maintenance cost. And the incremental NOI contribution from the lease-up of communities in our development pipeline and from the 12 joint-venture communities we acquired on January 25 of this year. Additionally, $0.03 per share increase in FFO due to the impact of the redemption of our $100 million, 7% preferred units in the first quarter and a $0.01 per share increase in FFO due to higher property net operating income due to the unfavorable $700,000 charge we reported in the first quarter on our interest rate swap. The above three positives are partially offset by $0.02 per share in dilution resulting from the full quarterly impact of 6.6 billion shares we issued in January to fund our acquisition of 12 unconsolidated joint ventures and the impact of shares issued year-to-date through our ATM program as we continued to reduce leverage and prefund the equity requirements for our development activities. We have not changed our same-store growth or projected transaction assumptions for 2012, but we have increased the bottom end of our 2012 full year FFO per share guidance range by $0.05 to reflect our FFO outperformance for the first quarter of 2012. We now expect full year FFO per share to be in the range $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share. At this time, we’ll open the call up to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And our first question is from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O’Neill.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Good morning down there.
Richard Campo: Good morning.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Just the first question is on the turnover. If you can just talk give a little bit more color, your turnover was up but yet you guys increased occupancy. So, can you just give more color on the change of the demographic of the tenant base?
Dennis Steen: In terms of changing demographics of the tenant base there is really not – there is nothing between the two quarters that will make us believe that there was any – we’ve no evidence but that is actually changing. The fact that turnover rate that the turnover rate was up 6% roughly 6% over on year-over-year basis does reflect partially that we push the heck out of rents but the flipside of that was we had sufficient traffic to be able to do it. And we are going to we’ll continue to do that as we think the trade off makes sense. We are within a range right now. Our annual turnover rate tends to run in the 47% to 50% range and we’re very comfortable with that range over the course of the year. So the fact that we’re 48 for the quarter really doesn’t get on my radar screen very much in light of the fact that we were able to push rents and push occupancy. So you’re always going to have when you’re doing those two things, you’re always going to have little bit more at the margin. People moving and making other decisions but as Rick mentioned on his in the stats that we look out for the ability to pay relative to our customer base, those metrics have improved materially in each of the last two years. So do they like it, no? No one likes rental increases. Do we get tons of emails? Sure but can they pay? And the answer of that is that they are paying a smaller percentage of their take home pay on a household income basis than they were last year. I think the other thing that you need really think about on turnover is the last few years has been at historical lows and that’s been driven by a lousy economy where people are doubled up and they are not moving around. They’re sort of stuck because economy is not that good. But if you think about Texas and you think about some of these really good economies who are adding 100,000 jobs but what’s happening is that you are sort of releasing that pent up demand by roommates breaking up and going to smaller units and having their own independent housing situation. So we would expect in a more buoyant economy where all the jobs are being created to have a higher turnover rate because people are actually moving around and that’s a good thing.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Yeah. That’s mote to the point what I was asking you sort of how many of the people who came in when rents were low have now sort of left and been replaced by people who are more commensurate with the price point that’s more of my question was going.
Dennis Steen: Well, I think – I think that’s exactly what’s happening. You’re definitely having people moving down market they can afford it and you’re having people move into our apartments that have higher incomes, they can afford it. And I think that’s evidenced by the percentage of rent that they’re paying. The increase – obviously in America, we haven’t had a 11% increase in earnings in a 12-month period, yet our customers have their incomes have gone up 11%. So clearly, we’re replacing sort of weaker customers with stronger customers and it’s all a function of the job growth and the buoyancy of the economy that we’re operating.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. And then second question is, Rick and Keith, you guys have been pretty active in the past in the corporate M&A world. As you speak around – what’s your sense for other CEOs (inaudible) our people with where the apartment valuations have gone. Do you sense that people are starting to be more willing to contemplate M&A or you think it still comes down to whenever a CEO decides its time, its time and apart from that there is not much else that can be done?
Richard Campo: I think that the latter part of your question is correct. M&A is a total social situation. It tends to be driven by the CEO and the board and the management team as to what they think about the world and how they feel about their business. And I think when you think about the multi-family business today, share prices have come back and values have improved dramatically, but when you look out on the horizon, you have to say; well, should I sell today because prices are high and the question becomes; well, what is your outlook for the future. And right now, the outlook for the multi-family future is pretty damn good for the next two to three of four years, because of all these macro factors. So I think it’s hard for people to unless you just believe in, the economy is going to go down big-time and Europe is going to blow up and stock markets are going to go down 50%. You believe that then maybe you are going to run for the doors, but I don’t think from a fundamental perspective people believe that our business is going to start getting bad or not as buoyant as it is today. So, when you put that backdrop with why would I want to sell when I think that the rental rates are going to go up and my cash flow is going up that becomes – so you have both situations sort of hurting M&A. On the one hand if you are running a company and you think it’s a great time to be in this business, why would you want to sell unless you believe it’s a top and I don’t think anybody in this business and I don’t think at the top.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Hi, good morning to you. I don’t think you mentioned this, what’s current occupancy?
Richard Campo: Last report was 94.9.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Okay. Thanks. And then Rick, could you just talk about your view on the housing recovery occurring in many of your markets, maybe provide some commentary beyond the increasing move out by home rate?
Richard Campo: Sure, the housing market in a lot of our markets is improving. I am talking about not just multifamily, but single-family, the markets that didn’t have the bust markets like Houston, whole of Texas really didn’t have a buzz, I mean we have situations in all of those markets where the single-family home business is actually doing really well. You do have probably submarket issues. So in Houston for example in the inner loop – houses around the market or two weeks to three weeks bids are exceeding listing price now which is kind of hurts my head, my 30 year old daughter just bought a house by her office and had to be $10,000 above listing price to be able to get the house. So, that the market that are – the housing markets that are that haven’t been affected by the buzz were actually doing pretty well and a lot better than once that are affected by the buzz. There are some interesting things going on in markets like Las Vegas where you have sort of the regulatory environment that has created an unusual situation there in Las Vegas. If you really want to buy house you do have to pay less price or higher and you’re bidding mortgage going on Las Vegas. And there are some strange things happening as a result of the laws that were passed in October 2011, AB284 was passed by the legislature in Nevada, which basically fairly simple low, that basically said lender before they can send out a default notice which was the first step in a foreclosure process had approved through an enough data that they actually had the mortgage and own the loan. And just to give you a sense of the defaults notices that went on in September 2011, this law came into effect in October of 2011. During September first three or four weeks of September had about 2,000 default notices go out. And in October they had 58. So part of the challenge in Las Vegas is that the inventory stock and such creating kind of an interesting situation where there is really limited inventory and housing prices are rising as a result of that. I think the Case-Shiller numbers for March and April are going to be surprising everyone in Las Vegas, but generally I think we feel like the single-family market is improving in all of our markets and it’s all driven by job growth and prices getting mark-to-market and consumers are buying homes, so it’s good and I fundamentally think that you have to have a positive single-family market for the multifamily market to be good long-term because it’s such a big driver of our economy.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: And then when you think about the higher quality tenants coming in through the front door today, as compared to those that are leaving and this recovery occurring in the single-family market. To what degree, do you become more concerned about that move out to by rate accelerating from the current level?
Richard Campo: Well I think the – we always look at those numbers for sure, but in a reasonable economy and let’s just take the 90s as an example where you start out in 1993 with home ownership rate about 64%. By the end of the decade, it was like 66% or 67% and that almost hit 70% in the next decade. During that period about 12% to 14% of the people in our apartments moved out to buy homes. What was really turned out to be a very, very good multi-family environment during that timeframe, what was happening was, you had the situation where you got a very vibrant economy. You had 20 plus million jobs created. So there was a lot of households created and we got our fair share of demand from the economy. I think that as long as single-family homes are not going to take share from multi-family until you have a buoyant – a buoyant economy. As long as we have a buoyant economy or creating jobs and we are – we have reasonable household formation like in past history then people moving out the backdoor to buy homes will be filled with people moving in the front door from the demographics and just a buoyant economy. So I think that while single family people worried about – worry about people moving out to buy homes, they’ve always moved out to buy homes in our business. The problem in the 2003 through 2008 timeframe was that we had really good renters who became really bad homers because they put no down payment. They didn’t have the wherewithal to make a mortgage payment. I think that could be or that would be a threat to multifamily if we had that situation happen again. I doubt given the bust and given the underwriting criteria and everything going on in the single family mortgage market that will happen anytime soon. So if we just have a normal environment where 12%, 14% of our people moving out to by houses but they are being replaced by new baby boom echo kids and immigrants and others that are traditional renters. We should be fine.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Richard Campo: And Dave just to clarify, our current occupancy rate is 95.3%.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Okay. That sounds to closer to a level that you spoke about a month ago. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Rich Anderson at BMO Capital Markets.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Hey, Good morning everybody.
Richard Campo: Hi, Rich.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So I want to talk about this first question on the rent to income ratio. So like if I’m a resident faced with a 10% rent increase it might be like – I’ve got to say no but let me first go look at my own personal rent to income calculation side. I don’t think they think that acutely about the situation. I don’t know if you think that, but I doubt people think about their own personal rent income ratio. And so, in saying that, I guess my worry is a wearing down effect. You got one big rent increase after another, eventually it’s going to get to the point where residents are just collectively put a halt to things. And I am wondering, you said you gave a lot of push back in calls and things like that, but at what point are you worried that, maybe rent income ratio is fine, but we’re just wearing people down here? And only thing that have to happen is the homework has to open up and then that creates option and you might still get good rent income or rental growth but maybe not as vibrant as you’re getting today. I wonder if you could comment on that.
Richard Campo: Yeah. Rich, I would – there is no question that our folks are not doing rent to income calculation. But I think it is – it’s useful to think about it from a big picture standpoint. And if you think about where we are right now in rent, we are currently as a portfolio and obviously it’s – there is variances between markets, but if you take all of Camden’s, which is a pretty big footprint over 15 markets and you take all of them combined, we just crossed over where we were in peak brands in 2008 last quarter. So in the aggregate across all of our communities, this is the first quarter that the average resident is paying more in rent in actual dollars than they were in 2008.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: But that’s a different person.
Richard Campo: I understand that. But – so the question becomes, the market is the market. And as long as we are raising rents and we don’t deviate too far from what the rest of the market is doing then everyone has to look at and say, okay, what is my alternative. I’m going to go shop and they do it all the time but the good news is that our – with our yield management system we know exactly what the market is. We know exactly what demand is and it’s what I guessing about what the price level should be and experimenting we know with very good predictability what you can do with rents and what the likely effect that will be on both turnover and your overall occupancy rates. So, it’s not that we’re, we don’t think that there is pressure. Obviously when you get 10% rental increases back-to-back no one likes it and there’s – I’m sure there are a certain percentage of people that just out of as a matter of principle not because of their doing their income to rent ratio, but just as a matter of principle, they go shop. They discover that lo and behold everybody in Houston raised their rents 12% in the last year and or at least let me explain this way. All of the likely alternatives for our residents which are class A communities that are well located. Our competitors are doing the same thing. Now are they sophisticated on revenue management? Of course not, but there it doesn’t take a whole lot of sophistication to call your comps and say what did you do on rents which is what our – we give a lot of information to the marketplace. Other people check in what we’re doing on rents. So is a percentage of that 48% we moved out notwithstanding the fact that they’re going to pay approximately the same amount of rent across the street or down on another block. Yeah, that probably is. And I understand that and that’s the trade-off but as long as turnover is staying in a band that we’re comfortable with given traffic demand, the ability to backfill and we’re raising rents and we’re raising occupancy then from our perspective as good operators in this business that’s our obligation to do that.
Dennis Steen: Okay. And there choice is to say I’m going to get angry and I’m going to go somewhere else.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Just second question then is I’m looking at median household income number in your markets of about 40,000 and you’re saying 69,000. Is that the difference between your markets and the subsector of your market that rents your apartment is it that substantial or do you think that my 40,000 number is wrong?
Richard Campo: I think that broad numbers can mislead people and when you think about markets I always use Houston as an example. You can buy $140,000 house in Houston. But it’s not – that’s the medium price of a house in Houston is not relevant if you’re inside the loop. Inside the loop, the average housing price is an excess of San Diego, California. And that hurts people’s head so if you use a average meeting income for a broad metropolitan area like Houston you’re going to get total skewed because our average income for example at Camden Travis Street in Huston is around $90,000 a year. Clearly much higher than the average income of Houston overall. And that’s because it’s very well located and in the rents there 1,500 bucks to $2,500 a month. You go out into the Hinterlands in Huston, you can get the same apartment from a square footage perspective for $600 and your average income in that apartment is probably going to be $30,000 to $40,000 per annual income. So I do think they are skewed by submarkets in a major way in major metropolitan areas.
Dennis Steen: Rich just as a follow-up on that, in Houston the average – or average household income on our current Tennessee is 73,000 a year.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay.
Richard Campo: Yeah.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. So, I just want to say that I heard the music and I heard the words running on empty and it’s later than it seems, but that was just my interpretation, so.
Richard Campo: Some people have the glass half full and some have half empty. Now we know who you are?
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks guys.
Dennis Steen: At least you didn’t hear it, at least you didn’t hear for tender.
Richard Campo: We will think about little wane next time, what do you think?
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Oh, I got all kinds of suggestions, all that you know.
Richard Campo: E-mail one. We are always looking for good ideas.
Operator: And our next question is from Eric Wolfe of Citi.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Thanks. Ric, when you said your residence income has gone from 62,000 to 69,000, you’re talking about the average of costs at your tenant base or those just the people that are moving in right now?
Richard Campo: That’s the average across the tenant base.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Okay.
Richard Campo: That includes.....right.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Okay.
Richard Campo: Just to clarify that’s household income.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Okay.
Richard Campo: So, where you have two people living together, that’s total household income.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Okay. And so I guess – I guess my question is if you look at just the people moving in this last quarter or recently, how much high are their incomes relative to those people that are moving out, is that like a $10,000 gap, $20,000 gap, trying to understand how much the income profile of your tenants is sort of changing recently?
Dennis Steen: Yeah, from the third to the fourth quarter of 2011 to the current quarter, it went from 66 to 69, so $3,000 difference in household income.
Richard Campo: But the challenge is does that includes the entire base. We haven’t tracked it that way and we probably could, but we haven’t. We don’t have those numbers in front of us right now. But clearly the new people coming in have a higher income than the existing people that are – that are, let’s say have been there for two years and we don’t recheck their income to drive that number up. And so, we think that that 69 is probably low, because our existing basis never knew are not re-qualified and they don’t tell us when they get raises. So I would think that – that clearly some of the people coming in have higher incomes, but also our existing embedded base are getting raises as well. So we can try and – maybe get some more granular information on that and get back to you later on that.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: That would be helpful. And then just a second question on your guidance, you mentioned that $2.6 million better NOI from the consolidated and JV properties. It wouldn’t seem like that’s – that NOI benefit is being carried forward in your guidance. So I’m just wondering what would make this reverse or is there something offsetting it later on?
Richard Campo: I think as you see as we go from the first quarter to second, as I looked at the backlog, the first component of our growth is $0.02 improvement due to the performance of the NOI of our properties and that even in a quarter where we normally have an increase in expenses. So I mean there is still a decent walk from first to second. I think our same store revenue guidance is actually up 1.8% consecutively.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: I guess the reason I am asking this if you look at your first quarter same-store revenue growth and you compare that with your fourth quarter, they’re about the same. And you look at last year where you ended up from the same-store revenue perspective at 5.5% and you compare that with your guidance this year, also 5.5%. It would seem to be me that you’re predicting – deceleration this year that’s essentially equivalent to what you had in acceleration last year. And I don’t know if that’s the right way to think about it?
Richard Campo: Well, I think what we’ve done in our guidance, the first quarter is always the toughest quarter to try to decide whether you’re going to change your guidance for the whole year so we sort of tickle the guidance if you will by raising the bottom of the guidance, but what we’ve done from our peer modeling perspective is just to use our original budget through the, for the second and third and fourth quarter. We clearly beat in the first quarter and then we do have our occupancies and our rental rates ramping up in that budget. But with that said we’re – that’s how we did our guidance. So clearly it implies that, I guess just a math implies that if you start out at 6.8% revenue growth and you say your average is going to be 5.5% for the year, you have a decline in that, but I think there’s upside in those numbers clearly.
Dennis Steen: And if you look back in last year in to the second quarter we actually are same store portfolio increase on revenues 2.9% with a significant piece of that was an increase in occupancy. So we’re not going to have that same type of impact this year as we did last.
Richard Campo: Right.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: That makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Seth Laughlin of ICI Group.
Seth Laughlin – ICI Group: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on DC supply it sounds everyone starting to expect the bulk of it to began in the fourth quarter of this year. Just wondering if that’s in your budget and if you can help us in kind of what the magnitude of that impact is going to be.
Richard Campo: First of all we missed the first part of your question, so can you repeat it?
Seth Laughlin – ICI Group: Yeah. Apologies it’s just a question on the DC supply. It sounds like fourth quarter when we’re going begin to see the bulk of that hit the market. Wanted to see if that’s in your budgets and if you can help us with the magnitude of the impact on your portfolio that you expect there?
Richard Campo: Sure. The new supply is definitely in our budget, when we do our budgets we do them on a property-by-property basis and each property looks that it’s competitive set and we try to then manage our budget space on the competitor set. So with that said any developments would be in fact, dialed into those to those scenarios and when you look at DC, it definitely has decelerated from its peak but we still believe it’s going to be a positive contributor to the overall income growth. Keith, you want to....
Keith Oden: Yeah, the written numbers for 2012 completions for DC metro are about 6,000 apartments. Same-stores for job growth in 2012 DC metro is 36,000 jobs sort of at the five to one ratio that we – is there a kind of thumbnail ratio that we’ve used in the past that would imply pretty close to equilibrium in that market. So if you get 6,000 new apartments that at 5 to 1, you will need 30,000 jobs to naturally take that – take on that absorption. So, yeah, there’s going to be supply and that’s not allocated perfectly across that market. There’re going to be pockets that are going to have some competitive pressure from the new lease-ups but you got – the overall market in DC even though it has decelerated, we’re still raising rents in DC as we do not raise on the 10%, we raise on it 4%, so in most days that would be considered really healthy market.
Seth Laughlin – ICI Group: All right.
Richard Campo: But when Houston’s doing 12 and Charlotte is doing 14 and Dallas is doing 10, you say well DC looks weak. Well, I think we’re going to be okay there.
Seth Laughlin – ICI Group: And in terms of your markets in Texas and then maybe specifically in Atlanta not concerned about supply sort of meeting that growth in this calendar year?
Richard Campo: No, clearly not this calendar year or next. I mean there’s – Houston has probably 10,000 permits being closed in Houston right now, but the problem is may be the benefit is that that those units aren’t going to leasing up until 2013, best case – end of 2013.
Keith Oden: We’ve got completions in Houston out after 2013 or in 2013 of about 11,000 apartments, which again sounds like a big numbers, but in a market like Houston, it’s really not that troublesome, particularly in light of the job growth forecast or 2013 that’s predicting another 90,000 or so jobs. So again, 5 to 1 on the 11,000, 55,000 jobs, we are probably going to get 90,000 jobs.
Seth Laughlin – ICI Group: Understood.
Richard Campo: And there is really nothing you can’t go to the grocery store and buy a multi-family apartment, it is what it is, those – the completion numbers for 2013 are, I mean that’s a pretty hard number and known and knowable. And so that’s my – I think in Ric’s opening comment that you got to get out to 2014 in everyone of these markets before you start, but you will see us doing any hindering about supply, because it is a known number in for what’s come in 2012 and 2013. Now the job growth side of it, who knows. We are certainly in our markets, we are clipping along, there is some pretty decent job growth right now, nationally it’s still pretty tacit but in our markets it’s a better than that.
Seth Laughlin – ICI Group: Understood. I guess my next question is just on San Diego, there has been a lot of talk about weakness in that market, but it looks like you guys have some pretty healthy sequentially growth as maybe just a little bit more color there, are you seeing something in that market other aren’t or is that just a blip in one time?
Dennis Steen: I would say it’s a blip.
Richard Campo: San Diego continues to be a struggle, probably it was just a real weak fourth quarter, in fact I think we did have a real weak fourth quarter. One of our communities only have, I think three or four communities that role up into the same store there. One of them is very much affected by what happened in the deployment and we have two aircraft carriers that within the last six months have been moved, one for renovation and one for permanent redeployment and it – then it wacked us in the fourth quarter. So I think the story – our story is about same as everybody else is for San Diego.
Seth Laughlin – ICI Group: Great. And then I’ll just wrap up, apologize if I missed this. What are you guys setting up for renewals going forward?
Richard Campo: The April renewals are running in the 8 plus range, 8.2%; new leases, we didn’t give that in the prepared remarks. New leases are running in the 6.2% range. So pretty consistent with what we saw for the month of – for the month of March.
Seth Laughlin – ICI Group: But are you accelerating those renewals requests as you kind of head further into the summer or do you expect that to stay at the current level?
Richard Campo: Our renewals rates on renewal increases going back are probably 14 months, they have averaged about 8%. And I just don’t see any reasons but think that that’s going to change much.
Seth Laughlin – ICI Group: Understood. That’s all from me.
Richard Campo: Thank you.
Operator: And next we have a question from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning, guys. On the development side, couple of your peers took up the return expectations turning ahead, just curious as to how as you start leasing these properties up, how the actual rents are under – how rents are trending versus your actual underwriting? And also, I think you talked about development strategy for the year. Can you give us a sense how that lays down in terms of actual starts maybe on a quarterly basis?
Richard Campo: Sure. In terms of our brands, rents are definitely higher than our original pro forma, probably 3% to 4%. The more interesting part for me was the speed at which they are releasing up and also the fact that we were giving no concessions in a typical development lease up over the last 20 years since I have been involved in it or maybe more. I don’t know that we’ve ever had development sort of leased up with zero concessions meaning that you have customers coming into the projects and there’s lot of construction mess and you start delivering a few buildings and everything else is going on and usually you give a little month or half a month or something. It’s an enticement for them to lease. So this environment in Tampa and Orlando, zero concessions is pretty amazing. And what you have there is just no supply and there’s a pretty high demand for new paint and new developments there in this environment. And with that said, we definitely have higher rents and no concessions that should lead to higher returns obviously somewhere between 40 to 50 basis points is what we expect in terms of better returns once they’re stabilized.
Richard Campo: Michael in terms of development starts right now we haven’t scheduled this one in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 one of which is a fund asset.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Appreciate the color there. Second of all just in light of the higher turnover you guys talked about there. Can you give us a sense if there are any markets where you’re facing greater resistance and also there’re any markets in particular across the portfolio, is it pushing longer renewal and new lease rates, where you saw pretty big spike in turnover?
Richard Campo: We didn’t – we have not really seen any big spike from the standpoint of variance to prior quarter 42% to 48% would imply kind of an average delta of about 6% more than turnover rates in the prior year. And we’ve got some 7s and 8s, the only one that jumped out at me was Austin at 11% in terms of change in turnover rate year-over-year. And when you look at it because it’s not because their discounted rate elevated, because it was so incredibly low a year ago. So went – and Austin went from 35% to 46%, but the number on that that strike me as hard as the 35%.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: And just as a follow-up to that. Can you talk a little bit about the loss lease, and you guys have been pushing pre aggressively, just curious as to how your – how the rents across the portfolio there, compared to market at this point?
Richard Campo: So, we don’t – our loss to lease change is hourly, because we are in a revenue management world, we re-price our inventory online every minute. So it’s not a number that we – that data is even meaningful for us to try to think about in terms of loss lease.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, so it’s safe to say that you’re moving rents to market or you pushing rents above market at this point?
Richard Campo: We are moving rents to what our yields star revenue pricing model recommends. I would say right now that we are probably in the 90% plus accept range. So not meaning that that 90% plus of all of the recommended lease rent either renewals or new leases are accepted without any further scrutiny and there is always a percentage up that do get scrutiny for – everybody has their own little one-off vagaries of reasons. So when you say pushing on the market, we are pushing them to what we believe the market is or what the market will sustain. Sometimes that may mean that we are pushing the rents more than our competitors because they’re not – they’re just not as quick to adapt to changes in market conditions. What normally happens is they call us or somebody else like us and ask what you’re doing on rents. We tell them and they adjust the rents.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. That’s great color. I greatly appreciate you guys. Thank you.
Richard Campo: The poor man’s revenue management system.
Operator: And next we have a question from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: Thanks, Good Afternoon. I do want to follow up on the home owners to move out to home ownership ratio, is that ratio pretty consistent across your markets or do you see a wide variance across the markets?
Richard Campo: It doesn’t vary that much. There are a couple of them that are little bit counterintuitive. Our Las Vegas move out to home ownership is one of the lowest in the portfolio which is – maybe because what Rick is saying earlier about the homes that are kind of stuck in the pipeline and you just can’t get access to that inventory. So, on the high end you’d see a Denver at 15%, 16%. You probably see Atlanta or Raleigh in the 16% range. On the lowest end, you got California at 7.8% and then you got Vegas and Austin in the 10% range and those will be the three lowest in terms of turnover rate. So our move out is not a – there’s not a huge change. Our historical number on the average on this number is in the 18%, 19% range. So we have no – we don’t have any single market that even back to the long-term average of move out to purchase home.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: That’s helpful. Thanks. And then just a bigger picture question, given the growth that you’re contemplating over the next couple of years. Do you think your current platform, your infrastructure can handle and manage that growth or do you feel like you’re going to need to add some bandwidth and some infrastructure?
Richard Campo: Our current platform could handle lot of growth. We have systems in place where we had properties that’s just plug and play. The systems are very scalable so we would require very little additional G&A or infrastructure to grow the platform with roughly 70,000 units I don’t think we need to be much unless you get maybe up to the – over 100,000 unit kind of zone.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: That’s helpful, that’s all I have. Thank you.
Richard Campo: Okay.
Operator: And next we have a follow up question from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks. Sorry to keep you going here. But a question on the income growth at 11% you mentioned is that all pure income growth or is that also a function of how you move the portfolio around over the course of the past year.
Richard Campo: Now that’s same store so it would be same store household income. So it should be reflecting of what’s going on in the portfolio. We do think it’s probably understated because of the fact that we do not re-underwrite or ask the people who are renewing their leases if their rent has – if their income has gone up or down. We expect to paying a 10% increase in their rent that they are likely to have had income growth, but we don’t actually go back and ask them. So that number is – should be all same store, it should be exactly the same portfolio for each period that we’re measuring.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. That’s all I have. Thanks.
Richard Campo: Okay. Great.
Operator: And next we have a question from Rob LaQuaglia of Wells Fargo.
Rob LaQuaglia – Wells Fargo: Thanks guys. Just a quick question on your longer term portfolio plans, Washington D.C. has become a larger and larger contributor to your overall NOI. And I think at 19%, it’s the highest it’s ever been. Where would you expect that to peak out and what is the target percentage in that market over the next two to three years?
Richard Campo: Well, we like Washington D.C. a lot long-term. I mean it’s great market and it always has been a great market. Overall as we manage our portfolio, we will – that number will go up and down. It will probably stay in the zone that it is now maybe up a couple percent, may be down a couple percent, but we – we are more interested in the quality of the portfolio within that market. We do have two new developments that are building there and we have some aligned properties into the extent that we would do more acquisitions and/or development in D.C. we would likely sell a couple of assets as well. So we sort of like where are there and we like the – and I think one of the big issues the big thing if you have to remember about Washington D.C. is its very different submarket. So the District is very different than Loudon County and some of these other markets. So we don’t really look at it as 19% in one specific market because of the way you can slice that submarkets up pretty effectively.
Rob LaQuaglia – Wells Fargo: Great. Thanks.
Richard Campo: Sure.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rick Campo for closing remarks.
Richard Campo: Great, we appreciate everybody on the call today. And we will see you in (inaudible). Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan. Please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden’s fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden’s complete fourth quarter 2011 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for one hour, and as a result, we ask that you limit your questions to two with one follow-up and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’ll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Richard J. Campo: Thanks, Kim, and good morning and afternoon to everyone on the call. Our pre-conference music was chosen today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Beach Boys. I know, we’ve received number of e-mails about the Beach Boys, they maybe a little too old for this crowd on the call, but for some of us the good vibrations are definitely a continuing theme in the multifamily business. We are looking forward to catching the wave of continued strong operating performance in 2012. I want to thank our Camden teams that made our strong 2011 operating performance possible. We ended 2011 strong with same-property revenue increasing 6.7% over the fourth quarter of 2010, and 5.5% for the year, which leads the sector in revenue growth so far. Same-store net operating income increased 8% for the quarter, and 7.1% for the year. We expect 2012 to be a repeat of the strong growth that we had in 2011. Strong macro factors continue to favor our business. On the demand side, falling home prices and tougher mortgage underwriting has kept competition from single-family home limited. Our customers have been doing very well in a slow job growth environment. Nearly, 60% of the jobs created in last two years have gone to people 34 years old and younger. The average income of our residence has increased from $61,000 per year to nearly $67,000 in the last year driving the ratio of rent paid to income down from 18.5% to 18% in a rising rent environment. Historically, the rent to income ratio across our portfolio has been around 22%. While more young adults are working now, there are still 1.8 million living at home or in roommate situations, most of whom are waiting to move out into apartments. Multifamily supply is increasing from post World War II lows, but it’s now forecast to reach 200,000 units until late 2014. Multifamily demand should continue to exceed supply for at least the next several years supporting strong multifamily operating fundamentals. During 2011, and into January 2012, we took advantage of an attractive acquisition disposition and development environment. We acquired 6,076 apartments in our fund for $590 million, generating double digit cash returns for our partners. We continue to recycle capital through dispositions, and sold 2,800 apartments for $251 million. Our real estate investment and construction team started 2,800 apartments adding $504 million to our development pipeline. After the end of the quarter, we acquired our partner’s interest in 12 properties, 10 of which we developed. We financed the acquisition with 100% equity. The acquisition and equity offering was accretive to earnings, and strength in our balance sheet. Debt-to-EBITDA is now 6.3 times compared to 7.6 times during 2010. We will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet or the debt-to-EBITDA target of around 6 times. We continue to be active in the transactions market, and we’ll be active this year. Our 2012 guidance includes $250 million on balance sheet acquisitions and $250 million of dispositions. We expect to add another $350 million to $450 million to our development pipeline bringing our development pipeline to nearly $1 billion. At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Keith Oden.
D. Keith Oden:  Thanks, Rick. Consistent with prior years, I’m going to use my time on today’s call to review the market conditions we expect in kind of in our four markets in 2012. I’ll address the markets in the order of strength by finding elaborate each one as well as our view as to whether we believe the market is likely to be improving, stable or defining in the year ahead. Following the market overview, I’ll provide additional details on fourth quarter operations and our 2012 same-property guidance. Starting with an overview of Camden’s markets, we’ll begin in Texas and North Carolina, whose markets received our top five spot this year, and all ranked as an A or A minus. Austin received an A rating with a stable outlook, the same rating as last year. As expected, Austin’s same-property revenue growth ranked number one in our portfolio in 2011, and we expected to remain near the top in 2012. Approximately, 15,000 new jobs are projected in 2012, which should easily absorb the 3,000 completions coming online this year. Dallas also earned an A with a stable outlook. Coming in just behind Austin at number two for 2011 revenue growth, favorable market condition should place Dallas in the top five markets again in 2012. Job growth is forecasted at 50,000 this year and the completion of 8,000 new apartments will be right in line with the 20 year historical average for completions in Dallas. In Charlotte, we view that market as an A with an improving outlook. We began seeing strength in this market during the second quarter of 2011, and by year end, it was one of our top performers. Rents continue to accelerate at rapid pace, and with current occupancy at 96%, Charlotte should be one of the best markets in 2012. Job growth is expected to be 16,000 this year with only 1,000 new units being delivered. Next is Raleigh with an A minus rating and a stable outlook. Raleigh was number three in our same-property revenue growth rankings last year, and should see above average performance again this year. 11,000 new jobs and mere 1,100 completions will allow occupancy and rental rates to remain high in this market throughout 2012. Huston is also an A minus, but with an improving outlook. After lagging in the early part of 2011, this market recovered quickly, and it was one of our best performers by year-end with 4Q ’11 revenues up 9.7% over the prior year, which bodes well for 2012. Houston is expected to be a leader in job creation in 2012 with the forecast of 66,000 new jobs. We’ll see 7,000 new units delivered here this year, which looks quite reasonable compared to the 11,000 units we averaged each year from 2000 to 2009. Great Denver and South Florida is B plus markets with stable outlook, and expect the revenue and NOI growth to exceed the midpoint of our same-property guidance range. The outlook for the job growth in Denver this year is favorable with over 34,000 new job expected, and competitions of only 2000 units in 2012. In south Florida, completions are projected around 2200 apartments with 25,000 new jobs expected. Once again new supply should be easily absorbed given tight market conditions and ample job growth. Orlando scored B rating this year with an improving outlook. But last year’s performance was slightly below the average for our portfolio. We believe 2012 will be better. Job growth is expected at nearly 22,000 with less than 1,000 new completion provided the favorable backdrop for our operations there. Our remaining Eastern and South Eastern markets, Washington DC, Atlanta and Tampa all are in B ratings this year with stable outlook. DC has fairly been one of the best markets in the country for the past several years turning in top tier revenue growth in both 2009 and 2010, and remaining strong for most of 2011. Our rents in DC are currently 8% above the prior peak levels, which makes it more challenging to aggressively raise rent. As such, growth has begun to moderate, and we expect 4% to 5% revenue growth in the market during 2012. New supply is starting to come online with 5,000 new units being delivered this year. Job growth is expected to be over 29,000, which will certainly help. The growth in DC will surely be less robust during 2012 than it has been in previous years. In Atlanta, there are over 30,000 new jobs projected with only 1,200 completions (inaudible) and job growth in Tampa is expected to be closer to 16,000 with 1,600 completions, allowing for decent performance in that market as well. Moving west, we have Southern California and Phoenix, both rated B minus, but improving. Southern California has struggled for the past few years, but economic indicators staying to be pointing in the right direction for 2012. Over 54,000 new jobs are expected this year, which is good news given the region’s high unemployment rates. Projected completions of less than 8,000 units in 2012, not materially impact the market. Phoenix is definitely on recovery mode making its way steadily up the rating scale from an F in 2009 to a B minus today. Our rents fell almost 18% from a big drop in Phoenix. We recovered half of that so far, most of it during 2011 as year end rents were 8% higher than in 2010. We continue to see strength in Phoenix, and expect it to be one of our top revenue growth markets during 2012. Stock growth, it will be strong 49,000 new jobs with minimal supply, only 12,000 additional units to be delivered this year. Coming in last this year, is Las Vegas, which we rated at C minus with an improving outlook. Las Vegas is still most challenging market in our portfolio, but we believe that’s finally bottomed, and is showing signs of improvement going into 2012. While we do expect positive growth this year, the rate of growth will likely be well below that of our other 13 markets. 20,000 new jobs are projected for Vegas in 2012, which is a welcome relief, and we expect only 1,100 completions, but stubbornly high unemployment rate coupled with below average occupancy levels will make meaningful rent gains elusive this year. In comparing our 2012 outlook to last year, all of our markets have a better rating this year, except Washington DC which we lowered from an A to a B. Overall, our portfolio this year would rank at a B plus compared to an overall ranking of B in 2011. And every market is rated either stable or improving. Now, key observations about our same-property results. We closed up the fourth quarter with a sequential underlying increase of 4.2%, which was primarily due to lower expenses. Although revenues were basically flat, this was primarily due to a seasonally anticipated drop in occupancy and lower fee income due to decline in leasing activities. More importantly, our rental rates rose a solid 1.2% from the third quarter with increases in every market except Las Vegas, which was down by a slight 2/10 of 1%. For the fourth quarter, new lease rates were up only slightly, and renewals were up 7.5% roughly the same as in the fourth quarter of 2010. Renewal rates are trending up in the 7% to 8% for both January and February. Traffic was down 2% from the prior year quarter, but was up 4% for the full year and our turnover rate for the quarter was 52%. We continue to benefit from incredibly low move-outs to purchase homes, which was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, and for the full year, move-out to purchase homes was 10.9%, the lowest annual level that we’ve ever had. Finally, I want to thank all of our Camden colleagues for making Camden a great place to work, a distinction recognized by FORTUNE magazine for the fifth year in a year, and our third straight top 10 finish. Placing seventh on the list of Top 150 Companies to Work For is an honor we claim on behalf of all real estate investment for us. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Dennis M. Steen: Thanks, Keith. I’ll begin today with a couple of comments on our fourth quarter results. Camden reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $64.3 million or $0.84 per diluted share, $0.01 per share above the $0.83 midpoint of our prior guidance range of $0.81 to $0.85 per share. Results coming in $0.01 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range resulted primarily from two items. Property revenues exceeding our forecast by $1.5 million due to higher than anticipated revenue growth across our same-store, non-same-store and lease up communities, driven primarily by rental rate increases, slightly higher realization rates on other property income, and better than anticipated leasing velocity at our two development communities and lease-up. We finished 2011 with a 5.5% increase in same-store revenues, towards the top end of our prior guidance range of 5.2% to 5.6%. Total property expenses continue to perform inline with our expectation for both the fourth quarter and year-to-date periods. For full year 2011, same-store expenses grew 3% over 2010, equaling the midpoint of our original guidance range for 2011. A $1.5 million favorable variance in property revenues was partially offset by higher than expected G&A and property management expenses of approximately $700,000. This unfavorable variance is the result of higher incentive compensation expense, as we adjusted full year accruals to reflect our actual 2011 performance, although the components of income and expense were generally inline with our expectations for the fourth quarter. I would now like to discuss our 2012 guidance. You can refer to page 27 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2012 financial outlook. We expect 2012 projected FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50 per share, with a midpoint of $3.43 representing a $0.40 per share or 13% increase from our 2011 FFO per share of $3.03, which excludes from 2011 results, the $22.2 million net impact of the following non-recurring items. A net gain of $3.3 million related to the sale of a technology investments in the first quarter, a gain of $4.7 million related to the sales of properties and land in the second quarter, and a loss of $30.2 million related to the discontinuation of a hedging relationship and the write-off of unamortized loan cost related to the pay-off of our $500 million term-loan in 2011. The major assumptions and components of our $0.40 per share increase in FFO at the midpoint of our guidance range are as follows. A $0.35 per share or $27 million increase in FFO related to the performance of our $48,400 same-store portfolio. We are expecting positive same-store net operating income performance of 6% to 8%. A $0.07 per share or $5 million increase in FFO related to increased net operating income from our non-same-store properties, and the incremental contribution from the development communities in lease-up. An $0.08 per share or $6 million increase in FFO related to reduced interest expenses primarily as a result of reductions in our outstanding debt from our prior share issuances, the favorable refinancing of unsecured debt in 2011, and $4 million in additional capitalized interest related to our 2011 and 2012 development starts. A $0.38 per share or $29 million increase in FFO related to additional net operating income from both pro forma acquisitions anticipated in 2012, and a purchase of the remaining 80% ownership interest in the 12 joint venture communities we completed in January of 2012. A $0.05 per share or $3.6 million net increase in FFO related to our election to redeem our $100 million, 7% perpetual preferred units in the first quarter of 2012. Included in the net $0.05 per share is preferred payment savings for 10 months, partially offset by $0.02 charge we will record in the first quarter related to the write-off of the unamortized discount on the preferred units. And a $0.03 per share or $2.7 million increase in FFO related to increased net fee and asset management income related primarily to fund acquisitions both completed in 2011, and anticipated in early 2012. These positives are partially offset by a $0.37 negative impact from previously completed share issuances in 2011, and early 2012; and a $0.17 per share or $12.5 million decrease in FFO related to lost NOI from both 2011 completed dispositions and 2012 anticipated disposition activity. On Page 27 of our supplemental package, you can also see details on our expected ranges of acquisitions, dispositions and development activities. The midpoint of our 2012 FFO per share guidance range assumes the following. $250 million in on balance sheet disposition spread throughout the year, $250 million in additional acquisition spread throughout the year, which excludes the completed purchase of the 80% ownership interest in 12 unconsolidated joint-venture assets previously disclosed. $125 million in acquisition in our funds spread throughout the first half of the year. And as a reminder, our investment period ends in the second quarter of this year. $350 million of on balance sheet development starts, and $50 million of development starts through our funds. Based upon our planned 2012 transaction activity, and $190 million of unsecured debt maturities in the fourth quarter of ‘12, we anticipate needing approximately $300 million of new capital for the remainder of 2012, and anticipate accessing the capital markets opportunistically. The composition of that capital activity depends on the capital market conditions at the time we go to market, but will likely be a combination of unsecured debt and common shares. For the first quarter of 2012, we expect projected FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.81. The midpoint of this range represents a $0.05 per share decline from the fourth quarter of 2011. This $0.05 per share decline is primarily result of the following items. A $0.01 or $700,000 decline in same-store NOI resulting from a 4% increase in same-property operating expenses partially offset by 1% increase in same-property revenues. A net $0.02 per share or $1.5 million increase in minority interest expense primarily resulting from a $2 million charge we’ll record in the first quarter related to the write-off of the unamortized discount on our preferred units upon redemption. A $0.01 per share or $1 million decrease in FFO related to fourth quarter of 2011 dispositions, and the sale of Camden Vista Valley in Phoenix, which was completed in January of this year, and a $0.07 negative impact from previously completed share issuances in 2011 and early 2012. The previously mentioned 4% increase in same-property operating expenses primarily results from a $600,000 increase in property taxes as we expect full year same-property real estate taxes to increase by 4.3% in 2012 over 2011. A $1.2 million increase in salaries and benefits related to annual salary increases implemented in February, and higher first quarter employment taxes. A slight increases in all other categories as we expect same-property expenses to increase by 3% in 2012 over 2011 at the midpoint of our guidance. The previously mentioned 1% increase in same-property revenue primarily relates to higher rental rates and occupancy across our portfolio. These negatives are partially offset by a $0.06 per share, or $5 million increase in FFO related to net operating – additional net operating income from the purchase of the remaining 80% ownership interest in the 12 community joint ventures we completed in January of 2012. As a reminder, our Board will evaluate our dividend payout for 2012 at its next meeting and we’ll announce the 2012 dividend rate in mid-March. Our stated dividend policy continues to be to increase our dividend at approximately one half of the growth rate in FFO per share. That concludes our remarks. And I’ll be glad to answer any questions at this time.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Jana Galan at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi, thank you. I was curious, if you could talk a little bit about the acquisition environment, and you’ve already been very active starting off the year. If you could talk about the cap rates on those transactions, and maybe what you’re anticipating to spread between acquisitions and dispositions could be going forward?
Richard J. Campo: Sure, the acquisition market, we think it’s going to be pretty good this year. Towards the end of the year, people started pulling assets from the market, and at least from what we hear from the broker community, there is a fair number of broker opinions value that, what are coming out and there is a fair number of owners that are being pushed by their banks, and other vendors where we have debt maturing this year. So we think it’s going to be a pretty good acquisition environment. As far as cap rates go, the good news is, there is going to be more assets out there, the bad news is, cap rates are low. So cap rates on acquisitions are going to be anywhere from depending on core portfolios of 4.25, sort of outside core market somewhere in the 5 to 5.5 range. In terms of acquisitions versus dispositions and the spread between acquisitions and dispositions, last year, we were sort of right on top of each other in terms of ability to sell dispositions assets pretty much at same price we’re buying acquisitions at. This year we’re budgeting somewhere between 150 and 250 basis points of negative spread between acquisitions and dispositions, but if the market remains blank, we’ll probably do better than that.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Wolfe at Citigroup.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup: Hi, thanks. Looking at the multifamily starts number, they’ve obviously been trending up off of pretty low bottom, but looking at the competition, a much higher percent or rental now versus condos in the mid-2000. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on whether this trend is something to be concerned about, and even though the effected total starts remained impressed, the actual number of apartments delivering is going to be pretty close to where it was in the mid-2000s?
Dennis M. Steen: Yeah, Eric, this is something that we’ve been tracking for long time, and we watch very carefully. When we talk about the starts in multifamily, we include both components, both up for sale, and for rent. Even in this environment, that proportion has moved up slightly, but it’s – the bigger issue is the total number of starts, not what’s moving around within the category of multifamily. And just to put that in perspective, because I know there is a lot of concern and fairly starts have moved up from the bottom. At the bottom, we were at a run rate of something around 75,000 annual starts. And right now depending on whose numbers you’re using, we’re probably in the 150,000 to 160,000 annualized. One of the data providers that we used because there is a – it does a great deal of – has done historically a great deal of work in these particular areas is Ron Witten. And Ron just recently brought his forecast down for total multifamily starts to be below to the 200,000 level throughout 2014, and in his previous forecast had starts moving up close to the 250,000 in the 2014, ’15 timeframe. So there is a lot of analysis that goes behind that. But the bottom-line is that, recently the trend has been towards a more moderate view of the total starts. And just to put it in perspective, as it relates to Camden’s portfolio, I mean one of the things that we have used historically, and this goes back 20 years, it’s a pretty decent of rule-of-thumb, and in our business, it’s not perfect, but it’s like any rule-of-thumb. There is a reason that people have used it over the years. If you think about in any given market, roughly five jobs creates a net demand for one multifamily unit. So if you got five jobs, you’re going to get one additional net demand. So one of the things that we look at it is, the ratio of the jobs being created to the – what the completions or deliveries are likely to be. If you look at our portfolio for 2012, and you take the jobs number divided by the completions number. So anything above 5:1 ratio means that things are getting tighter and better around the margin, and anything less than 5:1 would indicate that things are – that supply is getting the edge. Out of the 17 markets that we operate in, there is not a single market that currently has less than a 5:1 ratio. If you take the aggregate ratio for all Camden’s markets, the ratio right now is 10:1. So we were projecting across Camden’s markets about 440,000, call it jobs, and about 44,000 completions. That’s an extraordinary number, and I’ve said, we’ve been tracking this for 20 years, and I’ve never seen a scenario like that. There have been times when completions were lower, but it was normally on a market where you’re hemorrhaging jobs. So the fact that we don’t have any single market that’s less than 5:1 and the average across our portfolio is 10:1, this tells me that there’s a, we got a long way to go. If starts stay below 200,000 to get anywhere close to a level of concern where the supply is going to be driving the overall results in multifamily. Obviously it matters, all supply matters, it’s like filling rocks in the pond, if there is some tangential effect. But if we continue with the kind of what we’re forecasting for 2012 is kind of a middle of the road moderate results on jobs growth, and today’s number is any indication we may do significantly better than that, which would only help improve those stats that I just gave you. So that’s a long way of sand, it’s not something that we’re really concerned about at this point, and if Witten’s forecast are right, we think we’ve got until 2015 before it becomes an issue.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup:  That’s very helpful. And just a real quick one on the CapEx numbers, I guess the forecast. It looks like you’re predicting about 1000 per unit in terms of CapEx this year. And as I think about that 1000 number, it’s up from about 800 in 2010. So I’m just wondering, is that deferred CapEx that’s going in, or is there a change in the composition of portfolio. What’s accounting for this increase?
Richard J. Campo:  So I would not call it deferred, because deferred implies that you’re sort of, it implies something different than what happened. I would call it, where we had choices to make, for example, a paint job that’s on a community that’s at the margins. And you live with it another year, we absolutely made those decisions in 2009 and 2010. So we knew that there was going to be a catch-up component primarily around things like big ticket items like paint jobs, we’ve got far more paint jobs that we pursued last year, and budgeting again in 2012, than we did in’09 and ’10, and that makes up, that’s primarily the different, Eric.
Eric Wolfe – Citigroup:  Great, thank you.
Richard J. Campo: You bet.
Operator:  The next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities:  Hi, good afternoon, guys. Rick, you talked earlier about getting the development pipeline up to $1 billion. Is this just a temporary increase, or do you feel comfortable running at that level, longer term which is close to 15% of your enterprise value? And I guess how are you thinking about also using joint ventures or funds to offset some of that risk to you guys?
Richard J. Campo:  Well, we are not comfortable with having $1 billion in any one year, because what happens in this pipeline scenario is that, you start one, you finish one, you start one, you finish one. So we’re comfortable on the $400 million, $500 million range, sort of annually as we’re completing our properties. But as we’re completing developments and adding new ones, but we definitely are not going to get to the level that we were at the peak in the last cycle. And the big difference in this cycle is that, we’re funding the development with equity, as we go, our balance sheet is a lot stronger than it was in the last cycle. Generally, we will not do joint ventures per se to offload the risk, we will do some in our fund. But I actually found that joint ventures in the past didn’t necessarily offset the risk when you had to deal with your joint venture partner with respect to bringing new capital on the table sometimes. So oftentimes joint ventures really don’t reduce risk much. With that said, we are definitely going to keep an eye on the total number of on balance sheet exposure that we have relative to the size of the company, and the strength of the balance sheet.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities: Okay. And then, Keith, if I miss it or did you talk about the rent growth on the January, February or March renewals yet?
D. Keith Oden: Yeah, we gave the January and February numbers in the range of 7% to 8% on rentals.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities:  Okay. And then quickly, Dennis, you said, you already owned 20% of the little over 4000 JV units you just bought out your partner’s interest in. These assets will be in the same-store pool for 2012?
Dennis M. Steen: They will not. They’re going to be in non-same-store for 2012, and they won’t actually come into the same-store pool, maybe not until 2014, because they’ll be out part of this month. So they’re not going to be in same-store.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities: Even though you already owned a portion of it.
Dennis M. Steen: Yeah, because we actually consolidated them on January 20, something. And we will not be reporting in the same-store pool.
Robert Stevenson – Macquarie Research Equities: Okay, thanks, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.: Good morning to everyone there. Just the California investment, it was definitely eye opening, just given that you guys haven’t done anything in California for quite sometime. Just want to get a little bit more color, what finally prompted you guys to go out there? And does this reflect the start of more investments, do the numbers now pencil, that make it worthwhile to allocate capital to California, or was this more of just a one-off?
Dennis M. Steen: No, we’re committed to California. Clearly, the challenge has been in the past that the cap rates have been difficult to make the numbers work. But bottom line is, we think the California market is a great market long-term. Particularly, their acquisition of the Glendale track just was a very, very opportunistic kind of transaction where we are buying the land at substantially less than it was offered for and worth in the past, and then we’re able to generate a very attractive development yield on that project. We still have our Hollywood in buying or so many buying project that we’re working on in California, and we’ll continue to be active in California.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.: Can you just give us sense what the expected returns are there on the Glendale deal, and how much below market you’re on a per dollar price what you paid for the land?
Richard J. Campo: Well, the land was under contract before we acquired it at the peak of the market at around $32 million, $31 million plus or minus, we bought the land for $23 million.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill & Partners L.P.: No. Not the Hollywood, the Glendale?
Richard J. Campo: That’s Glendale.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill & Partners L.P.: Okay.
Richard J. Campo: That is Glendale. And we’re projecting a unlevered or a non-trended return around 5.5, 6 and with a trended in the 6 to 7, 6.5 to 7. And we think that’s a pretty attractive transaction.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill & Partners L.P.: Okay. And the second question is, on construction lending, it seems, that it’s still quite strict, the banks are still pretty tough in giving construction loans out. In your sense just speaking like all of your merchant friends, is there a sense that this is coming from the regulators that’s keeping the banks from lending or is this more that it’s internal to the banks like they just do not want to take any construction risk, and therefore they are being very careful in where they actually do construction loans.
Dennis M. Steen:  I think, it’s both. I think on the one hand, the regulators are pushing them to get merchant builders that have stranded loans, that haven’t been able to either sell those assets yet to pay off. So you’re getting some pressure from regulators. We’re hearing that from our banks. And then also, it’s just the banks asking questions today that they didn’t ask in the past, which is questions like what are your continuing liabilities, and what ratio of capital do you have in your entity to continue the liabilities demand that they are just not willing to take a merchant builder’s guarantee without any capital behind the guarantee. I mean, some of these merchant builders were 50:1 leverage to their capital. And I remember asking some of my merchant builder friends who will not be named here. What was your ratio of actual tangible capital and not your real estate value, but real liquid capital to your debt? And the bottom line is that, they said that it was infinite. They couldn’t calculate the number because you really have not liquid capital. It was all just their joint – the equity was reflected on the balance sheet with their joint venture interest in their promoted interest if you will. We actually talked to a banker that said that their bonuses were going to be eliminated because of downgrades, because of credit ratings on those kinds of loans. So with that said, it is a very difficult environment today, it hasn’t you’re not back to the sort of heavy days in 2005 and 2006 where any merchant builder to get a loan without much trouble. It’s a very difficult time, and I think the other interesting piece of that is, it’s not just the debt that’s the governor on multifamily development, it’s the equity. You have a number of equity people that were out there who have said; well I’m going to do two deals in Houston. I’m going to do two deals in Washington DC. And the merchant builders are fighting for that equity. So it’s both the equity side of the equation and the debt side of the equation that’s the governor and the mark, and that’s why when those – taken those numbers down and others have taken, their construction starts down. It was almost sort of happening in August, September of last year, but you haven’t seen really any major improvement in the credit market since then.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill & Partners L.P.: So the point is that, despite the pretty solid story for apartments in terms of limited supply and people choosing the rent, it’s probably known just you don’t see any cracks in the construction lending, it sounds like it’s going to be pretty strict for a while?
Richard J. Campo: I think so.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill & Partners L.P.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Karin Ford at Keybanc Capital.
Karin Ford – Keybanc Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. Keith, I wanted to follow up with you on your rating for Washington DC this year. I know you took it down from an A to B, but after hearing your commentary about the challenges there, I was surprised that you rated it stable. What gives you confidence that that market shouldn’t be labeled deteriorating given many things, that seem like are going to be issue later on in the year there?
D. Keith Oden:  Well, I think there is a lot of hindering about the potential for issues later in the year, but if you look at where most people are on forecasting job growth in DC, we’re still in the 30,000 to 40,000 job range for DC, and while the others some, there is some supply coming online even that market is still with jobs and projected supply is still above a 5:1 ratio for 2012. And if you look at our, so in terms of thinking about our numbers going forward in DC, we’re still projecting roughly 4.5% revenue growth in DC and that’s in most years in this business that would be considered to be a really strong number, but relative to some of our other markets where we’re getting double-digit revenue growth, it doesn’t look strong. So it’s – given what’s happened in the last few years in terms of rent growth, and the fact that we’re 8% above the peak rents than in DC relative to most of our other markets where we’re still below the peak. It’s time certainly for a little bit more cautionary note, but 4.5 revenue growth that in any of our markets in any given year, I will take that any day. I think most of the – it’s not that it was not a different scenario out there that you could kind of get in your brain and trivialize out. But I can think of half a dozen of those, but I think the most likely outcome for 2012 is still a year where we get 30,000 to 40,000 jobs. We bring on 5,000, 6,000 new apartments and we still get the 4.5% rent growth.
Karin Ford – Keybanc Capital Markets: So it sounds like the job outlook is really the thing we should watch for whether or not we need to change the scenario or trivialize it later on the year?
D. Keith Oden:  Absolutely.
Karin Ford – Keybanc Capital Markets: Okay.
D. Keith Oden: Because the supply side of the thing is already baked.
Karin Ford – Keybanc Capital Markets: Right.
D. Keith Oden: It is what it is.
Karin Ford – Keybanc Capital Markets: Yeah.
D. Keith Oden: We are going to get – that’s the kind of deliveries we’re going to get. And I think the variable that we will all be watching is this job growth.
Karin Ford – Keybanc Capital Markets: Okay. Second question, I know you said your purchases, move-outs for home purchases was stable across the portfolio in the fourth quarter. Were there certain markets where the number was up more than the portfolio as a whole? I think one of your competitors said they saw some – an increase in Phoenix, do you guys see any markets where you saw a tick up in that number?
D. Keith Oden: If you look at it across-the-board, you’ve got a – in our portfolio the range is pretty broad and so it’s kind of hard to say, was any broad brush, what’s going on. All the way from Ohio and Denver, it was almost 17% for the fourth quarter. You had – Atlanta was in that range, 17%. But at the other end of the range, you got, California is still at 5.9%, Las Vegas or Austin is at 7.4%. Most of the Houston markets were in the 10%, 11% range. So it’s not that we don’t have markets that are higher, it’s just that even the markets that are higher are below the average rate that we’ve seen in our portfolio for the last 20 years, which is somewhere around 18%, 18.5% range for a long-term average. So even in outlier market, where you see 16%, 17% relative to ’12 or ’11 that things like a lot, but relative to historical averages, it’s still extraordinarily low.
Karin Ford – Keybanc Capital Markets: Okay, thank you for the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Hey, good morning. 
Richard J. Campo: (Inaudible)
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets:  So, Rick, your comments about construction financing being hard to come by. That kind of surprised me, because I guess I’ve been hearing that banks are lending for multifamily construction more these days. Is this a new phenomenon?
Richard J. Campo: Well, I think they are lending more than they were.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Right.
Richard J. Campo:  But they’re not at full till the way they were pre-bust and pre-financial crisis…
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets:  But it’s trending up, isn’t it, not? 
Richard J. Campo: Clearly, it’s trending up.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay.
Richard J. Campo: I mean starts have gone from 70,000 units or 75,000 units to 150,000. So obviously those are, when you look at the pure increase, you could say construction lending has doubled and it clearly has. The question though is, can the merchant builders ramp up as fast as they could in the last cycle. And part of the issue is that the structure of their businesses has fundamentally changed, where in the past the banks would make them construction loans without regard to the capital that they had behind their companies to pay those loans back. And that’s a different animal today.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So I guess, I meant when I say trending up, but trending up substantially. Let’s start with my statement.
Richard J. Campo: They are.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Just so and we’re clear.
Dennis M. Steen: When we started, post-Wold War II low, and you have a historical number of 300,000 and you go from 75,000 to 150,000, that’s substantial.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Yeah. Okay. I just wanted to clarify that statement.
D. Keith Oden: Rich. Rich, let me give you the progression, and again...
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: You are eating up my question time here, but go ahead.
Richard J. Campo: Go head.
D. Keith Oden: The progression is in the U.S. starts, and these are Witten’s numbers. And so the 11 actuals would have been 150, that ‘12 projected as 186 in the 2013 projected as 177. Now, if you go back to 2009 in that progression, you get the risk number, which was up 75,000 apartments. Don't misunderstand our message, starts have increased and based upon these numbers, they are likely to increase again in 2012, and then moderate to roughly 175 in 2013. To me that's not the question, because what that level of starts translates to in our markets, like the Camden level, where we’re looking at starts and completions, that translates into roughly 43,000 apartments. And we’re projecting 438,000 jobs in 2012, that’s a 10:1 ratio. It’s not yet zero, and 43,000, but it’s a decent size number of completions across Camden’s market, just it’s dropped by the historical relationship of jobs to completion. So I think what – where people are, where they’ve started the [handling] is thinking that, because you get this progression from 75 to 150, that the next data point is likely to be 300, and the one after than 600. And it’s just not in the cards.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay.
Richard J. Campo: I mean that could happen. So it’s a matter of scale.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So the reason why Ron has reduced the supply outlook is a function of what?
D. Keith Oden: Two things, but there’s three things, construction lending that we’ve talked about.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Yeah.
D. Keith Oden: The equity availability, and the sort of selectiveness of the equity capital that’s out there. And then third, which is an interesting number is that, construction costs are starting to rise. So when you look at the numbers in terms of what construction yields could be with costs going up, Witten’s analysis, takes into account that it will – as you go forward in the cycle, it will be harder to make numbers work, and therefore from a return perspective, and therefore you won’t have as many starts.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And then my second question is, if you could just find for me what the stable mean?
Richard J. Campo:  Stable means that it’s looking – when we’re giving those Ag that go with it, it’s looking out over the course of 2012. Though at the beginning of 2012, you start out a point in time, you have a budgeted renewal rate increase, or things getting tighter or not as tight over the course of the year. So stable just mean, things are stable, if it’s a tight market at the beginning of the year, it’s likely to be a tight market at the end of the year.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. So, it’s not like market rents aren’t moving stable. It’s relative to where the starting point will be in the beginning of the year?
Richard J. Campo: That’s correct.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. How many of the stable markets are, the starting points are very high, that makes sense?
Richard J. Campo: Yeah, so Austin?
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Any of the A markets I guess?
Dennis M. Steen:  Yeah, Austin, Dallas, Charlotte, but Charlotte is improving [really] certainly.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Then anyone on the top of the A list. Okay, thank you.
Dennis M. Steen: Yeah.
Operator: The next question comes from Paula Poskon at Robert W. Baird.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Dennis M. Steen:  Hi, Paula.
Richard J. Campo:  Hi, Paula.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Can you talk a little bit about the strategy of how you’re identifying assets for dispositions? Is it more asset specific, around age or quality or more call on the market or sub-market dynamics or just a caught in the outplay on the cap rate environment?
Dennis M. Steen: So, our discipline around dispositions is almost always around the notion of sub-market quality and asset quality. We also have a very, we look at a five-year return on invested capital, which includes CapEx, rent growth and much of other things. So if you look at the five-year return on invested capital and you just take the bottom fourth quarter of our portfolio, so that sort of defines the hunting range for the assets that get on the disposition list. It starts with returns that are substandard because rents aren’t growing fast enough, or CapEx is too high, within that then we look at things like the direction of the submarket, asset quality, is it still – is it gotten to the point where it just not – we can’t operate it to a Camden standard anymore. And that’s how we fine tune the list of the bottom quarter of performers. And so, for 2000, we’re ramping up dispose this year in the $250 million range. So depending on the average asset size we’re talking about 6 to 8, probably 6 to 8 Camden communities out of 200.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That’s helpful. Thanks. And I know you talked a little bit about move-outs to home purchasing. Could you talk a little about move-outs due to rental rate increases, and what’s happening there trend wise and are you still able to backfill with higher quality tenants?
Dennis M. Steen: Yeah, we have experienced in the last two years, higher move-outs outside the to purchase home category, primarily around job relocations and financial instability. Those have moderated. And for 2012, we don’t think those are going to be – we think we are past the worst of the kind of tenant credit concerns. And as Rick mentioned in his comments, our credit quality across our portfolio has actually improved pretty significantly since last year. And the percentage of rent on average that our residents are paying is in the 18% range, which from a historical standpoint tells us that we’ve got room to grow on continuing to push rents. You’re always – when we are pushing rents, you always have the possibility that at the margins, yes, the person can pay it, but they are annoyed because of it. And we do our best to manage through that process. But at the same time, when you are raising rents on average of 5.5% across an entire portfolio like ours, there’s a lot of touch points there with people that are paying higher rent. I think the more interesting way to look at it is, where we are with regard to peak rents in our portfolio. And we are still not – this is as the numbers kind of hard to get your head wrapped around because we’re all talking about rental increases and how good the market is right now. But we have not yet, on average in our portfolio gotten back to the rent level that we were at in February of ’08.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Would you say that’s the majority of your markets or just a handful?
Dennis M. Steen: No, it’s probably two-thirds of our markets are still below peak rents or further above. And I understand the concept of you drowned in the river and the average depth was only 4 feet, but it’s a bit large in our portfolio, it just tells you that we’ve got lot of room to grow, particularly in markets that have lagged in the recovery. I mean, the Las Vegas is still 18% below peak rent and Phoenix is still in the 9% below peak rent. So we still think we got a lot of room up for growth in our portfolio from the markets that got beaten up the worst.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. And then just one final question, back to the new supply. Are you seeing, are you finding it anywhere more difficult or taking more time to get plans approved or get through the entitlement process just given how many municipalities have cut staff over the last several years and now at least in certain markets where there is more new supply on the radar screen, we are certainly hearing that here in Fairfax County, where the staff is overwhelmed and just can’t get through the workload?
Richard J. Campo: I think that’s definitely a initiative we have been facing is municipalities have cut staff, and even in places like Houston where a month or two behind on one of our space, our 55 and older property primarily because the building inspectors hadn’t inspected buildings in a longtime. So you had new people and they cut staff and its taken longer to get things done because of the limited staff folks and then the people that are on staff are having to be educated both our side and their side to be able to get things accomplished. I think that’s definitely a key issue and that it’s taking longer to get things planned and longer to get them build.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That’s all I have. Thanks very much. Yeah.
Dennis M. Steen: Yeah, on the other hand municipalities are seem to be much more motivated these days to have a taxable interest rather than rolling out, so. Yeah, unfortunately they don’t communicate in house, they’re some inspectors they maybe helped you – help you, gave your project sort of its own, but once its in the upper they tend to be just sort of [side load] and they do what they do.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. That’s all I have.
Dennis M. Steen:  You bet.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning, guys. First question, did you get new lease rates, what you guys expect new lease growth in 2012. And also just given how aggressively you pushed in the fourth quarter on renewals? How do renewals compare to input – renewals compared to current market rates in the portfolio?
Dennis M. Steen: The first question was on rental rates?
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: No, your new lease rates. You quoted I think 7% to 8% number for the fourth quarter. I am just curious just to what you – but your new lease rates were significantly below that. So I’m just curious as you look at ’12 kind of what you dialed in for new lease rent growth?
Dennis M. Steen: So if you think about – but the number that we gave you was for renewals, for both, for January and February. So from a revenue management standpoint, we’re looking at the model it’s forecasting out. No further than 120 to 150 days, so as we go put together our budgets, we’re looking at what’s the total amount of rental increase that’s going to happen for that individual community. So our revenue growth, forecasting, we don't forecast the difference between new lease rates and renewal rates using our revenue management tool. We do that through our property management folks who make depending on that community, every community has its own historical renewal rate and they break it down between renewals and new leases and have a rental growth rate assumption for that market. So, our own target at the midpoint is 5.5% across the entire market, but it varies pretty widely across that from community to community and within each community depending on how many renewals they historically have versus new leases.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Second one is just a book keeping question. Can you walk through what you’re expecting in terms of real estate tax growth for 2012, as well as utilities and also just, in terms of sources and uses, what you’re expecting in terms of total development outlays, including land purchases to back stock the pipeline?
Dennis M. Steen:  Okay. As far as kind of expenses, I’ll talk about that one first. We have a 3% growth in expenses, 4.3% is real estate taxes and if you kind of look at where we probably have the highest increases in real estate taxes it’s going to be in our Texas and Florida market. And a couple of those markets, all of those markets are probably greater than 5%, but was offsetting that to get us to a 3% growth rate. The other big line item in expenses is salaries, we’re actually budgeting to only go up 1.5% and that is because we had negative experience in 2011, as that relate to large medical claims, so that’s the next biggest category. And the only other item of size that I’d talk about is kind of R&M and we are looking at [R&B] and relatively flat zero to 1% in ’12 over 2011.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Did you give the development spent?
Dennis M. Steen:  Yeah, development spent for 2012 is going to be approximately $200 million.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: That includes additional line purchases to backstop the pipeline or no?
Dennis M. Steen:  Yes, it does.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from (inaudible) at ISI Group.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on the increase in the average income for your tenant base, it seems pretty pronounced given what we’re seeing internationally in terms of waste growth. Is that more concentrated in certain markets or is there something going on that you need your portfolio?
Richard J. Campo:  I think, it’s really across the portfolio, and what’s happening is, as the rent increases and renewal rates increase, what’s happening is, people who took advantage of lowering rents were they could afford a better located or maybe higher quality apartments than they hand in the past, they were able to move up, sort of B buyers moving up into A properties because of the lowering of the rents. As the rent cycle has turned around, now what’s happening is as folks that aren’t necessarily their incomes haven’t gone up enough to offset that rent, they certainly have to actually move down market. So what’s happening is that our people are, so the new people coming in the door are – they have higher income. So it’s not necessary that our existing rent basis is increasing at a very significant rate, because obviously 61,000 to 67, 000 is pretty big increase relative to what’s going on in the income growth. So it’s really people moving in that have higher incomes and people moving out that have lower incomes because they were pushed, they came up during the rental decline cycle and now they’re having going back down market in the cycle. We haven’t seen a lot of variation in markets, it’s already happening in all the markets in a very similar way where people are just getting the higher quality residents coming in the door, when our lower quality residents are having to move down market.
Unidentified Analyst:  How does that 67,000 compared to the prior peak, and do you worry about as you kind of upgrading tenants that just by the nature of that definition they are better qualified for ultimate home purchases, later on the cycle?
Dennis M. Steen: Well, I think, I don’t have the numbers for the peak at this point; we can look them up and give you those offline. But I think that even these, even the residents are coming in now that have higher incomes, still have the same issues with respect to the people that are in there, credit scores are better, but the balance sheets of these people are pretty limited in terms of down payments and the ability to get home loans. I don’t think that our – that the people are more out to buy a home, but obviously, when you have higher incomes, they have the ability to do that. I think one of things we looked at is sort of the age range, and our age range really hasn’t changed that much. And what drives home ownership is really demographics based on age, those are the people get the higher propensity they have to own homes. And so from that perspective, even though our income is up, our average age has not risen. The – sort of early 20, mid-20s group continues to be the dominant demographic force that is pushing our business. They tend to be very high propensity to rent folks. And so even if they have better incomes, they are not going to go buy homes until they get to that sort of sweet spot of the demographic to buy homes, which is really 35 to 45 years old.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. That’s helpful. Maybe just one quick follow-up, I know you’re talking about this kind of jobs to completions ratio and the average about 5:1. Can you give a little more color at the market level for – let’s call it the top five or six markets in your portfolio?
Dennis M. Steen: Top five or six ranked buy?
Unidentified Analyst: Sure. In anyway you have them?
Richard J. Campo: Yeah. I will get back to you offline.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure, that’s all from me. Thank you.
Richard J. Campo:  Okay. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Rick Campo for any closing remarks.
Richard J. Campo: Great, well thanks for staying on the call. And we will be taking music requests via email for the next call. So we’ll see you at the next conference. Thank you.
Operator: Conference is now concluded thank you for attending today’s event. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good afternoon, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, VP Investor Relations. Ms. Callahan, please go ahead. 
Kim Callahan: Good morning, and thank you for joining Camden’s third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden’s complete third quarter 2011 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. We ask that you limit your questions to two and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’ll be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo. 
Ric Campo: Thanks, Kim. Based on Camden’s operating results in the third quarter for Houston, Dallas, Austin, and Charlotte, the south is definitely rocking again. The continued strength of our operating results has been driven by the same macro factors throughout the year as follows, limited new supply pressure which we think will continue through 2013, continued negative consumer sentiment towards home ownership, and continued employment growth in our markets. Since the beginning of 2010, 2.7 million plus or minus jobs have been created. More than two thirds of these jobs have gone to people 34 and younger, which represents the sweet spot of our customer base. Camden’s markets experience more than double the national average in job growth over the last three months, are projected to exceed double the national average over the next 12 months. If you look over a 20-year historical timeframe, our markets have grown jobs of more than double the national average; we think that’s going to continue. We expect the strong operating fundamentals to continue and accelerate, if we get even better job growth. All of our markets with the exception of Las Vegas did well in the quarter. In spite of the softness in Las Vegas, there are some positive signs in the horizon. Las Vegas posted the best year-over-year job growth in the last month since 2007.  In addition, year-over-year numbers are all pointing upward for Las Vegas. Air traffic is up 8.7%, convention attendance is up 19.6%, hotel occupancy is up 2.1%, average room rates are up 11.1%. With virtually no new supply in the horizon, all these metrics point to better market in the next few quarters of next year. While Las Vegas represents only 6.5% of our same-store net operating income, the underperformance has been a drag on our overall same-store revenue and NOI growth rates. Excluding Las Vegas from the third quarter revenues, our revenues would have increased to 6.8%, 50 basis points higher. NOI would have been 8.1% or 70 basis points higher.  I point this out because I think Las Vegas is a great opportunity for us next year to accelerate growth as the market improves. Our team in the field and the support teams, and corporate teams at the regional office, the corporate office are prepared to step up and end the year strong, I’m sure. So with that, I turn the call over to Keith Olden.
Keith Olden:  Thanks, Rick. Before I address our operating metrics for the quarter, I want to spend a few minutes to address two themes that investors have been wrestling with for some time regarding multifamily business. The first is, what impact is the overhang of vacant single-family homes likely to have on the demand for multifamily rental housing. In other words, are we going to lose a ton of residence to single-family rentals? And the second is, will the home ownership rate continue to fall, and how will this affect the multifamily sector. In other words, are a ton of our residence about to become single family homeowners. Like all of multifamily peers, we’ve addressed these themes numerous times in the past, though primarily with either portfolio specific or [inaudible] evidence. However, there’s been some interesting research published recently that helps quantify the impact of the two trends are likely to have on our fundamentals. Regarding the single-family overhang, we’ve argued for some time that single family homes are a poor substitute for multifamily housing. To a large degree, our view was based on the observation that our typical resident, 40% of which are under 30 year-old, do not have lifestyles or life circumstances, which are compatible with living in a single family home in the suburbs. By in large, our residence want to be near their jobs, friends, and fun. As evidence, we noted that the percentage of our residence that selected moved out to rent a single family home or condo, has never exceeded 4.1% and has been very stable between 3 and 4% throughout the housing crisis. So how likely is this to change due to an increase in single-family rental inventory? We continue to believe that it won’t change much. Consider the following. A recent Federal Reserve study found that 90% of single family households that went into distress and/or foreclosure, ended up staying in some form of a single family home. Also, the average the family size in a single family home is three, versus 2.1 in multifamily. Combine this with the fact that 95% of multifamily homes have fewer than 3 bedrooms, and that the average single family home built since 1990, is 2100 square feet, whereas the average apartment is only 900 square feet. And it’s easy to understand why these two cohorts live where they live. We continue to believe that the single-family housing overhang has been, is, and will continue to have only a marginal impact on multifamily demand. The second theme is what impact will the long awaited economic recovery have on single family home buying. Currently, the homeownership rate is 66.1% nationally, down from a peak of almost 79%, but still above the long-term average of 65%. This is another way of saying that fewer and fewer people are buying homes, whether the homes are newly constructed, foreclosed, or existing home resales. This is obviously a net positive for rental housing, both single family and multifamily. It leads to the question of how long the trend will continue, and how will an eventual recovery impact the rent/buy decision. From Camden’s portfolio consider this. Two markets, which are experiencing something that looks a whole lot like a traditional recovery, are Houston and Austin. Both cities are seeing robust economic growth along with enough job creation to move the needle, 65,000 jobs projected in Houston this year, 17,000 new jobs projected in Austin. Single-family homes are both plentiful and affordable in these markets. All the conditions that would historically support strong single-family home sales are in place, yet single-family home demand is still weak. In Houston, the home ownership rate fell a full percentage point between the first and second quarter this year, a huge decline. In addition, the percentage of our residents who moved out to purchase a home in Houston was only 9.3%. In Austin, the stats are even more stark, the home ownership rate fell 1.7% between the first and second quarter of this year, and move outs to purchase a home were only 8.5%. In a normal recovery, these two cities would see move outs to home purchases in the 18 to 20% range. Clearly, there are other impediments to home purchases at work. As we previously argued, consumer attitudes regarding home ownership and tighter lending standards are the two most likely culprits. Our metrics in Houston and Austin suggest that home sales are likely to be anemic well into the much anticipated recovery in Camden’s markets. So what does what all this mean for multifamily investors? We believe it is quite likely that the tailwinds we are experiencing from the declining homeownership rate will be with us for some time, with or without a strong economic recovery. What it means for Camden is that the third quarter was strong, and the outlook is consistent with our view that 2011 to ’13 will be the best years in the multifamily business in the generation. Now back to our third quarter results. Our third quarter same-store results were solid with 6.3% revenue growth, 7.4% NOI growth. Our best performing markets were Austin, Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, and Charlotte. In fact, every market but Las Vegas had 5.5% or better revenue growth in the quarter compared to a year ago. Our sequential revenue growth was 2.1%, which is the sixth highest growth rate in 38 quarters of reporting this metric. For the quarter, average renewal rents were up 8.5%, average rents on new leases rose 3.9%. Our turnover in the third quarter was annualized 73%, due to normal seasonality. However, our year-to-date turnover is 57% versus 56% last year. As I discussed earlier, the percentage of move outs to purchase homes remains near all-time lows across our portfolio at 10.5%. Our traffic continues to be strong, up 4% from the prior year in Q3, which continues to support our ability to raise rent aggressively. Our average residence financial condition continues to improve. Despite pushing rental rates, the rent-to-income ratio actually fell from 18.5% to 18.1% due to an increase of 4.5% in an average household income from the second quarter to the third. These solid results are made possible by our 2000 professional associates who put smiles on the faces of our residence every day. To all of our associates, I encourage you to stay focused, and finish the year strong. And don’t forget, the outcome of Mr. Stewards bet, rest in your hands. I’ll now turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Dennis Steen:  Thanks, Keith. My comments on the third quarter results will be limited today, as our operating results were generally in line with our expectations, and there were no unusual or nonrecurring items in the quarter requiring further explanations. Our funds from operations for the third quarter of 2011 totaled $58.8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, representing a $0.01 per-share improvement from a midpoint of our prior guidance range of 74 to $0.78 per-share. This $0.01 per-share better than expected performance was entirely due to higher than anticipated revenue growth across our same-store, non-same-store and lease-up communities, driven primarily by rental rate increases and slightly higher realization rates on other property income. Total property expenses continue to perform in line with our expectations for both the third quarter and the year-to-date periods. And as a result, we have not changed our original full-year 2011 same-store expense growth guidance. We still expect full-year 2011 same-store expense growth within the range of 2.75 to 3.25%.  Even though our expenses are in line with expectations, I thought I would just spend a little time going over some of the year-over-year changes in same-store expenses as detailed on page of our supplemental package. Property taxes are treading a little better than our original expectations due to lower tax rate increases in a number of our markets. Salaries and benefits are up 6.1% with approximately 3.1% of the increase due to budgeted increases in payroll cost. The remaining 3% increase is a result of unusually high claims activity related to self-insured medical and Workers Compensation claims. Utilities are up 6.6%, with 2.9% of the increase due to the continued roll out of our cable TV and Valleyway initiatives in our portfolio, and 3.2% of the increase is due to higher water expense across our Sun Belt markets experience drought conditions. It should be noted that over 80% of our water expense is billed to our residence, with the recovery included in other property income. Repair and maintenance expense is up 4.9%, primarily due to a slight uptick in unit turnover cost, growing off of a 2010 base year, which essentially had no growth in R&M expense over 2009. Property insurance expense is down 8.3% due entirely to lower levels of self-insured property and general liability insurance claims. So in summary, favorable variance in property taxes and insurance are offsetting some non-recurring un-favorability in salaries and benefits and utility expense, resulted in our full-year guidance remaining unchanged.  Before I leave expenses, one additional stat that I thought was meaningful in illustrating our success in controlling cost over the past five years. If you exclude the utility expenses associated to the roll out of our cable TV and Valleyway initiatives, same-store property expenses as forecasted through the end of 2011 will have increased only .8% on average for the past five years. That compares to the peer group average increase of 1.5% per year. On the balance sheet side, we continue to be focused on maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet to insure that we’re positioned to weather volatility in the capital markets. To that end, during the third quarter, we completed an amendment to our existing $500 million unsecured credit facility, extending the maturity date from August of 2012 to September 2015, with an option to extend to September of 2016. And we’ve reduced our all in drawn cost to LIBOR plus 127.5 basis points down from LIBOR plus 250 basis points. Our liquidity position is sound, with 56 million in cash on hand, full availability under our $500 million line of credit, 243 million in equity issuance available under our ATM program, no schedule debt maturities for the next three quarters, and a manageable $291 million in debt maturities in the second half of 2012. Also, as a result of our strong operating performance and our focus on reducing debt levels, our credit metric have improved significantly. We expect our 2011 full-year fixed charge coverage ratio to be 2.7 times, and our net debt to EBITDA to be approximately 6.8 times. Moving on to earnings guidance, we have raised our full – our 2011 full-year FFO guidance range to $2.70 to $2.74 per diluted share, with a midpoint of $2.72 rather than $0.02 per-share increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range. This $0.02 per-share improvement is entirely due to better than expected revenue growth across our same-store, non-same-store, and lease-up communities, which contributed to the $0.01 per diluted share improvement, and FFO for the third quarter, and an expected $0.01 per-share increase in the fourth quarter of 2011. Accordingly, we have arised upward to midpoint of our full-year, 2011 same-store revenue and NOI guidance. We now expect 2011 same-store revenue growth within the range of 5.2 to 5.6%, and same-store NOI growth between 6.75 to 7.25%.  As previously mentioned, same-store expenses in total continue to perform as expected, and we left our guidance range for 2011 at growth of 2.75 to 3.25%. Our revised full-year 2011 also assumes no additional shares issued under our ATM program, approximately 75 million in disposition volume related to four communities, which are expected to close in December, and a total of 1.46 million in on-balance sheet development starts as disclosed in our press release. Our FFO guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011 is 81 to $0.85 per diluted share, with the midpoint of $0.83 per-share representing a $0.06 per-share increase from the $0.77 per-share we reported for the third quarter of 2011. This expected $0.06 per-share increase is primarily the result of the following, a $0.05 per-share projected increase in FFO due to higher property net operating income, primarily due to expected seasonal decline in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover, and personnel expenses.  We expect property revenues to be relatively flat from the third to fourth quarter, as continued improvements in rental rates will be offset by an expected slight seasonal decline in occupancy, and lower other property income, due to lower levels of leasing activity in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we expect a $0.01 per-share projected increase in FFO, due to an combination of slightly lower interest expense resulting from higher capital interest related to the increase in our development activities, and lower amortization of deferred financing cost due to lower line of credit facility fees resulting from the amendment to our line of credit in the third quarter. That concludes our remarks, and we’ll be glad to answer any questions at this time.
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Our first question comes from Eric Wolfe at Citi. 
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Hey, guys. I’m almost a little scared to ask, but what’s Mr. Stewart’s bet, if you can tell me? 
Ric Campo:  I can’t reveal the details until I find out whether he won or lost. So stay tuned. 
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Okay. We’ll look forward to that on the next call. 
Ric Campo:  It has to do with peer performance measures. 
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Okay, all right. That’s helpful. For the 40 million land parcel you bought in Atlanta, could you just tell us, you know, when you plan to start the first phase, you know, how much the project might cost and you know, what your underwriting is on the development? 
Ric Campo:  You bet. Are you talking about the Buckhead site that we closed on in the quarter? We’ll start the first phase of that project in the middle of ’12. It’s zoned for 900 apartments. We have a game plan right now to do it in two phases for a total of about 700 apartments. We paid 40 million for the site, it’s an extraordinary piece of real estate right in the center of Buckhead. We got two parcels that will be out parcels that we’ll be selling and when we’re done with that, our total basis in the project and the land will be about 29 million bucks. And on the number of units that it’s zoned for works out to about $31,000 a door. The land on the total purchase price, net of the two out parcels, and we pay about 30 bucks a square foot, there are very few – there are no land comps available for a tract of that size in Buckhead, but the ones that are available are in the 2 to 3-acre range and the cost per square foot on those would be more likely in the 70 to $75 a square foot. So we’re extremely pleased with that parcel and we think it’s going to be a real anchor for our Atlanta portfolio.  The untrend on phase one, untrended return should be in the 6 ½ to 7% range after we do an allocation of land to phase one. So we’ll kick off phase one sometime in the middle of 2012 and then depending on the progress we make on phase one, we’ll make a determination on phase two. 
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Great. And the second question is just a quick one. Could you tell us where your lost to leased is right now versus say just three months or six months ago? I just want to understand how much you’ve eaten through that lost to lease over the last couple months.
Ric Campo:  We don’t really – because we have – reprice our portfolio every – online continuously, we really don’t – we don’t even look at the lost to lease as an important metric for us. What we try to give people is guidance regarding what’s going on on renewals and new leases. So it’s – we continue to be able to push rents in our portfolio and obviously with our increase in guidance for the fourth quarter, we think we’re going to be able to continue that in the fourth quarter. 
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Okay. I’ll jump back in the queue. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb at Sandler O’Neill. 
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Hi, good morning. 
Ric Campo:  Hi, Alex. 
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: On the summer leasing and yesterday we heard from one of your peers that talked about a summer pause that caused a temporary slowdown in August and September. I’m just sort of curious, across your portfolio, did you guys pick up on any sort of slowdown either in any market, or any submarket or perhaps by price point? 
Ric Campo:  You know, we really didn’t, Alex, and there were a lot of conversation about our – what we were doing in the D.C. Metro area, and we did consciously make a decision there because of the structure of our lease expirations that we had coming up. We made a conscious decision there to make sure that we had – maintained our occupancy. And you know, despite all the trauma that that comment caused, at the end of the day our portfolio in Washington D.C. Metro was at the top of the peer group again for the third quarter on both quarter over quarter, sequential and year over year.  But as far as any broader trend or any other adjustments, we did not – we didn’t make any. Again, you’ve heard comments from some of the companies about maybe traffic being below what it was in prior years, which would have led to a slightly different take or strategy on what they were doing on their rental rates, but our traffic quarter over quarter over last year was up 4% across the portfolio.  You know, that just – other than kind of the normal ebs and flows, and seasonality around expiration dates, we just didn’t see it. And we don’t see it right now. And again, based on that, we’ve raised our guidance again for the quarter. 
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. And then second question is, with the other recent capital market’s volitility and you know, every day there’s, you know, the Greeks seems to doing one thing or the other and then if it’s not there, it’s the U.S. presidential election. As you guys think about capital outlays and the restarting the development pipeline, and then also maybe for Dennis, you know, and the unsecured debt side, have you been more – do you find yourselves being more – I guess more itchy finger on the trigger as far as slowing down or maybe, you know, either issuing unsecured now that that window seems to have opened or maybe a little more consciences about maybe slowing down the development pipeline just in case things start to even more volital? Just thinking back to ’08 when the market started to get nervous there were signs there and then it, you know, obviously Lehman happened and everything stopped, at which point it was too late.  I'm just sort of curious how the recent volitility has impacted your capital outlay decisions. 
Ric Campo:  You know, definitely, it is, you think about capital when you have wide swings in the – in stock prices and unsecured bond spreads and what have you. You know, the way we look at it is we have a – basically a three-year rolling strategic plan that we present to our Board and then we use it as a model. And we stress that model a number of different ways and have multiple sort of outcomes based on capital allocations and development pipelines. And so when we stress the model, we look at it sort of on a quarterly basis and decide what kind of development spend we want and what kind of acquisition disposition program we want and it just depends on what’s going on in that quarter. And if something dramatic happens, we can clearly pull the reigns back on development or other activities to make sure that we don’t get over leveraged or that we’re not in a position if you have a repeat of the 2008 scenario where we get in the position where we’re uncomfortable with our leverage. And if you – when you go back to sort of what we did in the bond market in June, where we took out a $500 million maturity in 2012, that was a real strategic move at the time because we had 750 million, you know, of on-balance-sheet debt that was maturing in ’12.  That was a very fortuitus transaction. If we went into the bond market today, even though it’s opened up some, it would still be more expensive than when we did it in June. So we are watching the capital markets and we definitely have a strategy with respect to maintaining our balance sheet integrity and making very, very specific moves on developments so we won’t get too much going on without having it funded. Dennis, do you want to add to this? 
Dennis Steen:  Yes. I’ll just give you a little update on pricing. As Ric mentioned, if you remember, we did issue back in June, $500 million, split between 10 and 12 years, and the 10-year piece at that time was priced to yield right at 4.7% and we got updated pricing as of yesterday, post the BPX’s execution and it looks like if we went back in the market today, we’d probably be issuing somewhere in the 4.9 to 5.0 range. So it’s pretty good to get that behind us before the volitility in the credit markets kind of blew up on us the last couple of months. That’s just an update on pricing. 
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jay Habermann at Goldman Sachs. 
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Good morning, everyone. 
Ric Campo:  Good morning, Jay. 
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs:  Good morning. A question on I guess D.C. and the recent start there, the Camden Noma. Can you guys give us your thoughts and expectations I guess for rent growth in the market in the near term because for the quarter it was slightly below average, but still pretty strong NOI growth. But obviously, sequentially, picked up above the portfolio average trends. So I guess just sort of outlook for D. C. going forward. 
Ric Campo:  Sure. I think D.C. is going to be a solid performer. It’s not going to be a the top of the pack because we have, you know, it’s sort of moving around and if you notice our portfolio, D.C. led the pack into this latest cycle and now we’re having some replacement for that of Dallas and Austin and others.  But I think that overall, D.C. is going to have a reasonable rent growth for us going forward. Maybe not as strong as some other markets. We’re looking very – and when we started that project, the project in Noma, we’re looking real hard at the start numbers, but – and I know there’s been a fair amount of chatter about development in Washington D.C. but when you look at the number of starts that are out there today and the future starts, you know, by 2014, we think we might get back to maybe 75 to 80% of peak deliveries. So I’m not too worried about the supply scenario just yet. Now, if that ramps up dramatically in ’12, ’13, ’14, then I would start getting worried. But between now and really ’13, there’s not a lot of deliveries that worry us too much in the D.C. market. 
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Okay, and I guess, as you look out to 2012, I mean, what sort of run growth do you think you could achieve in the market just based on where existing rents are today? 
Ric Campo:  Well, we’re not talking about ’12 or at this point, you know, if you look at Whitten and MPS and some of the other ones that are out there, [inaudible], you know, I’ve seen some numbers that’s, you know, size 3, or 4, or 5, but you know, it just depends on who you listen to at this point. 
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just lastly, can you comment a bit – I think Keith made some comment in regard to sort of seasonality in the fourth quarter, but you talked about the low move outs, the single family homes, can you give us some sense of what you anticipate, I guess, for this fourth quarter in terms of seasonality? Is this a typical type quarter? 
Ric Campo:  For move outs to home purchases? 
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Just in terms of the demand overall. 
Ric Campo:  I think that we’re – what we see right now, it’s still a continuation of the trends that have been in place pretty much all year, Jay. The – obviously, the fourth quarter has its own seasonality trends to it, one of which is, in our portfolio we always, 8 out of the last 10 years, our occupancy rate has gone down between third quarter and fourth quarter, so we, you know, no doubt in this space there will be some of that.  The second thing is, is that from the standpoint of lease renewals, we’re still renewing at significant increases, but in the fourth quarter, we just have fewer opportunities to renew those leases. The total transaction volume, third to fourth quarter, the fourth quarter is roughly 50% of the transaction volume that we see in the third quarter. So you’ve just got fewer opportunities to raise rents in that environment and we know that seasonally, we’re – we always have a little bit of down in occupancy. But those are typical expected and despite those factors, we still thing the fourth quarter is going to be strong and based on that we raised our guidance.  People just don’t move around during the holidays. I mean, you want move, change apartments or move to a new home, you know, in the – before Christmas or doing the holidays. People just don’t want to do that. So that’s why the transaction volume goes down, and it’s gone down every single year since I’ve ever been in this business. 
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks, guys. 
Ric Campo:  Thanks, Jay. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Dave Bragg at Zelman and Associates. 
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Hey, good morning to you. Just following up on the opening comments from Keith. What signs of pent-up demand for that single-family lifestyle might you be starting to see in your communities, perhaps in terms of an increase in the percentage of existing residents who are married or have children?  
Ric Campo:  I don’t think we see – we haven’t seen any major increase in the demographic in our portfolio. The demographic tends to be – tends to be 34 and younger and when you look at married with children, I mean, that demographic naturally is something like 22% or something. And we just don’t have a lot of married with children in our properties. I think that sort of goes to the point Keith was making earlier in his comments, which was that when you look at data out there, you know, I’ve seen in some of your reports where something like 90% of foreclosed homes, people don’t go into apartments, they go into rental housing. That’s why we don’t think that – that demographic just doesn’t go to a 950 square foot apartment when they can rent a 2,000 square foot house in the same neighborhood that they were in when they got foreclosed.  So with that said, when you look at the – sort of the people are getting married later, they’re having children later in life and that shouldn’t push people to buy homes any quicker with the current environment.  I think the other thing that’s important is that given that the government is Freddie, Fannie and the FHA are providing something like 90-plus percent of all sort of confirming mortgages and that’s a real impediment for people to buy houses today because if you don’t have every box checked properly or the proper credit score, you’re just not getting a loan because there’s no banks holding that paper, so they’re not willing to make an exception or make a rational decision on a borrower just because they don’t have a certain box checked, that the government won’t buy it from them because of that.  So I think – I think that’s going to take some time to go through the system. So the homeownership move-out rate, I don’t expect to change very dramatically until we have a significant change in the housing market. 
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Well, but just – I think the way we think about it is, if you think back about your long-term average move outs by home rate being 17%, you’re saying that the move outs are in single-family home rate is effectively unchanged versus a long-term average, therefore, far less people are moving out of your communities into single family homes despite what you said was a lifestyle decision that ultimately would come. So I was looking for signs of that demand starting to build within your community as less people move out from your apartments into single family homes. At some point, I would expect that one of those two metrics would have to tick up just based on that. 
Rick Campo:  No, I agee totally with you because I fundamentally believe that as the housing market improves, the lifestyle that people choose will be as they age to buy houses. And I don’t think that we’re in a, you know, a secular change of no one’s ever going to buy a house again, moving out of an apartment, they will. The question will be to me, how fast does that manifest itself, when do housing prices stop going down, when do the consumer’s sentiment about I don’t want to own because I don’t want to be in a situation where A, the price is going down or even if I did want to own, I can’t get a mortgage. So with that said, I think we’re a ways off from that switch being flipped and we haven’t seen any evidence in our portfolio via consumer sentiment or changes in how they’re thinking, or demographics that indicate that’s going to happen, you know, next week. 
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Okay. And another topic, could you talk about recent trends in a number of your markets in which you have both urban and suburban and assets? Are you seeing a diversion in demand trends across those two types of asset classes? 
Ric Campo:  We have seen very little difference in growth rates or demand rates in suburbs versus urban. And we – when we separate our – you know, a lot of people call this B versus A, and in our B versus A, the growth rate in revenue – or the revenue growth rate is just identical to the A. So it’s an interesting dynamic because while we did have an increase in our move-out rate, primarily because – in turnover rate, primarily because we’re pushing rent so hard, it was very similar in the A versus the B.  So you have sort of the same dynamics going on in the suburban projects that you do in the urban. So urban is definitely not out performing suburban, and I think part of the issue with that is that our suburbans tend to be really good surburbans and not sort of me-too suburbans out in the middle of nowhere. And I would think maybe some less quality and location suburbans maybe aren’t experiencing the same kind of growth from a revenue perspective as the sort of A, urban. But based on our portfolio, we have seen just – no diversion at all. 
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: That’s helpful. Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Rich Anderson at BMO Capital Markets.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Hey, is it just me or does Dave Bragg sound like Clint Eastwood? I don’t know. 
Ric Campo:  Good one. 
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Think about his voice and you’ll come to the same conclusion. 
Ric Campo:  I don’t think of him having a 357 Magnum pointed at me. 
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Listen here, punks. So early on in the call, you talked, Ric, about Las Vegas. And I’m curious as to what is it that’s driving you, besides that you think that you’re kind of at a downswing and maybe a bottoming of that market, what else is attractive to you about Las Vegas, if not for the fact that you kind of have this, you know, entry point, would you still be interested in the market if you didn’t feel like you were getting a special deal? 
Ric Campo:  I think Las Vegas, if you go look at it historically, it’s just been a great market. It’s an apartment market and it has a lure to people who move there to – out of California and it’s been a great apartment market minus the bust. And you know, if you look at the market today, it’s got all the dynamics of being able to make a bottom and come back reasonably strong given the overall metrics of Las Vegas going up. You know, when you look at other statistics that are out there, like the number of employees per hotel room, it is amazing how they’ve cut the cost dramatically in these hotels and if they just got back to half of the number, you know, sort of half of the losses in terms of workers in the casinos, it’d be about 70 or 80,000 jobs. It’s – so the dynamic can really turn pretty strong there, and you know, we are there and it’s a – we’ve always like Las Vegas and we continue to think it’s a good market.  And Rich, there’s been, in the last, call it 15 years, there have been two different periods where on a conference call we could have been saying Las Vegas is also [inaudible] for Houston, the rate would have been this or that. So there have been points in time in or portfolio where Las Vegas was the primary driver of growth and that happened for runs of two or three years in a row. So the way that I think is useful to think about it is Las Vegas is a high-growth, high-beta market. And if that’s the only market that you’re in, that’s problematic. If it’s one of 15, it’s part of a portfolio that makes sense. 
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: What are the – how would you characterize the type of assets you might be interested in? Would they be kind of busted condos, I assume a portion or is there something else that’s there that is appealing to you? 
Ric Campo:  You mean talking about acquiring in Las Vegas? 
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Yes. 
Ric Campo:  Well, you know, the interesting thing is that there’s just nothing trading in Las Vegas. If we wanted to double down, so to speak, we really couldn’t because there’s, you know, I was there about a month ago and I met with all the major players that are doing transactions and you know, last year there were 14 transactions in Las Vegas and the largest one was like a $20,000 per door deal. This year, only one – there’s only been one institutional quality trade and it was – Colonial bought it and it had to do with the adjacent property to one they already owned plus some land they owned. Beyond that, there has been zero even solid B assets in Las Vegas traded. And it’s sort of the psychology of why would you sell now in Las Vegas after you’ve had the bottom fall out of the market and cash flows dropped dramatically. It would be a fairly silly time to sell now. So most of the owners in Las Vegas are not interested in selling, so you really can’t – if you wanted to buy a big portfolio there, they don’t exist. 
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Paula Poskon at Robert W. Baird. 
Paula Poskon – Robert. W. Baird & Co. : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Could you characterize a little bit of what you’re seeing in terms of any change, if any, as the – in the credit profile of our tenants coming in versus your existing tenant base? And are you seeing any uptick in rejections of applicants due to credit uses? 
Ric Campo:  Yes, our overall credit profile of our applicants is improving. Probably the best stat and way to think of that is looking at household income and in the – between second and third quarter, this is very interesting, the average household income went up about 4.5% in our portfolio. So 62,000 and change to about 65,000 and change in household income, which so on average our – the rent to – rent-to-income stat actually dropped from 18.5% to 18.1%. And some of that is being driven by the fact that when rents decline as they did in the downturn, specifically in markets like Las Vegas and Phoenix where you had 18 to 20% decline of topline rents, you know, people move around and people from B- product, they have the opportunity move up to A product and they do so. As that turns around and you are aggressively raising rent, then naturally, you’re going to be replacing some of those residents that may not have the capacity to take the rental increase.  But the net-net result of that is is that we end up with a more qualified resident as indicated by the household income and really, a better ability to pay even in the face of raising rental rates. 
Paula Poskon – Robert. W. Baird & Co. : Thanks, that’s all I had. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets. 
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning, guys. You had the Atlanta purchase during the quarter. Are you guys actually looking or additional land parcels? And as we look ahead to ’12, when you guys have been very active the last couple of year at ramping up development, should we expect, you know, a fairly similar number of starts in ’12? 
Ric Campo:  We are definitely looking for additional land sites. We’re working through our legacy land obviously first, but we do have – we are looking for additional land. You can expect 350 million to 400 million starts next year if – in terms of total dollar amounts, assuming that we feel good about the world and as we move through and make decision on how we ramp that up and how our capital allocation works for that. In terms of when you look forward and we’re looking forward in our strategic plan into sort of ’12, ’13, ’14, if we had a program of 250 to $300 million a year of development above and beyond what we have already slated for ’12, then we would be out of land by the middle of ’13 in terms of the ability to add to the pipeline by the middle of ’13, we would have to put new land on the books today to be able to have land starts in ’13 and ’14, or in the last half of ’13 and into ’14. 
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: So what’s your intention to develop the remaining land parcels? You’re not looking to sell any of this, right? 
Ric Campo:  Yes. Well, some land parcels we may sell because the numbers don’t pencil or we just – for whatever reason, don’t want to be in that land. You know, ultimately if, the analysis is a pretty simple on. You look at what we can develop on the land that we own. If we don’t like the yield or we don’t like the market or whatever, for whatever reason, we sell the land. There are some land tracts that we have on our books right now that will be sold, and some of them are being reworked based on the new environment and new, you know, sort of a new metric. Like for example, our Hollywood site, we’re going through the process of redesigning that site and making it a smaller project and less capital intensive project. And if it works financially, we’ll build it. If it doesn’t, we’ll sell the land. 
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And just giving the rent growth year to date, the yields are tending up? The yields on your development starts, you’re trending up? 
Ric Campo:  Yes. The yields of new developments are anywhere from – on an untrended basis in the 6.5 zone. And then on a trended basis, you know, they’re higher than that, obviously, somewhere in the 7 to 8%. 
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: That’s helpful. And then my final – my follow-up question is, on Southeast Florida, you guys had a sequential revenue decline. What – is that market softening, you know, occupancy losses? What seems – what was the driver of that? 
Ric Campo:  You’re pretty – you’re not going to see that in anybody else’s number. We had some staff turnover in two or our largest communities in South Florida and it was just, you know, one of those things that happens when you have staff turnover. It’s not a market issue, that’s our issue and that’s been addressed and resolved. 
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Good to hear. Thank you. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Eric Wolfe at Citi. 
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Thanks. You mentioned that you don’t look at lot to lease, but I’m just wondering how you think about the embedded growth in your portfolio right now? And also, I don’t know if I missed it, but could you quantify the significant renewal increases that you referred to earlier? 
Ric Campo:  Yeah. The renewal increases that are already in place? Or November and December? They’re in the 7 to 8% range. We’ve renewed about 40% of the December rents and about 20% into Januarys. That trend is just going to continue.  In terms of how we think about what’s in the embedded – what’ s in the embedded base, you just – I think it’s more useful to look at, what are you doing in terms of your renewals that you’re actually signing over the existing lease rates. You can then look forward and see what’s the trend on your expiring leases and what’s the gap expected to be.  But to look at it on any given snapshot and take a – when you’re using revenue management to reprice your inventory every day to says what was your lost to lease that day or that moment in time, I’m not sure what that - I’m just not sure what they get you. 
Eric Wolfe – Citi: Understood. Thank you. 
Ric Campo:  Do we have any more questions? 
Operator:  We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ric Campo for any closing remarks. 
Ric Campo:  Great. Well, I appreciate your time on the call today and we’ll talk to you on the next call. Thank you. 
Operator:  This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-07-29 12:00:00) =====

Analysts: Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates David Toti – FBR Nick Joseph – Citi Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs Rob Stevenson – Macquarie Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets Ralph [ph] – UBS Andrew McCulloch – Green Street Advisors Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities Mark Biffert – Bloomberg Research William Kuo – Cowen & Co.
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Camden Property Trust Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, VP Investor Relations. Ms. Callahan, please go ahead.
Kim Callahan: Good morning. And thank you for joining Camden’s second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden’s complete second quarter 2011 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for one hour as there is another multifamily company hosting a call at 1.00 p.m. Eastern. As a result, we ask that you limit your questions to two with one follow-up and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we’d be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: I hope you enjoyed our recycled Bruce Springsteen pre-conference music. We plan on recycling our second quarter operating results for the next few quarters in foreseeable future. We actually had different music planned but somehow the file got recycled. With that said, despite weak job growth and uncertain economic activity our business continues to strengthen. Our markets are adding jobs while new supply continues to be limited, growth markets that are pro business with low taxes and affordable housing added most of the jobs in America. On Tuesday, USA Today ran a front page headline that if you want a job you need to move to Texas. Texas has created over half of all the jobs created in America in the last 12 months. We have continued to accelerate our acquisition and development programs to capitalize on what should be the best multifamily operating environment we’ve seen in decades. On the acquisition side, we expect to complete over $500 million by the end of the third quarter. We will have an additional $225 million of acquisitions remaining to finish up our fund. On the development side, we’ll start another $150 million through the end of this year. We’re on track to start $400 to $5 – $400 to $600 million of new development in 2012. Last week we began leasing at Camden LaVina in Orlando. We leased 35 apartments in the first weekend which is the strongest opening we’ve ever had for a new development. First half of the year has been busy for all of our teams. We completed over $1.7 billion in transactions including acquisitions, development starts and capital market transactions. All of this activity has strengthened our balance sheet and positioned Camden very well to capitalize on future opportunities. I’d like to give a big shout out to all of our Camden teams for a great first half of the year and remember we have the second half to complete. I’ll turn the call over now to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. This was another quarter of outstanding execution by our real estate operations and support teams. Their efforts allowed us to once again raise our FFO estimates for the full year. Ric summarized the transactions in the quarter and I’ll share some details on our operations for the quarter and give some thoughts on what we think may lie ahead. The drivers of our outperformance are the same as we cited in our original outlook for the year. Demand continues to be really strong coming from some of the usual places, as well as some unexpected ones. Although, job growth remains quite weak nationally, several of our larger markets are experiencing robust job growth. Houston is projected to add 72,000 jobs this year, Dallas, 64,000, Washington D.C. Metro Area, 59,000, Atlanta, 37,000, Denver, 30,000 and Austin, 21,000. In each case those numbers are sufficient to move the needle by themselves. In addition, the home ownership rate continues its (inaudible) decline. The average home ownership rate in Camden’s 15 markets now stands at 63.6% below the national average of 65.9%. This rate is dropping at roughly one-tenth of 1% per quarter. While the majority of those households probably end up in a single-family rental, many are finding their way back to apartment homes. We believe this will continue and home ownership rate will stabilize around the long-term average of 64% to 65%. Although, some published research indicates the rate could fall as low as 62%. New supply remains very limited. We’re still shrinking the overall inventory of multifamily housing due to the demolition of roughly 150,000 apartments per year. Across all of 15 – all 15 of Camden’s markets we expect a total of 22,000 multifamily completions in 2011. That’s more like the number of apartments we would have seen built in an individual market like Houston, Dallas or Atlanta during a typical year. These trends are likely to remain in place throughout 2012 and will continue to support strong fundamentals in our business, as they say, facts are stubborn themes. Our fundamentals continue to be strong as well. Our occupancy rate currently stands at 95%. We averaged 94.8% for the quarter, up from 93.9% in the first quarter. Despite the increase in occupancy, we’ve been able to continue pushing rents. During the second quarter, new lease rents were up 6.1% and renewals were up 8.6%. For July to date, renewals are up 8.8%, new leases up 5.3%. Current renewals out to September are trending up approximately 9%. Portfolio wide we’re 3.4% below peak rents and we still have room to increase rents just to bring our residents back to paying the rental amount they were paying three years ago. On average our residents are paying roughly 18.5% of their household income for rent, which is well below the peak of 20.5% in 2007. Our best performing markets for second quarter revenue growth were Austin, South Florida, Dallas and D.C. Metro. Our weakest markets for the quarter were Las Vegas and Southern California. Sequential revenue growth grew at a very strong 2.9%. This is the highest sequential revenue growth that we’ve ever reported. The most improved was Houston, up 5.2% sequentially joined by Dallas, Austin and Denver, each up by better than 4%. Despite these rental increases, our turnover rate remains below our expectations. For the quarter, we saw 55% turnover, which was less than the 57% in the second quarter of 2010 and still below plan for the year. One big reason for the lower turnover is due to the continued level – low levels of move-outs to purchase homes. The percentage of move-outs to purchase homes picked up from a record low of 10.4% in the first quarter to 11.5% in the second quarter but still well below historical norms. In summary, we find nothing in the data to alter our view that 2011, ‘12 and ‘13 should be the best three years in the multifamily business in a generation. Based on that, we think we’re probably in the second inning which should turn out to be a really good game, stay tuned. I’ll turn the call over to Dennis Steen, Camden’s CFO.
Dennis Steen: Thanks, Keith. I’ll start today with a few comments on our second quarter results. We reported funds from operations for the second quarter of 2011 of $30.4 million or $0.40 per diluted share, representing a $1.7 million or $0.02 per share improvement from the $0.38 per share mid-point of our prior guidance range for the second quarter of $0.36 to $0.40 per share. As a reminder, included in these results and our prior guidance were two non-recurring items. The first being a positive $4.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share impact related to a gain we recorded in the second quarter on the sale to our fund of the Camden South Capitol development in Washington, D.C. The gain was related to the reimbursement we received for previously written off third-party development costs. The second non-recurring item was a negative $0.40 per diluted share impact related to a $29.8 million loss on the discontinuation of a hedging relationship of an interest rate swap and a $500,000 write-off of unamortized loan costs. Both related to the payoff of our $500 million term loan in the second quarter. You can refer to our press release dated June 6th for further details on this transaction. Excluding these two non-recurring items, our FFO for the quarter would have been $55.8 million or $0.74 per diluted share, representing a $1.7 million or $0.02 per share improvement over our expectations. The better than expected performance for the second quarter was primarily due to property net operating income exceeding our expectations by $1.5 million, exclusively due to larger than expected property revenue growth across all of our operating region. Total property expenses for the three and six months ended June 30th continue to come in line with our original budget as lower levels of self-insured property and general liability insurance claims has substantially offset higher benefits cost, resulting primarily from an increase in self-insured medical claims for our employees and higher utilities expense giving 11% increase in water expense across our Sunbelt market experiencing drought conditions. Over 80% of our water expense is re-billed to our residents with the recovery included in property income. With respect to our capital position, during the second quarter we continued to take steps to further strengthen the company’s balance sheet metrics and to position the company – position the balance sheet for increasing investment activity. During the quarter we tapped the debt market, issuing a total of $500 million in new 10 and 12-year unsecured notes at an average yield of 4.85%. We used the proceeds to retire our $500 million term loan which was originally scheduled to mature in October of 2012. Additionally, during the quarter and in early July we issued approximately 1.1 million common shares at a weighted average price of $63.73 under our after market share offering program. As a result of these actions, our liquidity position is same. With $64 million in cash on hand, full availability under our $500 million line of credit, no scheduled debt maturities for the next 4 quarters and we have reduced our total debt maturities in the second half of 2012 to a manageable $294 million. Moving on to earnings guidance. We have revised our 2011 full year FFO guidance range to $2.65 to $2.75 per diluted share with the mid-point of $2.70 representing an $0.08 per share increase from the mid-point of our prior guidance range. This $0.08 per diluted share improvement at the mid-point is primarily the result of the $0.02 per share outperformance we recorded for the second quarter of 2011 and a $0.07 per share improvement in FFO attributable to higher forecasted property NOI for the second half of 2011. This increase in forecasted NOI is almost entirely due to higher than expected property revenues resulting from the continuation of higher than expected rental rate increases across our portfolio. We now expect same store revenue growth between 4.75% to 5.75% up from our prior guidance range of 4% to 5%. Property expenses continue to perform in line with our expectations and the mid-point of our full year 2011 expected growth in same store property expenses remains at 3%. The above two positives will be partially offset by $0.01 per share in dilution resulting from equity previously issued during the second and third quarters through our ATM program. As we continue to reduce leverage and pre-fund the equity requirements of our development activities. Our revised full year 2011 guidance also assumes no additional shares issued under our ATM program, $100 to $150 million in new on balance sheet development starts and $100 million in both acquisitions and dispositions late in the fourth quarter at a negative cap rate spread of 100 to 250 basis points between acquisitions and dispositions. Our FFO guidance for the third quarter of 2011 is now $0.74 to $0.78 per diluted share, with a mid-point of $0.76 per share, representing a $0.02 per share increase from the $0.74 of core FFO we delivered in the second quarter, which excludes the previously mentioned non-recurring item. This $0.02 per share increase is primarily a result of the following. A $0.01 per share increase in FFO due to higher same property NOI as a projected sequential increase in same property revenues, driven primarily by the continuation of increases in rental rates across our portfolio, more than offsets our expected increase in property expenses due to normal seasonal summer increases in utilities and repair and maintenance costs. This results in an expected sequential increase in same property NOI of approximately 1%. And we will also have a $0.01 per share increase in FFO due to lower interest expense resulting primarily from net interest savings related to the payoff of our $500 million term loan in the second quarter with the proceeds we received on our new $500 million 10 and 12-year unsecured notes issued during the quarter. And a reduction in interest expense resulting from an increase in capitalized interest expense due to the increases in development spend related to our six communities under construction and communities in our development pipeline. At this time, I’d like to open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from, pardon for pronunciation, Jana Galan from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning.
Ric Campo: Good morning.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I was curious in your view, your development starts for 2012 kind of what parts of your portfolio would you be expanding in and then also maybe some discussion around what kind of land costs you’re seeing?
Ric Campo: Sure. The starts for 2012 are throughout our portfolio, including Austin, Denver, South Florida, Atlanta and Washington, D.C., so it’s pretty well spread throughout our portfolio. Interestingly enough, land prices are pretty close to coming back to peak levels where they were in 2006 and 2007, good news, however, is that construction cost continues to be much less than peak, construction costs relative to type one building, or concrete construction is probably down 20% even though we are starting to build into our development models some escalation costs associated with commodity price increases. We haven’t started to see much pressure on pricing relative to personnel costs or those types of things yet but definitely commodity prices have had some effect.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you. And you mentioned that you have very limited completion or, I’m sorry, that the industry will have very limited completions in 2011, you said maybe 22,000 in your markets. I wonder what is that – what are you tracking for 2012?
Ric Campo: 2012 there’s definitely been a pick up in potential supply for 2012 but it’s not anything that we’re worried about at this point. Keith, do you have that number?
Keith Oden: Yeah. The – across all of Camden’s markets the number goes from 22,000 and forecast that we’re using right now across all of Camden’s 15 markets is 38,000. And again, relative to sort of a normal period of time across these growth markets that’s still an astonishingly low number.
Jana Galan – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you very much.
Ric Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to expand on your comments from earlier about the second inning of the cycle and you said earlier that 2011 to ‘13 could be the best years for the apartment industry in a generation, obviously, it’s unfolding at a faster pace than even you expected. So is your outlook for this recovery that it gets stronger from here, is stronger in aggregate than you previously expected or is it getting pulled forward, especially given the supply outlook for 2013 and beyond?
Keith Oden: I’m not smart enough to focus whether it’s being pulled forward from ‘12 or ‘13. The – but the fact as you kind of lay them out and you look at what’s driving the performance in our markets, there is just no way that these are tectonic moves. Particularly with regard to the home ownership rate that we are – as it continues to tick down at one-tenth of 1% per quarter doesn’t sound like a whole lot but it’s a – that each quarter that that comes down four-tenth is over the course of a year is worth about 500,000 households that are coming out of a home into a rental condition whether it’s single family or multifamily. And we think we’re still fairly early in that process. The number that came out today, the Census Bureau put out a number of 65.9% home ownership rate. But there are studies and there are a lot of smart people, including some people let’s say at the (inaudible/19:36), who think that, as pendulum swings tend to do that we’re probably not going to stop at the 64%, 65% historical trend that we may overshoot that and end up something closer to 62%. So that’s just a fundamental shift in the way that people who in the last five to seven years made a choice to buy a home as opposed to rent an apartment are evaluating that decision. There’s a lot – some of that has to do with the credit conditions and the underwriting and all those kinds of factors as well and again, I think they will continue to be pressure on that side of the equation. So that’s number one. And that doesn’t stop in ‘12 it probably doesn’t even stop in ‘13. So I think we’re going to have that tailwind for some time. The second part is with regard to supply and I know there’s a lot of people come, doing forecasting and a little bit of handwringing about supply. But the fact is that we are currently bumping along at a rate of multifamily starts that are in the low 100,000 range. And before that – I think that number would have to get, you’d have to see starts in the 250 to 300,000 range to get anywhere close to just keeping up with the current level of household formation notwithstanding what’s going on with the home ownership rate. So again, apartments are not like own flats. You can’t go to the grocery store and get more apartments. It’s a long lead time associated with bringing on new supply. We do agree that supply is going to get added. There’s no question about that but I think you’re talking about degrees of scale. When I see and think about 2012, if we were to add 38,000 apartments across our 15 markets that’s almost not enough to in most of those markets to even move the needle with regard to supply. So the two big issues are in place and the results are going to play out in a way that’s hard to see much change in trajectory in the next 12 to 18 months.
Ric Campo: The only thing I would add to that is that if you look at numbers like the doubling up scenarios where people are living at home or in roommate scenarios, we’ve only unlocked about 30% to 40% of those folks, rest of them are still doubled up at home or in roommate scenarios. So we have a fair amount of people a little under 2 million people that still can unbundle. The other piece of it is if you think about job growth, 60% of all the jobs are going to people under 34 years old, which are our prime markets. So our normal demographic is doing really well economically relative to an older demographic. So those things, combined with what Keith said, makes us think that we’re not pulling things forward, pulling demand forward but it’s going to be stronger from here assuming that we have some job growth.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: That’s helpful. I know you guys are baseball fans, so just wanted to confirm that you’re talking big league baseball and not little league six-inning game there. So that’s very helpful.
Keith Oden: Yeah. We’re talking about the nine-inning kind.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Got it. Just one follow-up question here. Just near-term, when you see the strong job growth in some of your markets in Texas as you talked about, can you contrast your pricing power there over the last quarter or two as you’ve seen the job growth come in to some other markets where fundamentals appear pretty strong still, but you’re not getting the job growth such as Atlanta, Charlotte and D.C., which all rank below the national average?
Keith Oden: Yeah. It’s clearly no coincidence that our top four sequential revenue growth markets for the quarter were Houston, Dallas, Austin and Denver. I mean, just, we’ve always said and as they not – no one’s reveal this law or rule that job creation and employment growth creates households, household formation creates demand for multifamily and there’s obviously a little bit of a lag there but there is no – it’s no coincidence that that’s what we’re seeing and I think, that is, we hope that we will see a broadening out of that – of the job growth experience in our other growth markets and I expect to see similar results. But we were having a pretty decent recovery, all of, if you look back at the results of 2010, there was a lot of strength in these markets that you couldn’t explain by job growth. So that’s where we started thinking of other things that could be driving it and the most obvious to us at least is the decline in the home ownership rate. But if you get both of those things combined, which we do believe we’re going to get at some time in 2012 and 2013 that leads to our thesis that we think this will be the strongest three years in a generation.
Dave Bragg – Zelman & Associates: Thank you.
Ric Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Toti of FBR. Please of ahead.
David Toti – FBR: Good morning, guys.
Ric Campo: Good morning.
Keith Oden: Good morning.
David Toti – FBR: Ric, quick question for you and sort of kind of a big picture. Given that you’re projecting a pretty fantastic playing field for the next couple of years and it looks like job growth and wage growth is somewhat stagnant. Do you think there’s a risk of sort of rent fatigue with renters that we could start to see next year in the form of elevated turn that begins to put a lid on how much you can raise rents?
Ric Campo: I missed a part of – you kind of cut out a little bit. You’re talking about tapping out rental increases because renters can’t afford it because the job market is not that great?
David Toti – FBR: Yeah. I guess – I am wondering how much renters can tolerate in terms of rent growth if their incomes aren’t increasing and their rent continues to go up by high single digits.
Ric Campo: Right. Well, first of all, if you think about where we are today, we are still at pretty low levels from a rent income perspective. As Keith pointed out in his comments, we are at a 18.5% of income and at the peak in 2007 we were like 20 and some change, and if you go back to sort of peaks in the past, it’s been somewhere in the low to mid-20s of income to rent that people could afford. So first of all, I think we have – we do in fact have a fairly good gap to make up before we start having a lot of rental rate shock because residents don’t have enough capital or income to pay the rent. So that’s one thing. The second thing is, we manage our rental increases such that we try to have a sort of a perfect match between turnover rates and rental income because it doesn’t make sense to have someone move out for five bucks or something like that. You make them move out for $200 when you get down to trying to maximize that revenue – revenue piece of the equation. So, I think we have a fair amount of room at least in our portfolio to raise rents without pushing people out.
Keith Oden: And David, in our portfolio, we – don’t get the impression that we don’t have people that move out and give the reason that I can’t afford the rent. That does happen. But the key is whether you can quickly back-fill that apartment with a new lease and so far, again, looking at our turnover rate quarter to – over the prior quarter of last year, it’s actually down 2% which is a little bit surprising given that we are pushing rents on new leases in the 6% range and we are getting 8 plus on renewals.
David Toti – FBR: Okay. That’s helpful. I guess I just – I keep feeling the ‘07 peak, you know, was a very different context where people were generally very optimistic about their income and their outlook for their own personal wage growth. Today’s world is a little bit different. So I am just wondering if those metrics are really comparable?
Keith Oden: That’s true, David but at the ‘07 peak we were losing 23% of our residents to purchase homes. And that number is a whopping 11% now. So those 12%, that’s huge in our portfolio when you think about those people are choosing to rent as opposed to pursuing some other housing option.
David Toti – FBR: I agree. It’s a strong argument. My second question, it’s a little bit off the track a bit, are you guys doing any LEED certified construction in your development? Is there any demand from your tenants, from your renters relative to the new product you are putting out around sort of green initiatives?
Ric Campo: There absolutely is and we are definitely pushing the edge on sustainability and communicating that with our residents. The challenge with LEED, however is, LEED is really setup for office and other uses, and we as an industry have put together several programs for multifamily, but we focus on that in a big way. As a matter of fact, one of the projects we did here in the city of Houston that we did in a third party construction for the city was actually platinum LEED and even though the LEED aspect is something we don’t really shoot for, we shoot for a broader definition of green. But our residents are definitely asking about those issues and it is a differentiating point that we are focusing on, on all of our new construction and actually even in our existing projects, talking about recycling and sustainability issues is a big issue with consumers.
David Toti – FBR: Is there any impact to yields or is it de minimis?
Ric Campo: No, it’s pretty de minimis, I mean, if you – when you get down to the issues of – if you were to LEED and went to LEED platinum it is significant cost for sure. But most municipalities have some sort of requirement and we exceed those requirements generally, and then we use the green aspects that we are putting into our buildings as marketing for our residents.
David Toti – FBR: Great. Thanks for the detail today.
Ric Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe of Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph – Citi: This is actually Nick Joseph here with Eric and Michael. I was wondering if you could give a breakdown of how you see the different expense items trending in the back half of the year. Just trying to get an understanding of how you’re getting 4.5% growth in the back half versus 1.5% in the first?
Ric Campo: Yeah, the biggest issue in the back half of the year is that we had large property tax reductions in the third and fourth quarter of last year. So that’s why it appears as though you’re going to have a large increase in the second half of the year. But property tax for the full year period is only going to be up right over 2. – little over 2% when on a quarterly basis for the next two quarters, property taxes are actually up 6.5%, and 17.9%. So if you normalize out those property tax adjustments, there’s really nothing that’s really amiss as it relates to our forecast for full year expenses.
Nick Joseph – Citi: Okay. Great.
Ric Campo: Let me broaden the response a little bit on expenses because there were several of the eagle eyes picked up our expense number relative to the comp set and asked questions about it. And as always, the devil is in the details. If you look at our expense number over a two-year period which you need to do to understand where the growth is coming from, if you strip out the expense associated with our cable TV and Valet Waste programs, we actually experienced a negative 4/10th expense growth last year. So in 2010, our expenses actually fell by 4/10th of a percent. If you make the same adjustment to the 2011 number, the midpoint of our guidance is 3. You strip out Cable TV and Valet Waste, it put you at 2.7% increase for 2011. If you match those two years together, minus 4/10th and 2, 7 up it leaves you at 2.3% expense increase for a two-year period on an average of 1.15%. And that number is not only below the average or midpoint of peer guidance for the two-year period, but it represents the lowest two-year expense growth experience in 20 years in our company. So, you’ve got to put these things in perspective. We are very comfortable with our expense and our control of expenses. We are below plan for the year. We think we have got a little bit of exposure in Q3 and Q4 as we always do from turnover, but we were comfortable with that number, and as a management team we are very comfortable with an average expense growth of 1.15% for each of the last two years.
Nick Joseph – Citi: Okay. Thanks. I guess on the call last quarter, you mentioned a correlation between job growth in the DC area in government spending. I guess with everything going on in Washington, and short – long term budget cuts come in increasingly likely. Are there any thoughts to recycling some of that DC portfolio, given it’s your largest exposure?
Ric Campo: I wish I agreed with your premise that it looks increasingly lightly. You know, I think the jury is still out on that, and when you look at these numbers and the plans that they laid out and who knows again, how that – it’s impossible to handicap. But I do know this, when they talk about a trillion dollars or $900 billion worth of cuts, that’s over a 10-year timeframe. And if things – if you think about what the – where the expense cut actually happens, unless they start significantly reducing headcount at the Federal Government level, which by the way, there’s no evidence whatsoever, unlike the states and municipalities who have already gone through severe headcount reductions, we’ve not seen any of that at the Federal level. You know, until you get to something like that it’s hard for me to see how the spending curve is going to change materially. Keep in mind, in Washington DC, they are always talking about the rate of increase. They are not – it’s against the baseline and the baseline always increases. So, if they get to and they are further down the road if you sort of think there is some grand bargain, and they actually get to the point of dealing with the real issue which is entitlements, at the end of the day if you cut Medicare reimbursements or you cut Social Security or cap increases in some fashion, it doesn’t take any fewer people to process a $90 check than it does $100 check. And so, if the real money comes out of the system, it really comes out of the system to beneficiaries so then you’ve got to think it about where the beneficiaries think about where the impact would be, and by and large our business is not affected by Medicare and social security reimbursements. So anyway, it’s a wild card for sure. It’s something we do think about. They ever get to meaningful cuts that gets over into headcount at Federal Government, clearly there could be some impact there, and that’s something that we do concern ourselves with. So we’re not changing our portfolio strategy at this point.
Nick Joseph – Citi: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Hey, good morning, guys. Question on development, and if you look at your pipeline communities and your land holdings, you talked about $400 [ph] to $600 million of starts next year, but over a multiyear cycle I am assuming you could have 1 billion plus of potential starts or development. How do you think about that pipeline communities and land holdings? You know, do you think you are well positioned for this two- to three-year cycle?
Ric Campo: I think we’re very well positioned for this cycle. We are working through our land bank that we had from the last cycle and we are in fact working on new transactions with new land transactions to fill the pipeline for ‘13 and ‘14. So, I think we’re very well positioned. I will say that we will not have the same size of a development pipeline that we did at the last peak. So we will stay in this $400 to $600 million range annually as we roll new ones, finish up and we lease up. We’ll roll new ones in, but I feel really good about where our development teams are. We’ve got great teams in California and DC, Florida and Houston that manage the portfolio and they’re doing a great job.
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just switching gears a moment, maybe Keith if you could talk a bit on Florida in terms of what you’re seeing across some of the markets there, maybe focusing on Tampa and Orlando? Is that really – is that coming from the weak single family housing market or are you seeing job growth, and maybe talk about rent growth – rent as a percentage of income, just how sustainable you think those gains could be?
Keith Oden: The job growth numbers for 2011, Orlando, we are forecasting 28,000 jobs, which is – it’s a meaningful number in a market like Orlando, enough to move the needle. In Tampa, we’re at about 17,000 jobs for the year, not quite up to where Orlando is, and then in Miami, we are at 23,000, which includes Fort Lauderdale. So, Orlando and Miami’s enough to move the needle. We are still – and we had good sequential growth in those markets. So I think that Florida is going to continue to do reasonably well. I don’t think there – we have been impacted by the single family debacle in terms of losing residence to single family homes out in the suburbs as an alternative, any more there than we have been in markets like Phoenix. It’s just not – yes, there is tons of unsold inventory still out there, and at some point there needs to be a resolution of that. My guess is that a huge part of the resolution is going to come from people who are being foreclosed in their existing residence seeking a single family rental alternative because they have a – they have a need to have a family because of their family size and composition. So I think that, that’s the most likely resolution, but that again, it doesn’t really have much of a direct impact on our business.
Keith Oden: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Good morning, guys. Keith, if I think about your comments in terms of, you guys, still being below the income to rent numbers in the portfolio, and you guys are still pushing rents on renewals close to 9% and still getting decent bumps on new leases? Is it basically the market that’s preventing you from raising rents even more at this point? Are you guys opening a gap between, you know, you versus the market?
Keith Oden: We’re not opening a gap between us and our – the better competitors, which by and large are the public companies, and then there’s always some well-run private companies. One of the things that you can never run so far ahead of the market that you have created an uncompetitive situation, but you can – if you’re using a good revenue management system, then it is capturing the strength that is apparent in those marketplaces. We can’t manufacture the strength. So you have great demand. If you look at our traffic year-over-year – quarter-over-quarter, it’s up almost 8%, some of that’s seasonal. But if you look at it year-over-year, our total traffic across the portfolio is up 6%. So there’s just more people out there, looking for well-located multifamily as an alternative. I don’t – when you think about 8.8%, 8.6%, 8.8% on renewals and 6% and change on new leases, you know, if you look at the trend going back for the last year, it’s just been a pretty steady straight line up, and I think that, that kind of trend is going to continue because the fact is, is that the market clearing rent for our communities is continuing to march up. Our competitors that use revenue management are seeing the same things that we’re seeing. Now, the less sophisticated competitors are always late to the movie, and that’s okay. We know we’re pushing rent in ways in some of our submarkets that are less sophisticated competitors haven’t gotten all to yet. But at the end of the day, even the less sophisticated ones do their – they do their comping and when they look at what we’re getting with no concessions, it’s pretty hard to get around the fact that they should be raising rents too. And they eventually do. It takes them a little while to get there, but they get there.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: When you take a look, excluding the rates, et cetera, if you take a look at the sort of less sophisticated guys that are operating, which I would assume the majority of the guys that you are competing against in any given market, I mean, where are they, you know, if you guys are pushing rent, you know, 8% plus on renewals, are they down in the 3% level or so on an average do you think, or are they much closer but not quite as high as you guys?
Keith Oden: It wouldn’t surprise me if they were half of what we are right now in renewals and new leases. But taking that – but in their world they are looking at that end going my gosh I’m getting 4% on renewals, I am getting 3% on new leases. They – a lot of the – most of them were playing a different game to rob their – third party fee managed and the worst thing in the world – the one statistic that everybody – every asset manager can look at and beat you up over its occupancy. So they tend to manage to occupancy much more than we do, but in their world they get 3% increases and call it a day and that’s just – there are just playing a different game than we are.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. It seems like there’s additional upside that could accrue to you guys just from having the competition be better?
Ric Campo: There’s no question about that, and that’s why we made our revenue management system available to the masses and people are adding on to it every time. The worst thing in the world is to have a stupid competitor across the street, and what we try to do is get our managers to educate them that they’re selling a product that’s too low a price, and we spend a fair amount of time doing that without getting into issues of getting everybody to have the same rent.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. Then just a second question, Ric. You talk about the $400 to $600 million development pipeline is where you sort of want to keep things. I mean, have you guys considered to any great extent funding some of the merchant developers and sort of pre-sell takeouts where your capital isn’t at risk as much as a way to either – whether or not you’re calling it quasi developments or quasi acquisitions, as a way to get additional investments without the risk?
Ric Campo: We have looked at a few transactions like that in markets that have really long lead times where we don’t have a big pipeline. But, generally speaking we shy away from that because at the end of the day you made a comment that you have less capital at risk. I found in those kind of transactions that you have as much capital at risk and you have additional risk, and that is that the merchant builder doesn’t deliver and doesn’t build the project on time and on budget and you end up having to deal with a lot of those issues. So, given that we have a very robust development background and experience and team, it’s highly unlikely we’ll do transactions like that.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Ric Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Good morning down there.
Ric Campo: Hey, Alex.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Just going back to Atlanta for a minute. If we look at the latest BLS data, I think there were job losses in fact, and if you look sort of from the dot-com bust, Atlanta never really regained its – the oomph that it had in the ‘90s, and what’s interesting is Phoenix, despite having been obliterated with the housing downturn over the past two years, it seems to be rebounding strongly. Do you think there’s something with Atlanta or why aren’t we seeing the growth that it used to have, why didn’t we see that come back and why is the job losses recently? Why are we seeing that as opposed to some of the other Sunbelt growth year markets that are rebounding?
Keith Oden: Our forecast for this year, actually showed a loss of 10,000 jobs in 2010 and the Whitten forecast is 37 this year, and the CBRE forecast is 40,000. Those may end up being a little optimistic. So let me give you my – this is my $0.02 worth and I don’t have any – anything more than this, which is, if you look at Atlanta’s economy, one of the things that was always a selling point of Atlanta was that it is almost exactly the distribution of the United States in terms of where the industry is. So it’s almost a snapshot mirror of the distribution of the US economy. And so you think about that and US economy has struggled mightily in the aggregate to move the needle on job and you almost would expect that to be the case with Atlanta. Because the drivers are the same as the overall economy. Now contrast that with where’s the job growth happening in our portfolio? Well, it’s – you know the top four Houston, Dallas, Austin and Denver, and there is just no question that the energy component of those markets, and Austin’s a little bit different story, but it’s part of the Texas story. Denver is very much part driven – affected by what’s going on in energy prices. So you think about those economies, they just – they’re marching to a different beat than the national economy is. And then my guess is that Atlanta is just doing what you kind of would expect from Atlanta given the weakness in the overall national job growth.
Ric Campo: And I think your juxtaposition with Phoenix is very, very telling because, Phoenix, for example, if you think about why Phoenix is doing well right now, it’s doing well because its cost of doing business went down big time as a result of the housing bust. You’ve had massive declines in housing prices and lots of unemployed workers and that has actually given Phoenix a competitive advantage against other economies where you haven’t had housing busts and what have you. You look at some of our properties in Phoenix, for example, we have a lot of engineers and construction workers and architects that are building the $1.3 billion Intel plant in – outside of Peoria. And when you look at what’s driving the Phoenix market, it’s actually Intel, medical and distribution services, call centers, those kind of things and they can relocate to Phoenix at a very, very low cost and the government is just welcoming them in with tax incentives and all kinds of different gifts and giveaways to try to get their economy back on track, and so that’s why it’s doing really well.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: But like if you think about it, you guys are always big into your portfolio weighting and how you balance the different markets. I mean, clearly you guys have been interested in Atlanta because you bought the equity site or the equity deal in Buckhead, the news reports about, I guess, a former high school site that now has an apartment on it or something like that. But if you think about it, if Atlanta from what your describing doesn’t sound as rosy as what it was, wouldn’t that almost suggest that you may want to down weight Atlanta and increase the weighting towards other more pro business or low cost or markets that have more growth potential?
Ric Campo: Well I think that we were just doing a juxtaposition between Atlanta and Phoenix right now, but if you look at Atlanta over the long haul, I think Atlanta is a great market because it is – and is still in the south. It’s still in the flow of business, it has a lot of Fortune 500 companies that are headquartered there. It has a lot of positives. So I don’t think you can ignore Atlanta and say Atlanta is off the edge of the earth and we shouldn’t be there. We like Atlanta. The growth has been okay given the job growth scenario there and I think Keith’s view of or his discussion of that it’s like the rest of the US economy and that’s why it’s having issues, you know, as you grow the US economy Atlanta will do great. Right now the US economy is not growing as much and we think there is some pretty attractive opportunities in the Atlanta area and we are committed to Atlanta over the long term.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. And then just my second question is on the land sites, who are you seeing out there – I mean, land values have rebounded strongly. Who are you seeing out there competing? Is it home builders? Is it other rental builders? Is it – who is out there bidding for that land?
Ric Campo: It’s definitely not home builders. In the last cycle home builders outbid the multifamily people in terms of billing developments. Today, the home builders are pretty quiet. I think what the homes builders are doing are buying, existing lots and things like that as opposed to outbidding us on multifamily sites. The typical players out there are sort of the typical players you’ve seen in the past which are REITs like us and then the merchant builders are coming to life again. They still have a lot of infrastructure to build out in terms of getting to the point where they can be anywhere close to the level they were in the last cycle but there definitely are merchant builders and REITs out there and it’s pretty much the same players as we had in the past albeit on a much smaller basis.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. Just for clarification, even in-fill sites like urban sites you’re not seeing the home builders there?
Ric Campo: No.
Alex Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. After listening to a lot of multifamily calls this week, it sounds like Texas and the West Coast are really the two regions of the country seeing the best acceleration over the next few quarters. Given the supply picture that you painted and you operate in both regions, be curious to hear your thoughts on whether Texas and some of the better sunbelt markets will be able to keep pace with the West Coast say over the next three or four quarters?
Ric Campo: Over the next three or four quarters, I think they will because there’s just no reasonable – there’s no major supply coming on in those markets so you have a classic situation where you have substantial job growth, limited supply and that is a great recipe for and backdrop for good growth and outsized growth than you otherwise have. One of the examples I use a lot on the supply side because I know everyone believes that supply is going to come back with a vengeance, especially in the non supply constrained markets, but to give you a sense; Trammel Crowe residential had 23 properties under construction in Houston in 2006 and 2007. Today they have zero and they are looking at sites today but best case scenario are not going to have any new product in the market until 2013. So we still enjoy a very limited supply of new product coming into these markets and I think it’s going to take at least another 18 to 36 months for any supply concerns to start to manifest. And if you’re talking about three to four quarters, you just can’t get it in the ground and out of the ground fast enough to hurt those quarters.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Got it. Second question. Just relates to rents, I know you said on the last call you expected new rents to cross over renewal rent increases probably in the next couple of quarters it looked like the spread widened out a little bit this quarter and even a little more in July. Can you just sort of update your thoughts on pushing rents in those two different group?
Ric Campo: Yeah. The widening came primarily from the pushing up on the renewals. So I – we may have to revisit our forecast on that if we continue to – and if you look at the – the stat I quoted earlier, Karin, if you look at our renewals going out what’s already in the bank for the August and September renewal, that number pushed above 9%. So it could take longer but that would be a good thing.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And it’s – but you’re not seeing weakness on the new lease side that in anyway concerns you?
Ric Campo: No.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay.
Ric Campo: But the gap did grow but it grew because renewal increases were actually at a faster clip and again, looking forward the evidence that we have right now of the August, September numbers it looks like that’s going to continue.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great. Thank you very much.
Ric Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Bower of UBS. Please go ahead.
Ralph – UBS: Hey, guys. It’s Ralph [ph] here with Derek. A couple questions. First, where did occupancy end the quarter and where is it here at the end of July?
Ric Campo: Yeah. We ended the quarter at 94.8 and we’re at 95% on the – as of yesterday.
Ralph – UBS: And how much more upside do you think there is to those numbers? I know that the portfolio average is being held back a little bit by Phoenix and Vegas. But is there another point that could get squeezed out over the next year?
Ric Campo: Yeah. I would – it would be very surprising for me to see that. We are pretty careful to try to operate our portfolio in the 94% to 95% range because that’s where we think we maximize revenues. If you see in any one of our markets that’s got anything above a 95 for more than a quarter it’s probably because we are – we just can’t get ahead of pushing the rents as fast as what people are willing to pay the increases at. It would be unlikely that you would see us operate for more than a quarter at something above 95%. But the flip side of that is if it continues to stay that way, our model is optimized to continue to push new leases and renewals even harder if that’s the case.
Ralph – UBS: Okay. While we’re on the new lease topic, did I hear correctly that the new lease growth in July was running around 5.3%?
Ric Campo: That’s correct.
Ralph – UBS: And that’s slightly below what you had in the second quarter of 6.1?
Ric Campo: It is. But that number jumps around a lot. If you go back two quarters ago we were at 5.7. The 5, 3 it doesn’t concern me at all.
Ralph – UBS: How quickly do you think that starts pushing higher? I would think if you’re doing 8% and 9% on the renewals and it start giving you some confidence with the occupancy where it is to start pushing the new rent higher than 5%.
Ric Campo: Most of that has to do with where the lease was initiated for the people that are renewing. You dial the clock back; most of these folks initiated their lease at a point in time when we were raising rents 2%. And if you go back prior to that, many of these folks got in leases that are probably 15% below where street rents are today. And there is, as Ric mentioned, there’s a little bit of calculus to you don’t want to force turnover beyond a point where you can back fill the units, comfortably back fill the units and – but most of that gap depends on the starting point, obviously on new leases, it’s whatever the market clearing rent is.
Ralph – UBS: Okay. On the development side, I don’t know if I heard this. What’s the stabilized yields at this point you’re targeting on the developments that you broke ground on in 2Q?
Ric Campo: The yields are anywhere from high 6s to high 7s.
Ralph – UBS: And when I blend that together with what was started before 2Q, does it bring it down a touch?
Ric Campo: No. It’s about the same. Actually, our sort of weighted average is somewhere in the seven in the quarter to seven in a half range, it doesn’t really bring it down, no.
Ralph – UBS: Is that up slightly from what you were targeting?
Ric Campo: It is up slightly, yes.
Ralph – UBS: Okay. And then lastly, you touched on the expense growth which was very much appreciated but one thing that I think puzzled me, just looking at the line items was the 7% year-to-date increase in salaries and benefits. Can you help me understand what’s going on in particular on that line item?
Ric Campo: Yeah. If you look at salaries and benefits, I’ll break it into two components, both salaries and bonuses were actually up 2.9% year-to-date which is for all practical purposes our 2% salary increase and slightly higher incentives due to the lease-up in our portfolio over this period of time. The rest or the 4.1% increase, the remainder of the increase is all related to benefits and it’s really two things. We had an extremely good year last year on medical costs and this year we’ve had a rash of large claims. So of that 7%, 2.9 is our core increase and 4.1 is just unfavorable variance on medical costs.
Ralph – UBS: Got it. You got an easy comp on that next year, sounds like.
Ric Campo: Yeah. And hopefully we’ll have – we won’t have any major experience issues.
Ralph – UBS: Hope so. Thanks, guys.
Ric Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew McCulloch from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Andrew McCulloch – Green Street Advisors: Hey. Good morning. I know we’re almost at the end of the call, so I just had 1 big picture question for Ric. Is there anything on the regulatory front that you’re particularly troubled about today or even potentially excited about, whether its changes to Fannie, Freddie changes to mortgage interest deduction rent control coming back in certain markets or changes to carried interest, what’s front and center on your radar screen today?
Ric Campo:
 c: And right now we don’t get a lot of subsidies from the government to rent an apartment, other than maybe the implied government subsidy that you get from Freddie and Fannie so there isn’t really any big pictures that brethren us, I know a lot of our lot of our National Multi Housing Council brothers who are very lathered up over carried interest but carried interest doesn’t apply to public companies. We pay ordinary income on all of our stock options or restricted stock grants. And the fact that our private brethren who pay capital gains on their incomes might have to pay ordinary income, that’s their issue and not ours, of course, I think they have – they argue to Washington that it would have a negative impact on supply because they wouldn’t do as much. And maybe it would and that would be good for us. So I’m not sure – there’s really no big ticket items out there, Freddie and Fannie, there’s still a lot of gnarling going on about what’s going to happen with them. But given everything else on the political agenda, you’re not going to see any major movement with Freddie and Fannie or even a plan for Freddie and Fannie until after the 12 elections. So I think it’s just go along, get along at this point without any major political risk for multifamily today.
Andrew McCulloch – Green Street Advisors: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: Yes, just one last question. I was curious about your thinking on the supply outlook for the DC Metro. Just can you put the unit growth in context around the timing for us and maybe talk about what your leasing strategy will be ahead of it and how you think that will play out in your NOI.
Ric Campo: On the supply side, we’ve got an estimate of completions in Washington, DC of 2,200 units for ‘11. And our estimate or forecast for 2012 is right at 4,000. Neither one of those numbers are problematic, in my view. I mean, if you think about the job growth that we’re forecasting in 2011, we think we get 58,000 plus or minus jobs. Our back of the envelope rule of thumb that has some historical correlation to what happens is that for every five jobs that get created it creates a natural demand for one additional market rate multifamily completion. So you translate the 58,000 jobs, you would expect you could absorb 10,000 new apartments without upsetting the natural balance. We’ve got 2,000 coming this year forecast for next year is 2012 we’ve got another 50,000 jobs forecast. Using the same math you would be able to support 10,000 without upsetting the balance. We’ve got 4,000 forecast. So unless something really odd or unusual or dramatic happens on the job growth front in DC Metro, we think we’re really still in very good shape. That’s helpful. Thank you. One last question on the single family rental point you brought up earlier. Do you have a sense on where pricing has gone on single family rentals? And do you have any history on where the gap in pricing has been between multifamily and single family?
Ric Campo: The gap interestingly enough, has been that single family houses have actually been pretty affordable. Interestingly enough in most markets the rental rates are going up on single family houses. And the real issue with single family houses is it’s really just a different product from multifamily, even If you look at our portfolio we have 6% of our portfolio is three bedroom units. And pretty much every multifamily house is a three bedroom or more. So when you think about the product maybe 6% of our product competes with it. And if you look at the vacancy rate, I’ll use our favorite market that people love to use as an example for single family problems and that’s Las Vegas. There’s about a 30% vacancy factor in the single family market in Las Vegas. Yet our property is at 93%, 93.5% occupied, which means that if those were really competitive products, there would be this giant sucking sound out of the multifamily and you would have a really low occupancy rate, high vacancy rate. So whether they’re more expensive or less expensive at the margins is important but really not a broad macro thing that hurts the apartment business.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Biffert from Bloomberg Research. Please go ahead.
Mark Biffert – Bloomberg Research: Hey, guys. Keith, just to expand on the data you provided on the markets, I’m just wondering if you’ve looked at what the spread to rent versus own is in those markets and with the job growth and the thought that as incomes grow and people get married and move out and start having kids, I’m just wondering what that spread is and where we could potentially see that cross over and keep over side it didn’t move out to own.
Ric Campo: When you look at the spread of buy to own right now or rent own, it’s probably at one of the best, sort of relationships today for home ownership. And it’s right at even in the sense that you can rent an apartment for the same price you can buy a home in a lot of our markets. The question, however is do they want to buy a home or can they buy a home. And when you look at the issues related to just the home ownership rate dropping, the fact that prices continue to fall, consumer sentiment is obviously very negative towards buying homes. As the time goes on and people get more constructive about home prices rising and their family situation or whatever changes, so that they’re more likely to buy a home, then they will buy a home, I’m one of the – and I think we are in general – we have a view that the home ownership rate dropping is not a secular change in consumer habits in the future because most people, when they get to their mid-30s and start reaching their 40s they have more capital, they have more stable job situations. If they do get married and have children they have different kinds of needs for housing and they will, in fact, move out and buy a house. And I think that actually is good for America because you’ll have then, ultimately the housing supply will go down, the excess supply – you’ll have more construction workers and products being made and what have you in the overall housing market. But, generally speaking you can’t look at the rent to buy ratio and say oh, they’re getting ready to all move out to buy houses.
Keith Oden: In addition, I think one of the things that we really learned the hard way in this last cycle is that comparing the cost to rent to the mortgage payment is just really fallacious; it’s the cost of occupancy. And in a rental environment your cost of occupancy is your rental payment plus a little bit of utilities and in a single family home it’s that, it’s utilities, it’s maintenance, it’s property taxes and all these other things. So it’s a little bit of a funny comparison to say rent payment versus, as a percentage of, relative to mortgage payment.
Mark Biffert – Bloomberg Research: So, I mean is it your view, then that the echo boomers that are really driving this push and where we’re seeing the biggest move outs, I think you said 50% of the ones that had doubled up are now coming out or maybe it was 30%, I mean, is it really a few years out before we actually see that, maybe it’s the echo boomers that drive that shift back into housing or is there another thing that might drive that?
Ric Campo: I think it is, definitely. The echo boomers, once they get more established. And these statistics on propensity to rent go back 25 years and they haven’t really changed much, is that a 21 year old has a higher propensity to rent than they do to buy 40 year old has a much higher propensity to buy than they do to rent. And as the baby boom echo ages and as they get into their mid 30s, they will start buying houses, there’s no question about that. At least through the next 3 or 4 years, like through 2015 we still have an increase in that cohort between 18 and 24 years old that continues to increase through 2015. So I fundamentally believe that as the markets improve and consumer sentiment improves with respect to housing prices and mortgage availability improves and credit metrics improve, people will in fact buy houses, when they get to the point where they have a higher propensity to buy versus rent because of lifestyle issues and choices. But today, you have negative consumer sentiment. You have all these people doubled up. You’ve got a lot of young people coming into the marketplace. It’s made our business really, really good. And ultimately in 2015, 2016, 2017 you’ll probably get more to a market like we had in the ‘90s, because if you look at the ‘90s you didn’t have the baby boom echo all the baby boomers were buying houses. But interestingly enough, through the early part of the 90s, after the early 90 recession, through the end of the decade before we had the tech pass, multifamily did incredibly well, primarily because we added 25 million jobs during that timeframe and created a lot of new households and demand. So we have decent job growth and decent economic activity after ‘15 then it should be a good business too. But between now and then it’s going to be a really good business.
Mark Biffert – Bloomberg Research: Okay. Just back to development, I mean, previously Ric, you’ve talked about moving up the coast, either New York, Boston or San Francisco. And I’m just wondering if any of the deals you’re looking at from either a development or acquisition side are in those markets or if you’re just comfortable staying where you’re at in your core markets.
Ric Campo: We’re absolutely comfortable staying in our core markets. And the developments that we talked about, the $400 million to $600 million are all in our core markets.
Mark Biffert – Bloomberg Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from partner (inaudible 70:59) William Kuo from Cowen and Company.
William Kuo – Cowen & Co.: Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just had a quick question, I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the rent to income ratio. Is that coming more from people who might – they get raises, like existing residents who instead of moving out they’re staying put or is that coming more from new residents coming in with higher income levels and that’s bringing the rent to income ratio down?
Keith Oden: Well; this is – these are just our embedded base. It’s just taking the household income that’s reported on the lease application and dividing it by the average rent. Either – it could be driven by either one of those. Obviously the average rents are going up pretty significantly but household incomes have been going up, as well. I mean, an interesting thing is that for the 91% something of people in these country who are employed and who are our demographic cohort but below 30 years old which is roughly 40% of all of our residents those people have a job and they’ve gotten increases in the last two or three years. And the fact that total wages are down is primarily a function of 9% unemployment rate but for people who have jobs, their household income has increased at a time where for 3 years their rental payment was going down and obviously that’s reversed and we have a fair amount of room to go before we even get them back to what they were paying in 2007 at a time when their incomes have clearly grown.
William Kuo – Cowen & Co.: Okay. Thanks. And a quick question on real estate taxes. I know last year a lot of people had positive surprises because they kind of appealed and found out in the back half of the year. What are the chances of that happening again this year?
Ric Campo: I think we’re pretty comfortable with our full year forecast, where our expense growth on real estate taxes is going to be just above 2%. We’re still appealing a lot and having good success on it but after a couple of years of having some pretty decent decreases in real estate taxes, we’re looking at a little over 2% decrease. I think the tax assessors have been listening to multifamily conference calls and looked at stock prices and net asset values of the REITs and have figured out that property values are not falling anymore.
William Kuo – Cowen & Co.: Okay. Great. That’s helpful for me. Thanks.
Ric Campo: That was our last call. We appreciate your time and attendance on our call and we’ll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Camden Property Trust fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator instructions) After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden’s fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and belief. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden’s complete fourth quarter 2009 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Ric Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Oden, President and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today is scheduled for one hour so we ask that you limit your questions to one with one follow-up and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today we would be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or e-mail after the call concludes. At this time, I will turn the call over to Ric Campo.
Ric Campo: Good morning in some places and good afternoon in others. Our pre-conference country music is in honor of the upcoming Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and as Vern Gosdin sings in the last song “This Ain’t Our First Rodeo.” As in any rodeo, there are always bumps and bruise along the way. As we continue to navigate the great recession, I am very happy with our team’s performance so far. Since the beginning of the recession we have completed 1.6 billion in capital market transactions and strengthened our balance sheet and improved our liquidity. During 2009, we closed the year at the midpoint of our original same-store guidance and produced a sector leading 45% total shareholder return. 2010 will be a continuation of the market challenges that we face in 2009. We believe that we are a little more than halfway through this down cycle. The multi-family fundamentals will lag current economic conditions by about six months. With job losses abating towards the end of 2009, we expect the fundamentals will improve in the second half of 2010. With limited supply, positive demographics, and the homeownership rate continuing to decline, we expect a robust recovery in fundamentals beginning in 2011. During the quarter, we pushed back the potential starts on eight development properties into mid-2011 and beyond. In connection with this action, we took an $85.6 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter. In addition, we stopped capitalizing costs associated with these projects totaling $0.11 per share which represents the bulk of the difference in our 2010 guidance versus first call consensus. New development is a core competency for Camden. We have five communities in our development pipeline, excluding the eight delayed properties that could actually start in late 2010 for delivery in what could be very robust conditions in 2012. I want to thank all of our Camden team members for their hard work and dedication to providing living excellence to our customers during these difficult times. At this point, I will turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Ric. Consistent with prior years, I am going to use my time on today’s call to review the market conditions we expect to encounter in our largest markets in 2010. I will address the markets in the order of best to worst by assigning a letter grade to each one as well as our view as to whether we believe that market is likely to be improving, stable, or declining in the year ahead. Following a market overview, I will provide some additional details of our fourth quarter operations and our 2010 same property guidance. Providing guidance in today’s business climate is fraught with peril. Last year, our guidance assumed a nasty recession with a loss of 2 million jobs nationally. As it turned out, we lost that many jobs in the first quarter on our way to 5 million jobs lost for the year. Nonetheless, to prepare budgets and forecasts, one has to have a view even if that view is somewhat murky. Our view for 2010 is that we will have a very modest back-end loaded recovery which produces roughly 700,000 jobs nationally or a 1.5% increase in employment. This translates to approximately 145,000 net new jobs in Camden’s markets. Not great, but it beats the heck out of the 1 million jobs lost in our markets in 2009. So here we go. Starting with an overview of Camden’s markets, we begin in Washington, D.C. Metro. With a rating of ‘B’ and an improving outlook D.C. Metro is our highest rated market for 2010. Our tax dollars will be hard at work creating 17,000 new jobs and new completions will only be in the 2,500 range. This should create an opportunity for return to rental growth in 2010 and position D.C. Metro as our top performing market during the year. Denver should follow with relatively strong 2009 performance as our second best market in 2010. We expect to see a very modest decline in revenue this year, roughly the same as we had in 2009. 10,000 new jobs will be sufficient to offset 2,400 completions and maintain Denver as a ‘B’ market with a stable outlook. Houston and Dallas both rank as ‘B’ markets but with declining outlooks. Both markets are still struggling to absorb roughly 15,000 completions in 2009 with another estimated 5,000 completions in each market in 2010. Rental occupancies, rental rates and occupancies will continue to be under pressure. Dallas has a better jobs outlook with 40,000 growth versus projected Houston growth of 10,000 new jobs. The Texas markets were among the last to succumb to the great recession, which allowed us to maintain our revenues as essentially flat in 2009. 2010 will be a different story as revenues will likely fall by 4% in both Houston and Dallas this year. Next in line would be southeast Florida and Orlando, both of which we rate at B- with a stable outlook. Southeast Florida will likely lose an additional 5,600 jobs but with market wide occupancy rates strong in the mid-90s and fewer than 2,000 completions, we do see some stability in Southeast Florida for 2010, which will produce less revenue decline than in 2009. Orlando should add 7,000 jobs, complete 2,000 new apartments in 2010, which should allow us to limit the revenue decline to roughly the same as last year and thus the B- stable rating in both markets. Southern California should see some signs of stability in 2010 while the operating environment remains very difficult with 12% unemployment, we do expect to see modest job growth roughly 7,000 and completions across the whole region of 6,000, which should be manageable. Our rating for Southern California is C+ with a stable outlook. Austin gets a C rating with an improving outlook. 10,000 new jobs are sufficient to clean up the 2000 completions and limit further revenue declines to the 2% range for 2010, roughly half of the revenue decline we saw in 2009. Raleigh also rates a C with an improving outlook. 5,000 new jobs and a mere 1,400 completions will allow for occupancy rates to pick up, setting the stage for revenue recovery in the second half of the year. Atlanta also receives a C rating with an improving outlook, with a projected 18,000 new jobs and finally, some relief on the supply front with only 2,900 completions, we look for revenue declines below what we experienced last year. In Charlotte, the worst is probably over. Job growth albeit modest returns in 2010 with 7,000 new jobs likely sufficient to offset 2,900 completions. We see Charlottte as a C market with a stable outlook. Tampa remains the weakest of our Florida markets. 2010 will see another year of job losses in the 15,000 range which along with a 3,000 completions will keep pressure on occupancy rates and rental rates. In Las Vegas, we see a few rays of light as we project an increase of 13,000 jobs and only 2,900 completions. This should allow us to limit our revenue declines to well below last year’s 7.2% while undoubtedly one of the most challenging markets in the country we rate Las Vegas as a C- with a stable outlook. And last again this year is Phoenix. Although this year ‘F’ is for finally, not for Phoenix. Last year, we gave Phoenix the only F rating in the history of our ratings game. However, we did see it as improving. As it turns out we were correct on both scores. The fundamentals in Phoenix were flat awful as reflected in our portfolio’s worst NOI decline at 14.9%. However, the rate of decline has decelerated and this year we rate Phoenix as a D market with an improving outlook. After two years of massive job losses, we project job growth of 34,000 this year and with only 2,000 completions, Phoenix will see an improvement in occupancy rates, which will limit further revenue declines to the 6% range. In comparing our 2010 outlook to last year, I think it’s notable that 11 of our 14 markets have a better rating this year than last. Only Houston, Dallas and Las Vegas have lower ratings. This is quite a contrast to last year when all 14 markets were rated lower than the previous year. However, this projected improvement comes from a very low base with the average rating of C+ up from last year’s portfolio wide rating of a C. Clearly, 2010 will be another very challenging year for our onsite team. Now, a few comments on our fourth quarter results. Sequentially NOI actually rose 2.6% from last quarter, but I don’t read too much into that as our revenues declined in every market. Good expense control discipline and some really good news on property taxes drove the positive NOI results. Average occupancy fell by 9/10% and rental rates declined by 1.6%. The 9/10% decline in occupancy is in line with our historical seasonal drop, but the 92.9% occupancy for the fourth quarter is roughly 1% below our historical occupancy rate for the quarter. We ended January at 93.3% occupied, which is only 40 basis points below our ten-year average occupancy rate for the first quarter, so we think we’re getting back closer to our expected occupancy rate. Our annual turnover rate declined from last year’s 63% to 58% which was in line with our expectations. We did see a spike upward in the percentage of move-outs to purchase homes from 13.8% last quarter to 15.6% in the fourth quarter. We believe that part of this increase is attributable to the tax credit which is set to expire at the end of the first quarter. In any case, the home purchase percentage for the year was 13.3%, still well below our 18% long-term average. Skips and evictions were roughly the same as last year but move-outs for financial reasons and job losses rose to 10.8% from 6.1% in the previous year. Turning to NOI guidance for 2010, we see revenues declining again roughly 3.25% at the midpoint, expenses up 2.75% at the midpoint resulting in a projected 7% NOI loss versus our 6% NOI decline last year. Adjusting operating expenses for the impact of cable TV and Valet Waste expenses, our operating expenses will have increased by 2% over the entire two-year timeframe or roughly 1% per year. In 2009, we faced some of the most challenging market conditions since the mid-1980s. In a hypercompetitive market, it is more essential than ever to provide the best possible customer experience. Reducing turnover by exceeding our resident’s expectations is absolutely critical again in 2010 just as it was in 2009. The best way to ensure a great customer experience is to maintain a motivated, engaged and happy workforce. To that end, I am pleased to report that Camden was named as one of the best places to work in the state of Texas and also in Charlotte, South Florida, Orlando, Tampa, Las Vegas, and Houston. In addition, for the third consecutive year, we were included on Fortune Magazine’s list of the 100 best places to work in America. This year we broke into the top 10, up from number 41 last year. To make this type of improvement in such a challenging year speaks volumes about the commitment Camden’s associates have to our company. Every one of our 1,800 associates can take pride in knowing that in one of the most difficult business climates in a generation they contributed to creating one of the ten best workplaces in this country. At this point I will turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Dennis Steen: Thanks, Keith. I will begin with a review of our fourth quarter 2009 results. Camden reported an FFO loss for the fourth quarter of $36.3 million or $1.19 per diluted share. Included in these results was an $85.6 million impairment loss on our announced reduction in development activities as detailed in our press release on February 2nd. Excluding this impairment loss, our FFO for the fourth quarter would have been $49.3 million or $0.71 per diluted share at the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $0.69 per share to $0.73 per share. Core results coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range resulted from property net operating income exceeding our forecast by approximately $2.2 million, offset by higher than expected G&A and property supervision expenses of approximately $1.1 million, and increased amortization of deferred financing costs of $900,000. The $2.2 million favorable variance in property net operating income for the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower than anticipated property level expenses. Property expenses were 2.1 million lower than anticipated due to $1.3 million in real estate tax savings, primarily driven by lower tax rates and valuations, which were finalized in the fourth quarter for our Texas and Florida markets, and an $800,000 positive variance in all other property level expenses, primarily due to lower utility, employee benefit, and property insurance costs. For all of 2009, same-store expenses increased 1.8% over 2008, significantly below our original 2009 guidance range of 5% to 6.25% due to real estate tax expense declining 2.3% from 2008 as compared to an expected 4.5% budgeted increase due to the success and achieving valuation reductions and lower than anticipated increases in tax rates. Additionally, we benefited from lower than anticipated utility rate increases and an increased focus by all of our communities in controlling discretionary expenses. Excluding the impact of expenses related to the continued rollout of our ancillary income initiatives Perfect Connection and Valet Waste, 2009 same-store expenses actually declined 0.1% from 2008. The $1.1 million unfavorable variance in total G&A and property supervision expense for the fourth quarter was due to approximately 600,000 in non-recurring separation costs related to the retirement of one of our executives with the remaining $500,000 unfavorable variance primarily due to an increase in compensation costs related to higher employee participation in our stock purchase program and increases in incentive compensation costs. The $900,000 unfavorable variance in deferred financing costs to our fourth quarter guidance relates entirely to the costs we incurred in the fourth quarter to extend the maturity date of our $600 million unsecured line of credit from January of 2010 to January of 2011. We decided to expense in the fourth quarter of 2009 all costs related to the extension versus amortizing these costs into 2010. Moving on to capital activities in our liquidity position, during 2009 we made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet by raising $692 million in new debt and equity capital using the proceeds to pay down all balances outstanding on our $600 million line of credit and to repurchase and repay near-term debt maturities. At the end of 2009, we had approximately $64 million in cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet, full availability under our $600 million line of credit, which now matures in January 2011, and no significant funding requirements for our existing development projects. We have only two projects currently under construction. They will both be completed in the first quarter of 2010 with any remaining funding expected to come from existing construction financing. With existing liquidity of $664 million and capital markets which have improved substantially in the second half of 2009, we have confidence that we can retire or refinance our upcoming debt maturities, which total approximately 138 million in 2010 and 150 million in 2011. On January 15th, 55.3 million of our 2010 maturities came due and we retired these unsecured notes using available cash. Now I would like to discuss our 2010 guidance. Please refer to Page 28 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2010 financial outlook. We expect 2010 projected FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.65 with a midpoint of $2.50 representing a $0.36 per share or 13% decline from our adjusted 2009 FFO per share of $2.86, which excludes the non-recurring 2009 impairment losses and losses on the early retirement and debt and after adjusting the 2009 fully diluted shares outstanding for the incremental full year impact of our equity offering in May of 2009. The major assumptions and components of our $0.36 per share decline in FFO at the midpoint of our guidance range are as follows. A $0.37 per share decline in FFO related to the performance of our 47,359 units same-store portfolio. As Keith discussed previously, we’re expecting negative same-store NOI performance of 5.5% to 8.5%. A $0.09 per share decline in FFO related to 6.5 million in lost interest and real estate capitalization on the eight development projects we recently put on hold. These two declines will be partially offset by an $0.08 per share increase in FFO related to lower interest expense resulting from lower average outstanding debt balances in 2010 as we use the proceeds of our $272 million equity offering in May to repurchase and retire debt throughout 2009 and into 2010, and a $0.02 per share increase in FFO related to an increase in non-property income due to a 2.6 million or $0.04 per share non-recurring gain we expect to record in the first quarter of 2010 related to a contingent liability established in 2006 for potential future real estate tax increases on assets we sold in 2006 out of our Midwest markets. The real estate tax increases did not materialize and we are now reversing our liability resulting in the gain. This gain is partially offset by reductions in interest income related to our mezzanine loan portfolio due to lower mezzanine loan balances outstanding and less interest income on cash investments as all proceeds from our equity offering in 2009 have now been used to repurchase retired debt. Page 28 of our supplemental package also details our expected ranges for acquisitions, dispositions and development activities. The midpoint of our 2010 FFO per share guidance range assumes the following for 2010. $50 million in both acquisitions and dispositions in the second half of the year, 350 million in acquisitions and our value-add fund, spread throughout the last three quarters of 2010, 75 million of new development starts late in the year, and our guidance does not include any further equity or debt issuances. Also, of note, total general and administrative and property management expenses for 2010 are expected to be between $48 million and $52 million with the midpoint of $50 million representing a slight decline from $50.1 million for the year-ended December 31, 2009. The slight decline is the result of no growth in recurring overhead costs and the fact that the $1.6 million in severance and retirement costs we experienced in the first and fourth quarters of 2009 was almost entirely offset by a reduction in the overhead costs we expect to capitalize to development projects in 2010. As a result of our recent decision to put on hold eight development projects in our pipeline, in 2010, we expect to capitalize 3.3 million in overhead costs to our existing development projects and development pipeline down from 4.8 million in 2009. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect projected FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.68 with the midpoint of $0.66 per share representing a $0.05 per share decline from the fourth quarter of 2009 adjusted FFO per diluted share of $0.71, which excludes the impact of the impairment losses. The $0.05 per share decline is primarily the result of the following. Lower projected first quarter same-store net operating income of $6 million or $0.09 per share. This decline is the result of a 2.1 million or 1.5% sequential decline in same property revenues due to the continued repricing of rental rates across our portfolio and a $3.9 million increase in same property expenses. The increase in expenses is due to fourth quarter of 2009 favorable variances in real estate taxes as we adjusted our full-year accruals for final 2009 tax rates and assessments and lower than anticipated fourth quarter employee benefits and insurance costs I mentioned earlier, plus growth in core expenses as we expect same property expenses to increase by 2.75% in 2010 over 2009 at the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally, we expect lower capitalized interest and capitalized real estate taxes of approximately 1.6 million or $0.02 per share as we have discontinued the capitalization of costs to the eight development projects we recently put on hold. The above two negatives are partially offset by a 2.5 million or $0.04 per share increase in non-property income primarily due to the gain I mentioned earlier related to the final resolution of real estate tax contingent liability on previously sold assets, a $700,000 or $0.01 per share reduction in interest expense resulting primarily from the retirement of the 55.3 million or 4.39% unsecured notes which matured on January 15th of 2010. We used available cash to retire these notes. And lastly, a $900,000 or $0.01 per share reduction in the amortization of deferred financing costs due to line extension costs which we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. At this time, I would like to open the call up to questions.
Operator:
 :
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O’Neill: Good afternoon or good morning. A question on the development versus acquisitions on a go-forward basis. Just given the level of write-downs, have your thoughts changed as far as weightings of either developments or acquisitions for external growth and then has that changed your return thresholds or the spread that you need between the two?
Ric Campo: No, not really. The development starts, we talk about the development starts weighted to the back half of the year, so we have not decided to start any new developments at this point. We’re going to wait and see how the year unfolds. If it unfolds better than expected or unfolds in the way we think it might which is a better second half and a more firming in the economy and actual job losses cease and actually start, we perhaps will start developments at the end of the year. As far as the spread goes, I still think you need a reasonable spread of 100 basis points to 200 basis points between an acquisition and a development. Today, the real challenge, though is when you look at acquisition cap rates, they clearly have been compressed in the last 120 days compared to what they were before, but again we’re also talking about very limited acquisitions out there, so the comps that you’re seeing are very few deals, so, on one hand I don’t know what cap rates will do this year, but clearly, you need a risk premium for development over acquisitions.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O’Neill: And then the follow-up question to that is on the acquisition front, have you noticed any difference between the large, like mega cap banks versus the regionals versus the community banks in their willingness to do deals on troubled real estate?
Ric Campo: The regionals do seem to be a little bit more aggressive on and focusing on their issues than the larger ones. We have been in contact with any major banks or regional banks that would listen about trying to acquire debt or directly acquire short sale type transactions and I would definitely say regionals are more talkative today even though there hasn’t been a great deal of transaction volume at least they’re having conversations.
Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O’Neill: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Toti of Citigroup.
David Toti – Citigroup: Hi, everybody. Just going back to the acquisitions, Ric, can you walk us through what some of the acquisitions might look like in the joint ventures? That volume was quite a bit larger than what you’re projecting on balance sheet, and I am just wondering what the differences might be?
Ric Campo: The differences in the type of acquisitions?
David Toti – Citigroup: Yes, is there any quantifiable difference between the types of assets you look at, the types of deals that you would accept and maybe the regional footprint?
Ric Campo: No, there really isn’t any difference. Our acquisition activity is going to be primarily in our fund. And it’s going to be located in our four markets within the type of assets we have in our markets, that we have in our core, which include anywhere from solid B properties all the way to new developments.
David Toti – Citigroup: What kind of properties in terms of the span, you just mentioned assets and developments; would you consider broken deals or land? How wide is that spectrum of assets to consider?
Ric Campo: The spectrum of assets is pretty wide, but we would clearly look at land. We would also clearly look at some busted transactions. We probably aren’t going to spend a great deal of time with half condo versus rental type properties just because the complexities of operating those properties with the existing condo owners in an apartment scenario, but we would deal with one that is maybe have limited sales and not necessarily where you have just really depends on the deal, but we would look at broken deals, no question.
David Toti – Citigroup: And my follow-up question and this is something you get asked I think on every call. Could you just update us on any recent discussions you have had with the GSEs relative to appetite, their view, and any changes in underwriting?
Ric Campo: We continue to have a very close contact with GSEs. There’s a pretty decent article in the Wall Street Journal today that went through the state of the GSEs in terms of the government not really doing anything yet. One of the things they pointed out in the article which was instructive I think was the idea or the fact that in the Obama 2010 budget going forward there was one sentence dedicated to the GSEs, but we see the GSEs continuing to be an active player in multi-family. While they have tightened their underwriting, they still provide capital in the 5.5% range and will continue to do so. One of the interesting things is that their volumes are down significantly in terms of volumes of new loans, down significantly from 2009, and their budgets are down somewhere in the 20% to 30% below the originations that they had in 2009 primarily because most of the REITs have finished their refinancings and the spread between the unsecured debt market and the agency market has tightened dramatically. And so you have a situation where the agencies are actually having to move into more single asset transactions and more private entity transactions as opposed to the public companies. They love the public company business because they’re the best capitalized investment sort of borrowers in America really. So I think that’s kind of interesting is that their volumes are actually down and falling not rising.
David Toti – Citigroup: Great. Thanks for the detail.
Ric Campo: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Bragg of ISI Group.
Dave Bragg – ISI Group: Hi, thank you. Just a couple of specific questions on guidance and also 4Q. Can you tell us what the same-store revenue expense and NOI numbers were if you removed the impact of cable TV and Valet Waste programs both in 4Q and looking forward in 2010?
Keith Oden: Yes, David, for 2010, it is roughly 60 basis points on the expense side, and where as before we have broken that out, we think that now that it is under 1% differential and really we’re very close to being completely rolled out in both of those programs that it was probably less confusing to people to not break it out separately, but in 2010 it’s roughly 60 basis points.
Dave Bragg – ISI Group: That’s just on expenses?
Keith Oden: Correct.
Dave Bragg – ISI Group: Okay. And then just on 4Q ‘09?
Keith Oden: On NOI? The differential, it’s 8/10 of a basis point, something like that, or 8/10 of 1%. So, for full year 2009, we were in the 1.5% range, and it rolled down throughout the year 8/10 in the fourth quarter and for 2010 6/10.
Dave Bragg – ISI Group: That helps. Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Dave Bragg – ISI Group: And the follow-up question is just could you walk through the major items in operating expenses, talk about the outlook there specifically real estate taxes?
Keith Oden: Yes. In terms of operating expenses, we think that property taxes are probably going to be up in the 1.7% range in 2010. Again, that’s one of the biggest differentials we had, and in 2009 versus our original guidance was some positive news on taxes. We ended up basically flat for the year in 2009. We think we’ve modeled at least anyway on our forecast about 1.7% increase. We got utilities up next year in the roughly 3.7% and again those are really just from having conversations with all of the utility providers as to what they think the increases are going to be, so that’s a pretty big number. And then third repair and maintenance, we are roughly up 1.4%. Salaries up 2% for the year. As you all probably remember we had a salary freeze in all onsite as well as our corporate positions in 2009. We are assuming a 2% increase in salaries at the site level, so if you just take the property taxes, utilities, R&M and salaries, you’re dealing with somewhere in the range of 80% of all of our operating costs that those numbers work out to about a little bit less than a 2% increase, so all other factors get to you the 2.75 at the midpoint and just again to recap, 2.75 at the midpoint adjust that for the Valet Waste and cable expense gets you closer to the 2% range. We ended up actually a little bit slightly negative on total operating expenses in 2009, so, sort of take 2009 and combine it with 2010, you’re up 2% over the two-year period or 1% a year.
Dave Bragg – ISI Group: Just back to my original question there to tie it together. What’s the revenue impact from the Valet Waste and cable TV? So if I take expenses down 60 –
Keith Oden: About 30 basis points.
Dave Bragg – ISI Group: Got it. Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. Can you just talk a little bit about January trends thus far? Certainly, your peers have mentioned January is showing significant improvement. Just curious if you guys are seeing the same thing?
Keith Oden: I think significant improvement would be an over statement, but we have seen improvement. Our traffic levels were a little bit better than we expected them to be in January, the result of which is our least percentage ticked up pretty nicely and at the end of January we closed out right at 93.3% occupied. Our portfolio has a seasonal swing in it of about 1% to 1.3%. Historically, so, if you sort of go back and look at first quarter occupancy levels for the last ten years, 93.7% is where that comes out. We ended January at 93.3%. There was a little ramp up to get to that from the beginning of the year. If that continues, I think we could see the first quarter being 93.5% range, something like that, which again relative to historical, our portfolio numbers is really not that far off. Now, looking back into the fourth quarter of last year, we had a 1% decline over the third quarter. Again, that would be as expected. What wasn’t expected was the 92.9% average occupancy rate. That is about 1% below our ten-year historical average for the fourth quarter. So, no question in the fourth quarter we were below our long-term average in that regard, but a lot of that has to do with just where you are and what your pricing strategy is, and we think that from our perspective, sitting with the 93.3% occupied kind of staring at our markets over the next 11 months, I would much rather be in a position of trying to rebuild 1% occupancy or 1.5% occupancy in order to make our numbers, which is basically what we have to do versus having to raise rental rates 1.5% to get there. And so part of this is, as we talked about in the third quarter last year, we consciously made a decision and we tweaked our revenue management program to allow for a little bit lower occupancy because the model was we thought was overly penalizing market rates, and if you go down that trail, you get to live with that for the next 12 months. And we were just not willing to do that. So I hope that gives a little bit additional color there.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: The additional color is greatly appreciated. And then just on the refinancing front there, just curious as to what your plans are for the joint venture maturities in '10? Seems like you have a pretty sizable maturity log there.
Ric Campo: Right. We are working on those at this point. We’re either going to refinance them with agency debt or extend them with existing lenders and we feel comfortable being able to handle those maturities without any trouble.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Good morning, folks.
Ric Campo: Hello. Good morning.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So on YieldStar what is your rate of rejection right now? In other words, how often are you saying no to whatever suggested rent that pops out?
Ric Campo: That’s a really good question, Rich.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: (inaudible)
Ric Campo: (inaudible). I’m going to have to get back to you.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Would your sense be that you’re rejecting more and that in a down cycle maybe YieldStar isn’t quite as useful as it is on an up cycle?
Ric Campo: No. I think my sense is that cancellations and rejections really hasn’t moved a whole lot. And by the way, this is really not YieldStar. This is our set points for our acceptance or reject as a credit quality issue and is really not related to YieldStar, but we’re constantly reviewing at the site level through our district managers what those set points should be for whether you have a rejection or not.
Dennis Steen: Is your question about YieldStar and whether we’re rejecting the rental rate it is saying or whether we’re rejecting somebody based on credit?
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: No, rental rate.
Dennis Steen: Whether we’re accepting the YieldStar model or not?
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Yes, correct.
Dennis Steen: I would say on that it is fairly low because the reason is if you’re not accepting what your model says, then why do you have a model?
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Right. But I thought I recall the rejection rate was starting to move up.
Keith Oden: Rich, I am sorry, I was going on the other trail on acceptance or rejections of residents. Within YieldStar, we did in the second quarter of last year, we did start seeing more recommendations out of YieldStar to do pricing decreases that we, as a management team, and our pricing group thought were not warranted, and again gets back to the logic within the YieldStar model. It hates vacancy and we had set our vacancy targets relatively high trying to push -- maintain occupancy. But you end up actually going the other direction on total revenue because it starts really aggressively reducing rent, so yes. In the second quarter of last year, we were seeing more of that. One of the tweaks that we made during the year was adjusting the occupancy targets within the model, and right now we’re not seeing any greater level of rejections of pricing. All of those, if it falls outside of an anticipated range, then it has to go for further review and approval and those are not any higher than they were before we started adjusting the set points in the second quarter.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: And my follow-up, I guess, is completely unrelated question is, we were looking at just a little bit of extrapolation of Florida Power & Light Company, a public company, FPL has been pointing to some increased activity, they are obviously a Florida utility, and I was wondering, and that could be considered an early signal that things are starting to recover in the state of Florida. I was wondering if you look at anything like that and if you while you might be having still some lingering problems in Tampa and elsewhere in the state, if you think that the turnaround in Florida could be sooner rather than later despite your comments for 2010?
Dennis Steen: Rich, we spend a lot of time thinking about Florida Power and Light and all other light companies, but it’s primarily in regard to what their rate increases are going to be, which has been ridiculous over the last couple of years. It’s been one of our biggest challenges in managing operating costs has been utility costs, not just electricity, but gas as well as water. But in all candor, that’s not something that we’re looking at or trying to figure out whether conditions are improving in those markets, but I will say that if you think about our ranking this year, Southeast Florida and Orlando have moved up into the top half of our portfolio. We think Tampa is going to be a laggard within our portfolio in the Florida markets, but Southeast Florida came in at number five for the year, B- and stable, and by the way that was an upgrade from last year as a D stable. Orlando is B- and stable and that was an upgrade from C- and stable, so relative to the prior year, I think those markets have shown some pretty decent potential for recovery in 2010.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michelle Ko of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Michelle Ko – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi. You mentioned earlier that you thought we were a little more past the halfway mark in the downturn. I was just wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about what gives you confidence that that’s the case when 4Q same-store revenues declined the most in '09 and are you seeing some encouraging signs in January and February in particular markets where rental rate declines are lessening? If so, which markets?
Ric Campo: The key concept on being more than half way through is really what’s happening to jobs. If you take just look at the jobs and how the progression of job losses unfolded last year and if you go six months back, say, six months ago you had a whole lot more job losses than we had in January, and so as the job picture improves, our business improves, but it takes about six months to work through that system, so when you look at the progression, that’s why I think we believe that you’re half way through or more than halfway through, and we are seeing some positive signs on rental increases and the gap between in place rents and certain markets like South Florida is a great example. Keith, you can add to that.
Keith Oden: Michelle, I think Ric’s point is the macro point on the jobs is really crucial because we think we’re at an inflection point or will be within the next couple of months on job losses versus job creation. Our forecast is 700,000 jobs for the entire year, and that’s what we have kind of modeled our results around. And to kind of put that in context, 700,000 for the year, that’s roughly what we lost in one month in January of 2009, so there is a lag to that, but we are beginning to see improvement and it shows up primarily in our world and looking at the change in new leases, which is kind of real time data over in place leases. And for the month of January we had the lowest gap in the last twelve months, a gap to new leases versus in place leases at roughly 4.6%. That number has been as high as -- in our portfolio in '09 that number got as high as 7%, 8%, so that’s an encouraging sign. The other is that we continue to be able to renew leases at higher than in place rents. In January, our renewals were actually 1.4% better than the in place rent, so the more you see that and as you look at our budgets for 2010, you do start to see in certain markets where on a gross potential rent basis we actually start seeing increases year-over-year. Now, portfolio wide, we’re still not going to, we know we’re projecting revenues down 3.25 at the midpoint, so we’re going to continue to make progress on that. We won’t turn positive portfolio wide on a month over month basis looking at it over 2009, but we get pretty close by the end of the year, so I think the 4.6 and the 1.4 give us some sense that as you look backward and see where you were or where we were in terms of year-over-year progressions, it is getting better. We just got a long way to go.
Michelle Ko – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned South Florida was improving. Are there any other markets that you see improving dramatically?
Dennis Steen: Again, those dramatic words, I always drop all of those. I don’t see any of them improving dramatically. Clearly, in our world, we think DC is fairly constructive for us; job growth is going to kind of overtake what little small amount of supply there is. Denver still looks like it’s going to be a decent stable market for us, some job growth and minimal completions. I think as you look at two big pieces of 2009 versus 2010, in 2009, we lost a million jobs plus or minus across our portfolio. In 2009 we had completions that were roughly four times the level of what we’re going to see in 2010. Fast forward to 2010, instead of losing a million jobs, we think we’re going to gain 145,000 jobs in our markets and we know that the completions will be roughly 25% of what they were last year. So those two things just -- we don’t operate in a vacuum, but knowing those two pieces of information and the impact that it has on our ability to stabilize occupancy and raise rents would tell you that 2010, we should be on a road to a really nice recovery in occupancy in rents in 2011.
Michelle Ko – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Dennis Steen: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Levy of Macquarie.
Michael Levy – Macquarie: Thank you. As a follow-up to Alex and David’s questions about the acquisition activity, have you guys made any bids for any assets as of yet?
Dennis Steen: Yes, absolutely. We just haven’t bid high enough.
Michael Levy – Macquarie: So what do you think is going to change that would make it more likely for you guys to acquire assets in the next couple of months? Are you at all concerned that the market will remain too aggressive for asset acquisitions or will there just be better pricing on assets or more availability of assets?
Dennis Steen: I think there will be more availability of assets. I think that sellers, property sellers I think are going to be under more pressure to sell, and I do believe that over time as rents continue and NOIs continue to roll down, that sellers who do want to enter the market are looking at pretty good cap rates. So I do think that the volume will increase in terms of the properties that are out there. The real key thing from our perspective is making sure we’re patient and we’re trying to focus on transactions that are either off market or where we can buy the debt or we can come up with some strategy where we’re not number 40 bidder on an asset, and trying to create value by doing something a little more complicated or what have you. And so, I do think there is going to be more supply in the acquisition market and I do think there will be opportunities. But again we’re going to be patient, we didn’t buy anything in 2009, and I think the key to this market is, when we think about the volume of loans that have to be refinanced over the next three years, it’s like $200 billion in multi-family financing that has to be done. And I think that’s going to create an opportunity over the next couple of years. Now, may not be in the first quarter or second quarter, but I do think there is going to be opportunity.
Michael Levy – Macquarie: That’s helpful. Thanks. Just as a second question, the range that you gave for the same-store NOI decline, would it be right for me to assume that the 700,000 net job creation over the course of 2010 would put you at the midpoint of that range?
Dennis Steen: Yes.
Michael Levy – Macquarie: So what happens if the net number of jobs created is basically zero? What type of same-store NOI decline might we be looking at?
Dennis Steen: The 700,000 represents nationally about 0.5% job growth. Job growth is going to be somewhere between the midpoint and the bottom. I think the bottom of the range is probably a job loss, and the top of the range is better than 0.5.
Michael Levy – Macquarie: That’s very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody. Given your view on DC, could you provide a little bit more color on the submarket dynamics you saw that led to the decision of putting the South Capital project on hold and I suppose likewise on Andra in Houston?
Ric Campo: The South Capital project putting on hold was a direct function of three additional developments that were being built by JPI in the sub market and currently those properties are in lease up and are generating somewhere in the two to three months free range, so when we saw those markets, those properties coming out of the ground and then we felt the sort of uncertainty in the marketplace where respect to capital, keep in mind we stopped that project in May of 2007, so, we were worried about the development market beginning in the first half of 2007. We didn’t think that we clearly didn’t want to deliver with that competition in the marketplace and it was the right decision. The property itself or the location is a great location, and the market keeps getting better over time, and we will ultimately build that project, but it was the right decision to make at the time. As far as Andra airport in Houston, we have a second phase of our age restricted property that’s included or age restricted project that’s included in our five shovel ready projects today and we’ll be evaluating when we start that perhaps at the end of the year. We do have another development site there as well, but it’s likely to be -- given Houston’s supply issues, it’s liable to be a 2011 or '12 transaction.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: Just to keep on the DC theme for a minute with my obvious preoccupation on it, can you quantify what the severe weather impact was on the fourth quarter operating expenses and likewise have we already blown through the operating expense budget here in guidance for the first quarter considering what were happening in real time?
Keith Oden: We had roughly 100,000 in snow removal in the fourth quarter. Right now if you look at what that was versus what we’re dealing with right now, there is no question that there is going to be some expense impact in our DC communities. We still have communities that we’re wrestling right now getting access and getting people to get in and out, so it’s a major deal. And our Regional Vice President, our Divisional Vice President is up to his hips in snow right now, in fact, he canceled his attendance at our annual leadership meeting because he is there with the troops trying to make sure that we’re doing everything we can for our residents. Yes, there will be a financial impact. Little bit too early to tell.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: Thanks. And I think I missed your letter grade on Tampa.
Keith Oden: Tampa was C and stable.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: Thank you very much.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew DiZio of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Andrew DiZio – Janney Montgomery Scott: Thank you. Keith, you talked about move-outs to home purchase in the quarter. Can you comment on which markets those move-outs on home purchase were most acute?
Keith Oden: I just give you the ones that, Colorado at 25% which is Denver, DC at 22%, Raleigh at 22%, and beyond that Charlotte is at 17. Beyond that you’re below our historical 18% mark in virtually every unit. All of that rolls up and I am giving you the fourth quarter, 15.6%. So those were the ones kind of outliers on the upside. And I think that it will be interesting to see I think we got one more quarter of probably a really large spike in the move-outs relative to what the run rate has been. I think it will be very interesting to see what happens in the second quarter as the tax incentive rolls off. I believe we’re going to roll back down from the levels that we ended the year at and sort of slog along in the low teens throughout 2010.
Andrew DiZio – Janney Montgomery Scott: Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Haberman of Goldman Sachs.
Jay Haberman – Goldman Sachs: Hi, everyone. Just a question. I know, Ric, you talked about still evaluating some starts towards the end of the year. I guess it sounds like you’re still going to look at market fundamentals and consider that investment. Has your view changed broadly, though on the pace of the recovery given that there is still a lot of single-family overhang and the job growth outlook still looks fairly soft?
Ric Campo: No, not really. I think we’re pretty much where I thought we would be. When you look at this cycle compared to last cycles, our fundamentals have held up incredibly well relative to what you would expect with 8 million jobs being lost. So I feel very good about 2010 and what you have now is basically a roll down of existing rents and the first half is going to be influenced by the last half of 2009 and as long as we keep these numbers going in the right direction in terms of jobs, not losing a lot more jobs and having consumer confidence rise and all of the basic things that should keep the economy going forward, I feel pretty good about 2010. The real question will be do you have an inflection point in the second half of the year and do we really start seeing that gap between in place rents and street rents or the new rents really narrow as it’s been narrowing? Does it continue that trajectory and then do we actually get a positive number there. To me that’s what we have to see before we would commit capital to start new deals is that inflection point, and I don’t think there is any rush to start new deals because in terms of development because there is not going to be any merchant builders starting new development, and we’re going to be at historical lows from a star perspective for at least the next two years or three years.
Jay Haberman – Goldman Sachs: So based on current rents and I guess the current land prices where do you see development yields today?
Ric Campo: I think the development yields are going to be somewhere in the -- depending on where you are 7.5 to 8.
Jay Haberman – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Dustin Pizzo of UBS.
Dustin Pizzo – UBS: Hi, thanks, guys. Ric, just to follow-up on your last answer and one of Keith’s prior answers, I just want to make sure I heard you guys correctly that your expectation despite talking about a potential inflection point, your expectation that year-over-year rental rates won’t turn positive for the portfolio as a whole in 2010 would suggest very much that we will be talking about negative same-store revenue growth into the next year?
Kevin Oden: I think if the progression continues, it’s unlikely you’ll be talking about same-store revenue growth in 2011, because by the end of 2010, we’re very close to still slightly negative but very close to year-over-year portfolio increases.
Dustin Pizzo – UBS: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from David Toti of Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: It’s Michael Bilerman speaking. Ric, I don’t know if you want to talk a little bit about this whole aspect of looking back the last couple of years and knowing that you guys were first to get hit from a revenue and same-store perspective in '08 relative to your peer set given the markets that you were in, an element of being the weakest in, strongest out, your WISO , I don’t know how you want to pronounce it, almost like a FIFO concept, '09 you sort of came in basically just below the peer set from same-store and the guidance for 2010 is just below, so I guess at what point do you start thinking about the turn and how strong that turn may be relative to the other peer set companies?
Keith Oden: Your math is correct. We were slightly below the peer set in ‘09. Guidance for below the average, by the way, not below the bottom, the average of the peer set. 2010, we’re again slightly below the average of the peer set. We got a bunch of people that are worse numbers than we are and a couple of people that have better numbers than we have for 2010. But if you take a higher numbers at a 7% down NOI, one of the advantages of doing this gig late in the cycle is you get to see everybody else’s numbers and compared to the peer set, the peer set is down 6% on NOI projections for 2010. We’re down 7% at the midpoint of our guidance range, so in any case, the jury on WISO versus FISL is out until 2011 because no one is going to see a recovery in 2010 based on the guidance numbers I have looked at. So go back to what I said previously. I think you will have to wait and see how it plays out in 2011 when we’re in a market that, A) is creating jobs in a meaningful amount which we think will be the case in 2011 and the impact, the disproportionate impact of where those jobs gets created, which we continue to believe will favor Camden’s markets and the effect that that will have on the operating fundamentals. And I think the truth of the matter is you’re going to have to wait until 2011 to call a victory lap on either FISL or WISO.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Right. And then I guess if we looked at it just from a cumulative compound perspective from '08 to '10, your NOI would have been down about 13%, your peer set’s down about 9%, and so the question is, is the 2011 recovery going to make up more than that difference or not if you looked at a four-year cumulative period?
Keith Oden: Again, I wouldn’t stop the clock in 2011. I think you have to go through the entire cycle of recovery, which will be 11, 12 and 13. By the way, you can go back and do the math on this, if you go back to the last two cycles and do the same math that you’re doing on a cumulative basis and we had a slight out performance on a cumulative basis, lower at the trough, higher at the peaks, but a slight out performance, so I still think that you have to look at this in the context of a cycle and recovery and we still believe that our markets are going to outperform in 11 and 12.
Ric Campo: Just to give you a sense, in 2006 we were the second best NOI growth in 2006 and the best was AIMCO, but they had a pretty tough 2005 from a comp perspective. If you look at 2006 and 2007, the WISO markets produced a total increase in NOI in '06 at 8.6% and in '07 at 5.1% for a total of 13.7% in the two years after the recession of the early part of the decade. So some of these markets came up dramatically like Arizona, for example, in 2006 Phoenix was beat up pretty bad in the last cycle, went up 16.6% in NOI in 2006. 2007 was up 3.8% in NOI, you had a 20% increase in Phoenix NOI from the snap back in the last cycle, so obviously WISO is something we have looked at a lot and talked about. When you look at why that happens, it’s because those markets have the benefit of low taxes, lots of educated people, low housing costs, and this recession has improved their competitive set relative to the markets that feed these markets like California and other markets like that, so we still think WISO makes a lot of sense.
Keith Oden: So to sum all that up, we think it’s too early to call FISL and to quote Boone Pickens, if you don’t rush the monkey, you will get a better show.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Okay. We’ll stick with that. In terms of just a follow-up, on the occupancy, just going back to maybe Rich’s question, your occupancy sequentially dipped about 90 basis points. I guess you look at the peer set, it appears as though occupancy was held better in the fourth quarter. I guess was there anything on rate where if you would have given up more on rate you would have had a more flattish occupancy or you’re really holding the line more so on rate these days?
Keith Oden: Our seasonal decline, if you go back ten years and look at over ten years, we declined about 1% from third quarter to fourth quarter, so that’s not unusual in anyway. The 92.9% absolute rate is about a percent below where we would expect to be or have been on average in the last ten years, so that’s a little bit different. The answer to the question of could you give up rate and buy occupancy? The answer is absolutely, yes. The simplest thing to do in this business is to get occupancy if you’re willing to do that at any price, you can make that happen immediately, but you ultimately pay a significant price for it down the road as you’re stuck with those leases for 12 months. I always tell the simple way to think of it is this. If we collectively were to do something as stupid as put out as edict that said that every community manager who is not 96% occupied 30 days from today is going to be terminated, our portfolio would be 97% -- and with no constraints, do what you need to do to get there, our portfolio would end up at 97% occupied and we may have given away 20% of rent that we didn’t have to. So it’s the easiest thing in the world to say, I’m going to hit an occupancy target irrespective of what I have to do on price. I am not suggesting any of our competitors did that, I am just saying that that’s not the way we look at it. We would prefer to manage our occupancy by making small adjustments to rent in consideration of all the things that are going on in the submarket and the fact that we are 100 basis points below our competitors on the fourth quarter we can live with that as long as we’re doing the right things and maintaining our rent roll appropriately because ultimately we’re going to get that occupancy back, it’s just a matter of over what period of time. It’s a different story on rental rates in a challenged market, but we’ll get the occupancy back.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Great, thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Our last question comes from Michael Levy of Macquarie.
Michael Levy – Macquarie: My questions actually were answered. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the speakers for any closing remarks.
Ric Campo: We appreciate your being on the call and we will talk to you at the next call or if not before at some of these conferences. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good Morning and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Third Quarter 2009 Earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan. Ms. Callahan, please go ahead. 
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them.  As a reminder, Camden's complete Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Release is available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at Camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which may be discussed on this call.  Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden's chairman and chief executive officer, Keith Oden president, and Dennis Steen, chief financial officer.  Because there are several earnings calls being hosted today, including another multi-family company at 1:00 pm Eastern, we will limit the time for this call to one hour. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we'd be happy to respond to additional questions offline after the call concludes. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Rick Campo. 
Rick Campo: Thanks, Kim, and good morning. As Billy Joel points out on our conference music, if that's moving up, then I'm moving out. Well clearly, he was talking about the housing bust based on failed government policies at moving the national home ownership rate up.  Over two million people have taken his advice and moved out of home ownership and into apartments, taking the home ownership rate down from 69% to 67.4%.  Our operating results for the quarter were in line with our expectations, with same property net operating income declining 7% for the third quarter over last year. Year-to-date, same property net operating income declined 6.2% over last year.  If someone had told me that we would have lost nearly eight million jobs and had an unemployment rate pushing 10% and that our properties and our industry in general would have performed as well as it has, I would have thought they were crazy.  Clearly, multi-family demand has been reduced by the employment losses but there are three countervailing trends that helped our industry. First, the reduction of the home ownership rate by 1.8 percentage points has created two million new renters.  Some believe that the home ownership rate will fall to pre-government programs, to around 64% to 65%, potentially creating another 3.1 million renters. In the last cycle, we had people moving out to buy homes who really couldn't afford their apartment rents. That number peaked at 24%. Now we're about 13%, 14%.  The second biggest difference in this cycle versus the last one is that multi-family supply peaked at the beginning of the downturn. In this cycle, multi-family supply was moderate going into the downturn. Multi-family developers were crowded out by home builders who could pay more for land. Construction costs increased faster than rental rates, so getting development yields to work was very difficult.  New supply will likely hit World War II levels or post World War II levels, in term of low supply as a result of lack of equity and debt in the market and I'll talk about a little bit more in a minute. Eighty five percent of the new apartment starts historically has been produced by merchant builders. That model is dead for the foreseeable future.  The third biggest difference in this cycle is that demographics are better. They're on our side. The baby boom echo is in full swing. The 18 to 24-year-old age cohort grows annually for the next six years, peaking at more than 60 million people. Eighty five percent of these folks rent.  These major influences on our business will set up a strong recovery in rents and occupancy when job growth resumes, the key is when does job growth resume, obviously.  Let us talk a little bit about WISO, since it's a big topic these days. For those of you who haven't got into the WISO discussion yet, WISO is weakest in, strongest out. The idea of WISO is about job growth, which markets get job growth first.  Our portfolio has been built on the premise that apartment demand is driven by job growth. The growth markets, before this recession, will be the job generators post-recession. Job growth markets will grow again because they are pro-business. They have a low cost of doing business. They have young, educated workforces.  They have affordable housing. Clearly the housing bust has given them even a more competitive advantage in that regard at this point and they have good weather. One of the things that we've have always enjoyed debating is this concept between barrier and non-barrier markets. Some of our analysts call these supply constrained versus non-constrained markets.  Well, I've got to tell you, in the next five years plus, all markets are going to be supply constrained. So I think the idea of being in the growth markets where jobs are going to come back first and the idea that all markets are going to be supply constrained is a pretty good position to be.  So let me talk a little bit about, just give you an example of sort of what's happened in the markets and use Houston as an example. In the ten years after the big Houston bust in the early 80s, there were nine properties built per year between 1985 and 1995 or a total of 2,600 units a year.  Between 2000, the last ten years, there's been 40 properties built a year or an average of 12,000 units.  The projections going forward is somewhere back to the 80s through 90s number of about 10 to 11 properties a year. I actually think that's going to be lower than that.  In the next five years, Houston's supposed to add 500,000 new people. In the next ten years, 1,000,000 people. So you have a very interesting situation setting up where you have supply constraints because of the financial markets and the equity markets.  The merchant builder market is basically dead and will be dead for a long time. And what's going to happen is that when growth comes back to these markets, you're going to have a housing shortage. Now the key ultimate issue is when does that happen. What's going to happen in 2010, 2011?  Obviously, none of us know that. We're positioned well for the future and we like where we are and we're going to continue to be in these markets. I want to take this opportunity to thank all the Camden people in the field and at the corporate office who have been doing a great job managing expenses and managing through this complicated time. They provide living excellence to our residents and our customers.  At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Oden. 
Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. My one-word description for this quarter would be uneventful, which in this environment is probably a good thing. We hit the midpoint of our FFO guidance of $0.70 per share for the quarter and we are reconfirming that we still expect to achieve the midpoint of our original same store NOI guidance of down 6% as we wrap up 2009.  There were no material unknown pluses or minuses for the quarter, so in a word, uneventful. As you would expect from our quarterly results and reconfirmed guidance, little has happened since our last call that would change our view of the multi-family operating environments. As such, my prepared remarks today will be brief to allow more time for Q&A to address your specific questions.  At the end of the third quarter, we were right in line with the plan for our overall portfolio. Four of our six operating regions were actually above plan and two were below plan. Our Texas markets, D.C. Metro, Florida, Denver and Atlanta are holding on to better than planned results and those are being offset by worst than planned results in Las Vegas, Phoenix and California.  Traffic levels actually improved relative to the second quarter, with a quarter-over-quarter decline of 5% in the third quarter versus a 10% decline in the second quarter. Our in-place rents continue to trend downward. Year-to-date we are down roughly 3%, reflecting the continued pressure on new lease rates, which are roughly 7% below in-place rents.  Renewals continue to be a relative bright spot. Our renewal leases remain higher than in-place rents by 3% and higher than new leases by roughly 9%. In this respect, our aggressive lease renewal program has certainly paid off. Not only are we renewing leases at higher rates than new leases, we are renewing a higher percentage than in previous years.  Year-to-date our turnover rate is down six percentage points from last year. Our occupancy rate fell .5% from the second quarter to 93.7%. We continue to adjust our revenue management system's occupancy targets to balance occupancy and rate tradeoffs in these most volatile markets.  Going into the downturn, our occupancy targets had been set at 96%, roughly 1% above our desired occupancy level. As we discussed last quarter, we had adjusted the target downward to combat market pressures.  At the beginning of the third quarter, the targets were actually set at about 94% on average, so it's not surprising that our occupancy rates dropped in the quarter. Since quarter end we've tweaked the occupancy targets back up closer to the 95% on average range.  Obviously, we'd prefer to operate closer to our optimal level of 95%, but with many of our private market competitors in a lease at any cost mode, there's a point beyond which chasing occupancy through rate reductions is counterproductive.  Bank store results for the quarter were basically in line with our expectations. Revenues fell 4.5% on average, with the weakest results in Las Vegas, Charlotte and Phoenix. D.C. Metro and Houston showed relative strength with very slight decreases.  Offsetting the revenue decline, expenses fell by 0.6% in the quarter. The savings were primarily from lower property taxes, utility costs and across the board expense control discipline by our onsite teams. We expect the expense savings to continue into the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our lower expense guidance for the full year.  It looks as if the first time home purchase credit may have bitten us a little bit in the third quarter as move outs to buy homes moved up to 13.8% from our all-time low of 10.9% in the first quarter. This level is still well below the long term average of 17%, but it's certainly something that bears watching.  Our resident's financial condition appears to have improved slightly in the quarter as a percentage of skips and evictions declined again and remain well below their peak that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Also, our bad debt expense remains below plan for the year at less than 0.8%.  Before I turn the call over to Dennis, I want to acknowledge the incredible job our onsite teams are doing. Although the operating environment in most of our markets is far tougher than anything we modeled in developing the budgets for this year. The goal of achieving our original same-store budgets for the year is still well within reach.  We've certainly done a great job of coping with the chaos. The marathon that has been 2009 is almost over. Let finish strong and we'll see you soon. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our chief financial officer. 
Dennis Steen: Thanks Keith. My comments this morning on our quarter results will be brief as our third quarter of 2009 operating performance was in line with our expectations and we had no unusual or nonrecurring transactions in the quarter.  We reported funds from operations for the third quarter of 2009 of $48.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in line with the midpoint of our prior quarterly guidance range of $0.67 to $0.73 per share and $0.01 per share above first call consensus of $0.59 per share.  All components of income and expense for the third quarter were generally in line with our expectations. We continue to make significant progress towards the completion and stabilization of our current development pipeline.  For our on balance sheet development pipeline, we reached stabilization at three communities during the quarter, Camden Potomac Yard and Camden Summerfield in Metro D.C. and Camden Whispering Oaks in Houston, Texas.  This leaves only three communities in our remaining on balance sheet pipeline, all of which are currently in lease-up. And in Orange Court, in Orlando, and Camden Dulles Station in Oak Hill Virginia, have completed construction and are 93% and 81% leased, respectively. And the third community, Camden Travis Street in Houston opened in October and is expected to stabilize in the third quarter of 2010.  For our nonconsolidated joint venture development pipeline, we reached stabilization at Camden College Park in College Park, Maryland in the third quarter. This leaves only three joint venture communities under development.  Two of these communities, Camden Amber Oaks in Austin and Braeswood Place in Houston have completed construction and are 74% and 52% leased respectively. The third community, Belle Meade in Houston, opened in September and is currently 20% leased and expected to stabilize in the third quarter of 2010.  With only Camden Travis Street and Belle Meade still under construction, we have less than $10 million in anticipated funding requirements for our active development projects, all of which will be funded with existing construction loans.  Moving on to capital activities and our liquidity position, during the first half of 2009, we made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet by raising $692 million in new debt and equity capital, using the proceeds to pay down all balances outstanding on or $600 million line of credit and to repurchase near term debt maturates.  We began the third quarter of 2009 with $158 million in cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. In July, we used $82 million of this cash to retire our 4.7% senior unsecured notes, which matured on July 15. We had no other maturities or no new financing transactions during the third quarter.  As a result, at September 30, we had approximately $82 million in cash and short term investments on our balance sheet, no remaining debt maturities for the balance of 2009, no significant funding requirements for development activities and full availability under our $600 million line of credit.  Additionally, debt maturities for 2010 totaled approximately $137 million, all of which can be funded with our existing liquidity. One other item of note, in October we exercised our option to extend the maturity date of our line of credit for one additional year. Our $600 million line of credit now matures in January of 2011.  We are currently in dialogue with our lenders regarding a new line of credit and will likely commence a formal process in early 2010. Based on our discussions, we believe that if we were to negotiate a new line of credit today, our borrowing rates would be approximately 225 to 275 basis points over LIBOR.  We are encouraged to hear from our lenders that the credit environment continues to improve every day. As we move close to a formal process, we will provide more details. Moving on to earnings guidance, we expect fourth quarter 2009 FFO of $0.69 to $0.73 per diluted share, resulting in a full year 2009 FFO of $2.97 to $3.01 per share, with a midpoint of $2.99 per share.  The midpoint of our full year guidance represents a $0.01 per share improvement from the midpoint of our prior full year guidance of $2.98 per share. The $0.01 per share improvement is due to a reduction in property operating expenses due to lower than anticipated real estate tax expense resulting primarily from successful process of real estate values and lower than anticipated tax rates for our Florida and Texas communities.  We have also updated our full year same property guidance. We have narrowed our projected 2009 full year same property NOI declined range to 5.5% to 6.5% down, keeping the midpoint at a decline of 6%, which was the midpoint of our original guidance we issued in the first quarter of 2009.  Our revised NOI guidance range is based upon full year 2009 same property revenue decline between 2.75% and 3.25% and same property expense growth now between 1.75% and 2.25%. At the midpoint of 2.0%, our expected same property expense growth for 2009 is 3.6% below our original guidance we issued in the first quarter of 2009.  This decline is primarily due to lower than anticipated real estate tax expense, resulting from successful process or real estate values and lower than anticipated tax rates for our Florida and Texas communities, favorable variances in utility expense, due to lower natural gas and electricity rates and our communities continued focus on controlling costs and reducing discretionary spending.  As I previously mentioned, for the fourth quarter of 2009, we expect projected FFO per diluted share within the range of $0.69 to $0.73 per diluted share. The midpoint of $0.71 per share represents a $0.01 per share improvement from the third quarter 2009.  The $0.01 per share improvement is primarily due to two items. First a $0.07 per share projected increase in FFO due to lower property operating expenses, resulting from our expected seasonal decline in utility and repair and maintenance expense in the cooler months of the fourth quarter, the lower real estate tax expense related to our Texas and Florida communities and lower incentive compensation costs due to the expected seasonal decline in leasing activity in the fourth quarter.  The $0.07 increase is being offset by a $0.06 per share projected decrease in FFO due to lower property revenues due to our expected seasonal decline in occupancy in the fourth quarter and the continued re-pricing of new rents to market rates across our portfolio. Projected non-property income and all categories of other expenses including interest expense for the fourth quarter will be comparable to third quarter amounts.  At this time, I'll open the call up to questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Dave Bragg – ISI.
David Bragg – ISI Group:  Just wanted to get your thoughts on cap rates. I believe last quarter, Keith, you spoke about a potential to see a market clearing price especially in the Phoenix's and Vegas' of the world over the next few quarters. Since then we've seen some data points out of some stronger markets like DC that have been, perhaps, lower than expected. Is there a widening of the spread that's occurring between the stressed and non-stressed markets?  
Rick Campo:  Dave, it's Rick. You know, I don't think so. I think what's happening is over the last 60 days cap rates have tightened and there are two things driving that. One is there's a lack of product in the market. In the average multi-family, and this is in our markets, the average multi-family transaction volume over the last four years before the recession was about $95 billion and this year so far it's been about $6 billion of transactions, so very limited supply of product.  That has been sort of offset by a fairly robust demand for product that is coming out of what we call country club money and maybe private REITs and those sort of groups, and those people have been driven by yield.  And what's happened is, is that most sort of decent properties have had anywhere from 20 to 30 bids and when you look at the economics of buying between say a 6 and a 7 cap rate and financing it at 5.25% to 5.50% Freddie or Fannie rate, the equity return is pretty robust.  At the high end of that range you're getting 9% return on equity or higher, and at the low end of the range you're getting probably 7%, 7.50%. So given that a lot of money markets are paying 0.4%, I know on our $82 million of cash we're getting a robust 0.4%.  So that has driven a lot of capital into the multi-family market and I think with the backdrop of very good fundamentals from a supply and demand perspective looking out into 11, 12 and 13. So with the limited supply in the economics I went through it doesn't surprise me the cap rates were compressed.  And I don't think that there's a wide gap between – I have heard that some sub 6 cap rates in really high quality properties in D.C. In Dallas we have sub 6 cap rates as well in uptown. If you go into the more secondary markets and into the hinterlands you can get 7, 7.50, 8.  You can also buy really, really horrible products that I don't think any of the public REITs ever want to buy or own at higher than that. So there is a differentiation in the product side and locational side, but high quality products in any major market are pretty tight and there's not a big differentiation between D.C. and Phoenix. For example, if it's a Scottsdale type, really first class product, it's probably going to trade close to 6.
David Bragg – ISI Group: Just one follow-up on that, given the lack of supply on the market now, are you seeing more products being brought to market currently to respond to that demand and can you just update us on potential opportunities that you see out there in the fund? Thanks.
Rick Campo: Well I think as the pension funds do mark to markets and get there asset values right on their books you're going to start seeing more properties come to market I would think. I think it just takes sort of time for the private market to wake up to the rationale that they had a margin call and they've got to pay it.  And that's going to take some time and it maybe middle of next year before you start getting a lot of that come out. I think part of the issue that keeps a lot of, sort of, let's say, new development product out of the market that is in short-term hands is that the banks are just not pushing borrowers to refinance deals that may be out of balance from their loan perspective.  They sort of have the installment plan, which is push it out as far as you can and why take a borrower down when there's no really good market today, so there's a lot of that going on. I suspect that in having lots of conversations with borrowers and with lenders, that as the recovery unfolds and as banking profits increase, it'll be a regulatory driven thing.  And as the regulators start pushing the banks to push some of this product out it'll start coming out. And I think it takes two or three or four quarters of strong bankerings to push them to the point where they will actually release inventory.  There's a lot of companies that need to be restructured and banks that need to move product off their books. I got to believe that the $600 billion of multi-family debt that comes due in the next three years, that there will be opportunity.  I think that the opportunity is not going to be fire sale opportunity. It's going to be solid cash flow, solid properties, a positive spread to your underlying debt costs and decent cash-on-cash returns to your equity in the 7.00% to 8.00%, but it's not going to be the market like it was in the RTC days where you could buy 10%, 11% cash-on-cash return. That's not going to happen. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Rob Stevenson – Fox-Pitt Kelton.
Rob Stevenson – Fox-Pitt Kelton:  Keith, can you talk a little bit about the strategy that you guys have with respect to the second time a lease will renew during the downturn? I mean, you guys have been successful at sort of, renewing leases at sort of flattish rates.  But when you're going to do that the first time and it's a $50 to $70 a month gap that somebody might save by moving to another community, yes that's not a lot of money and it's the cost of moving and changing your cable and all that other stuff. It's too big of a hassle for that.  But once you get to the second time and that starts to snowball and you got two sort times to mark the market, what are you seeing on the early second time renewals and are you guys proactively taking leases down slightly rather than trying to renew them a second time at flat?
Keith Oden:  Yes Rob, actually in five of our markets, which would be Phoenix, Las Vegas, Tampa, Orlando and Northern Virginia, we are in most cases in the third renewal. Keep in mind we started feeling the effects of the housing debacle really in the second quarter of '07 and so really in '07. We've now been through '08 and '09.  But the strategy is really no different. It's being incredibly proactive on renewals. Get out way ahead of it. We contact our residents 90 to 120 days before their lease expires. We have a very detail-specific program for handling our renewals. We've adjusted our commission rates to reflect the importance of renewals with our onsite staff, so there's a whole lot of things around that.  The question is really not the time or the number of rolls that you have. It's the absolute gap between what new leases are and what your renewals are.  And I said, on our last conference call that in our world, with average leases in the low 900s, if that number got to be greater than 10% it would cause a fair amount of concern, because we have, obviously in a revenue management world, there's great visibility from our embedded rental base and our customers as to what current market rents are on not just theoretical alternative apartments, but actual alternative apartments.  So it's something that we are concerned about but so far so good. Our renewal rates, if you look at where we're renewing leases, we're only down very slightly from the beginning of the year where as our new lease rates we're down 7% to 8% from where we were at the beginning of the year, so it is something that we are aware of but so far so good.  And the key is really in execution and knowing that within a certain band our residents are being incredibly well taken care of. They have a great customer experience and right now they're still minus [inaudible] the cost of all the moving and headaches associated with it. It still makes economic sense for them to renew their lease. 
Rob Stevenson – Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay. And then as a follow up, Rick is there anything on your books that you guys could see starting development-wise in the next six or so months? And what's the sort of key one or two things that you're sort of looking at to judge whether or not you'll starting anything in the early part of 2010?
Rick Campo:  Well, I would say just generally that it's not going to be in the early part of 2010 or this quarter. You know what we do is we will continue to monitor our development deals, and when I say monitor, we're continuing to work on them, making sure that our entitlements continue to be in place.  And we actually have been negotiating incentives from the cities who want to see these developments built and we've been able to negotiate tax incentives and other things to actually improve the yields during this sort of hiatus in development.  But what we will be doing and we do this generally every quarter but lately it's been pretty much every six months, we will be evaluating between now and the end of the year all of our development properties, looking at existing rents, re-doing the construction numbers and trying to decide when they make sense to build.  I think fundamentally we have great sites. The development world is going to be very, very difficult to get started again and the public rates are really the only game in town in terms of being able to put new supply into the market. And so it's going to – what's going to drive us to do development in the future is going to be number one, are the going in yields reasonable yields relative to what we can buy properties for? We have to have a premium to that. There's no question about that. And then what in the economy is going to sort of give us more confidence that we do have a recovery and that when you project out into 2012 and '13, that we're going to have a robust, a multi-family business.  And I think that with that it's going to be just how – watching the economy unfold and seeing what happens to job growth and what happens to rental rates. And we'll monitor those situations before we start anything. 
Operator:  The next question comes from J.J. Habermann – Goldman Sachs. 
Jonathan Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Going back to occupancy, I know you mentioned changing the target in your lease optimization model but some markets did see a dip, I guess quarter-over-quarter. So can you give us some sense, are you losing traction there? Do you think that as you look at to 2010 that rate is just going to become more of the – you're going to see more pressure on rates as competition intensifies as you mentioned? 
Rick Campo: Well, Jay, in every market, it's a balancing act and clearly in a market like Las Vegas where we saw many of our competitors – you can drive around now and see two months free signs fairly commonly. Our private market third party-managed absentee ownership competitors which is still the preponderance of the people we compete with, have fairly nonexistent discipline when it comes to pricing relative to occupancy.  And we'll do almost anything to maintain – try to maintain a 94% or 95% occupied condition because that's the one thing that everyone, no matter where you sit and evaluate data, it's the one thing you can immediately understand and get your hands around.  So there's a great temptation by our private market competitors to use price as the only mechanism for balancing – for maintaining their occupancy. Well, there's a point at which it doesn't matter what revenue management system you're using, there's – or none at all. There is a point at which chasing market share if it means that you're absolutely embedding rental rates that you don't think make any sense 12 to 15 months out, it just doesn't make any sense to do. And so in those markets, for example in Las Vegas where we in this quarter saw some really silly pricing strategies, at least from our perspective, from our competitors, we're just not going to do that. And part of it is is you have to adjust the targets in the model so that – the model hates vacancy, the number one weighted factor in the model.  But at the same time, you have use that model as a tool and it's a great guidepost for what's going on in the marketplace. But on top of all of that is just good operating discretion. And we are currently, I mean in markets like Las Vegas we overrode roughly 25% of all price recommendations in the quarter because the model, again, was reacting to competitor's occupancy and their pricing that is the most visible thing to get your hands on.  So going into next year, I think as we continue to see lease rates roll down which we have seen all this year, I think that we've been pretty clear about we think that 2010, at least the early part of it, is going to be – certainly going to be a continuation of the trajectory that we've been on to this point.  And we will continue to have to find that balance point. We're in the fourth quarter historically – between third and fourth quarter, we experience a 0.6% decline in occupancy just for seasonal factors. It's been that way for 15 years, so it certainly wouldn't be a surprise to see our occupancy tick down from current levels.  We certainly think that we'll be able to maintain, which 93.8 maybe it ticks down into the low 93s. We're in the low to mid 93s as we sit here today. So it wouldn't shock me to see that kind of a number for the fourth quarter of next year. And then going into 2010 as we put our plans together, we're going to be mindful of the fact that we're still in some really challenged markets and we're going to continue to try to find that balance point that maximizes our revenues. 
Jonathan Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Can you give us a sense too – I know speaking of WISO can you give us a sense of which of your markets you expect to be strongest perhaps in job growth over the next 12 to 18 months? And also maybe some comments just on Dallas, this most recent quarter. 
Rick Campo: In terms of job growth for 2010?
Jonathan Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Yes, in which markets do you think you're going to see the most job growth over the next 12 to 18 months? 
Rick Campo: I think that we're still probably in – at least for the next nine months, we're talking about which – probably for the next six months into 2010 we're talking about which ones will have the least negative numbers. The last monthly number was what, 263 down? I think that there are a few braves souls out there that are saying that employment could be slightly positive in the first quarter but I think those are few and far between.  Most consensus views that I have looked at played it sometime in the second quarter possibly we get the first positive print upward on job growth. It takes a little while for that to work its way through into our metrics, so I mean I think the latter part of '10, you could start to see positive job growth.  And our point in WISO is really not – it doesn't presuppose a time certain for that to happen. Our point is simply that you're going to have to – everybody has to have their own view of when job growth occurs. Our point is simply that when it does occur, it is likely to occur disproportionately in our 15 markets. 
Keith Oden:  The way I would sort of put it is that when you look at some of the industry analysts out there like Ron Witten and others who project revenue growth and they based that based on employment growth in a moderate recovery and not a major V shape up, up and away kind of scenario.  The markets that would be on that list would be Phoenix, Orlando, Houston, Dallas, Austin. Tampa is probably behind a little bit on that but it's the sort of the usual suspects on growth. And it's all about what their economy is made up of.  There is a lot people who go well, yes, but all those markets grew because of the housing bubble. But if you take an Orlando for example, in Orlando, the total construction workforce in Orlando is 6.7% of the workforce. In Florida it's 6.6%.  When you look at Orlando's job losses, there – through the first half of the year they lost roughly 18% of their construction jobs but the construction jobs are not what's driving Orlando's market. Disney has 62,000 employees there. You got all the restaurants and Walmart and you've got – those are the largest employers.  And its leisure business and they've got Defense and they got health care and they've got a lot of other good things that ultimately when the economy comes back the people want to live in Orlando, and they have a low, low tax base. They have no sale income tax. All these things that have driven these markets for the last 20 years are going to drive them in the future. It's not going to be new house construction or apartment construction. It's going to be just good old job growth as a result – as it relates to services and business expansion. Now if we all believe that's never going to happen in our lifetimes again, then we'd better do something real different than try to make investments obviously.  The second part of your question was, was Dallas in the quarter? Dallas on our projections is currently slated to see in 2009 about 57,000 employment loss and a lot of that is back-end loaded. The first two quarters actually weren't that bad in Dallas. So we know we're seeing the job loss bug really hit Dallas for the first time in any meaningful way.  And the second part of that is, is that we've got multi-family completions in Dallas of roughly 15,000 apartments in 2009, which is roughly the same number that completions in Houston, so, those were the two Dallas Houston probably the last two markets standing where merchant builders could get deals financed and get them into the pipeline. So we're working through supply in both of those markets at a time when the job loss bug is really finally caught up to the Texas markets.
Rick Campo: Just on the point quickly, I had lunch with the Trammel Crow Partner in Houston yesterday, and he started 22 projects in Houston and Dallas in the last 18 months and actually maybe 8 or 9 months ago from that and today he will start zero projects for the foreseeable future.  And he thinks maybe five years before they get back to building anything and they're in total asset management mode and sort of restructure mode. So that merchant builder, just one merchant builder accounted for 22 projects in these markets and they are totally out of the market and they won't be in the market any time soon.
Jonathan Habermann – Goldman Sachs: And just a strategy question for Rick, I mean just to that point, do you think that it makes sense to raise capital today in anticipation of that distress that you highlighted?
Rick Campo: We already did. We raised capital in May, sold common stocks to position. We also have pretty much an unfunded billion dollar acquisition fund with our institutional partners. So, I don't think you, with $82 million sitting on your balance sheet today, to raise more capital and put it in cash at such a huge negative spread to the cost of funds doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  But I will tell you that if an opportunity came along and we had the ability to raise funds for a specific deal, then we would absolutely be doing that.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill & Partners: I just want to go to your condo background. What's your take on the Corus trade? What do you think the returns are like there?
Rick Campo: I guess the Corus trade when you think about returns first of all you have to think about a non-interest 50%, non-recourse, non-interest bearing loan from the government. That's pretty value added oriented, right? If I could go to a bank and get a $2.5 billion non-recourse, non-interest bearing loan for seven years I might have a pretty good shot at making a good return. And then so I think, I thought the Corus deal was an awesome trade for Starwood. I think you're going to make a lot of money with it. And I think the government is smart in what they're doing too because there of, I think, the 60% partner with Starwood. So Starwood only put in like 550 million and then the government put 60% more in which, I guess, equate to about a billion or maybe 600 million or 700 million.  And so they not in a dump mode at all, they're in a hold, let's do this rationally. Let's make sure that they don't to what the RTC did. I mean if you think about what the government did in the RTC days, there was no capital and they had a no reserve auction with very few people.  And what that leads to is massive price reductions and massive dislocation and there was billions of dollars made in that time frame as a result of the government action. Today I think the government's really smart doing that because you're not going to have a lot of Corus assets being sort of thrown into the market at really low prices.  What their total returns will be will clearly depend upon how the recovery comes out and how well they do in terms of managing that asset base. But I got to believe with no carrying costs to your debt and having basically 50% free money, they had to do really well. 
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Well hopefully you guys can get similar financing on some of your future deals.
Rick Campo: That would be nice.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Along those lines, Dennis what are your thoughts on where unsecured is for 10-year for you guys and then also where you think you would find that convert pricing?
Rick Campo: We haven't looked at converts pricing, so I can't give you an update on that one. But from a 10-year, we're getting indications from several of our bankers that we would price somewhere about 300 over. So for a 10-year all in it would be about 6.5 and for a five year, based upon the treasury at about 5.5.
Alexander Goldfarb – Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Okay.
Rick Campo: Updated pricing on the converts, I don't want to give you that.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Toti – Citigroup.
David Toti – Citigroup: Hi, everybody, Michael's here with me as well. Rick, a question from you relative to some of the comments you made earlier about move outs to housing and it looks like the government stimulus could be extended. What's your view on the impact of that program? It seems to be mounting across the board in terms of being a negative force in the multi-family space and what's your view in 2010 as to the momentum of that effort by the government?
Keith Oden: Yes, this is Keith. I think that the tick-up that we saw if you look at progression of move outs to buy houses from the first quarter it was 10.9, went to 12.6 in the second quarter. We were at 13.8 this quarter. And while that's an interesting tick-up, our long-term average move outs to buy homes is in the 17% range. At the peak it was 24%.  So if you put that in perspective over the last 15 years this is still really, we're still getting a lift at the margins from the current level of move outs to buy homes. Now there's a lot of other crosswinds out there that we all know about, but if you just isolate that one, it really is not a big part of the picture.  The other thing that's kind of interesting is when you look at it, if you look at it at the market level, three of the lowest move out to purchase home data points that we got in the third quarter were in Florida, Las Vegas and California. Those are the three lowest. It's 10.9% in Florida, 11.9% in Vegas, 8.4% in California.  So if you think about the – it just doesn't correlate very well with the anecdotal evidence of there's tons of all these houses in the foreclosure pipeline and that's what's driving people to move out and buy homes. The tick-up in the real big spikes that we saw in the move outs to buy homes were in markets that really have not, would be on no one's list of really trouble from a housing inventory standpoint.  Denver was at 24.7%, Raleigh, North Carolina was at 23%, so it's counterintuitive but it's consistent with what we've been saying all along is that the story in these markets of our performance and the rental declines is about employment and really not about this sort of shadow housing supply that everybody seems to fret so much about. I still think it's an employment question.
David Toti – Citigroup: Are you guys doing anything to combat aggressive homebuilders and brokers that are targeting your tenants specifically? There's been lots of reports about increasing efforts on some of the larger apartment complexes around the country.
Keith Oden: No, you really can't do that. And when you get down to it, I'll just add to the issue here into the discussion about home ownership. When you get down to it, people have to have a down payment now. They have to have credit. Even with the $8,000 first time credit they were giving people, they actually have to have some credit to get the debt.  And there's a lot of people that are over-leveraged and that shouldn't be buying homes, that aren't buying homes that bought homes last time. They're going to be renters. So we're not worried about all the sudden the people going out and saying, "Oh my God, I got to go buy a house because I'm going to make a gazillion dollars on houses again, because the market, consumer psychology just takes a long time to change. And I don't think if you did consumer studies on whether people thought it was great to buy a house now, they might think so, but it's going to take years to change that mentality again.
David Toti – Citigroup: And then my last question is just, could you provide a little color on what's happening in Phoenix? I'm not sure if you mentioned that. Just in terms of on the ground, that seems to be kind of chronically weak.
Keith Oden: Phoenix continues to be one of our most challenged markets. It's below plan. Year-over-year, it's still near the bottom of the pack in terms of NOI growth, down 13.4% for the year-to date. And it's still in our portfolio the worst performing market. So not only worst performing of all of our 15, it's the worst performing to plan. So any way you look at it, Phoenix is a real challenged scenario for us.  But again, if you go back to what's the underlying cause of what's going on in Phoenix. We have 2009 job losses forecast for this year alone at 116,000 jobs lost in Phoenix. In 2008, that number was, at the midpoint, was of our three data sources was 90,000. So you're talking about almost 200,000 jobs lost in Phoenix in a two-year timeframe.  And again, in our world, if I didn't know about anything else going on with housing or shadow supply or any of these other crosswinds, that kind of job loss in a market like Phoenix would be sufficient for me to say, "Yes, I get it."  I mean, we're going to be down 13%, 14% NOI growth over the course of, or if you go back to pick up last year, close to 20% NOI growth in the Phoenix market. So that's going to continue to be a challenge. and it will be until the job and the employment situation turns around nationally and in particular in our markets.
Rick Campo: The key thing though I would just add is that in Ron Witten's analysis for revenue growth in 2011, Phoenix is the number one market in America, with revenue growth of 10.2%, not our numbers, his numbers.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Hey, Rich here with Ron Witten.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: What are the chances and would you be willing to, you have this fund, to never fully put the entire buying power to work in this environment?
Rick Campo: Given that we're at 20% of the fund and it's our money, too, we'll invest the fund based on what we want to invest our money in, and if we don't think that the investment environment is reasonable, we won't invest the money.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So as you see it right now, what do you think? What are the prospects of putting the entire fund to work?
Rick Campo: I think they're very good. I think that based on the conversations that we're having with a lot of different folks, there's a lot of sort of constipation in the market right now, but I think they're going to get some religion next year and we're going to start having more transaction volume and be able to place our capital at reasonable returns.
Keith Oden: Rich, the good news for our institutional partner and this is part of our conversations when we were putting the fund together is that whether we put that capital to work or not today, tomorrow, a year from now, the fees associated with putting that capital to work are not a meaningful part of our world, whereas with most private market sponsors, it is their world., so just a little bit different perspective.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: And last quick question so you can get another call or two in. What are you seeing in terms of IRRs on assets pricing today and what percentage of that value creation is cash flow and what percentage is terminal value?
Dennis Steen: Well, when we look at IRRs today, it's probably going to be 2/3 cash flow or maybe more and then the rest a price appreciation. When we're doing our analysis, if you look at, say you buy at a 6.5 cap rate and finance it with 5.5% Fannie Mae debt, you put in a growth rate probably pretty above trend in 2011, '12 and '13. Go back to a sort of 3% trend after that, seven-year hold with a 50 bit increase in the exit cap rate gets you about a 15 IRR, 15.5 IRR.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: You said 50 basis points cap rate and terminal?
Dennis Steen: Yes, increase a terminal 50.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michelle Ko – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Michelle Ko – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi, I was just wondering, some of your competitors are saying that they're seeing the rental rate decline or it's getting better in certain markets. Are you seeing that in any of your markets?
Rick Campo: Yes, basically D.C. metro was flat and they're outperforming plan. Houston and Dallas have kind of hung in there around flat. We had rental growth in those two markets up until this quarter, so I mean, there are signs out there that some of the markets are stabilizing.  But overall, in a portfolio like ours when you see the --for the quarter being down on revenues of 1.3% sequentially tells you that most of our rents are still rolling down. And I think, I don't know, that the folks that I have talked to or heard have conversations with, I think that's pretty consistent with their experience.  I think that some of the recent revisions in terms of guidance have actually guided to more rental rate declines in some of our competitors than what they would have seen at the beginning of the year, which tells me that they may be about to enter the worst part. But we've been dealing with this for really two and a half years.
Michelle Ko – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, and in terms of the roll down, how long do you think it would take for those renewals to roll down to the new lease rents? Is that the next six to nine months or can you give us a sense for the timing of that?
Rick Campo: Well if you look at our in place rents, they have declined every month throughout this year. So through nine months, even though they were relatively small declines, we've had a decline in every month, which tells me that at least for the next nine months, if you stop the world today and rents were flat or up, you're going to still be dealing with not being able to significantly raise your NOI or your rental portion in the next nine months.  So I mean, I think there's a tail associated with these lower rents that we're going to live with for at least some part of or through the middle of 2010.
Keith Oden: But I would say also that if you take our strategy of letting our occupancies fall and keeping our rental rates up, when the market turns, we're not going to have to raise rent to increase revenues. We'll just have to keep the street rents at where they roll down to, make new leases at that level and increase our occupancy, which will drive our revenues before our competitors who are at 95% have to raise their rents.  So, that's I think a really interesting nuance when you people get all stressed out about lower occupancy, but we're driving our occupancy low to try to maintain our revenue. I would have much rather have higher revenue at lower occupancy levels than lower revenue at higher occupancy levels because it'll allow us to really increase our revenues quicker than our competitors without raising rent.
Michelle Ko – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Also can you give us a sense for what you anticipate in terms of are there going to be further expense cuts in 2010, or do you think you would have probably anniversaried some of the expense cuts by maybe mid-'10 or somewhere thereabouts?
Keith Oden: Yes, I think the biggest opportunity that we're going to have in 2010 is in property taxes for further downward revisions on valuations. We've gotten some benefit of that this year, but most of the bulk of our re-valuations happen in 2010.  Our markets happen to be very property tax dependent for the revenue source. Property taxes make up about 27% of our total expenses, which would my guess is at the very high end of the multi-family sector because of the markets in which we operate. So to the extent we get property tax relief that everybody's going to get some of, we'll probably benefit a little bit more from that. I think that's that the biggest single area for opportunity for us in 2010.
Rick Campo: We're going to take two more questions to make sure that we stay on our promised timeframe. And each question needs to be a one-part question because we have two more people in the queue, so no three part question, next?
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: I just had a quick question about development. Given that you stopped a lot of the – you're not expecting the delivery of new projects for some time and you've been working on a number of them in the pre-development, are there any ones where you're so far along that you either have to move forward or stop capitalizing interest at this point?
Rick Campo: Well, the valuation of stopping the capitalized interest really is a function of deciding whether we're going to continue to work on the development and also where the cost is relative to the land position. So we will evaluate all of those ongoing developments in the fourth quarter.  And to the extent that we abandon a development, we would have to mark that land to market and stop capitalizing. Last year, we of course did that in the fourth quarter. I think we had a write down of like $51 million plus or minus.  We haven't made those evaluations at this point. But each quarter, we look at it and make sure that we are analyzing whether the developments are reasonable to go forward with and if there are any impairments.
Operator: At this time we show no further questions.
Rick Campo: Great, well thanks a lot. We appreciate your time and get on the other call now and we will talk to you again at the end of the quarter.
Operator: Thank you for attending, you may now disconnect. This conference has concluded.

Operator: Hello and welcome to the Camden Property Trust 2008 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of today's presentation. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kim Callahan. Ms. Callahan, you may begin.
Kim Callahan: Good morning. Thank you for joining Camden's fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2008 earnings release is available in the Investor Relation section of our website, at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which may be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Olden, President; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Rick Campo: Thank Kim and good morning. I hope everyone has taken a leave out there. Welcome to our 61st quarterly conference call that Keith Olden and I have held which since our IPO in 1993. We operated Camden as private company for 10 year before our move to the public markets. Over last 25 years we have navigated many business cycles and market conditions. I point these facts out to make a simple point, this is not our first rodeo. I will not spend a great deal of time today talking about current market conditions. I think everyone on this call could use a break from that. But I will talk about however, its how we are running our business and how we are positioned for what will be our robust recovery when these economic conditions improve. First onsite teams are focused on day-to-day operations and providing living excellence to our residence. Our support teams are focused on providing our onsite teams with workplace excellence. Our liquidity and balance sheet are strong; we have already tapped the secured markets to Fannie Mae and will continue to do so this year. Dennis, will give you more details on our capital plans later on the call. Beginning the third quarter we began right sizing our G&A, development and construction staffing levels for fewer development starts and a more difficult economy. Many of our markets entered the recession in late 2006 and early 2007. With this knowledge we took action to slower our development pipeline before many of our peers did so. We have not started a wholly owned new development since mid 2007.  Developments that were started were in joint ventures limiting our risk and lowering our capital requirements. We have just $5 million in developments spending remaining in 2009 that is not already been financed. Development will continue to be a core competency for Camden but we will not start any new projects until market conditions improve. As Chairman of the National Multi-Housing Council, I presided over our annual meetings several weeks ago. I came away with a couple of observations. 2009 will undoubtedly be a tough year for our business but opportunities for well capitalized and experienced companies will emerge We have $350 million of unfunded equity in our fund to take advantage of such opportunities, combined with 60% secured debt financing which is readily available today. We will have nearly a $1 billion of acquisition capacity to take advantage of opportunities as they emerge. Clearly, this business cycle is different from many that we have been through in last 25 years. Here is what we know. We know that new supply did not peak at the start of this downturn as has been the case in many of the others. In fact construction is ground to halt. We know that we have better rental demographics with a baby boom echo high propensity release than we had in the last three cycles. We know that renters who are good renters, but bad owners are not likely to move out to buy house anytime soon. We also know that this downturn will end just like every other one has. J.P. Morgan remember my son that any man who is aware on the future of this country will go broke. At this point I would like to turn the call over to Keith.
Keith Olden:  Thanks Rick. Consistent with prior years I am going to use my time on today's call to review the market conditions. We expect to encounter in our largest markets in 2009. I will address the markets in the order of best to worst by assigning a later grade to each one as well as give you our view as to whether the market is improving, stable or declining. Following the market overview I will provide some additional details of our fourth quarter operations and our 2009 same property guidance. Starting with an overview of Camden's markets will begin in Dallas. With initial ranking of B+ and declining outlook Dallas is our highest rated market for 2009. Although job losses of 9500 or projected that's a manageable number in a market like Dallas. The challenge in Dallas will be the 15,000 projected multifamily completions in 2009 up from 9,000 last year. The new supply and modest demand contraction will make more challenging with fairly decent 2009 in Dallas. We rate Huston in current conditions as B with a declining outlook. Similar to Dallas, Huston will lose jobs but at a manageable level of 10,000. However, an additional 15,000 new apartments on top of the 18,000 delivered in 2008 we'll reduce pricing power for all multifamily operators. Huston was our best performing market in 2008 at 5.5% NOI growth. However the job losses and supply increase will make NOI growth harder to come by in Huston this year. After a sold year of NOI growth last year, Denver will again be one of our best performers in 2009. Job losses should be in the 8000 range with only 4800 new units completed in the year. The market is stable going into 2009 and we believe it will remain, we have rate Denver a B. Our top three markets for 2009 Dallas, Huston and Denver have a common threat. Their economies are highly influenced by the energy sector. Despite the spike in oil prices in 2008 it appears to crude oil has settled back in to $40 to $50 per barrel range which is about where we were a year ago. Our forecast assumes that this trend will continue in 2009 and we will continue to support decent economic activity in those three markets. Next in Las Vegas, we rate current conditions of the C+ with a stable outlook. A sharp decline in new rental units and a job market that performed much better than expected in 2008 that left Las Vegas in reasonably good shape. Net job losses for 2009 will be in the 7000 range due to the opening and staffing of several major new casinos. In the DC metro area, we rate the current conditions a C+ with a stable outlook. Supply will increase by modest 4000 units but the job picture will deteriorate significantly from last year. From 20,000 jobs added in 2008 to a projected 20,000 job lost in 2009 the net swing of 40,000 jobs will keep this market under pressure. Even if the stimulus package is approved it's unlikely to have an meaningful impact on the job picture for 2009. Although in 2010 and 2011 things look considerably better. Likewise an Austin we rate current conditions as a C+ but with a declining outlook. Although it is the only Camden market projected to grow jobs in 2009, the 3,600 jobs will be overshadowed by the 5,000 multifamily completions. Pricing power vanished in Austin in the fourth quarter; and it is unlikely to return this year. Next in Southern California, we rate current conditions as a C with a declining outlook. The projected loss of 48,000 jobs in Orange County and 32,000 jobs in San Diego on top of the combined 58,000 jobs lost in 2008 will continue to cause challenges for multifamily in Southern California. In Raleigh we rate current conditions as a C- with a stable outlook. Although job losses will be minimal at 2,500 the supply picture is a little more troubling. 4,700 new apartments on a base inventory of 96,000 are enough to move the needle. Many of these communities are currently in lease up mode which explains the challenge in current conditions. In Orlando, we also rate current conditions as a C- with a stable outlook projected 17,000 job losses in 2009 plus 5,000 new units to be delivered set the stage for continuing challenges in Orlando. In South Florida we rate current conditions as a D with a stable outlook. Our caution on this market in last years forecast was the unsold condominium inventory well that will still be an issue for 2009 the projected 50,000 job loss between Miami and Fort Lauderdale are a bigger concern. We rated Atlanta in current conditions as a D with a stable outlook. Supplies is in better shape than it has been for many year in Atlanta, unfortunately a projected 54,000 job losses for 2009 on top of 46,000 lost in 2008 will cost some pain in this market. Next to Tampa where we rate current conditions as a D with a stable outlook similar to Orlando but with the worst jobs picture. New supply of 2300 units will get lost in a shuffle but the 26,000 job loss will not.  Charlotte is projected loss 15,000 jobs although with a turmoil in the banking sector that could turn out to be quite optimistic. In addition to mind boggling 4,000 new apartments will be delivered in 2009 add to this a current city wide occupancy of 91%. And you have a recipe for some really tough sliding hence our rating of D with a stable outlook.  Now before I get to our last and lowest rated market let me say this. Over the many years that we have been providing our market rankings, several regular attendees on our call who shall remain nameless but you know who you are Rich and Jim, I will ask is there is possible for a market to receive enough ranking. My consistent response has been to paraphrase the words of Supreme Court justices Potter Stewart regarding pornography. I said I can not define an F market but that I will know an F market when I see it. This year we have one market where we are budgeting net effective rents to decline by 7% and for NOL to down by low double digits and that most certainly meets our definition of an F market. Phoenix lost a staggering 70,000 jobs last year, and its forecast to lose an additional 20,000 this year. At 4,000 new rental units and a never ending single family foreclosures to the supply equation and you have the makings of a 10% year-over-year NOI declines, which is what we are projecting. Therefore we rate Phoenix as an F. Straining to end on a positive note, we rate the outlook as improving. It just can not get much worse. In comparing our 2009 outlook to our 2008 outlook, its not surprising that every market has a lower rating than last year. The weighted average letter grade for the portfolio moved down one full letter grade from the B to B- range in 2008 to C to C- range in 2009. The outlook condition for the portfolio moved from stable in 2008 to a modest decline in 2009. These ratings are consistent with our NOI forecast of a 6% decline at the midpoint. What is worst category, our expectation is that at some point in 2009, Camden's markets will begin to outperform the national averages. I have based this on the fact that many of our markets were very early to the job loss maybe, with Phoenix, Las Vegas, Tampa, Orlando and northern Virginia under stress since the second quarter of 2007. Based on our employment forecast for 2009 and 2010, we believe that on a relative basis, the work to the jobs performance in Camden's markets is or soon will be behind us. As employment growth reemerges, it is likely it will do so disproportionately in Camden's markets. Now, few comments about our fourth quarter results. Our sequential revenues fell in every market except Houston. The a-tenth increase in NOI resulted from some fourth quarter expense adjustments. The revenue decline was a combination of 1.3% occupancy dip and a nine-tenth percent rental rate decline. The average occupancy decline from third to fourth quarter in our portfolio over the last ten years is eight-tenth of a percent. And so the 1.3% decline was larger than normal and it was the largest decline since the 1.6% drop from third to fourth quarter in 2001. Traffic was down across the board 6% below the prior year quarter and 4% down over the prior year. The biggest drops were in Atlanta down 14% year-over-year and Austin down 17% year-over-year.  Our turnover rate declined slightly from the prior year from 64.1% to 63% though not as much as much we had anticipated. The composition of the turnover however did change appreciably. Move outs to purchased homes fell from 18% to 13.7%. Evictions and skips increased by six-tenth of a percent each and move outs due to financial reasons increased by 1.5% while residents moving back home remained flat year-over-year. Turning to our NOI guidance of 2009 we provided you with revenue and expense estimates two ways. One includes the other income from our cable TV, trash collection and utility billing amounts and revenue and expenses as we are required to report them in our financial statements and based on this methodology our revenue should decrease by in the 0.5% down to 2.5% down range. Expenses will increase in the 5% to 6.25% range. For comparability to our peers we have also provided a revenue expense growth numbers, excluding those income items. Using this methodology we expect revenue growth to be down in the 2% to 4% range and expense growth to be up in the 3.1 to 4.3 range. In either case our projected same property NOI growth for 2009 is down 4.5 to down 7.5 or down 6 at the mid point.  Finally in year where good news was hard to come by, at Camden. We recently received two extraordinary pieces of good news. First, for the fourth straight year Camden Property Trust was named as one of the best places to work in Texas with their highest ranking yet number five in the state. Second, Camden was once again named Fortune magazine list of the 100 best companies to work for with the ranking of 41 up from my ranking of 50 last year. This recognition is a gold standard of the company awards for employees satisfaction and maintaining a great workplace. To actually move up on the list, in a year of miss budgets, staff reductions, salary freezes and bonus cuts speaks volumes about the commitment our employees have to this company. Building a great franchisee is a priority for Camden whether the markets are good or bad. At this time, I would like turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Dennis Steen:  Thanks, Keith. I will begin this morning with a review of our fourth quarter results. Camden reported FFO for the fourth quarter of $10.1 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Included in these results were the following non-recurring items. $8.8 million in gains on the early retirement of debt which I will discuss further in a minute, and $51.3 million non-cash impairment charge on our announced reduction in development activities as detailed in our press release on January 26. Excluding these two non-recurring items which were not included in our prior guidance for the fourth quarter, our FFO for the fourth quarter would have been $52.6 million or $0.90 per diluted share, $0.01 per share above our prior guidance range of $0.85 to $0.89 per share. The slightly better than expected performance is primarily due to property net operating income exceeding our forecast by approximately $700,000 and $340,000 favorable variance in interest expense. The $700,000 favorable variance in property NOI is the result of $900,000 unfavorable variance in property revenues as same store revenues came in at the low end of our expectations with average occupancies and average rental rates declining 1.3% and 0.9% respectively from the third quarter. The unfavorable variance in property revenues was more than offset by $1.6 million favorable variance in property expenses reflecting the success of our cost reductions and containment measures as well as lower-than-anticipated incentive compensations and employee benefit costs. For all of 2008 same store expenses increased 4.6% over 2007 below our guidance of 4.8% to 5.2%. Excluding the expenses related to the roll out of our ancillary income initiatives Perfect Connection, our bulk cable program and Valet Waste our door-to-door trash collection program 2008 same store expenses increased just 1.6% over 2007. Excluding the impact of our ancillary income initiatives and fourth quarter 2007 favorable property tax adjustments of $1.6 million our fourth quarter 2008 expenses increased just 1.3% over fourth quarter of 2007. The $340,000 favorable variance in interest expense to our fourth quarter guidance was due to lower than anticipated rates on our floating rate debt and the positive impact of our repurchase of our unsecured senior notes during the quarter. We use availability under our unsecured line of credit to repurchase $137.8 million in unsecured senior notes which had an original maturity date in 2009 and 2010 at an effective price of 93.3%. Non-property income and the components of overhead expenses were generally inline with our expectations for the quarter. I would now like to highlight some of our recent capital market activities and discuss our liquidity positions. Over the past several quarters we have been proactive in addressing our liquidity needs. In September we closed on $380 million Fannie Mae credit facility using the proceeds for the repayment of all remaining 2008 debt maturities and to pay that all amounts then outstanding on our unsecured line of credit. In the fourth quarter of 2008 we began to focus on our 2009 and 2010 debt maturities. We used availability under our line of credit to repurchase through a tender offer and open market transactions $18.1 million or by 4.7% notes due in July of 2009 $99.6 million of our 4.375% notes due in January of 2010. And $20.1 million of our 6.75% notes due in September of 2010. Resulting in total repurchases during the quarter of $137.8 million at an average discount of 6.7% representing the yields maturity of 11.4% and resulted in a gain on repurchase of $8.8 million. These repurchases were the primary reason for the $145 million outstanding balance on our line of credit at December 31, 2008. We are currently negotiating with both GSEs on a potential move $250 million to $300 million secured debt facility that we expect to close early in the second quarter. The expected proceeds will be used to pay down balances outstanding on our unsecured line of credit and refinance 2009 debt maturities of approximately a $126 million. The GSEs are still very active in the multifamily sector with pricing for new 10 year facility estimated approximately 6% for fixed rate debt and around 4% for the initial term for floating rate debt. Looking at liquidity for 2009, we begin the year with $444 million in availability on our unsecured line of credit which after all extensions matures in 2011. As for our sources and uses of cash in 2009, we have $126 million in debt maturities as detailed on page 23 of our supplemental package. We have minimal funding requirements for development activities as all on balance sheet development activities are substantially complete and current joint venture development activities will be funded with the existing construction loans. For the purpose of our liquidity analysis we are assuming no 2009 development starts and no proceeds from asset sales. We are assuming dividend are paid in cash at the current dividend rate which results in dividends being fully covered by operating cash flows and that we complete $250 million in new agency secured debt. Based on these assumptions we expect to have over $500 million in liquidity at December 31, 2009 which will give us flexibility to meet our 2010 capital needs which consist primarily of $349 million in debt maturities. We are committed to maintaining the strong balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to weather the current uncertainty in the credit markets. I will now like to discuss our 2009 guidance. Please refer to page 26 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2009 financial outlook. We expect 2009 projected FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.45 with a midpoint of $3.30 representing $0.25 per share or 7% decline from our adjusted 2008 FFO per share of $3.55 which excludes the non-recurring 2008 impairment losses and gains on early retirement of debt. The major assumptions of components of our $0.25 per share decline in FFO at the mid point of our guidance are as follows. A $0.34 per share decline in FFO related to the performance of our same-store portfolio, as Keith previously discussed we are expecting negative same store NOI performance of 4.5% to 7.5%. A $0.05 per share decline in FFO related to non-property income net which includes fee and asset management income net of expenses and interest in other income. The decline in this category is due to lower levels of third party development and construction fees and lower interest income on our mezzanine portfolio due to lower rates and balances. A $0.02 per share decline in FFO related to $1 million severance charge to be reported in the first quarter of 2009 on our announced reduction and construction and development staffs. These three negatives will be partially offset by the following positives. A $0.06 per share increase in FFO related to additional accretion from our development activities. As the $9 million to $10 million or $0.16 per share accretion from development stabilized in 2008 and developments currently under lease up more than offsets the $6 million or $0.10 per share dilution from the stopping of capitalization of interest in property taxes on the five land parcels for which we have recently announced that we have stopped development activities. And $0.04 per share increase in FFO related to the reduction in interest expense. This decline in interest expense is primarily due to lower expected rates on our floating rate debt including the $175 million floating rate portion of our Fannie facility which recently repriced for the first six months of 2009 at an all then rate of 2.1% and the positive impact of the repurchase of our unsecured notes. These positive earnings will be partially offset by lower capitalized interest. And lastly a $0.03 per share increase in FFO related to reductions in G&A and property management expenses. Due to the reduction in staffing and additional expense control, corporate expenses for 2009 are projected to be 4% below 2008 level. For the first quarter of 2009, we expect projected FFO per diluted share to be within the range of $0.80 to $0.84. With the mid-point of $0.82 per share represented an $0.08 per share decline from the fourth quarter of 2008 adjusted FFO per diluted share of $0.90 excluding the non-recurring items I mentioned previously. This $0.08 per share decline is primarily resulted the following; lower projected first quarter same-store net operating income of approximately $3.1 million or $0.05 per share, this decline is a result of $2.2 million sequential decline in revenues due to our lower occupancies and rental rates across our markets and a $900,000 increase in expenses primarily resulting from fourth quarter 2008 favorable variances and an incentive compensation and employee benefit costs.  Secondly, we will incur additional dilution in the first quarter of 2008 from our development pipeline of $1.1 million or $0.02 per share. This is due to the significant number of units completed in the fourth quarter of 2008 and units to be completed in the first quarter of 2009, at communities under lease-up in both our on balance sheet and joint venture pipelines. As a reminder, we begin to expense all operating and interest costs related to completing the units regardless of lease status. Please refer to pages 16 and 17 of our supplemental package for the construction and lease-up status for properties in our pipelines. Third, severance cost of approximately $1 million or $0.02 per share related to staff reductions as mentioned earlier. The above three negative variances will be partially offset by a $1.4 million or $0.02 per share reduction in interest expense from lower rates on our floating rate debt to a positive impact from our fourth quarter 2008 repurchases of senior unsecured notes which had an average interest rate of 4.76% and we are funded with advances under unsecured line of credit, partially offset by a reduction in capitalized interest due to the completion of units in our development pipeline and the band limit of development efforts on five land parcels in our pre-development pipeline. At this time, I would like to open the call up to question.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
David Toti - Citigroup:  Good morning. It's David Toti here on the line. Couple of questions on your development pipeline? Can you just talk about Camden Potomac and it seems there was a slight occupancy dip there. 
Rick Campo: Sure, Camden Potomac is a good example of large project that sort of gets in its way when it strives to finish up its lease-up. You have very good absorption to start with 20 to 30 units a month and then once you get a year ended lease-up, you start having your traditional turnover and your velocity goes down generally in the 10 to 12 units a months. So it takes a lot longer to lease the bigger projects and it does the smaller ones. The Potomac also had an issue, real specific issue to the project. We had a large military corporate account that was working at the Pentagon on a special project that related to about 5% of the occupancy. And that corporate account finished their work and moved out. So, we had sort of a hole in the move out mix related to one corporate user. We think that the project is still very well positioned and we just had a little hiccup on the corporate move out. 
David Toti - Citigroup: Okay. And then also relative to the pipe line. Is there any way to quantify the impact it yields on the move out of some of the stabilization dates? 
Rick Campo: Well that’s a good question because the whole issue of what is the stabilized yield in this market is very complicated question. Is the stabilized yield based on the rent stream that is under pressure, what is stabilized today is really a hard question. I mean you could take a hard line approach and say that current market conditions remain indefinitely and then you are talking about yields and probably are down, 75 Bips from where they were before plus or minus. And I would say that just see the packing up of some of these dates, what we were doing there is simply trying to maintain decent velocity on lease-up without having to give away the store if you will, we could lease this up ahead of schedule if we just drop rents dramatically and create a market. We think it’s a better strategy to take our time in lease-up and not try to push velocity at the price of rental structure, especially when a lot of these projects are in the mid-70 lease, so we don’t want to describe rental structure for the existing residents. 
David Toti - Citigroup: Okay. And then my last question just along the lines of rental management relative to your management systems, it's obviously you held onto occupancy slightly at the expense of rent growth. What’s the next chapter of that management system? Do you start to look no occupancy at some point to keep revenue decline stable or do you still hold occupancy as the primary goal?
Keith Olden: Yes, our system, David, is really calibrated towards maintaining occupancy. The yield to our revenue management system places a huge cost on vacancy as any revenue management system should. So the model is always fighting for occupancy. Interestingly enough our occupancy at the end of the year it was at 93.3%. We are projecting write-off that for the balance of 2009 which is about a percent below where we would normally like to operate the portfolio on a stabilized basis. One of the things that we have done as a result of trends that we saw in the third and fourth quarter, where the downturn started to really accelerate, we had to go in and tweak our model to deal with things that in a normal stabilized world the revenue management model really doesn’t have to deal with. Two that are most obvious in our world are skips and evictions.  And I gave you some numbers in my prepared remarks, we used to put a little context to those, the skips and evictions both went up at sixth-tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter on a run rate basis. And that sounds like a whole lot, but if you add those two together skips and evictions are not something other than what you would normally expect to see which is a pretty stable number over long periods of time. They constitute unanticipated demand destruction and a revenue management model.  In other words our revenue management model is always looking out at 150 days to try to balance future demands and what we know is becoming available through lease explorations. Well skip or eviction is a lease exploration that happens overnight. And that is very hard to anticipate that in a revenue management model other than they just hold it constant base on history. Well with the increase in that particular metric you got 1.2% increase in immediate demand destruction as opposed to quarterly lease move outs.  So we are having to tweak our model to deal with that. We think that we had made the correct adjustments and our expectation is that we will be able to maintain our occupancy in around the 93.5% to 94% range for the year. If there is any, so the upside I think in our particular case because we went into the year about 93.3%. We have been able to maintain that for the first two months of this year, which is better than plan and both months because January and February are normally two of our lowest seasonally adjusted occupancy numbers. So, I think there is a little bit, I think we got in the head of the problem on the skips and evictions and if that continues to be the case there maybe a little bit of upside in that. 
David Toti - Citigroup: Great. Thank you for the detail.
Keith Olden: You bet.  
Operator: Your next question will come from Mr. David Bragg from Banc of America. Please go ahead, sir.
David Bragg - Banc of America: Hi, good morning.
Rick Campo:  Good morning, David.
David Bragg - Banc of America: Rick, given your role at the National multi-housing council, can you talk a little bit about the latest lobbying efforts?
Rick Campo:  Lobbying efforts with respect to?
David Bragg - Banc of America:  With respect to, recently I was reading about the mortgage assistance effort and basically excluding the GSEs or excluding the multi-family portfolio from the GSE portfolio limits?
Rick Campo:  We are defiantly in the middle of having discussions with all of the related parties in the whole debate on what happens to the GSE’s and what happens with the stimulus bill. We were successful as an industry last year sort of fighting back this tax credit for new home purchases. They originally had a $15,000 number in there that they have now and we were successful in sort of beating that back.  I think the industry is definitely well positioned, lobbying on the GSE side. I think the momentum of the stimulus package and fact that the $15,000 tax credit for home purchases came from the republican side and it was a compromise with the democrats and the senate to put it in, makes that probably a really tough thing to lobby against this point given the momentum of the bill and everything that’s going on the hill.  I think our industry believes fundamentally, I think the improvement in the single family home market is paramount to the improvement in the overall economy which helps the multi-family business as well. So, while we think it's, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to give people tax and credits to buy houses. We think mortgages rate and dealing with GSEs is probably better way to do it, I don’t think we are going to be successful in limiting that particular tax credit at this point. As far as the GSEs go, we believe that they are going to be around for long time. It's not an easy situation to fix. The multi-family part of the business is very robust they have very limited loan losses. They made a lot of money on multi-family. This last year I think Fannie Mae actually just did a pres release yesterday to talk about how they funded $35 billion multi-family loans in 2008 with very low delinquencies both Freddie and Fannie have increased their profits from multi-family in 2008. The idea of taking multi-family out of the cap is something that we are definitely pushing and make sense. If you go through the Freddie and Fannie press release it's very instructive 89% of their loans were to people that were from a partner perspective related to people at or below the medium income for their communities. So, by definition Fannie Mae continues to and Freddie Mac continue to make affordable housing available for people from a rental perspective, so we think that we are well position to continue to dialogue with Freddie and Fannie. We have broad coalition in your group it's not just multi-housing folks. We have the mortgage bank association, the national homebuilders also senior housing does a lot of Fannie Mae financing as well. So, we have a broad correlation and its working on this not just multi-housing council, but we are definitely pushing very hard and we think we will be recently successful with GSEs.
David Bragg - Banc of America: The focus on affordability that you mentioned, we did see that in press release and had not seen that in the press release from a year prior, is that certainly an increased focus for both Fannie and Freddie? 
Rick Campo: The whole idea, I think between, if we think about Freddie and Fannie's sort of charge it used to provide liquidity and stability to housing markets and they had sort of a secondary issue which was to provide affordable housing and obviously the Freddie and Fannie scenario is to keep rates low. So, that people can afford homes, the incentive finance committee plus house committees have sort of pounded on the GSEs about providing affordable housing Barnet Frank has made multiple statement that one of their main mission is to provide affordable finance to people and when you look at apartments, people think of market rate apartment is not necessarily affordable make sort of get confused about the definition of affordable. Most people think of affordable means that it's a section A housing or subsidized housing in some fashion. But I would say that future Camden's portfolio we would be probably in that zone, 80% to 90% of our properties are serving the middle income folks, workforce housing if you will, teachers police, fire fighters and those are folk and those people are at or below the medium income of most American.  So, the apartment business is all about affordable housing and that’s why I think that Freddie and Fannie, they are not going to see the whole apartments get cut out of the deal especially when you think about how much money they are making on multi-family portfolio. Freddie Mac haven’t seen their year-end numbers yet on the multi-family, but through November they had $380 million of profits built in, that had come in during the year from multi-family originations. That was up like 28% or 30% from the prior year. So, in a market where situation where you have the government trying to figure how to stop losing money, it would seem really odd for them to shut down an entity that is making money in the multi-family area and provides liquidity for affordable housing.
David Bragg - Banc of America:  Okay. That’s very interesting. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Rob Stevenson from Fox-Pitt and Kelton. Please go ahead.
Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton:  Good morning. Ric, given your comments a minute ago, has the Rental Multi-Family Housing Council tried to get a tax credit for renting, slanted towards helping working class families as a way to sort of offset some of the dilution that might impact you guys from having a single family housing tax credit?
Rick Campo:  It has definitely been brought up. But I think it’s a real difficult thing for us to put in to the mix. We get into the whole issue of how big is the proposal, how much does it cost. But the whole single-family housing discussion is one that sort of dominates and I think it is real tough situation to try to get something like that in.  I guess, from my perspective this isn’t the industry’s perspective for saving the life. I had a lot of discussions with our industry people about this. The tax credit is not all that bad the 15,000 in my view, because it will be short lived and the people who use it are going to be, not the people that were pulled out of apartments initially. Those folks that don’t have down payments, they don’t have good credit scores, they don’t have stability from a home ownership perspective, are still not going to buy houses. There is going to be credit criteria that keep folks, that really out to be renters in the rental part of the business.  The other part of the equation I think that benefits multi-family is that, if you look at what happened in the peak of the housing level, a lot of the baby boom echo kids were buying farmhouses and condos. The parents with personnel notes thinking that it was a great thing to do, so a lot of our rental demand that was coming forward in the form of baby boom echoes were actually buying properties too. We think that the baby boom echo is not going to buy speculative condos or down houses and that our demand is actually going to go up from that sector once the economy improves. So, I hope that answers the question, I just think it would be tough to get a rental credit in here. 
Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton: I mean to follow your logic, basically yes, there's not going to be little pull to people, our marginal credit out of your units, but what they will be able to pull out with the tax credit or your operation on higher quality renters that have the way with all to buy and presumably given the credit quality of the renter-base seems to be going down across the multi-family space. I mean isn't that likely there a sort of disproportionately impact too. 
Rick Campo: We have had a lot of discussion about that and I think that in a natural, when you think about the natural supply and demand aspects and the propensity of the rent versus to own, I don’t think that the tax credit is going to create a mad rush to go buy and to move out. I think the consumers sentiment is different is more fragile than just gee $15,000 go buy a house.  The people that are going to buy homes are going to buy homes, and we are fine with that. When you think about the problem we are not buying with is when you have people that really can't afford a home, buy a home and our natural renters are I think we are going to have more natural renters than we would having people move out to buy homes.  The peak moving out to buy homes, 24% of our people moved out of peak in the mid-part of the decade. If you look back into the 90s we had an average of 12% to 13% of the people moving out to buy houses. We didn’t have the baby boom, the baby boom echo dynamic at that point. And multi-family cash flows rose dramatically during that timeframe. So, I think when you get back to a more normalized economy especially when you are thinking about the supply that we are going to have, there are people that we are talking at (inaudible) conference, about a housing shortage for apartments in 2012 because of the lack of ability to build. We can build even what we are tearing down. We were tearing about 110,000 units a year and most people think that we are going to go below that from a new start perspective in 2009-2010. So, I don’t think that we are going to be negatively impacted by some rush to go buy houses initially. 
Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton: Okay. And then one last question for Keith. Keith when you take a look at the expected expense growth in '09, ex-trash and cable, what’s putting the upward pressure to get you in the 3% to 4% almost 4.5%. One would expect wages were down, materials were down what’s putting the pressure there on you guys?
Keith Olden:
 : Property taxes.
Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton:  Okay.
Keith Olden:
 : We got our forecast for '09 increase in property tax is just 4.5%. Interestingly enough if you take our controllable expenses the way we define and which excludes tax as insurance. We are actually down year-over-year on controllable cost in '09 because of our headcount reductions and our salary [freeze]. So the pressure is coming all from property taxes, obviously that’s going to be a huge battle. There is nothing we can do this year. That’s already baked in, but for next year it’s going to be a huge battleground.  We are very aggressive and we will continue to be very aggressive because it is our single largest exposure on the cost side of the equation for 2009. So, it’s not from, we are doing a great job controlling cost. Dennis, walked through it, that you kind of back out those non-comparables for the year. We were up 1.6% for 2008 non-controllables were actually down year-over-year in 2009. So, we are very comfortable with, we have done what we need to do to get any controllable cost out of the run rate. We are just fighting the tax amounts.
Robert Stevenson - Fox-Pitt Kelton:  Okay, thanks guys.
Operator:   Your next question will come from Michelle Ko from UBS. Please go ahead.
Michelle Ko - UBS:  Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about renewals what gross trade excluding other income are you assuming for renewals in '09. And now you are becoming more aggressive on concessions to lock in occupancy. Then also, are the new residents being offered some better deals than someone renewing for the same unit?
Rick Campo:
 : Yeah, let’s talk about just generally on renewals first of all. We don’t deal we will have to deal with the concession part of it, because we do net effective pricing whether it's on renewals or whether its on new leases. Our renewals quotes are all generated from the same yield management system that we used to generate new leases. The only, the new ounce with renewals is if you have someone who is particularly crafting, they have the ability to go in and look at what if we have a current unit offering where those net effective rents have dropped at that particular community on that particular unit type, then they could obviously have visibility to what that other comparable unit maybe leasing for now. Obviously every unit is unique, it's uniquely priced in the location and the community, sales on the new premium, etcetera. But we are clearly aware and we are managing that process by doing the following, we have 60 days prior to any renewal coming up. Our MO is to have a personal contact from someone on staff to the residence and offer them the ability to renew their lease at their existing market rate. Most people when they learn that they are not going to be faced with the rental increase, that’s something that’s seems like a fare and here is a fair bargain for them to be able to renew that lease term.  Our community managers have the discretion and the case where you really do have a fairly sizable gap between what current markets is and the visibility into that current market is versus someone’s renewal. They have the ability to adjust the rental rate and negotiate those and individual circumstances.  The key though is that you have to make sure all of these determinations were made at unit tight level, at the community level, there is a great tendency for people who want to say, if you don’t have a revenue management system and most of our competitors still do not. They kind of tend to look at it and say the market rent is doing this, therefore, my blanket approach is going to be to offer everyone a discount on renewals. Well, it's just not the way it works, I mean it could very well be that even though the general market rents maybe down 1% or 2% and by the way that's our estimates next year for net effective rent to be down somewhere in the 1.5% to 2% range something like depending on what markets you are in.  But if you look at it at the individual unit level, it's very possible that somebody could be in a market it's down 1% but they happen to be in a unit type where we have zero availability they are all leased. It's the most popular floor plan and you may get a rental increase. So, regardless of what research you do into the generalized market you have to look at all of these decisions at the individual unit level which is what we are doing.
Michelle Ko - UBS:   Okay. Great. And also have you seen more doubling and tripling up? Have you seen like the most vacancy in studios and one bedroom versus the two and three bedrooms? 
Rick Campo: Let me say what we have seen, we have seen that transfers within Camden's communities for all reasons for the fourth quarter of 2008 were up. There were about 12.5% versus about 9.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007. So transfers for all reasons we know are up. We believe that a fairly sizable portion of that our people who are transferring to an apartment to accommodate a newly minted roommate relationship. So, we do believe that it's happening. It's happening if you assume that it's some portion of that 4.5% increase or 3.5%. I mean it's a meaningful number and I think if you are going to likely to see that we will likely see more of that as 2009 unfolds. But the hard numbers are transfers are up 3% and we have no way to attribute that to anything other than people or making different choices about the room mate situation.
Michelle Ko - UBS: Okay. And then just lastly, given a number of REITs are trying to conserve capital by issuing a part of there dividend and stock in cash. Can you talk about what your assumptions are going forward in terms of how you pay your dividend?
Keith Olden: Well, Dennis, went through in our capital plan or model our current modeling guidance assume that dividend is paid out of operating cash flow and paid at it's current level. When you look through our assumptions, we are paying with the mid point of our range and the CapEx deduction we are paying, our dividend out of operating cash flow. Obviously, with these kinds of markets today, you have to look at every option for liquidity and balance sheet strength as key going forward.  I think that our Board reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis, our Board meeting is coming up in a week or so. We will be reviewing the dividend and making sure that we will be survivor in this game and have a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity, I think that there obviously have been companies that have paid stock dividends and companies that have cut their dividend and I think all of that is a function of sort of how they sit in the current market and what their views of the credit markets are in the long term operations of their businesses and will be doing that on a quarterly basis. 
Michelle Ko - UBS: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. Just a question on your NOI guidance down 4.5 to down 7.5, given the fact that your markets did enter the decline earlier than others and the fact that your comps looks a little bit easier than some others do. Can you just talk about whether or not you expect the decline sort of continue to increase over the course of the year or, you if start to expect to see the decline start to level out at some point in '09?
Dennis Steen:  Karin let me address that from just a little bit different direction. And I think it might be easier for you to get your head around. If look at Camden, our stock position by the way is what your premise was that Camden's market entered the downturn first. We were the first one who got that with the job losses from the sub-prime debacle. If you look at where those markets that got hit the hardest, for example in Phoenix, Phoenix in 2008 lost 70,000 jobs, that's a really staggering blow to that economy. They're going lose jobs again in 2009, but they're going to lose jobs probably in the 20,000 range. So, if you think about the rate of change of job loss, that's pretty consistent across Camden's market. Now let me kind of bring it back why I think that there is an inflection point coming in 2009 for Camden on a relative basis. If you take the actual reported results at the end of 2008 for our peer group, and you compare it to Camden, the average of the peer group was in NOI growth of roughly 4% positive. We were four-tenth negative, so almost a 4.5% underperformance relative to the peer group if you want to look at that way. If you look at the guidance for 2009, assume that we are all geniuses and we hit our guidance, exactly as it is given, we are 100 basis points below the midpoint of the peer group. Peer groups are about five, we are at down six. So, if you think about it from the rate of change, that's a huge shift on a relative basis, and I think that the underlying reason for that is that, our markets have probably taken the of their hits. I mean how many jobs, can you lose out of the housing, food chain in Phoenix. I mean those all went away in '07 and early in '08. So I think there is a reasonable case that you can make that sometime in 2009 that there is an inflection point, where our markets will begin to outperform the national averages. Many of the markets that got really whacked in the fourth quarter, New York as an example; Camden obviously has no exposure to. So I just think that on a relative basis, I think the preponderance of our bad news is probably in. I think our peer group probably has some really tough sledding to do in the next twelve months. So on a relative basis, we feel pretty good about that. If you take that same analysis forward to 2010, and based on our projections where job growth turns positive in 2010 in Camden's markets, we are likely to see a pretty decent job growth number. But if you take those same forecasts across the 42 top metro areas in the country, and look at the markets where Camden has no representation, those markets are still based on our forecast, still going to be losing jobs in 2010 on a basis. So we are hopeful that your premise is with which we agree is the right one.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That’s very helpful thanks.
Dennis Steen:  You bet.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Next question is just on your acquisition guidance. You put in 0 to 100 million on your balance sheet and 0 to 200 million, potentially in joint-venture. Can you just talk about what type of return expectations, or what type of market conditions you need to see before you start to head down that path?
Rick Campo:  Well, Karin, that's a question that our acquisitions team to ask us every day. And we keep moving our bar up. The biggest issue to me is going to be gain a sense that we have an inflection point in what’s and what NOIs are going to do, because it’s not so much what cap rates you should buy out to me, because I think cap rates are interesting and clearly they have gone up, but the more complex issue to me is what will cash flows be and what the growth rates will be in those cash flows going forward. And so the combination of two things, one is we need to get a cap rate that is north by at least a 100 basis points 150 basis points over the debt loss. And second an underwriting confidence that we can underwrite the NOIs at a level that we feel comfortable with. Now, even if it’s a decline, that’s okay as long as we have an expectation that that decline is going to have an inflection point, and we in fact are going to be able to project increases in the NOI going forward. So that’s why we have 0 to 100 numbers of sides.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Got it. Just last question is have you checked what your pricing is on your issuing new unsecured debt today?
Keith Olden: Yes, we went out today would probably somewhere in the 10% to 11% range.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay 
Keith Olden: Back in 300 to 400 basis points.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from Jonathan Habermann from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs:  Hi, good morning. it’s Jon here with (inaudible) while most of our questions have actually been answered already, but just really quickly I was wondering if we could get maybe an update on how the demand for your different ancillary services have been holding up in different markets in terms of Valet Waste program and Perfect Connection and what should we change on that front over the past two or three months?
Keith Olden: Well, in both cases the valuation in Camden TV there really isn’t a take option. It’s a service that we provide, we do breakout the fee for that service separately, but our acceptance rate has been extraordinary on both cases. In the case of cable TV it’s fairly, straightforward and a no brainier most of our residents already have cable. They are paying more to the current incumbent provider than what the price we provided at. And we actually provide a little bit better package for less money. So that's just absolutely a win for our residence and the acceptance has been great on the Valet Waste it's a customer service issue. It's also a property maintenance cleanliness issue. Once you roll it out, the way that we roll it out, which we give people the service free for the balance of their lease term whatever that happens to be, even people who conceptually object to the idea of paying to have their thrash collected and taken out. By the time they have had the service for four, five months for free, find that when it comes online and they are paying for it’s a value proposition. So the acceptance has been extremely good, and our only hesitation in rolling it out, cable is rolled out everywhere we can of where the contracts provide. Valet Waste, we are rolling out everywhere that our partner Valet Waste can provide the service, which is at this point about 75% of our portfolio.
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs:  Okay thank you. 
Keith Olden: You're welcome.
Operator:  Your next question will come from Rich Anderson from BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Hey, thanks and good morning. Dennis how much more debt can you raise through remain comfortably within covenants levels? 
Dennis Steen:  I didn’t hear at all, but I think you asked how much additional debt could I raise from a secured perspective, and after the $250 million raise we have in the second quarter, we have another $100 million to $250 million that we can do in addition to that.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  So $400 million in total?
Dennis Steen:  Yeah. $400 million to $450 million in total.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. 
Dennis Steen:  That's to make sure you maintain your ratings and all that and that’s very critical and important. But when you look at let's just make an assumption that unsecured market never comes back. I'm saying never here. It’s very hard to believe, or let's just say never. Under that scenario, we could probably borrow an extra $1.5 billion of secured debt and still be in covenant compliance with your bonds. The negative of that would be that you obviously down graded and would be a secured strategy versus unsecured strategy, so we are absolutely committed to an unsecured strategy. We do believe fundamentally that markets will improve, they have already improved, so for this year even though the numbers were still pretty expensive to unsecured. But if you take the zirconnian never ever, ever will the unsecured market comeback for multifamily companies, we could issue a $1.5 billion worth of agency debt and still be in compliance with our bond covenants.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Did the point being why bother maintaining an investment grade rating and there is never.
Dennis Steen:  Well, if the relative advanced care market never comes back.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Right.
Dennis Steen:  And there is never an alternative for us to borrow in that market, then you would go secured. And there wouldn’t be no decision, and I just want to make sure, I am clear on that that we have an unsecured strategy we are going to maintain our ratings, but you have to look at on our worse case downside scenario then it never comes back ever and the answer to the question to $1.5 billion.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  And maybe quick question for you too, Rick. Does Fannie and Freddie prefer funding acquisition, or existing asset, there are any difference in the pricing anything like that?
Rick Campo:  No, Fannie and Freddie really their enjoyed their current position, and that they are able to get the best borrowers. What they really like are the best borrowers and their properties. And today, because borrowers are the public companies because we have low leverage. They hadn’t been able to really make a market with the public companies, and hence we end up with tightest spread and the best yield from Freddie and Fannie. 
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  I guess I was thinking within acquisition they least have a data point in terms of value asset.
Rick Campo:  No. I don’t really think they even look at that number at all. What they look at is debt coverage. They look at debt coverage period and the story and they could careless what you have to acquire the property at, do you acquire the property at a number that they are going to look at their loan and say, I want debt coverage of 125 or 130 and that will you take whatever underwritten cash flow for trailing three months, is divided by that number and that's what they are going to lend, and so I don’t think they have preference as to carrying what you pay as long as you are putting equity in to cover their debt.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. That's all I have thanks. 
Rick Campo:  Okay.
Operator:  Your next question will come from Alexander Goldfab from Sandler O'Neil. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfab - Sandler O'Neil:
 : Good morning.
Dennis Steen:  Good morning, Alex.
Rick Campo:  Good morning Alex. Glad to have you back.
Alexander Goldfab - Sandler O'Neil: It's good to be back. It's pretty rough market out there.
Rick Campo:  I have heard that.
Alexander Goldfab - Sandler O'Neil: I know the paper have all those good news in there lose that in the headlines. Just a question on development, going through, obviously you guys or not alone in pairing back, but going through, it's interesting Colorado, you axed although I think in your opening comments you said that Colorado was sort of at the top of your list for performing market. Selma and Vine got axed NoMa too axed, but you kept Las Vegas just want to get a little more color into how you made decisions on, which deals to keep, which ones to get rid up, and then specifically on Selma and Vine, just given the difficulty with LA, the decision to give up that assets and then also what was driving the expense, because on a per-door basis it looks pretty pricy, so not sure if that's hard cost or if that's the carrying cost and the soft cost.
Rick Campo:  Okay, well the way we analyzed our development pipeline, and went through this impairment analysis and discussion, we did two things. One was we sort of separated projects by size and by what we thought projected yields would be in current market conditions. The challenge on the second piece was construction cost have come in dramatically in the last six months, plus or minus and it's really hard to sort of judge what construction costs are today. We know market conditions from a rental perspective and out robust for sure. So we categorize each property from a size perspective and a total return perspective based on what we thoughts the cash flows would be. So two projects stock out which would no NoMa phase II and Selma and Vine as they were large projects over $150 million each and then the other projects sort of hit based on a yield filter, if you well, and we then evaluated the cut points on which projects we thoughts going forward to be regional projects and ones that could be done in phase I or phase II, we're analyzed and Las Vegas for example just to give you color on that. Las Vegas can be done at a phase II, which is a very three-storey, four-storey, garage wrapped product it's a bread and butter product. And we think Las Vegas in long-term is a great market. And we have a decent basis on our land. So, we have decide to keep that one. The price pressure on cyclical product has going down a whole lot more than type one construction on Selma and Vine for example. Now the fact that Denver is doing well today is important, but ultimately the decision was what total \ return could we earn on that projects in Denver relative to other projects. So it was really just making a cut at what returns we were willing to take. Now, that said, the fact that we wrote these down, and the fact that we have abandon the construction on them at this point doesn't mean that we can't reinstitute them in the future at the written down price. So, Selma and Vine point out has a lot of entitlements and one of the issues with it was because of the entitlement issues that took us years to get that building entitled and today the question ultimately would be whether that building gets to built as entitled though we have to change the entitlement in the future. So, bottom line is that even though these are abandoned developments today, they could be restarted in the future if in fact they made sense.
Alexander Goldfab - Sandler O'Neil: Okay. And then as far as your California strategy, it seems like just the tough, not as seems it is a tough market to do business in, and as far as growing the portfolio in that market doesn't seem to, has grown as much as the other areas. Are you guys still focused on California, do you think that this down cycle will provide opportunities or your is experience so far is that it's just not worth, the upside isn't worth the risk and your money is better spent in the other markets?
Rick Campo: No. I think that you point out definite dilemma. And the reason we don’t have a lot of development in California right now is, because we cancelled it all. We didn't approve a single deal in California in last three years, and trust me we had a very robust California development team out there who was working on deals ongoing basis, yet we rejected every single deal they brought with the exceptions of Selma and Vine.  And so I think that it has been a difficult environment and people in California were willing to take the risk and develop the 5.5 cap rates that ultimately you are going to be less than 5.5 in the current environment. And so we just elected not to do that. California is a great market long-term, we have 10% plus of our portfolio in California today, we are committed to California to be a long-term. I think that as the markets continue to create price discovery and that California will offer some opportunities, co-acquisitions of either potential developments that need to be refinanced that have some issues on getting the refinancing done and do acquisitions going forward. So we are absolutely committed to California long-term and it will still be part of our portfolio.
Alexander Goldfab - Sandler O'Neil: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question will come from Paula Poskon from Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.
Paula Poskon - Robert W Baird: Thank you, just one question. Are you seeing any increase in early lease terminations and relatedly, what is happening with the average length of stay and does that have any impact on your recurring CapEx guidance?
Dennis Steen: Yeah. The change in the lease terms that we have seen has come primarily from the increase in skips and evictions. And depending on where they are in the lease term, then it could be a really long piece of termination or a short piece of termination. Our overall lease term has really not changed that much. We offer through our revenue management system, the resident has the opportunity to choose their own lease terms. Everyone of them is priced differently at a different price point is depending on what the revenue model is looking at in the future for explorations and demands. So that piece of the household is really decided by our residents and it's roughly the same as what it was at the beginning of the year, there really hasn't been much a change.
Paula Poskon - Robert W Baird: Thanks very much. 
Dennis Steen: You bet.
Operator: Your next question will come from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets:  Good afternoon. First of all congratulations on your ranking in the top 50 for FORBES list of top 100 companies to work for, thanks.
Rick Campo:  Thank you.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: First of all, question for Rick. Can you talk about your unemployment scenario assuming your guidance and what the sensitivity are in NOI?
Rick Campo: I'm sorry, you broke up a little.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: On your forecast for 2009, can you talk about the sensitivity to employment change?
Rick Campo: Yeah, our forecast for unemployment for 2009 is right at 9.5%. Sensitivity to that, we have always used the metric and this is of sort of like using on axe I understand to kind of do some surgery, but broadly speaking we have always used the for every five jobs you create one natural net apartment rental demand. So if you wanted to kind of work through the math market by market you could run that number through and that would roughly be what we would see a sensitivity.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets:  Okay that’s helpful. Secondly can you touch on the January trends and how that played our relative to guidance?
Rick Campo:
 : Little better, better than plan, we are not January and the primary difference was a little bit better occupancy rate in January that we had, had in our plans. February was, also looks like its slightly better again primarily in occupancy we will see whether that can continue this trend can continue to hold. But relative to plan off to a pretty good start.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets:  You touched upon your outlook for different market in terms of with letter grades and whether are you proving in which markets do you think are closest to the bottom right now. And conversely which markets do you feel at this point or as we stand here to-date have the furthest of fall?
Keith Olden:  Well since we only gave only one improving and I gave that to Phoenix. Its hard to say that we are ready to call bottoms in any of these. I think that the, we are pretty far down the trail in most of our markets where there are going to be significant job losses with the exception of Atlanta that still has pretty big job loss forecast for 2009. South Florida still has a pretty sizeable job loss and then Southern California. I think based on the job numbers alone those three markets would be the ones where you, you probably not quite as for a long an see a turn around on the jobs part of the puzzles. Interestingly enough in Las Vegas. I think that's probably one that may have surprised of people and the ranking and it certainly surprises us a little bit in the performance in '08 and the projection for '09. The resilient treatment pretty good there I think we are pretty far down the trail. I think if you just kind of think of it in. There is a wave that's rolling though some of it was housing related and then some of it is more general economic conditions. The housing related markets that stated getting whacked the soonest would have been Phoenix, Las Vegas, Tampa, Orlando in Northern Virginia. So, I think that you still for the general economic overtly to deal with but I think the housing piece of it in the sub prime piece of the equation is probably largely behind us in those markets. I do not know if that helps you any way. 
Rick Campo: Only I would add is that Las Vegas you have 14,000 hotel rooms that are opening up towards end of '09 and into 2010. We know it takes two and a half employees to run each hotel room even with the situation that's going on there now. So you have built in job growth they have to operate the hotels, they are not shuttering them, they are opening them and I think that equation helps Vegas lot better then the rest of the market volume.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: That’s very helpful for the color there and finally Rick, some of your peers have mentioned I think 2010 could be potentially worse than 2009. I just be interested to get your take on that?
Rick Campo: I think anybody who knows what’s going to happen out about out more then sort of 60 to 90 days in this economy. This just is speculating. You can make a case that 2010 is going to be a decent year for the apartment business and I think it just a function of how the economy plays out. What happens with the Stimulus Bill? Do you have improving economic conditions and I do not think we are not saying that 2010 is going to be the year that we have positive same store NOI growth but we are also, I just think it's really hard to prognosticate backend of 2010. I know that at some point you are going to have recovery and with the limited supply that we have in the marketplace from multifamily perspective with the demographic trends that we have with everything going on our business we know we are going to have pricing powers at some point, is it in 2010 may be is on your view that may be 2011, but I can not argue with somebody who says 2010 is going to be worse than 2009 at this point.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks.
Rick Campo: Okay. Great. Well, that was the last question so we appreciate you are being on the call and we will talk to you again next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Camden Property Trust third quarter 2008 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kim Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Callahan, you may begin.
Kim Callahan:

':
':
Rick Campo: Good morning and happy Halloween. It's appropriate that our call is on Halloween, relative to the tricks and treats that we are experiencing in our markets, and the general state of the capital markets.
': Given the challenging economy and job losses today we are pleased with the third quarter property operations. Our on site teams are doing a great job navigating these uncertain times, and I thank them for their continued commitment to provide living excellence to our residence. We measure our on-site teams quarterly performance relative to MPF published market data. Our teams consistently outperformed the local markets. For the quarter, we outperformed 13 of our 16 markets; our charge to our on-site teams continues to be that we ask them to outperform the market in spite of market conditions. We will not be providing 2009 guidance on this call, we will provide 2009 guidance on our fourth quarter conference call.
':
': You might be surprised by these numbers. If you put them in perspective, during 2002 to 2004, recession our net operating income declined from peak to trough to about 11.5%. So, why would the NOI decline be less in this recession? First, our view is that we have been in recession in our challenged markets since the first quarter, but there are essentially three economic drivers that are significantly different this time around, I worry about saying, this time its different, but there are lot of specific things that are different. First the supply of multi family housing is 45% less, going into this recession compared to the last recession. Supply was peaking at a time of significant demand declines in the last recession. Given what has happened in the credit markets, the fact that new developments and financing have essentially dried up, we expect future supply to fall through at least 20 year lows, and as a matter of fact, our future supply probably will off set substantially by demolitions, so we will have negative supply over the next two or three years in the multi-family business.

': Given the current tighter credit underwriting for home loans and the negative consumer sentiment, these dynamics will actually increase rental demands during this cycle, rather than taking rental demand away from us, as the last cycle. The third major difference in that is demographics. The baby boom echo is producing many more 18 to 24 year olds in the last cycle and they have the highest propensity to rent apartments. When job growth returns there will be significant pent-up demand. We believe that there will be shortage of multi-family units, beginning in late 2010 and through 2013.

Keith Olden:
':
': The third quarter is always our highest turnover quarter, but 78% for the quarter was higher than we had anticipated. We are still well below plan on expenses for the year. The 3.4% increase in expenses year-to-date, adjusted for the impact of our cable and valet waste initiatives, is slightly less than 1%. So we continue to see good expense controls on sites. We expect to finish the year at the low end of our original expense guidance, however, our fourth quarter expenses will likely show a significant increase over the prior year, due to the $1.6 million in property tax reductions that we had in the fourth quarter of 2007. We averaged 94.9% occupancy for the quarter, as our revenue management systems maintained rents flat to the second quarter, in order to hold occupancy.
': The largest revisions among our markets occurred in Atlanta, which went from a projected 16,000 gain, in the second quarter, to what is now projected as a 3,000 job loss. Los Angeles was projected at 14,000 job losses is currently projected at 56,000 losses. Phoenix was revised from a loss estimate of 12,000 jobs to 39,000 jobs, and Tampa was revised from flat to down 13,000. This 123,000 downward revision to the employment outlook in our markets in the second half of this year will continue to create challenges. Consistent with our expectations for slowing demand as jobs are lost, we experienced a 7% decline in traffic from the third quarter of 2007, and our closing percentage fell from 34% in Q2, to 32% in this quarter. Since quarter end, our occupancy rate has come down to right at 94%, which is higher by 20 basis points than our historical seasonal decline from second to third quarter.

Dennis Steen:
': Excluding these non-recurring items that were not included in our prior guidance, FFO for the third quarter would have been $51.2 million, or $0.87 per diluted share at the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $0.85 to $0.89 per share. Our FFO, excluding the non-recurring items, achieved the midpoint of our FFO guidance range for the third quarter of 2008, based on the following: Moderating same store revenue growth and slightly higher than anticipated same store operating expenses, as Keith just discussed, produced $1.3 million or $1.6 million unfavorable variance to our same store net operating income expectations for the third quarter. This unfavorable variance was offset by a $400,000 favorable variance in net operating income from communities in our development pipeline as all communities under lease-up are progressing positively towards stabilization and a $700,000 favorable variance in general and administrative expenses due to lower salary and benefits, incentive compensation and legal expense. During the third quarter, we continued to make significant progress towards the execution of our 2008 disposition program. During the quarter, we sold five operating assets to third parties, generating total proceeds of $115.6 million and resulting in a gain on sale of $65.6 million. This brings our year-to-date disposition volume of operating real estate assets up to approximately 2,400 units, which had an average age of 24 years, generating $140 million in proceeds. The average cap rate on our 2008 dispositions was 6%. Using 2008 annualized NOI and CapEx per unit of $650 and the unlevered IRR was approximately 12%. We are currently marketing for sales seven additional communities with an average age of over 20 years. Three of the communities are currently under contract but we do not expect any to close in 2008. Additionally, in August, we sold Camden South Congress, a 253-unit community in Austin to the Camden multi-family value added fund for $4.2 million resulting in a gain of $1.8 million on the sale. And current with the purchase, the fund obtained a seven-year floating rate loan from Freddie Mac to finance 70% of the purchase price. Turning to the capital markets, we and the rest of corporate America continue to navigate through the current credit crisis. We made significant progress during the quarter in further strengthening our balance sheet and liquidity position. On September 24, we closed on a new $380 million Fannie Mae credit facility. The facility has a term of ten years, and was comprised of a $205 million, 5.625% fixed rate loan and a $175 million variable rate loan currently priced at 4.2%. The proceeds were used for payment of all our remaining debt maturities for 2008 and to pay down amounts outstanding on $600 million unsecured line of credit. As of September 30, our liquidity position is sound. With $29 million in cash on the balance sheet, no debt maturities for the remainder of 2008, and full availability on our $600 million unsecured line of credit, which after all extensions, matures in January of 2011. Additionally our dividends continue to be adequately covered by operating cash flows, and we have a significant unencumbered asset pool of approximately $4.3 billion which continues to be available for potential financing. We also have the ability to replace a significant amount of unsecured debt with secured debt and still satisfy our financial covenants. Based upon our existing liquidity position, potential proceeds from asset sales, and our ability to incur additional secure debt, with Fanny and Freddy still very active in the multi-family space, we are very comfortable that we can meet our upcoming debt maturities. Please say page 23 of our supplemental financial package for additional details on quarterly debt maturities through the year 2010. 2009 debt maturities total only $198 million or 7% of our outstanding debt. $50 million of the 209 maturities are secured notes, $46 million of which matures in the first quarter of 2009 but can be extended at our option to the first quarter of 2010. Based upon current interest rates, we plan on exercising this option. Looking forward at our capital needs and liquidity position, assuming our only development spin relates to the $40 million required to complete the communities in our current development pipeline that all debt maturities are paid off with availability on our line, and the only proceeds from asset dispositions relate to the communities currently being marketed, results in our line of credit being fully available at the end of 2008, and have an approximately $400 million in availability at the end of 2009. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to weather the current uncertainty in the credit markets. Moving onto earnings guidance. We expect fourth quarter 2008 FFO of $0.85 to $0.89 per diluted share, resulting in full year 2008 FFO of $3.57 to $3.61 per diluted share. The midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance of $0.87 per share is in line with our third quarter core results, after excluding the non-recurring impact of gains on the early retirement of debt and insurance cost related to Hurricane Ike from third quarter results. Our fourth quarter guidance is reflective of the following: A $0.02 per share projected increase in non-same store net operating income as the positive impact of a continued lease-up of seven communities in our development pipeline was only partially offset by NOI loss on third quarter dispositions. A $0.005 per share projected increase in same store net operating income as our expected seasonal decline in property operating expenses is slightly greater than our expected decline in property revenues, due to the fourth quarter decline in average occupancy and lower levels of other property income in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in turnover and leasing activities. Full year 2008 same property NOI growth is now projected to be a negative 0.2%, to a negative 0.6%, revenue growth of 1.4% to 1.8%, an expense growth of 4.8% to 5.2%. These two positives are being offset by a projected $0.02 per share increase in interest expense. This projected increase is primarily due to the fact that the average rate on our new 10-year $380 million Fannie facility of approximately 5% is higher than the average interest rate incurred in the third quarter on-line of credit balances and maturing mortgages paid off with the Fannie facility proceeds. We expect total property supervision, fee and asset management, and G&A expenses for the fourth quarter to be inline with third quarter amounts. At this time I will open the call up to questions.

Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from David Bragg with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

David Bragg - Merrill Lynch:

Keith Olden:

':
':
': So those would be the three that I would think would be most likely candidates to move, based on projected job losses from one category to the other. Going the other direction, in our northern Virginia market, we think it has seen pretty decent stabilization. Our DC Metro has held up well, the Maryland has held up well. The big challenge has been northern Virginia.
':
David Bragg - Merrill Lynch:
 :
Rick Campo:
': From an underwriting perspective, we are definitely tightening our underwriting up, lowering growth rates and actually putting recession scenarios, the numbers that I of went through in my prepared remarks. We are using those from an underwriting perspective today.
':
David Bragg - Merrill Lynch: Okay. So just generally speaking, the, NOI growth figures that, from Woodland that you indicated seem appropriate for 2009, 2010 and 2011 as you look forward for acquisitions?
Keith Olden:
':
':
':
':
':

David Bragg - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Keith Olden: Sure.
Operator: Our next question will come from Dustin Pizzo from Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone.

Operator: Our next question comes from Lou Taylor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Rick Campo: Good morning. .
Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank:
':
':
':
Keith Olden:
':
':
':
':
':
':
':
':
':
':
':
Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then how about development in leasing, how is the pace going, and what are you having to do there from a pricing standpoint to maintain the leasing pace?
Keith Olden: It depends on where you are. The pace is going reasonably well. We have seen some degradation in lease rates by virtue of having to provide a little more concession than we do, we do concessions in the development side of the house versus the stabilized operating side of the house that uses revenue management. We are doing well in terms of getting the projects leased up. I think in our last call I talked about probably a degradation of 25 basis points at least from just slower rent side of the equation in the original yields.
Lou tailor - Deutsche Bank: And then how about just in terms of what are the markets or projects are the concessions running a little heavier than, say, some other regions?
Keith Olden:
':
':
':
':
':
.:
Lou tailor - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Habermann from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Hi, guys. Good morning. Jay Habermann here with [Slone] as well.
Rick Campo: Hi Jay.
Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs:
':
Keith Olden: Well, Jay, I think the good news is that the starts continued to plummet. The second piece of it is that, in some of these markets you have seen real spikes new home sales. I saw the other day that in California for the reporting period for one month, now one month is not a trend, but year-over-year the sales were actually up almost 100% from the same period a year ago, the bad news is, is that the price was off about 35% from the prior year.

Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Just last question. You mentioned seven additional assets for sale. Is that something you look to expand upon or is that do you feel comfortable with the asset sales than obviously the liquidity measures that Dennis spoke to?
Rick Campo:
':
':
Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michelle Ko from UBS. Please go ahead.
Michelle Ko - UBS: Hi, good morning.
Keith Olden: Good morning.
Michelle Ko - UBS:
':
Keith Olden: We have got seen any in Dallas. We saw a little bit weakness relative, I mean, Austin has been an incredibly strong market for us for the last two-years. But I would say that we did see a little bit of weakness in our numbers in Austin but again you are talking about from a level that has been really strong for us. The interesting thing is that on the job growth revisions that I was mentioning earlier and I was giving you the ones where there were negative job revisions, but there were also positive job revisions from the second quarter, and the biggest ones occurred in Dallas. It went from a projected 20,000 to a projected now 37,000. Houston went from a projected 37 to a projected 41. And Austin actually came down from a projected 16,000 to a projected 11.4, still a decent number, but less than the projection even in the second quarter.
':
Rick Campo:
':
Michelle Ko - UBS: Okay. And also in terms of your revised same store revenue guidance for 2008, are you anticipating that the fourth quarter NOI growth is going to deteriorate from the third quarter?
Rick Campo:
':
Michelle Ko - UBS:
':
Dennis Steen: It actually is going to decline slightly because of decrease in occupancy and decrease in other income due to lower turn over and the fees relating to that turn over.
Michelle Ko - UBS: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
David Toti - Citigroup:
':
Keith Olden:
':
David Toti - Citigroup: Okay.
Keith Olden: But again, over in my initial comments, traffic in the third quarter year-over-year was down 7%.
David Toti - Citigroup: All right. Also could you provide a little bit of color with regard to discussions the board had relative to buying back that and your appetite for more, going forward?
Keith Olden:
':
':
':
David Toti - Citigroup: Okay. And then, did I miss a few comments on your expectations for the timing and the proceeds related to the land sales?
Keith Olden:
':
David Toti - Citigroup: Yes.
Keith Olden:
':
':
David Toti - Citigroup: Any rough idea of proceeds or amounts?
Keith Olden: About 10 million. If it happens, it will be about $10 million on our land dispositions.
Rick Campo: Just land or our total dispositions?

Keith Olden: Just the land, yes, 10 million.
David Toti - Citigroup: Okay. And then lastly, Rick, can you give us a little bit of a view of your take on capital markets recovery? How this would play out? And how you guys are underrating or underwriting interest rates going forward.

': And so that was a big win for National Multi Housing Council. And if you go back to that Bill, the homebuilders were really upset about it, because they got nothing out of the Bill. They actually wanted to expand the ability of homebuilders to go back two years and take operating losses back more than two years, which would have been basically just the Treasury writing the homebuilders a check, and we were effective in lobbying and negotiating that away, and it was a big win for apartments and a loss for homebuilders.

Rick Campo: No.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Then just a quick one, could you foresee anything in your future where you guys would have to reconsider your dividend policy and cut the dividend, noticing you are not getting paid for almost a 10% yield and conserving capital that way?

Karen Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just a couple quick ones. The $4 million cost savings, is that 2/3, 1/3 split good as far as splitting it between the G&A and the operating expense line items?
Keith Olden: No. Because the positions that were corporate would have been a higher average than salary than the on site.

Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Good afternoon: Looking at your operating performance by market, it looks like Florida seemed to actually show some improvement just from a quarter-to-quarter basis. Was that a function of just using your comps or anything you switched gears doing down there or what are you seeing basically in that market?
Keith Olden:

Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. I was referring more towards Tampa and Orlando where it seem like the rate of negative growth, and both of those markets seemed to actually decelerate essentially from the first quarter.

Paula Poskon - Robert W Baird:

Rick Campo:
': Our take on that is that its really not all that different, because the, at the, at the margins, $70 or $65, $70 oil if we can stabilize in that range, still is very attractive for the Gulf operations, the on-shore operations, in terms of finding new, doing exploration and development. And obviously the refining piece of it, which is a huge component of the oil and gas industry in the Houston Metro area, I suppose at $2 gas is better than a $4 gas for them.

Operator: Our next question will come from Eileen See from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Eileen See - Credit Suisse: Hi, thank you. What was the NOI decline in your weakest market in the last recession? And second question, regarding your balance sheet structure are you planning to move toward a higher percentage of secured debt, as a percentage of your total debt and if credit market did you do (Inaudible) Would you move back to lowering the percent secured debt.
Dennis Steen:
':
Eileen See - Credit Suisse: Oh. My other question was, regarding the balance sheet structure, are you planning to move towards a higher percent of secured debt if the credit markets continue to be challenged? And then conversely if credit markets improve, would you then move toward lowering the percent of secured debt?
Dennis Steen:
':
':
Eileen See - Credit Suisse:
 :
':
Dennis Steen:
':
Eileen See - Credit Suisse: And then when credit markets improve would you move back towards lowering the percent of secured debt?.
Dennis Steen: Sure. I mean, based upon the differential and the actual spreads on those two products, but we would look on that based upon current market conditions.
Eileen See - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Rick Campo: The answer to your first question. The worst market in the recession on a one year basis was Austin, Texas. And it was down, NOI was down 16.3%. And Austin is really a good example, because what was happening in Austin in 2001, as you recall, it was the hotbed of the tech industry in Houston or in Texas. They call Austin the silicone valley of Texas basically. You had Dell Computer there, you had Intel building a plant. So what happened in Austin that supply peaked right in 2001, and then all of a sudden a tech bust hit and you had massive job losses, because of tech, and you had peak in the supply and then a big drop off of NOI during that period. So Austin was the worst market, and in the peak one year decline was Austin at 16%.
Eileen See - Credit Suisse: Do you think that any of your current markets could experience that big of a decline?
Keith Olden: No.
Eileen See - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you very much.
Keith Olden: Thank you.
Rick Campo: Certainly.
Keith Olden: Okay. Great. That was the last call. So we appreciate the lengthy call, and all the questions, and support. We will talk to you next quarter and see you there. Thanks.

Operator: Welcome to the Camden Property Trust second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Kim Callahan :  Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden’s complete second quarter 2008 earnings release is available in the Investor Relation section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which may be discussed on this call.  Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Rick Campo. 
Richard Campo:  Last quarter I talked about a tale of two markets. This quarter the story continues, strong market performance in Houston, Dallas, Austin, Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh, and California posted 4.3% positive same-store NOI growth over the prior year. Markets that continue to be challenged by weak job growth from the unwinding of the housing bust continue to post declines in net operating income of 2.9% for the quarter over the prior quarter last year.  Overall, same property NOI growth was 0.8% for the quarter, pretty weak relative to our historical growth. Sequential NOI, on a positive note, grew 1.7% over the last quarter. We believe the balance of the year will be more of the same till job growth accelerates. We don’t think this is an inventory issue in the challenged markets. We really think it’s a job growth issue. As a result, we have lowered our same-store property NOI growth to a midpoint of 1% for the year, for the balance of the year. We also have lowered our FFO guidance for the year to $3.55 to $3.65 per share.  During the quarter and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we sold 1,307 apartments for roughly $110 million. The properties were on average of 24 years old. The sale resulted in a 12.63% unleveraged internal rate of return over a 13.5 year holding period. We will continue to recycle capital selling older, slower growing properties and reinvest those funds into development, debt repayment, and stock repurchases. All the sales were financed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The agencies continue to be a significant financing for us for multifamily properties. The recent enactment of the housing bill will insure that strong agency multifamily financing will continue on [inaudible]. As a matter of fact, we were really excited about the housing bill because it was a serious victory for multifamily companies. The Congress really took a hard look at our industries lobbying efforts to create a more balanced housing policy and we think that that bill really does that.  During the quarter, we made significant progress on our development pipeline. The costs are inline with budget. Leasing continues to be on plan. We did have some challenges in some of our challenging markets achieving pro forma rents. We stabilized yields, are still above 7% and we’ve reduced our yields overall by about 15 basis points.  Future development starts will be staged over the next several years and will be funded using our line of credit, disposition proceeds, joint ventures, and our value-added fund. Our management teams are doing a great job under challenging conditions. We appreciate their commitment to providing living excellence to our customers.  At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden:  Overall our operating results were inline with our expectations for the quarter with a small miss in revenues more than offset by expense savings. Year-to-date, we’re slightly ahead of plan, but that will change as we move through the second half of the year. Our property level reforecast for the balance of the year indicates a sideway trend in NOI, so we expect to end the year roughly where we are today with the same-store NOI growth of plus or minus 1%. Our original guidance was predicated on a much stronger job growth outlook than we will see in the second half of this year.  To put this in perspective, when we finalized our 2008 plans in the fourth quarter of last year, we were using a consensus estimated increase of 1.3 million jobs for the total U.S. Currently, we are using an estimated 210,000 job loss or $1.5 million negative swing in jobs. In Camden’s 15 core markets, that translates to an original estimate of 406,000 in positive job growth in our market to a now revised 81,000 job growth or a net swing of 325,000 fewer jobs. As you know, we built our platform on the premise that job growth is the primary driver of multifamily performance over the long-term. When the economy is adding jobs, our portfolio will benefit disproportionately to the U.S. averages. The reverse is also true, which is where we find ourselves today.  Rick mentioned the continued bifurcation in our portfolio between the economically challenged markets in our portfolio and those that continue to have decent growth. There’s been a ton of discussion as to what the root cause for the challenges in our underperforming markets is. The consensus view is that the single-family housing debacle and the resulting overhang in unsold inventories are the primary causes for the pain in our challenged markets, so let me give you our non-consensus view and that is this: We believe the declines in job growth, which have been much more pronounced in our challenged markets, are the primary reasons for the weakness in those markets. The largest downward revisions to 2008 job growth in our portfolio occurred in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Tampa, Orlando, and Los Angeles. It’s much easier for me to connect those dots to our challenges than it is to connect the dots to single-family rental competition as the root cause. Now I know that you may thing that I’m making a distinction without a difference here, but consider this:  If the root cause is weak job growth, then a recovery in job growth from a modest recession could occur as early as 2009, and our portfolio would see the benefits relatively quickly. If the route cause is the single-family housing overhang, which may take two or more years to resolve, then our portfolio will be under pressure for much a longer period of time. Obviously we feel strongly that it is all about the job and recovery may be nearer than the current consensus view.  Now turning to some specifics for the quarter: We continue to see good traffic at our communities. We were down less than 2% in traffic over the prior year, which is a really tough comp. Our closing rate was a solid 34% for the quarter, which allowed us to increase occupancy to an average 94.6% of 80 basis points over the prior quarter. We actually average slightly better than 95% for the month of June.  Unfortunately, our average rental rates were basically flat year-over-year and up a meager two-tenths of a percent sequentially. The pick-up in sequential was primarily from the occupancy gain and other income from our perfect connection cable program and our valet waste initiative. Our resident turnover rate for the quarter was down 3% from last year to 65% and the percentage of move-outs to home purchases was 14.2% or flat with the first quarter but down from 20% in the year ago quarter. We expect to see this trend continue as many residents continue to lack the courage or the financing required to purchase a home in this environment. Our yield star revenue management system continues to perform as expected and our challenged markets we’ve seen downward price adjustments to achieve 95% occupancy and our healthier markets we’re still getting decent rental increases. As the employment growth forecast began to deteriorate through the second quarter, we challenged our onsite staff to look for ways to accelerate the expense reductions from our numerous technology initiatives. The response has been favorable and we’ll continue to be a focus throughout 2008.  After adjustments to our operating expenses for the cost component of our cable and trash initiatives, operating costs for the first half are down nine-tenths of a percent from the prior year. In making the comparable adjustment to revenues, that would decrease the year-to-date number to essentially flat from the reported 1.5% increase. We do expect expenses to increase in the second half of the year due to seasonality and a fourth quarter ’08 comparison to a fourth quarter ’07 expense number that had roughly $2.2 million worth of downward adjustments for benefit in property taxes.  There’s ample evidence, anecdotal as it might be that consumers are being pressured by rising costs and weaker job markets. We’ve yet to see this stress translated into higher bad debt expense or delinquencies at our communities. Bad debt expense fell from the prior quarter from $6 per unit to $5 per unit, which is in line with our historical average. Delinquencies are in line with what we’ve seen the past two years when times were clearly better for the consumer. These trends are also in line with what our competitors are experiencing.  One of the great ironies emerging from the single-family housing foreclosure mess is that apparently the multifamily industry did a better job of qualifying our residents for a 12-month lease than lenders did in qualifying buyers for a $250,000 mortgage.  As you step back and scan the big picture for the quarter, if you’re a glass is half full kind of person, you would see that sequential NOI was up 1.7%, was positive in 12 of our 15 markets. You would also look at our revised full year guidance and conclude that we’re not expecting any further sequential deterioration between now and year-end. On the other hand, if you’re a glass if half empty kind of person, you’ll see that our challenged markets are still challenged and will remain so throughout 2008 and that we are and will remain near the bottom of our sector in NOI growth for the year. Whichever camp you fall into, I can assure you that our entire team is doing everything possible to fill up the glass. I’ll turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Dennis Steen:  I’ll start this morning with a review of our second quarter results. Camden reported FF0 for the second quarter of $54.9 million or $0.94 per diluted share, $0.05 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $0.87 to $0.91 per share and $0.04 above the first call mean estimate for the second quarter. The $0.05 per share outperformance to the midpoint of our prior guidance was primarily due to property net operating income exceeding our forecast by $1.6 million and our recognition of a $2.3 million gain on the repurchase and retirement of 27.75 million of our unsecured bonds during the quarter.  These two positives were partially offset by a $1.1 million unfavorable variance related to costs that were expensed on abandoned acquisition activities. Approximately $700,000 of this unfavorable variance is included in general and administrative expense and approximately $400,000 relates to one of our development joint ventures and is therefore included in equity and income of joint ventures.  The $1.6 million favorable variance in property NOI was the result of lower than anticipated property expenses, which more than offset slower than anticipated growth in revenues from our stabilized operating communities, as Keith just discussed. Property expenses were $2.6 million lower than anticipated for the second quarter due primarily to a $1.3 million non-recurring decline, an employee benefit cost due to unusually low claims related to our medical benefit plan, and lower than anticipated utilities and repair and maintenance expenses for our stabilized operating communities.  During the second quarter, we made significant progress in the execution of our 2008 disposition program. In the second quarter, we sold Oasis Sands in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Camden Towne Village in Dallas, Texas recording a gain on sale of $14.7 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold four additional communities, Camden Briar Oaks and Camden Woodview, both located in Austin, Camden Arbors in Denver and Camden Lakeview in Dallas. This brings our year-to-date disposition volume of operating real estate assets up to approximately 1,500 units, which has an average age of 24 years generating $120 million in proceeds.  The average cap rate on our 2008 dispositions was 5.9% using 2008 annualized NOI and capex per unit of $650. We’re currently at various stages of marketing additional communities for sale and now expect 2008 total disposition volume in the range of $200 to $350 million.  Our balance sheet metrics and liquidity position continue to be strong. We ended the quarter with over $320 million in availability under our unsecured line of credit. After applying proceeds from asset dispositions completed in July and projected dispositions for the remainder of 2008, we’re currently forecasting over $500 million in availability on our line of credit at year-end 2008. We do have just under $180 million in secured debt maturing in the second half of 2008. Our assumptions include the refinancing of these maturities with new agency secured debt. We’re currently negotiating terms on the new agency debt with indications of all end rates of just under 4% for floating rate debt and the mid to upper 5% range for seven- to ten-year fixed rate debt.  Due to the disruption in the unsecured bond markets, we took the opportunity to repurchase $27.75 million of our unsecured note at an average discount of over 9% representing a 7.13% yield to maturity. This repurchase and retirement resulted in a gain of $2.3 million, which is reported in FFO for the second quarter. We have not forecasted additional repurchases for the remainder of 2008.  Moving on to earnings guidance, we expect full year 2008 FFO per diluted share to be between $3.55 and $3.65 per share with a midpoint of $3.60. This represents a decline from our original full year guidance of $0.10 per share at the midpoint. The decrease in our full year expectation is primarily the result of the following:  As Keith discussed earlier, we have revised our full year same property guidance and we now expect same property NOI growth of 0.5% to 1.5%, down from our original guidance of 2.25% to 3.25%. This 1.75% decline in expected same property NOI growth lowered our full year FFO guidance by approximately $0.09 per diluted share.  Additionally, non-property income net, which includes fee and asset management income, net of expenses and interest in other income is now projected to be approximately $0.06 per share below our original 2008 full year guidance due to the delayed timing of new development joint venture starts originally planned for the second half of 2008. The above negative impacts are partially offset by the $2.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share gain related to the early retirement of unsecured bonds reported in the quarter. For the third quarter of 2008, we expect FFO per diluted share within the range of $0.85 to $0.89 per diluted share with a midpoint of $0.87 per share representing a $0.07 per share decline from the second quarter of 2008. This decline is the result of the following:  A $0.03 per share decrease in same property NOI as projected growth in same property revenues is more than offset by our seasonal summer increases in utilities and repair and maintenance expenses, a $0.04 per share decrease in property NOI related to our property dispositions completed in the second quarter of 2008 and plans for the third quarter of 2008, and a $0.02 per share decrease related to the net positive impact in the second quarter of 2008 from nonrecurring gains on the early retirement of unsecured bonds and cost associated with abandoned acquisition activities.  These three decrease are partially offset by a $0.01 per share projected increase in property NOI related to the continued lease-up of communities in our development pipeline a $0.01 per share projected net decrease in interest expenses as proceeds from second and third quarter property dispositions are used to pay down balances outstanding on our unsecured line of credit, offset in part by a reduction in capitalized interest due to the completion of units in our development pipeline.  At this time, we will open the call up to questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Christine Kim Deutsche Bank.
Christine Kim – Deutsche Bank Securities :  Just a question on the revenue growth guidance, you guys are 1.5% for the first half and are expecting a ramp-up 2% to 2.75%, I’m not just sure what’s going into that assumption.
Keith Oden:  Christine, our revenue forecast going forward has a slight increase in the third quarter and then a very slight increase again in the fourth over the run rate. The difference is that in the fourth quarter of last year, which is when we really were getting hammered in the job loss market, we had a reduction or a fall off of about $4.5 million in revenues from Q3 to Q4. So when you run basically flat revenues through that model, you end up at 3% guidance, so we’re pretty comfortable with that in the back half of the year. 
Christine Kim – Deutsche Bank Securities :  So is that going to come mostly from the rent side then or from an occupancy pick up?
Keith Oden:  The occupancy pick up, we’re assuming we maintain in the 94.5% to 95.5% range, so we really are not on a run rate basis forecasting any pick up from occupancy, and it’s really not growing rental rates either. It’s just that if we stay flat from our guidance, a run rate in the second quarter, the comparable in the fourth quarter of ’07 was almost $5 million less than the third quarter of ’07. So it’s basically a flat assumption on occupancy and some small pickup in revenues and that’s coming primarily from the seven or eight markets where we really still have some degree of pricing power. But at the end of the day, it’s not that we’re projecting ramp up or better conditions in Q3 and Q4, it’s just that the comparative drop off in the fourth quarter. 
Christine Kim – Deutsche Bank Securities :  Speaking of pricing power, could you just comment a little bit on how sensitive people are now to rent increases both on renewals and on new leases that you’re signing?
Keith Oden:  In the five markets that we posted a 3% same-store NOI loss, they’re hypersensitive. We’re fighting for market share in those markets. We’ve done a good job and the pricing model has done a good job of kind of fighting back to a 95% occupied condition, which was most of the pick up in the occupancy in those markets quarter-over-quarter, so that’s the good news. The bad news is in order to get there, we’ve had to lower our net effective rents. We don’t concessions because it’s not the way our model price of revenues, but I can tell you that in every one of those markets, concessions are the rule and not the exception. In markets like Tampa, you see the crazies doing two months free and the like in some of the assets that we compete with. But yeah, I would say very sensitive in those markets and not so much in the markets where we’re still able to get some rental increases. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Anthony Palone from JP Morgan. 
Anthony Palone – JPMorgan:  Can you talk about expected development starts dollar-wise over say the next 12 months?
Richard Campo:  Sure, we are likely not to start any developments before the end of the year, plus or minus. We may start one project in DC between now and the end of the year on our balance sheet. Next year, I don’t have any specific numbers I can give you right now, but we’re evaluating starts in the first quarter and second quarter. The idea being is that we think that starting projects in first quarter/second quarter ’09 would have deliveries going out into 2010/2011, which we believe is going to be a pretty good time for the multifamily business, especially when you consider what we expect to be a sharp fall off in development starts over the next 12 to 18 months because of the credit crunch and just the negative situation that’s being imposed upon the merchant builders of the world. So we’re going to be very prudent in those starts. We’re not going to start the transactions without having them fully funded either through dispositions or through joint ventures or through the utilization of our value-add fund.
Anthony Palone – JPMorgan: Then in that same light from an accounting and earnings point of view, in the past you’ve been able to quantify how much development delusion you thought was embedded in your FFO. Can you many comment on that for this year? Then what happens to that I guess if the amount of development ongoing comes down, guess that dilution gets lifted a little bit, but maybe on the flipside you have to start to bring in any capitalized overhead? 
Richard Campo:  Well the first question, I think our guidance shows $14 million of development dilution this year. Clearly as you ramp up development and you start leasing up higher percentages of properties, that development dilution either goes up if you ramp up. If you’re ramping down, that development dilution clearly reduces. So next year based on the current starts that we projected, which have been pretty much none this year, you have a ramping down of that development dilution next year with the lease up of the existing properties that are being in lease up today. So with that, with respect to that, you definitely have a… Next year, we’ll have less development dilution than we have this year when the assets start earning.  The second question about capitalized overhead, clearly in a market where you are not ramping our development up but actually ramping it down some, we have had to expense more capitalized cost than we would’ve otherwise this year. Actually two pieces of that, our value-add fund, we actually have added overhead this year that’s been expensed relative to the value-add fund and because of the nature of the market, I mean this is a very interesting market as everyone well knows, while deals are getting done as evidenced by our dispositions, the acquisition side of the business we’ve been very patient on. So we’ve had actually less fee income anticipated from our value-add fund. At the same, we’ve had to expense additional personnel that we brought into the Company to make sure that we were fully covered on being able to acquire properties. We expect that the sort of big spread between the buyers and sellers will start to change towards the end of the year and into next year, so what we hopefully will be able to match those revenues and expenses.  As far as any additional sort of capitalized overhead, if you look at our numbers today, we have about $12 million annually of sort of development spend, acquisition spend if you will and today we’re expensing about $6 million, so we have a capitalization of about $6 million relative to those numbers. So we feel pretty good about, our people continue to be very focused on getting the development pipeline in place for 2009 and we expect that we will start through joint ventures and fund to a number of developments in the first and second quarter of next year.
Anthony Palone – JPMorgan: Last question, on the projects that stabilized in the quarter, can you give us what the yields ended up being on those?
Richard Campo:  We don’t talk about specific individual yields on projects, but all of our projections showed yields in excess of 7% on all the projects and we’re still in that zone.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  David Cody here with Michael, a couple of questions, just sort of big picture. It seems that there’s a lot of selling activity largely because of the support of Fannie and Freddie on the buyer side. In the absence of Fannie and Freddie at current volume how do you project that climate relative to buyer interest and their ability to get financing and which entities would step in in the absence of these agencies?
Richard Campo:  That’s a good question. If you look at the CMBS market, in 2008 the CMBS market was crowding out Freddie and Fannie. In the first half of 2007, Fannie and Freddie were less than probably 45% of the market; the balance was CMBS like companies and what have you. Today, of course CMBS is zero in 2008 and Fannie and Freddie are about 90% of the financing markets. There are like companies that are continuing to finance properties but Fannie and Freddie clearly are supportive of the multifamily business. When you think about their charge, Fannie and Freddie’s charge is to provide liquidity and stability in the financing markets for housing. One-third of Americans live in rental housing, so the idea that Fannie and Freddie are not going to be there, clearly that’s a big part of their charge.  Prior to the housing bill that was passed last week or this week, you had the implied guarantee of the government and now you have the actual whole faith in credit of the government. They’ve expanded the ability of Fannie and Freddie to access the discount window as well or said window, so you have a situation where I know there’s a lot of concern about Fannie and Freddie and their ability to fund, but they’re in a better position vis-à-vis liquidity today than they have been ever. When you think about sort of the politics of Fannie and Freddie, the Bush administration, the conservative Republicans have been trying to break them up or control them, make them smaller for the last eight years and they’ve been unsuccessful Now you have a situation where Fannie and Freddie are the sort of white knights to bail out the single-family housing market and the government has taken a very more aggressive policy position by putting the full faith of the government Fannie and Freddie. So when you take the idea of Fannie and Freddie’s liquidity…  Now if you ask me about what their shareholders should be worried about, that’s a whole different story, but we think that Fannie and Freddie are going to continue to be major players in this market. They’re taking advantage of entrenching their market share. CMBS markets will come back in the future, but Fannie and Freddie are positioning themselves to have a larger share of market when that in fact does come back. The other thing I think is real instructive on Fannie and Freddie is that when you look at their multifamily business, the multifamily loans are the most profitable loans that Fannie Mae has and Freddie, but they also have very, very low default rates; I mean less than 1% default rates in the multifamily sector. So when you look at their loans as a percentage of their total book, multifamily is a small piece of it so they’re actually expending their business as opposed to contracting it.  Now if Fannie and Freddie went away and they just said, “Gee, multifamily is really not housing and we really didn’t want you to lend multifamily,” then you would be, multifamily would probably be in the same boat that commercial real estate is, office buildings and hotels and retail where they’re having a real tough time financing. Even with Fannie and Freddie financing, the sales volumes are down 70% in 2008 over 2007. But I don’t see Fannie and Freddie being a real issue. I think they’re going to continue to be in the market in a major way and take advantage of the opportunity they have.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Along those lines, did you need to provide any seller financing and were you approached for financing by any of your buyers?
Richard Campo:  No, not at all. I think one of the things that when you look at this whole idea of the transaction volumes being down significantly this year versus last year, big deals have trouble. If you have anything over $100 million plus, you start having issues. But small bite-sized deals that $20 million, $30 million, those kind of deals are being done every day and I think what’s happened there is you got sort of these small, medium sized regional players that can aggregate equity capital, get a Fannie/Freddie loan and get deals done. That’s why you’re seeing a fair number of these smaller deals because I think the total, if you look at our sales, I mean I think we have one over $20 million and the rest of them were all sort of smaller bite sized kind of deals. I think that’s where the sweet spot of the transaction market is going to be going forward I think, at least until the big spread and the largest transaction narrows. 
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: This is Michael Bilerman speaking. Going back to sort of the sequential, the moderation potential increase in NOI and thinking about the revenue line that you’re talking about holding occupancy and really not, really having flattish rent, it sounds like that’s predicated on there being an uptick in jobs overall in the U.S. I’m just wondering, in tying that to what happened in the second quarter where it sounds like yield star really pushed occupancy at a little bit at the expense of rent that if you sort of trend, things get a little bit more murky and a little bit worse in the back half of the year that you’re going to see, you many hold occupancy but rents will trail down, in which case you may fall a little bit lighter on your forecast. 
Keith Oden:  Michael, in our planning we are using the latest reforecasting of Witten’s numbers, which shows roughly a 200,000 job decline overall for the year. I’ve seen numbers as low as 100 and as high as 300, but I think that’s in the range of what most people’s expectation is today. So our reforecasting contemplates that that’s kind where we end up. We got another number today that was I guess slightly better than consensus on the number of job losses. But I think that we’re, I now that we have anticipated that level of job loss. Now if it ends up that we get a further revision of the unemployment rate, we end up with a total job loss of something materially higher than the 200,000 for the year, then obviously that’s a different that’s a different situation.  But I think it’s important to note that in our numbers, if you look at the revenue progression second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, there’s really a very modest increase in the top line revenue number. The change in the pick up relative to the first half of the year on a run rate basis is really the fact that fourth quarter last year kind of fell off the chart. There’s two things that happen. Fourth quarter definitely came off significantly in the fourth quarter in ’07. The second thing that happened is that, which hurts our same-store NOI guidance, is the, we have a very bad comparable in the fourth quarter expenses to the ’07 number. We had roughly $2.2 million in adjustments in fourth quarter ’07 that we’re not going to have this year in our expenses, so we’re going to see higher than trend expenses in the fourth quarter, but relative to fourth quarter ’07 actuals, if we just kind of maintain where we are right now with a very modest increase, that’s how you get to the 3% number. So we’re fairly comfortable with that and, again, this is based on a property level ground up reforecast of every community in our same-store pool. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb from UBS.
Alexander Goldfarb – UBS Investment Bank: Just quickly, you mentioned it in the opening comments, I believe, but I didn’t quite catch it. Your revenue outlook for the quarter and then in your guidance with or without the cable and trash, can you just break that out again?
Keith Oden:  Year-to-date, the revenue actuals would’ve been, without the cable and trash income, would’ve been nine-tenths of 1%. 
Alexander Goldfarb – UBS Investment Bank: What about for the quarter?
Keith Oden:  For the quarter it would’ve been two-tenths of a percent. 
Alexander Goldfarb – UBS Investment Bank: Then for the full year, what is the revenue without the cable and trash?
Keith Oden:  The revenue without is roughly, you take 300 basis points off of our same store NOI, off the expense numbers, and we’re in the 4.25% to 5.25% range. So take 300 basis points off of that and it puts you roughly around the 1.5% to 2% for the year. 
Alexander Goldfarb – UBS Investment Bank: Then going quickly just back to the comments on Fannie and Freddie, I mean just in speaking to people there’s some buzz that maybe Fannie and Freddie would be told to focus more on like affordable apartments and less so on like the market great deals that’s sort of product more typical of that REITs have. It sounded from your comments that you don’t believe that to be the case. Can you just expand a little?
Dennis Steen:  The interesting thing about affordable, people think of affordable and they get confused. Affordable can be a lot of things to a lot of different people, but affordable doesn’t mean Section A. It doesn’t mean the 50% of median income. Fannie Mae’s definition of affordable is basically between 100% and 80% of median income. If you take most of the apartment portfolios in America, that’s probably 80% of their portfolio for the apartment REITs as evidenced if you go back to the Archstone transaction last year, Fannie and Freddie provided $12 billion worth of financing and most of those properties were “affordable.” When you think about it, the whole idea of apartments is that apartments because of their nature are affordable relative to the median incomes, even in markets like the District in DC.  So you have a situation where Freddie and Fannie, I guess the biggest risk in Freddie and Fannie today is that they’re going to have a new regulator. There’s a new sheriff in town. That regulator is going to be set up, it’s not going to be in place until probably the first or probably second quarter of 2009 is what we’re hearing about, so OFHEO is going to continue to run them for at least the next eight or nine or ten months and then the regulators going to come in and figure what them to do. But when you get done to it, one of the prime issues that Freddie and Fannie has is that they focus on affordable housing. They get tremendous credit for making multifamily loans, and equity investments for that matter, in multifamily because a multifamily property by definition because of the 80% to 100% of median income test is affordable. They have requirements to participate in affordable housing and multifamily is what they call affordable housing rich for their achievement of those goals. So I don’t, I think we have to really be careful about what afford housing is. Affordable housing often time is confused with this low income aspect and it really isn’t the low income. It’s about people who make 80% to 100% of the median income. 
Alexander Goldfarb – UBS Investment Bank: Then on your debt, how much more secure debt can you issue and still stay within your current investment grade rating?
Keith Oden:  We have about 9% in secured debt and the bottom line is that we could usually double that without any trouble. 
Alexander Goldfarb – UBS Investment Bank: Without any trouble to your existing investment grade rating?
Keith Oden.:  Right. Fundamentally, we are an unsecured borrower and it just is the right thing to do for a public company long-term. But right now you have a dislocation in the market and you can do a Fannie Mae loan in the mid 5s. If we went out into the unsecured bond market, it probably in 7+, so you’ve got this 150 to 250 basis point negative spread on unsecured versus secured. We are a long-term unsecured borrower, but in this time of dislocation when you have spreads that are gapped out beyond what they’ve been in the last ten years, you got to look at secured debt and that’s what a lot of companies are doing and we’re doing the same thing.  But at the end of the day, I think the markets will come back to some resemblance of reasonableness from a spread perspective on the unsecured side and we’ll be back in that market. But we definitely are not going to risk our unsecured ratings. We have alto of bondholders that have confidence that we won’t do that, and we won’t. But we will take advantage within the context of being able to take advantage of this spread differential at this point without sort of getting in trouble with our unsecured bondholders.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Dustin Pizzo from Banc of America.
Dustin Pizzo – Banc of America Securities : Just to focus on Fannie and Freddie for another minute here, on the upcoming agency refinancing that you’re thinking about doing, it sounds like the spread you’re anticipating on that tenure portion of it is about 50 basis points lower than one of your largest peers announced a deal yesterday. Could you just provide a bit more color there and maybe the types of conversations that you’re having with them?
Richard Campo:  Well, we’re having specific conversations with Freddie and Fannie on an ongoing basis. All the numbers we put out are recent quotes that we got in the last week, so I think you have to be careful with… I know with comparing the rates at various times because obviously there’s spread differential and also rate differential and the rates have been bouncing around pretty good here at late. But generally there’s competition between Freddie and Fannie. They both want to do the deals with the best borrowers and the sort of key top borrowers are the ones are going to get the best spreads. Public REITs, including Camden, are some of the number one borrowers that Freddie and Fannie want to lend to. I can’t talk specifically about the last deal, but I can say the numbers that we threw out today in the mid to high 5s are actually quotes from both agencies over the last ten days.
Dennis Steen: Those quotes are based upon a leverage of about 55%, which might be different than the other quotes or other transactions that have been completed recently.
Dustin Pizzo – Banc of America Securities : Then on your guidance, are you guys still factoring in the $200 to $400 million of JV acquisitions. Did you touch on that? 
Richard Campo:  We are lowering those really. I sort of mention that when I talk about being patient and having a, we have a gap right between our fee income and I think Dennis talked about the lower fee income in his comments. You might reiterate that, Dennis. But we really believe that the acquisition market for our fund and our joint ventures is going to improve by the end of the year and early next year. We just are being prudent and not sort of pulling the trigger too fast on that at this point and so that has led to our projections for fee income to be lower this year than we had really anticipated. Dennis, you might want to…
Dennis Steen:  In our guidance, as I mentioned earlier, there was a $0.06 impact due to the delay of any development joint venture starts from the last half of this year into the first part of next year. But we don’t have any projected fee income from development joint ventures in the last half in our current forecast.
Dustin Pizzo – Banc of America Securities : Is that purely new development JVs or could we see you also potentially contribute some of your recently completed or soon to be completed developments into the fund?
Richard Campo:  We would not contribute recently to completed developments to the fund, no. The fund is a value-add fund and that would be sort of a core holding and that’s really not the strategy of the fund and so we would not be doing that, no.
Dustin Pizzo – Banc of America Securities : Then just lastly, what was the original coupon and maturity on the bonds that you repurchased?
Dennis Steen:  Maturity was 2,017eens [sic] with a couple of 5.57%. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Jay Habermann from Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs:  Rick, your comments about this being a tale of two markets and you provided different NOI growth between the better market versus the weaker market, I’m just curious given Keith’s comments about this sort of being more of jobs related impact, your expectations for some of your better markets as I guess you look out over the next six to 12 months, do you expect to see more deterioration in some of the better markets, or really more weakness in some of your again sunbelt supply affected housing markets? 
Richard Campo:  We think the stronger market is going to continue to be strong. When you look at Houston, for example, I mean Houston and Dallas are the top two job markets in the country right now and we think they’re going to continue to be strong. Austin, we’re getting nearly 10% same-store NOI growth there. So the key is really jobs and because those markets even in a slower job growth scenario, still have very reasonable job growth.
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Just again in the event of a more prolonged downturn, do you have expectations in terms of further asset sales? I guess and also can you talk about expense control as you look out in the second half of the year and even beyond?
Richard Campo:  Sure. If we can continue to sell 24-year-old assets with an achieved IRs that we’re achieving and Dennis threw out the $650 reserve cap rate at 5.9%, the actual reserves, the actual real spend on those deals were over $1,100 per door. So when you look at the effective cap rate with real capex, it was like 5.5%. So we will continue to sell assets like that, be able to fund our development and buyback stock and bonds and other things that create value for shareholders long-term. So as long as there’s a Freddie and Fannie financing bid out there and we have these regional players who are willing to be buy these older assets and make assumptions that they’re going to be able to rehab them or do something that we haven’t been able to do today, we’ll continue to do that. Keith, you might comment on the…
Keith Oden:  Jay, on the expense control, I mean when you’re in this kind of environment and we started having all these conversations with our site level folks at the end of the first quarter as we started seeing the job growth estimates come down. You have to…It’s a nickels and dimes business and you have to focus on expense controls and I think that when you take our numbers and make the proper adjustments for the cable and valet waste component, we’re likely to end the year up in roughly a 2% total expense increase and that includes the effective, the bad or the real weak fourth quarter comparison from ’07 on expenses. If you normalize that, we’re closer to 1% year-over-year total expense growth and that’s in light of the fact that we have had to take our property tax estimates up from the original, our original forecast and obviously we have the same cost pressures that everybody else does down the line with regard to payroll, etc.  But if we can, and I’m not saying we could maintain that, but that’s the kind of focus that we’re going to have to have if we start putting together a game plan and ’09 had similar characteristics, revenue growth that ’08 does. So it’s a constant focus. As far as the good news is that we’re coming into a time where many of the technology enhancements that we’ve made onsite. As well as here at the corporate office, we are beginning to see some real tangible benefits from that. One of the things that has been a significant assistance this year in our year-over-year expenses is the fact that just on one example, last year we made the decision strategically to kind of get out of the housekeeping business and we lowered our onsite headcount by about 163 housekeeper positions and outsourced all of that on a contract basis and the year-over-year savings on direct costs is in the $2 million range, never mind all the ancillary costs that go with that headcount.  It’s just something that’s the nature of this business and it’s something that’s even more critical in times where you’re revenue growth is meager. It’s certainly where we are in ’08 and we’ll take a hard look at 2009 as we get a better handle on, hopefully a better handle on when the job growth situation turns around. But yeah, it’s a constant focus for us. 
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs: Rick or Keith, you mentioned the revised disposition target, can you just give us a sense of sort of the non-core pool of assets that you’re looking at for further sales, and again this is over say the next 12/18 months, just how that large could be? 
Richard Campo:  Well generally, I would say that we have at least another couple hundred million, $250 million of assets that we’d like to sell over time. You’re going to add that every year because the whole objective of managing a portfolio is to try to pick the properties that are going to be the better growth properties when you look at total return on investment capital including capex. We’re always going to be a seller of sort of the bottom 5% of the portfolio on an ongoing basis. But I would say that our existing held for sale, we have probably have another $200 to $250 million behind that and just depends on what the cap rates and how the market ends up.  The challenge you obviously have is that when we sell a 24-year-old asset harvest very good return on that asset over a very long period of time and then reinvest that capital into other activities. From an FFO perspective, you generally have a dilutive effect and so you have this sort of balance between improving your NAV and your asset quality versus FFO growth. If you look at the capital recycling we’ve done over the last few years, if we hadn’t done that capital recycling, we’d have FFO that’d be probably I think the differential between sales last year versus this year was like $0.32 a share. So there’s a good… You have to strike a decent balance between selling a lot and having your FFO being diluted. On the other hand, you obviously have to create a long-term young faster growing portfolio until there’s just a balance between those.
Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs:    Just quickly for Dennis, any share repurchase built into the balance of the year?
Dennis Steen:  None.
Richard Campo:  It doesn’t mean we won’t buy any though.
Operator:  Our next question does from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets :   Rick, some of your peers mentioned that June trends particularly had dropped off significantly, but the July picked up. Did you see similar trends in your portfolio?
Richard Campo:  Not really. I think June was fine and July came in according to our plan. Keith, you might want to comment on that more. 
Keith Oden:  Total revenues?
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets : Yeah, they saw traffic across the properties was down a little bit. There was also some softening [inaudible]. Just June was a lot softer than they had anticipated.
Keith Oden:  June was really, from June to July, we were slightly up and dead on with our reforecast, so we think we’ve got certainly on the near-term. We have pretty decent visibility and July was dead on with our reforecast. 
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets : Secondly, Atlanta and Charlotte have held up a lot better for you guys and some of your peers, could you comment on what do you think what’s driving that? Also, Northern Virginia’s been a little softer. Could you comment on that one as well?
Keith Oden:  Atlanta and Charlotte, when you look across, when we kind of lay them out relative to original plan, both of those markets are right on track with what we originally anticipated, so it’s hard to know what anybody else had in their planning. But those markets had kind of unfolded the way we expected. Charlotte was a little bit softer than what we thought in the first quarter, but we had a pretty recovery in the second. The real question on Charlotte that I think has got everybody a little bit on edge there is what happens going forward with bank consolidation. But I think to date that’s been more something of kind of getting people to sit on their hands in nervousness than actual job loss losses and I think that [inaudible] we’re going to end up okay in Charlotte.  Northern Virginia has definitely been a weak spot for us. We report our numbers as DC Metro, but the reality is that our issue and DC Metro has been Northern Virginia. Our District assets have held up nicely as have our Maryland assets. If you average those together, they’re probably in the 1.5%/2% range on growth and that’s been offset by the negative at Northern Virginia. We actually had a pretty decent recovery in the June/July timeframe in Northern Virginia. It’s probably not going to get back on plan by the end of the year, but certainly it was encouraging to see an uptick in the Northern Virginia market.  On a comp set basis, we’ve actually trailed the comp set in Northern Virginia. Part of that is that Northern Virginia, you got almost bifurcate that between assets in Arlington that sort of like they’re part of the district. We have a couple in that category and then assets in Loudon County which really kind of march to their own drummer, and unfortunately that’s been a pretty negative beat for the last nine months. 
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets : Finally, Rick, a question for you: You’ve mentioned the last call and on this call that you think 2010 and 2011 are going to be great years for the multifamily sector based upon supply trends at this point. I’m just curious what your thoughts are preliminary on 2009 at this point?
Richard Campo:  It depends on job growth obviously. I think that most of the consensus job number has 2009 picking up. I don’t think anybody on a consensus basis has a deep recession planned, so I think that 2009 is better than 2008, but I don’t think it’s a barn burner type of recovery like we had in the last cycle. Because what you have going on right now is you don’t have a true recession. I mean even though we talk about our challenged markets and they were down 2.9% from an NOI perspective, that’s not a recession. I mean if we go into the recession, you’re down 5%/6%/7% in a deep recession and I think that when you start looking, it just depends on job growth obviously.  Ultimately if we have sort of a get along/get along and we stop losing jobs and start adding a few, then 2009 is better than 2008. You should have an acceleration of job growth into 2010 and 2011 and that’s why we think that those could be really good years for multifamily. When you look at multifamily permits, they haven’t dropped off the edge of the earth yet because you had a lot of deals that have been funded prior to the really teeth of the credit crunch coming, especially from a construction perspective. So you have I think over the next six months, we’re going to see starts fall of dramatically, so you’ll have a great supply scenario along with decent job growth that should make 2009 better than 2008 and then 2010 and ’11 really doing really well.  We actually had a, I’ve done some analysis on a recession scenario, sort of an early ‘90s style recession, and it’s interesting that even in a recession scenario, you don’t have the same kind of declines in NOIs across the board the way you did either in the ‘90s or in the 2000 recession and primarily because supply. Supply has not peaked. Supply has been going down over the last few years. We’re probably 30% less supply than we had in 2006. When you think about what’s happened in multifamily, you have supply that’s lower. You have the homebuilding mentality is over. Some people think that the percentage of home ownership, which the Bush Administration was trying to get to 70%, sort of got to 69ish. Some people think the home ownership percentage is going to low 60s and when you have this mentality where your customers aren’t running out to buy houses and even if they want to buy a house, they have to a real down payment down now and they have much stringent underwriting criteria given the housing bust. So you have a pretty decent outlook even in a recessionary scenario for multifamily, so I think that we feel confident borrowing even in a major recession that even multifamily is going to be in a pretty good position middle half of 2009 and into 2010 and ’11.
Operator:  Our next question will come from Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets :  Two or three questions here: First, is there anything about this experience that you’re getting sort of the proportionate share of downside at least currently as you said because of jobs that might cause you to tweak your sort of geographic footprint over the longer term.
Richard Campo:  No, and the reason being is that this is an unprecedented time. Who could’ve predicted that you would have the massive dislocation that we’ve had in the home business and at the same time had a situation where the business is not that bad, right. You think about it and why we talked about: Yeah, we have challenged markets and we have all these headwinds and is Fannie and Freddie going to be around and all that and at the end of the day, we have 1% same-store NOI growth. Well it’s not five, but it’s not negative six. You’ve got situation where clearly the metrics aren’t as good and they’ve been falling, but it’s not as bad as a homebuilder market or some of the financial institutions that have taken their hit. So from that perspective, I think we have to be careful that we aren’t sort of in group speak about how horrible it is because it really isn’t that bad, and the fundamentals of this business are poised to do a lot better over the next three to four years. So the other thing I think is really interesting is when you think about capital, everybody wants to know about how we’re going to fund our development pipeline and gee do they need capital and all that and I think those are great and important concerns. But when you think about competition for capital, the public companies are well positioned now. We’re sitting on a billion three of dry powder with our value-add fund, plenty of dry powder in our own lines of credit and credit capacities, yet people are worried about capital? The interesting is the private guys are desperate for capital. They don’t have any alternatives for raising a lot of capital today, so I think what’s going to happen is you’re going to have a major shift in the strength of the public company, these would be the private guys and the competition for deals is going to be a lot less, which should in fact improve our ability to complete transactions in 2009 and 2010.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets : Another question on sort of job-related to the jobs and you again mentioned in the past that’s all about the jobs and not about the shadow supply or whatever. But if it is about the jobs, then why wouldn’t have bad debt gone up? If it’s about jobs, then you would’ve thought that that number might have deteriorated and it didn’t. So can you sort of reconcile that for me?
Keith Oden:  Rich, if you think about where we are in the big picture, even though the job situation has clearly been deteriorating, I think the numbers came out today and we were at 5.7% unemployment rate nationally. 5% in the old days, 5.5%/5% used to be considered frictional and structural unemployment, so we’re not that far removed from that. So even though it’s been deteriorating and jobs have been going away for sure, it’s clear that most of our, the folks in our communities have been able to replace their jobs with another job. It may not be the one that they had; it may not be paying what it was paying them, but most of them have been able to replace their jobs. Those that haven’t, move out and move, double up, and do all the other things that happen during a job losses or a recessionary time. But counterbalancing all of that is the fact that just in our portfolio alone, last year we were losing 20% of our residents to buy homes, and today’s that 14%. That 6% swing in that one component is a huge difference in terms of what our net exposure is, if you will, to move outs that have to be replaced. So interesting, the bad debt, even on our delinquencies, as you look delinquencies, we haven’t really deteriorated, so I think there’s something to be said for people pay their cell phone bill and they pay their rent and then the rest of it they try to make ends meet. I don’t think that this is not unique to us. If you look across our markets where kind of look at a Las Vegas bad debt delinquency rates year-over-year versus a market like Houston where you wouldn’t expect to see any change, we really just don’t see any difference across these challenged markets. So I don’t… I think a lot of it has to do with the shifting nature of where our move outs are going and what the underlying component of that is so…
Richard Compo:  It’s also about credit quality. I mean we will maintain our credit quality. When you get down to, you want to turbo your occupancy, try to push rents, you lower your credit standards and you get a bunch of people in there that won’t pay and I think that’s something that the multifamily industry has grown up knowing is that, and the professionally managed ones, the public companies understand that if you drop your credit standards, you’re going to have higher bad debt. I think that the industry has done a good job of making sure that that they didn’t drop, they didn’t sort of have a gut wrench reaction and say, “Oh my god, I better get a warm body in there whether that warm body is going to pay me or not.”
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets : Last question is on the Fannie and Freddie angle, and I hear you. It’s a profitable business for Fannie and Freddie and on that basis there should be no reason for them to curtail their lending practices. But on the sort of the negative sort of skeptical side of that, I mean doesn’t put it the multifamily industry in a bit of a competitive disadvantage? Fannie and Freddie know how critical of a role that they’re playing in your business right now, if it’s not the only game in town, it’s certainly one of the only games in town from a capital raising standpoint. So I mean how does that play into the role of them potentially getting more aggressive with you, and not just you, but everybody? I mean do they sort of have you by the baseballs, I guess?
Richard Campo:  It’s interesting because it’s sort of like the don’t want to kill the golden goose, right. They’re making all this money on multifamily, they have to be careful that they don’t widen their spreads to a point where they chill the market and so you have a situation where the spreads actually have tightened because they did get a little ahead of themselves in the first quarter and you saw a drop in originations. I think the good news is that because Freddie and Fannie are both big institutions, they compete against each other so you have a situation where there is a competitive response to the market given that they both want to do the deals, right.  Now if we only had one, then you might have an interesting situation. But when you got down to the ultimate market condition, you have two competitors that are definitely dominating the market and what they’re doing is they’re trying to entrench themselves so that when the CMBS market does come back, and we know it will at some point, then they’ll have an upper hand and be able to continue to sort of protect their market share. So I think there’s a balance between how much they can charge and how much a borrower can afford and they’re playing that balancing game between, they know they’re the only date at the dance and they are using that power to get the best borrowers, so I mean marginal borrowers at the end of the line and are going to be the ones that are going to get the widest spreads and the more sort of difficult underwriting. So I think they’re, I don’t see them getting to the point where they’re a monopoly saying, “Okay, guys, here it is. Take it or leave it.” 
Keith Oden:  Rich, they have changed the game too. If you look at what they’ve done on underwriting standards and loan to value in the last 12 months, it’s a totally different game. On a risk-adjusted basis, whatever spread they’re getting today is a heck of a lot richer than it was 12 months ago.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Green Tree Advisors.
Haendel St. Juste – Green Tree Advisors:   Couple questions. Actually could you share with me the disposition cap rate for the assets sold during the second quarter?
Dennis Steen:  It was 5.9% cap rate based upon $6.50 a door and 2008 annualized NOI. 
Haendel St. Juste – Green Tree Advisors:  Just for the assets sold during the second quarter?
Dennis Steen:  Oh, during the second quarter only?
Haendel St. Juste – Green Tree Advisors: Those were the ones that were subsequent.
Dennis Steen:  That was a year-to-date number I just gave you. 
Haendel St. Juste – Green Tree Advisors: I’m actually looking for more of the assets that were sold.
Dennis Steen:  In the second quarter?
Haendel St. Juste – Green Tree Advisors: The ones that were sold after the quarter please.
Dennis Steen:  It’s very similar. I don’t have it broken out. I’ve got the four – Lakeview, Arbors, Briar Oaks, and Woodview and it was just right at 6% at $6.50 a door.
Richard Campo:  The actual capex, Haendel, was $1,168 (bucks) per door, which would give you a, if you wanted the real capex which includes the real capex with the cash flows Dennis described from the 5.8. 
Haendel St. Juste – Green Tree Advisors: How does the pricing compare to your expectations? With that, can you share any thoughts on that decline in pricing from peak values? 
Richard Campo:  Sure, the interesting thing is we don’t think there’s been a significant decline in value from the peak values because these kind of assets always were sort of in the 5.5% to 6% range because of the high capex aspect of them and age and sort of location issues, so I don’t think that they’ve gone, the prices have changed that much. You might have had some lunatic who would’ve paid a four cap rate in the past, but I don’t think that really is the case for these kinds of assets.  During the negotiation process, we did sort of a mid or sort of a low to high in where we thought the pricing would come in and there was definitely some renegotiations that went on with these assets. But generally speaking, the renegotiations were 1% to 2% max and on an asset like a $25 million deal in Austin, Briar Oaks, you might’ve given up $100 to $200,000 to get the deal done because at the end of the day the market just believed that it needed to retrade whether it was $100,000 on a $25 million deal or $400,000 at the end. It didn’t really matter that much. So we didn’t have any significant retrades that caused us to have to go back to the players. The other thing we had was we had a good group of buyers. There was 10 to 12 regional buyers on every asset and we had a good sort of process in being able to sell these assets.
Haendel St. Juste – Green Tree Advisors: Next question: Considering your recent asset sales and your relatively strong liquidity, what are your current thoughts on capital allocation today in terms of buying back more bonds, the opportunity there versus stock buybacks and other opportunities? 
Richard Campo:  Well the key there is we’ve always said that if we can sell assets like this and then buy our stock back, it makes a lot of sense. We bought $230 million of stock bought. We have authorization to buy another $270 million of stock, plus or minus, and we’re going to be opportunistic with acquiring the stock and bonds, balancing that with doing it on a leverage neutral basis. So we’ve sort of, we wanted to see how these dispositions went. We have another group of dispositions in the pipeline that are going to be sold over the next quarter or so. I think the key is being patient and being opportunistic in both acquiring stock and bonds. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to us to go out and sell assets and buy other assets when we can buy our stock on an effective basis at a pretty attractive relative to what we could buy the existing asserts. We will continue to buy assets and do development in our fund in joint ventures because the rate of return we get on our equity is obviously far higher and we get better leverage from that perspective. 
Haendel St. Juste – Green Tree Advisors: Lastly, you gave color on year-to-date or actually different in your strong markets versus weak market, do you expect that the relative gap to close over the next six months between your strongest and weakest market widen, any color you’d like to share on perspective thoughts on those two roots of assets or markets relative to each other?
Keith Oden:  Yeah, in our reforecast handout, we expected we’ll end up about where we are right now by rolling our reforecast through on top of our first half results. I just don’t see the dynamics that are in place right now, not going to change in the challenged markets. We’re still in pretty good share and the markets that are not being challenged, a big chunk of that comes from our Texas exposure and those may actually get better over the next six months than the first half so…
Operator:  Our next question comes from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Just one more quick question on Fannie and Freddie because I know, Rick, you’re very knowledgeable on this particular topic. Is it your view that the government, you mentioned that their liquidity position is the best today that it’s been in a long time. Is it your view that the government liquidity and OFHEO and/or the Fed, that liquidity that they’re providing there is for more than just to stem what are expected to be big losses coming on the single-family side that they’ll actually allow Fannie and Freddie to use government liquidity to then lend on to the apartments?
Richard Campo:  Absolutely. I think they’re worried about the losses but Freddie and Fannie pulled so much of America’s mortgage market that without Freddie and Fannie today, there would be no home lending. They’re 90% of the entire single-family mortgage market today because of the meltdown in these mortgage market that these the private mortgage market is going on. So it’s not about subsidizing multifamily or subsidizing single-family, it’s about creating the mortgage market and keeping the mortgage market going. If the government didn’t give the expressed backing of Fannie and Freddie’s bond’s I mean you would have a meltdown that is hard to imagine what happens if they did fail. So I think the government, that’s why the government has basically thrown the towel in and said, “All right, we can’t constrain their growth. We’ll put in a stronger regulator and that regulator over time will make sure they don’t do speculative investments. But the point that the Bush Administration had about Fannie and Freddie over the last, their entire terms of the Administration was that they were getting this implied government guarantee and going out and making aggressive investments. All the problems they had with financial and accounting issues and executive comp and all that stuff that the government still couldn’t get control of them during that timeframe and now they’ve just thrown the towel in because if they hadn’t thrown the towel in, you’d have a huge meltdown in the financial markets. So I don’t see that as a threat to the multifamily business because you think about the losses in homes, they got to make money somewhere and multifamily is their most profitable least risky loan.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets: So you don’t see a risk that the government would say, “You need to preserve capital on the multifamily side to try to stem some of the losses on the single-family side”?
Richard Campo:  I don’t see that at all. The risk that the regulator comes in…I think the biggest risk is the regulator, the new regulator comes in middle of ’09 and says, “All right, your risk-based capital needs to be higher than it is today.” Now OFHEO has already come in and said both on Freddie and Fannie that they’re adequately capitalized today and so the ultimate risk obviously is if you do have the regulator come in and say, “Gee, we want you to have more capital,” then either have to raise capital or lower their ability to make loans.” But I don’t think anybody sees that right now. 
Operator:
Richard Campo:  Thanks a lot for your participation, and we will see most of you I hope next month in Austin at our Investor Meeting. So thanks a lot and we will talk to you soon.

Operator: Hello and welcome to the Camden Property Trust first quarter 2008 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). Now I would like to turn the conference over to Kim Callahan.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to advise everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete first quarter 2008 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which may be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I will turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Rick Campo: Thanks Kim and good morning. While reviewing our results for the first quarter, I was reminded by the opening words from the Charles Dickens' book, 'A Tale of Two Cities'. You remember those they start out as -- it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. So Camden's market performance for the first quarter can be described as 'A Tale of Two Markets.' First, strong markets with positive operating fundamentals that have avoided the housing debacle, these markets include Houston, Dallas, Austin, Charlotte, Raleigh, Denver and Coastal California. Then our markets that are at the epicenter of the housing bust, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, Suburban Washington D.C. and Inland California. These markets are experiencing job loses related to the continued unwinding of the housing-related employment and an increased shadow supply of rental condominium and housing. Operating fundamentals remain challenging in these markets. First quarter same-property net operating income was 1.4% in 2007. Revenue growth was up 1.5% in the same period. It's interesting to contrast revenue and NOI growth in strongest versus the most challenged markets. Revenue growth for the strongest markets increased 4.1%, compared to a 1.6% decline in the challenged markets. Net operating income increased 4.8% in the strongest markets, versus a 2.4% decline in the weakest markets. We think that the underperformance in these challenge markets will continue through next year until the housing markets and the overall economy improves. Our management teams on-site continue to be focused on providing living excellence to our residents and are up to the task in our almost challenged markets. Camden continues to enjoy a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. During the quarter, we closed an additional $150 of capital commitments for our value-added fund, bringing the total capital commitments to-date of $300 million. With Camden's capital and the use of 70% leverage in the fund that should give us capital in excess of $1.2 billion to fund our acquisition program and our development. We continue to make progress on the completion of lease-up of our development pipeline, cost budgets are intact and leasing is generally on plan. We continue to evaluate our pipeline in light of market conditions that delayed the start of several projects. The credit crunch and negative investors' sentiment should lead to a substantial slowdown in multi-family constructions starts this year, while we expect the rest of 2008 to be challenging. Lower supply and moderating construction starts should foster excellent market conditions for development deliveries in 2009 and in the 2011 for developers who can't access capital today. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Keith Oden.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. Overall, our operations came in slightly better than planned for the first quarter, although as Rick mentioned there was more variability to plan in our individual markets than we would normally expected to see in the first quarter of a forecast period. This variability just highlights the uncertainty that the well-documented cross-currents affecting our markets have created. It also reflects the impact of the reduced job growth for cash across our markets. We know the job growth is the metric most highly correlated with NOI growth and that was evident in our results for the quarter. Overall, occupancy for the quarter rose slightly from last quarter to an average of 93.8% and has continued to trend upward. Our most recent occupancy rate was 94.3%. Rental rates were down slightly from last quarter, but the slight decrease was more than offset by an increase in other income, primarily the continued ramp-up in cable television and Valet Waste discount. Overall, traffic in our portfolio was flat versus the prior year quarter, but the distribution of plusses and minuses mirrors our NOI performance by market, with Houston, Dallas and Denver, showing big gains in traffic, offset by weakness in Florida, Las Vegas, Phoenix and charlotte. Our turnover rate for the quarter was 53% in line with the first quarter of 2007 and down slightly from last quarter. The most interesting data point for the quarter was the percentage of residents moving out to purchase a home which fell to 14% for the quarter. This is the most concrete evidence we have to indicate that the single family housing mess is causing our residents to delay or cancel the home purchase option. The current environment has significant challenges for our residents, slowing job growth, falling consumer confidence, rising cost of food and energy have taken their toll, and actually there is a concern that bad debts may rise. But for 2007, our bad debt expense was about $6 per unit per month or roughly one-half of 1%. And for the first quarter of 2008, bad debt was $5 per unit per month which is consistent with our long-term trends. So far, so good on that front. The cost trends associated with the oversupplied housing markets have been well chronicled over the past three quarters. Subprime mortgage defaults or closures following home sales, reduced job growth, but a greater propensity to rents and moderate and declining multi-family deliveries just to name a few. We continue to believe that the net-net of all of these factors will be a slight positive for multi-family performance as 2008 unfolds. Our same-store NOI growth came in at 1.4 for the quarter, which was slightly better than our plan and against our full-year guidance of 2.75% growth at the full-year midpoint. You should not interpret this to mean that we are projecting a strong recovery in fundamentals in the second half of the year. Last year, our first quarter and second quarter results were quite strong, at a 6% same-store NOI growth and the second quarter was up 2.1% sequentially over the first quarter. The subprime meltdown began in the summer and our portfolio got slammed. Occupancy rates dropped in the fourth quarter to 93.6% and we are just now seeing our occupancy stabilized at higher levels. Our forecast assumes that we maintained our occupancy rates in the 94.5% to 95% range for the second half of the year. In addition to the first four months of the year, our other income is running roughly $250,000 per month ahead of plan. Most of the increases from cable television, Valley Waste and fewer waived fees. We expect this positive variance to be maintained, which is equal to about 75 basis points of same-store NOI pickup. The combination of the occupancy increase and the other income pickup on top of the favorable comparables in third and fourth quarter provides the basis for our forecast to maintain our full year same-store NOI range. The most serious risk to our 2008 results is a further reduction in job growth in our markets. Our original guidance was based on aggregate job growth estimate in Camden's markets of roughly 290,000 jobs. Our updated forecast cut that estimate in half to roughly 140,000 jobs. If the job outlook worsens, or if we fail to see any positive impact from the unraveling of the housing mess, we will have to revisit our guidance. The key leasing period of May and June will likely give us much better visibility of what the full-year 2008 should be and should our May and June results disappoint and cause us to revise our thinking about our full-year guidance, you will be the first to hear about it. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mr. Dennis Steen.
Dennis Steen: Thanks, Keith. Camden reported FFO for the first quarter of 2008 of $52.3 million or $0.89 per diluted share, at the midpoint of our prior guidance of $0.87 to $0.91 per share and equal to the first call mean estimate for the first quarter. Our performance at the midpoint of our guidance range is reflective of same-store and total property net operating income results for the quarter, in line with our expectations, in the absence of any significant non-recurring or unusual items in all other categories of non-property income and expenses. On the transaction front, during the first quarter we sold Camden Ridgeview, a 24-year-old asset in Austin, Texas recording a gain on sale of $6.1 million, which is included in discontinued operations. Additionally, we sold 4100 square feet of retail space adjacent to our regional office in Las Vegas and recorded a gain on sale of $1.1 million, which is included in continuing operations. Neither of these gains are included in our quarterly FFO. We are continuing to pursue our strategy of selling over assets in our portfolio. We have begun marketing our next round of dispositions and we have substantial interest in this portfolio. We still forecast 2008 total disposition volume in the range of a $175 million to $380 million. Moving to our development activities. We currently have 15 development communities underway with a total projected costs of $920 million in our on balance sheet and joint venture pipelines. Four of the communities are completed and should stabilize over the next two quarters. Of the remaining 11 under construction, eight have initiated leasing activities. Projected costs are continuing to come in slightly below budget and leasing absorption and rental rates are generally in line with our expectations. We are still projecting up to a $100 million in on balance sheet starts and $200 million to $400 million in joint ventures starts for 2008. Taking a look at our capital structure. As volatility in the debt and equity markets continues, we continue to be rewarded by the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. As of March 31, we had just over $400 million available under our $600 million line of credit. Additionally, we have very manageable debt maturities over the next several years. For the remainder of 2008, we have a $189 million of scheduled maturities, consistent entirely of maturing mortgage debt. The vast majority of which matures in the fourth quarter. We currently do not anticipate tapping the capital markets for the remainder of 2008. Although spreads on unsecured debt have been declining recently, they still remain high. Due to our current low level of secured debt, which totals only 10% of our gross asset value at March 31, we do have the ability to add significant new secured debt to our balance sheet if it continues to be a more attractive alternative to unsecured debt. During the first quarter, we repurchased 690,400 common shares at an average price per share of $43.41 for a total of $30 million. Over the past four quarters, we have completed the total of $230 million in common share repurchases under our prior $250 million authorization. Also during the quarter, our Board approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $250 million. Moving on to 2008 guidance. We are maintaining the full-year FFO guidance we issued in early February of $3.60 to $3.80 per diluted share. We have made no changes to the key 2008 financial outlook assumptions we laid out in our prior quarter supplemental package. For the second quarter of 2008, we expect projected FFO per diluted share within the range of $0.87 to $0.91. The midpoint of $0.89 per share represents flat performance as compared to the first quarter 2008 results, primarily resulting from; number one, a projected $0.02 per share increase in property net operating income as revenue growth from our stabilized portfolio and communities under lease-up is projected to more than offset our seasonal increase in property expenses we experienced in the second and third quarters of each year. This positive increase is entirely offset by a projected $0.02 per share increase in interest expense, due primarily to a reduction in the capitalization of interest on our development pipeline. This is due to the significant number of apartment units completed during the first quarter of 2008 and the units to be completed in the second quarter of 2008 for the communities under construction and currently in lease-up in our development pipeline. Development dilution will begin to decline in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, as we make progress towards stabilization of a significant portion of the development pipeline which is currently in lease-up. At this time, I would like to open the call up to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Keith, I hope you can expand first on the, what we should expect as we go through the quarters this year for the same-store revenue growth, given the (inaudible) ramp, just to hit that 3.5 point seems like better ramp. I know you talked about it some. But if you could just talk about may be the level of revenue growth we should see as the quarters go on?
Keith Oden: Well, the revenue growth is going to, the pick-up will be primarily in the third and fourth quarter. And a big piece of it is attributable to the occupancy rates that we had in our third and fourth quarter of '07. And I mentioned the fourth quarter was actually 93.6%. We were a little bit better than that in the third quarter, but we were trending down for the whole quarter. So, I think you can expect to see the revenue pick up in the third and fourth. We do have some pretty modest rental increases there that are modeled, but again they were very modest given our original guidance of NOI range in two in a quarter to three in a quarter. So, I think you will see a little bit more impact in the third and fourth. The other thing that it running through our numbers that you will see in the total revenues not necessarily in the rental revenues is the outperformance on other income. The run rate through the first four months of the year is in the $250,000 range and we believe that most of that is sustainable as run rate recurring.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Okay. And on the move out to buy a home, how is that looking in some of these most challenging markets? And how is that impacting when you said net-net housing prices are helping apartment, how does it playing on those markets from the move out?
Keith Oden: It's interesting because we look at it market-by-market, it's all over the map. Actually there is some, for example, in Tampa. It was quite low, which a little bit countering to the view that world saw on the part on housing prices and there might actually be more of a demand, because the price structure is shifted down and also you had more of an impact from the lower price point communities. But it's really all over the map and again the quarterly number like that can be pretty volatile. So, I think the takeaway is really the difference between where we were last year at this time which was roughly 20% move out to home purchases and where we are today which is 14% for the quarter and it doesn't sound like a big deal. But 6% differential on your backdoor turn rate turns out to be a big deal on our portfolio. So I think the takeaway is more the fourteen and people see where that goes for the second quarter and throughout the year.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Okay. My last question is on the maturing debt this year, what's the plan to refinance that?
Keith Oden: Right now, we have enough liquidity in our balance sheet that we don't need to refinance it. So right now, we're going to actually paid it off with balances outstanding under our line of credit.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Okay. Would you consider tapping either the unsecured market or what looks better that versus some of the agency financing today?
Rick Campo: Well, the markets are changing dramatically and over the last month or so, the actual spreads in the unsecured markets have actually come back in, somewhere between 150 basis point to 200 basis points, So, we're just going to stay tuned to the markets. And if the unsecured market is still expensive, we have the ability to go out and get some debts from the agency. So, we'll just stay tuned to it, but the good thing is we don't have to go out into the markets anytime soon.
Rick Campo: And fundamentally, we're an unsecured borrower. It's just much more flexible financing to use with our model. But at the end of the day, if there is a substantial differential between the cost with unsecured versus the secured trending of Freddie type of facility, we'll look at that and we have a lot of capacity to be able to reduce secure debt, but we will rather stay in the unsecured market. But if there is a 200 basis points differential, we'll explore the agency debt.
Michael Bilerman - Citigroup: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Alex Goldfarb at UBS
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Good morning.
Keith Oden: Good morning, Alex
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Just going back to clarify on the revenue. In the first quarter, the 1.5% revenue growth, that includes or excludes the ancillary income the cable and trash and all that stuff?
Rick Campo: That includes.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: The 1.5% includes that, okay. And then, you said that the ancillary income is running $250,000 a month ahead of schedule?
Rick Campo: It is $250 ahead of plan.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Okay. So then if I interpret your comments about the back half of the year, it sounds like you're just expecting that occupancy will get back to where it was in that $94.50 to $95, so that's where the both the pick-up will come from?
Rick Campo: That is correct. But it's also – Alex, it's not like we are having to make a huge lease from where we are today. We closed out last week at 94.3% occupied. But more importantly, we were at 92.8 lease and given in our portfolio is as if you'll trend forward 30 days from the lease percentage that's going to be add 200 basis points to it, that's your occupancy percentage. So trending forward of that number, we're looking at 94.8% about within the next two to three weeks.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Okay.
Rick Campo: So coming off 93.8 number for the quarter, that's a pretty good pickup and our forecast is that we can get to that and maintain it even though our rental increases have necessarily been extremely moderate across the portfolio and it's really kind of as Rick mentioned we've got some pretty decent rental increases in the market that are not getting slammed and we've got less than planned increases than the others. But the YieldStar model is calibrated to the 95%. We think we're pretty closed to getting back to that level and our expectation is that we can maintain it through our stronger leasing periods.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Okay. And then just want to go back on the difference between the secured and the unsecured spreads. If you can just comment, I didn't no if you were commenting that unsecured is now a 150 to 200 over or that's how much they've come in. So if you could just clarify that and also comment on what the spread would have to be where the unsecured would start to look attractive to you guys again?
Rick Campo: Yeah. The comment I made earlier is how much that come in. Our unsecured spread is we sit here today is probably somewhere in the 275 to 300 basis points over range. And on the agency side, we are probably looking at somewhere around 2 to 2 in the quarter. So, sitting at 50 to 75 over, it's still might make sense to use more secured debt. But we'll just have to once again wait and see after the job report today settles down exactly what the spreads are going to be going forward.
Keith Oden: And I think the issue on how, how wide the spread has to be to start focusing on a little bit on secured debt. You do have to remember though on secured debt, you have a lot of other costs associated with it, not only cost associated with the environmental and titles and all that that you don't have in the unsecured world. And you also have a lot of flexibility issues. So they don't have to right on top of each other to make a decision to stay in the unsecured market. And as I said before, we are an unsecured borrower. We will continue to an unsecured borrower and that the margins doesn't make sensible, we'll be some of that. But clearly month ago the spreads on unsecured bonds were like 425 over plus or minus versus agency debt of 200 and we have a spread that wide. We got to look hard at agency debt.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Okay. And then just my final question is, are you seeing any difference between the pay patterns of folks in your housing affected markets first, the non-housing affected markets?
Keith Oden: No, we really haven't. It's the bad debt expense that I gave you earlier. You would look at it across the markets, there is not a nickel's worth of difference in them.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: And delinquencies?
Keith Oden: Delinquencies are in good shape.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Thank you.
Keith Oden: People pay their cell phones first and then the ramp.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Perfect. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wachovia.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia: Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions. I get jump around, have you guys been active repurchasing shares after the quarter end?
Rick Campo: No, we have not.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia: Okay. And then I am curious on the D.C. market. Likewise, how is D.C. fairing, I guess subsequent to quarter end, are you seeing any improvements in the leasing space or price and year-over-year revenue growth?
Rick Campo: The continuation of the same that our challenge in the D.C. market is really Northern Virginia. The D.C. Metro assets are doing great. The Maryland, more north of urban assets are doing fine. It's really just the Arlington, Northern Virginia area where we are just getting hammered with the single-family home competition and to some extent, condos. But there was a fair amount of new supply that was in the process that main delivered. We are part of that. We got a couple of comments of pretty good size lease-up. And it's actually going quite well right now, but that's because a couple of competitors that are in the area have finally gotten over their hurdle of like near way to their lease up. So, it's combination of all three those things, but it's clearly the -- our challenge is the Northern Virginia piece of that D.C. Metro.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia: I guess two follow-up on that, what has been your experience out of the Dallas market and are you able to may be give us indication of what the central revenue growth was inside the Beltway versus outside if you have that number?
Rick Campo: I don't know have that broken out in front of me, but we can get that for you. In the Dallas area it's actually better than the Arlington area. We've got a lease up that's underway there that's off to a good start and I think that we're going to be okay there. But it's definitely, our challenges are concentrated in the Arlington, Northern Virginia.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia: And just last question is in terms of the financing market today, half of the agency, I'm curious what do you find I call the next best comparable loan-to-value that's available to you and/or pricing, I am not sure (inaudible) from the same lender, I guess I am just curious that you have passed through Fannie or Freddie, what the next best alternative?
Rick Campo: The next best alternative would be life companies. You still have life companies out there that are active. They are active a little bit slower on the loan-to-value. You could still get Freddie and Fannie at 70% plus or minus loan-to-value depending on the product location and the sponsor. Life companies tend to be little more with a low leverage, so you are going to see some 50% to 60% of LPVs on those. And they are going to have a little bit wider spread as well.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford at KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Have you guys given us what the revenue growth would have been this quarter without the ancillaries?
Rick Campo: No, we did not that to you, but it would be 750, 000 for the quarter plus or minus.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Question on guidance, you assume the midpoint of our 2Q guidance, it looks like you need about $0.91 for each one of the last two quarters of the year to hit the low end. Given the flattish nature of top line growth from here, what do you expect it's going to drive sort to the sequential quarterly FFO growth in the back half?
Dennis Steen: Yeah. Karin, this is Dennis. As I look out to the next couple of quarters, one of the things you have to kind of model in is a development dilution is going to probably be less by $0.04 to $0.06 in the second half of the year. As Keith mentioned, we're going to have higher occupancy in the balance of the year. We also have lighter expenses in the fourth quarter compared to any other of our first week quarters and we'll have a slight pick up in the fee income relating to our fund activity. So we feel very comfortable with our guidance range and being able to be up in the midpoint of that range.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That's helpful. Final question is you mentioned delaying some development, did you expect any abandoned pursuit costs later on this year?
Dennis Steen: In the quarter, we actually had abandoned pursuit costs of about $350 I believe, but we are monitoring our spend on the projects that we are working on and we don't have a big amount of pursuit costs delays that delayed at this point. The delays are primarily projects that we already either own land on where we can sort of time the timings to make sure that we wanted to deliver into late '09 and early 2010 time frame. So the more projects already owned that we're going to delay, but that deal cost that we incurred in a quarter with projects that we clearly abandoned which would they were couple Phoenix and in Las Vegas I believe, so at the end of the day we don't have a lot of big pursuit costs issues that we have to worry about.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: On the land that you owned if ultimately end up deciding to sell, do you think you have to take any write-down from value on that?
Dennis Steen: No.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay.
Dennis Steen: We evaluate our land positions on an ongoing basis and we are still in our land at good numbers.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christine Kim of Deutsche Bank.
Christine Kim - Deutsche Bank: Hey, good morning. Keith, could you may be provide a little bit more color on what do you see in terms of traffic patterns, and also if you are seeing any material change in your closing rates?
Keith Oden: Actually our traffic even though it's moved around flat year-over-year with the prior year, prior year first quarter of '07, we were up about 20% from the fourth quarter of '07, but that's typical. The fourth quarter is always our lowest traffic point. So that's not unusual at all. And we were basically flat to the prior year -- the thing that is very interesting and it certainly higher than with the kind of results that Rick pointed out the haves and have-nots in the market. If you drill down to the traffic patterns, it's very consistent where markets where we have the most challenges from the oversupply conditions. They had relative to what we would normally see in the first quarter, traffic was down across the board. Fortunately in those markets that we have not had those issues Dallas, Houston, Denver, Austin, Charlotte traffic actually was up pretty nicely. So it really kind of is market driven and what's going on in that market. But net-net our traffic was no worse than it was first quarter of '07. But first quarter of '07 was a pretty good quarter for us both from traffic standpoint and through rents that NOI was up about 6% and we were up sequentially, first to second almost two, first and second quarter likes we were pretty good. So it's kind of encouraging to me that we've got the same traffic levels that overall in the portfolio that we had then. Closing percentages in our portfolio are target for closing percentage is 40% and we are within 4, 5 percentage points of that on any given reporting period and that really hasn't changed.
Christine Kim - Deutsche Bank: Great. And my other question is, you have been tracking obviously move out to home purchases, but are you tracking move out to rent other product types like single family home or condos?
Keith Oden: We do. We track move out to rent and we also don't necessarily know what they rented, but we do track move out to rent other varieties and for the quarter that was 2.7% and that the delta in that from the prior quarter is about 1.7%, so you kind of want to think of it is combined those two together. We've always had some component to move out to rent. We just started tracking it last year as a separate line item. So, there is some piece of that that's going from our apartment to rent something else that it's not a big part of it. Not a big part of the incremental change.
Christine Kim - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great.
Keith Oden: The other thing I think you need to – that's kind of interesting to add on to that thought is that we have started seeing anecdotally people who are moving out of condos because they don't like the management and condo management and single-family home management is very different than a professionally managed property and we are starting to see people moving out of the condos and houses going back to apartments to some extent. Also we have seen some move-ins that some demand has been created by people who have been renting condos, renting house and being for closed on with the investors who are running or keeping the rent and not paying their mortgages, so that when the foreclosure happens, the resident gets [mortgage gets] set up to rent. So, they basically just evict the people and then they have to go find another place. And we've seen a fair amount that going on in Las Vegas and in Florida.
Christine Kim - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks, guys.
Rick Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dustin Pizzo of Banc of America Securities
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Hi. Good morning, guys. Keith, just a follow-up on that last one. Have you seen any anecdotal evidence of an increase in renters from the increased mark-in efforts you had towards those who actually foreclosed on their loans and not necessarily people who may have been renting those homes or condos?
Keith Oden: Yes, the two areas where we have done that more extensively are in Las Vegas and Orlando. Anecdotally, we've seen some evidence that that program has had results. I think that when you combine all of those things and factors together, whether it's outreach marketing to people who are having to go through a foreclosure from an owner's perspective or the two other categories that Rick just mentioned, which is kind of people coming back into the apartment rental pool from their bad experience in single-family home or condominium rentals. And when you combine all that together, that is part of the explanation for why our traffic year-over-year is not down. And I mean there has to be some component of it. And so, I think that as you look at all the crosscurrents and try to do the handicapping on is our subprime foreclosures is more or less significant than the slowdown in the rate of home sales. It's really hard to handicap those individually and get good metrics around them. But the one thing that is pretty consistent is the traffic levels across the portfolio of our size. And to see the first quarter traffic levels in '08 still at the first quarter '07 level in the aggregate is pretty encouraging. So it's kind of hard to know where that additional traffic is coming from, but one of the things that is for sure we are seeing and experiencing is we're in a completely different market with regard to the consumers' attitude towards buying a home. It seems like forever to go, but if you go back to the first and the second quarter of last year, the mindset and mentality was that housing was still the best investment option available to the individual investor, and people were still buying homes hand over fist in the first and second quarter, and it really wasn't until the subprime bust in June, July timeframe that that really started to change in earnest. So, it's hard to handicap the individual components, but it's hard to argue where traffic levels at the same this quarter as they were in first quarter '07.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And then, Dennis, you touched on the assets that you have out in the market right now. And I know you may not be far enough long in any of your sales right now to notice. But generally, in your marketplace, have you been seeing deals get over the finish line? I know a number of your peers have mentioned that as it's gotten down to crunch time, the buyers have either come back to try and retrade the deal or have backed away entirely. And I was just trying to see if you've seen deals getting completed and also perhaps what you're seeing on a pricing level as well.
Dennis Steen: Well, I'll take that. There is lot of anecdotal evidence out there that some deals aren't getting done. There is a pressure around that. In the first quarter, there was a fair amount of retrading and uncertainty primarily as a result of the agencies starting to widen out their spreads. The spreads widened out bps and bps, some 75 bps in a 100, and that was going on in the first quarter. And what happened then was you had people who had unwritten properties at much lower debt rates and they came back to try to retrade. Some retraded. Some didn't. And I think that sellers today are not pressured. Okay? So, if they don't like the price, they are not going to sell. And so, I think there is definitely a bit outspread when it comes to the changes that were going on in the debt market. And we had a situation, for example, on Ridgecrest, which is the one asset we sold in the quarter. We started out have a retrade. We didn't retrade. The people who took their earnest money, and then they came back. Ultimately, the spreads came in on Fannie deal, and they ultimately did the deal. But I think generally, that volatility in rates is pretty much over and the spreads have come in on Fannie and Freddie, because I think they thought they would have a big rush in a lot of deals. And they didn't have them. So, you had sort of a more reasonable spread situation and it's a little more stable today than it was then. But again, I think it's a function of there is a bit outspread today. But when you can get Freddie and Fannie financing in low 5s to high 4s, you can still make positive leverage play with the cap rate in 5.75 to 6.5. On our portfolio that we have out there now, we have properties in Houston that are getting 20 bps, properties in Dallas that are getting the same number. So, there is a lot of activity. Cap rates definitely have gone up from the sort of lows in the last year when you had CMBS lenders willing to give 95% financing. And the nature of the buyers has changed a bit, because the high leverage buyer is basically out of business and anybody who is going to buy today is going to put 25% to 30% equity in the deal. But by and large, I think the deals are starting to get done more than they were in the first quarter.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: And just lastly on that, do you anticipate your sales being more portfolio type transactions or more one-off?
Dennis Steen: No, more one-off.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Okay.
Dennis Steen: I think the problem that people have today is that there is more one-off buyers out there than portfolios, and it's more difficult for buyers to come up with bigger checks, if you will. We had some portfolio offers, but in the aggregate, the individual offers added together better than the portfolio offers.
Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson at BMO Capital Markets.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Rick Campo: Good morning.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: So, I guess the question, everyone is hanging their hats on Fannie and Freddie, do you have any sense that there is a feeling to amount of business that they ultimately want to do in multifamily where they can get sort of capped out or do you think this is going to go on perpetuity?
Keith Oden: There is always a feeling at some point, but when you look at what Freddie and Fannie are doing right now, it's a very profitable business for them. They have very, very minimal defaults or bad multifamily loans out there. And when you think about what's going on in the housing market, whenever the government says that they are going to improve the liquidity of the housing market by improving the GSE's ability to provide liquidity, that's good for multifamily. And we have to remember that one-third of Americans live in rental housing. Fannie and Freddie's charge is to provide liquidity and stability to the housing markets. And they define the housing markets as all of the housing markets, not just single family. So, when you hear about the bills in front of Congress today about expanding Freddie and Fannie's ability to help housing, they are also talking about multi-family. So, when have a situation where you got companies that need earnings and have a great product and have sort of market to themselves, they are going to as much as they can. And if you look at what they did last year, it was huge. It was almost I think $100 billion and over $120 billion between them or something like that. It was a big number. So, I don't think that the industry is worried too much about Freddie and Fannie having issues. And when you have a profitable product and they are sort of the only game in town and they have the need to put the money out.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Do you think that they were may be influenced or pressured by the declining spreads in the unsecured markets?
Keith Oden: Absolutely. And I think the other part of it was that they were influenced by deals not getting done, because what was happening as they were walking their rates up in the first quarter and then people were trying to retrade the sellers. Sellers said no, and their deals got blown up. So, they didn't have as much deal flow as I think they thought they were going to get because of the bid outspread issue. And that's why I think their spreads are a little more stable now.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Rick, part of your comments, prepared remarks, you said you expect the challenged markets to be so challenged through 2009 is the words you used. Do you mean all the way through till December of '09?
Rick Campo: Well, Rich, I think it's hard to predict the future. But I know that the challenged markets have had more employment hits, because obviously when the speculative housing bubble busted, you had a massive amount of dislocation of the jobs that were related to that. And so places like Las Vegas, I think we sort of estimated that we had something 12% of our residences were related to the housing industry, the construction workers or mortgage bankers or real estate brokers and people like that. And so, I think that it's going to take longer in those markets to work through the inventory. So you have to work through the inventory number one, and then number two you have to be able -- you have to get back to more normal job growth. I just don't think that I am not going to Pollyanna [ph]. I don't think that's going to happen tomorrow and it's going to take time. Now how long it takes in the 2009, I don't know, but I know it's going to a challenge through the rest of 2008. And with all the economic stimulus that is gone on and the tax rebate checks that are coming back and the people here soon should have a positive effect on the economy, but it's going to take awhile for those markets to come, people to get back into thinking that there are good times. I think we've seen while I was in Florida last week and talked to our people and was interesting because I started hearing some of our senior management, they were talking about whether they're going to get back into the housing market now and they certainly talk about well I am going to buy house probably in the third or fourth quarter and they're starting to feel like may be the market is going so turnaround because there is lot of value.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. In light of those comments, Keith any D or F markets in your reference for right now?
Keith Oden: I don't know if we have any owned, still don't know if we've gotten to an average and F would have been Houston, Texas in 1984.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: So you're not F?
Keith Oden: That would have been an F because the market occupancy rate was 77% and I believe that rental rates bottomed at about $0.48 per square foot, that's an F.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay.
Rick Campo: Rich, the interesting thing, we've had discussion at NMHC and I'm the Chairman this in National Multi-Housing Council. And we had a conference call here week or two ago and the research folks at NHMS are talking about potential multi-family housing shortages in 2010. And because of the credit crunch and the fact that we think that multi-family starts are going to be at 15 to 20 years lows going forward over the next 12 to 18 months given the credit crunch. And so you have the situation where you have markets that are, their fundamentals are fine in the sense of their long-term demographics or long-term job growth or long-term population growth. And right now, we have this credit crunch/housing bust from have negatively impacted those markets, but long-term those markets are great markets and what should happen this year and going in the next year is that the difficulties will lead to lot better growth in the future because of lack of supply.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Hi, good morning, guys.
Rick Campo: Good morning.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Keith, the rent rate numbers that you have shown to some, does that include the impact of Valet West and Perfect Connection?
Keith Oden: Yes, they do.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. If you excluded that, what was rent growth in the first quarter?
Keith Oden: It's roughly $750,000, probably works out to about 7 or 8 something like that.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Second question for Rick. The fund closing you mentioned $300 million of commits, does that close in the second quarter and do you begin I think properties in the second quarter, or is that a second half of the year event?
Rick Campo: We've actually started I think properties already.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay.
Rick Campo: And so it's closed and what we do now -- we haven't completed the fund rates and we are still going to raise some additional dollars. But as far as commitments closed, the $300 million is our commitment that are closed, so we can draw those down anytime.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So, actual purchases are development in the fund, or do you anticipate anything in the second quarter?
Rick Campo: We put a development in the fund in the second quarter I believe. And we have a program to complete acquisitions and have developments through the second, third, and fourth quarter.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Just given your comments previously about asset pricing, also about refinancing in terms of on balance sheet -- using on balance sheet capacity, how do you still thought there is a lot of opportunities for share repurchases this year?
Rick Campo: It's a total function of the share price and our ability to sell assets that we've been doing on the leverage neutral basis. But we still think that shares are undervalued and will be in purchase of the shares. We sort of rested a little bit in the buyback in the first quarter, primarily because of market sort of rallying pretty big and we had and we are in the process of selling, getting our next slug of dispositions to reload our ability to buy stock, but I haven't changed my view on the stock value relative to the net asset value and I think it's definitely from a capital allocation perspective one of the best things we can do.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: And finally, in terms of in this environment currently, where do you see mezzanine loan opportunities?
Rick Campo: That's an interesting question because we have seen mezzanine opportunities and we are working on few transactions. The mezzanine market got very overheated along with lot of other credit market obviously. We think we will be able to do some mezzanine financing going forward. We haven't done anything yet, but we are working on a lot of deals.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from J. Habermann at Goldman Sachs.
J. Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Hey, guys, good morning.
Rick Campo: Good morning J.
J. Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Rich had a question on development. You did mention the couple of properties that did sort of fall out of the mix. But in your comments, you mentioned sort of evaluating the level of development. But at the same time, you sort of mentioned that 2010-2011 could be an interesting time period. So I am just wondering is any sort of pull back very temporary and do you think development really will remain the top priority?
Rick Campo: Well, development is not necessarily our top priority. I mean I think we believe that development creates a lot of value and we create a lot of value over the years and it's just balance part of our strategy. I think that as the year unfolds and we see what happens to some of these markets in the next six, eight months that could give us some light on perhaps moving development into productions modes. We are likely to do lot of developments in our fund. And I think we have shown what if $100 million of starts plus or minus through $100 million on our balance for this year and the balance in our joint ventures or fund. But I think the development business is going to be a very good business going forward especially when you sort of look through the issues, challenges that merchant builders are having today with leverage levels and ability to get investor capital. So we are going to be opportunistic and make sure that at same time make sure that we are managing our balance sheet, so that we don't have to go into the capital markets. I mean, had we been in a position where we have to fund in the first quarter and it would have been not a good time to come in the market. So it's all about balance and it's about trying to be cautious in an uncertain environment.
J. Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And just a push-up a bit more on the share repurchase, I mean the stock is trading roughly implied cap rate of about 6.5, you're taking about cap rates on assets sales perhaps in the five and three quarter to 6.5 range. So would that seems indicate that your preference is going to be just pay down debt?
Rick Campo: Not necessarily. I think the asset sales that we're talking about are the oldest slowest growing assets in our portfolio. And when you look at the implied cap rate and then look at our best assets, those assets aren't trading at 6.50 and they wouldn't ever. It would at least in this current market. I mean we could and if you look at Washington D.C., cap rates there is continued to be in the low 5s. So I think there is still a pretty big spread between what we were selling our worst assets or our slowest experiencing assets at and the implied cap rate in our stocks. So it still makes sense to continue to from a capital allocation perspective to sell assets and buy stock as long as we're doing at net leverage neutral or not increasing debt to do it.
J. Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And just last question, what are you seeing broadly in terms of concessions, perhaps by market like trends and concessions?
Rick Campo: Well, lot of our competitors are kind of going down those trails particularly in the challenged market. It's common to see other people offering one month free, the crazies are on occasion you'll see something more than that. But in our world, we do with the YieldStar pricing, we really don't even have the word concession in our language any more. But yes, our competitors have tried to maintain higher base rates and do the one month. But when we're comping rents, we're always comping to the net effective.
J. Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay. How about end markets like Northern Virginia or even New Florida?
Rick Campo: Lot of concessions in both of those markets. Again concessions is more of a structuring matter for our competitors than it is for us. Again, we are pricing it net effective.
J. Habermann - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thanks.
Rick Campo: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Swett of KBW.
Steve Swett - KBW: Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. But, Keith, can I just ask you about Charlotte markets. It's been pretty solid for you guys, but seems to have really weakened considerably in the last quarter. Is that demand related, supply related and do you think that's heading down towards the level that some of your other weaker markets are at?
Keith Oden: Charlotte, it's definitely not supply related. There has been a very modest demand of new supply brought on in Charlotte. I think that we are seeing right now is uncertainty related. You got Wachovia, B of A. You got all the banks and the employment impact that financial institutions have in that market. And I think you've just got a lot of people who are kind of antsy, sitting on their hands, afraid to make commitments. And I think they're kind of hunkering down, and I think the lack of activity is related more to that. In our forecast, we have a decent job growth scenario, had really nice job growth in '07, and it looks like '08 is going to be okay. But I think that it clearly does not have the characteristics of Tampa, Las Vegas, Phoenix where you had incredible run-up in home prices that was by and large driven by speculative demand. It clearly didn't happen in Charlotte. I mean that a decent increase in house prices over the last three years, but nothing like in those other markets. So, it's hard for me to think about Charlotte given the market conditions in conjunction with those other housing challenged markets.
Steve Swett - KBW: Okay. And, Rick, you talked little bit about cap rates and investor interest in properties. You mentioned markets in Texas. And I was wondering if you could just comment on anything you have seen in the market in investor interest and properties in some of the weaker areas like Arizona, Nevada and Florida?
Rick Campo: Well, I think there are definitively investors looking in those markets, but that's where you have a much larger bid ask spread, and then the underwriting is very tough there too. So, I think that you are not seeing as much activity in terms of sales activity in those markets. That being said, we are out looking for acquisitions for our fund. We like those markets because of the issues that is going on there right now. So, you have definitely fewer buyers and a bigger bid ask spread. But we like them from an acquisition perspective, but I am not sure as a seller I'd want to be trying to push sales in those markets when you have sort of the negative investor settlement that's out there.
Steve Swett - KBW: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Green Street.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street: Good morning.
Rick Campo: Good morning.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street: Guys, what was the cap rate on the asset sale in the first quarter?
Rick Campo: Cap rate was, if you use $250 a door and 3% management fees, it was like 5.2. And if you use the real CapEx, it was like 4.50.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street: Okay. And how about the development that was sold to the JV?
Rick Campo: The development that was sold in the JV was sold at our cost.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street: Cost, okay.
Rick Campo: Yes.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street: If you just sense that there is a portfolio discount out there in the marketplace and that's factoring into your decision to sell asset on a one-off basis?
Rick Campo: That's good question. I think the answer is yes. There is a portfolio discount today. Any large buyer that has a lot of capital is definitely wanting to get a better price in a one-off. And that's why when we put our portfolio out there, we did both scenarios. We said, "Fine. If you want to bid all, great." And then we had a lot of bids from one-off people. And then when you add the one-off bids up compared to the portfolio bids, there is probably 5% or 6% variance between the two in terms of price.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street: Got you. And one last question, I guess a follow-up on the stock repurchases. And maybe I misreading this, but if I look at first quarter asset sales compared to the amount of stock you bought back, am I misreading it, because you used a little bit of debt to buy back stock in the first quarter? And if that's the case, can we see more of that going forward? I know you've spoken in the past of funding that activity exclusively via asset sales.
Rick Campo: Well, you try to match it perfectly, but you never can. And so the key is making sure we're doing on an overall basis, and we are not going get way ahead buying stock and using debt. But we had assets sales at the end of last year. We had some asset sales that include contributing assets to our fund. And we'll continue to fund it with asset sales. You do have to pay down some debt. Well, you can't just sell assets and buy stock, because then your leverage still goes up. But at the end of the day, we are committed to a leverage neutral program. Whether the timing of it works out, you will have some variations on the timing now and then.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street: All right. Thank you. Great.
Operator: Our final question comes from Ben Lentz at LaSalle Investment.
Ben Lentz - LaSalle Investment: Hi, guys. I'm curious about your expectations in guidance for the four markets that have negative revenue growth and have continued to decelerate. So, southeast Florida, Tampa, Vegas, Phoenix, do you see them hitting a bottom this year and starting to come back by the end of the year in your guidance?
Keith Oden: We do. The distinction that we see in the next two to three quarters is more on the occupancy rate in those markets. I still don't think we're going to looking at anything meaningful on the rental growth side, but I think that we will see an increase in the occupancy rate in those challenged markets. Our original guidance for those markets would not have had a negative number for the full year, even though you see negative numbers for the quarter. Some of that is because of the way we laid out our plan with regard to the third and fourth quarter and occupancy rate increases, et cetera. But I think that in our revised thinking and forecasting, we're going to have better than expected performance in four or five markets over the course of the year, and we're probably going to have worse than anticipated or originally anticipated performance over the course of the year. And those are the four markets that you mentioned are the most suspect.
Ben Lentz - LaSalle Investment: And in the revised guidance, are they negative for the full year number?
Keith Oden: Two of them are negative in the fully year number.
Ben Lentz - LaSalle Investment: Okay. But we don't see them decelerating throughout the year. They can hit bottom, and in 2009, they're going to be week, but they're going to recovering from a year-over-year revenue growth perspective.
Keith Oden: I think that's a fair assessment. I think we're going to see improved performance in the third and fourth quarter, even in the face of kind of sloppy, underlying housing conditions. Whether or not it lasts over into the first quarter '09, when does that recovery start, I think that's the open question right now. But through the balance of the year, we think that we're kind of kicking along the bottom. We see decent metrics on traffic. We see decent closing percentages, and we see less turnover in the portfolio even in those markets primarily resulting from the reduction and losing residence to home sales. So, the net-net of all that is I think we have an opportunity to kind of walk along the bottom, pick up a little occupancy, not drive rental rates. And we'll end up at the end of the year with a couple of those markets with a negative number, but we think that gets offset by the fact that Huston, Dallas often and Denver will continue to outperform.
Ben Lentz - LaSalle Investment: Okay. And then DC seems to decelerate to flat. Is that going to go negative as well?
Keith Oden: Not in our forecast.
Ben Lentz - LaSalle Investment: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Rick Campo: Very well. Thank you for being on the call today, and we look forward to update you next quarter. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2007 Q4  (2008-02-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to the Camden Property Trust Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Now I would like to turn the conference over to Mrs. Kim Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Before we begin our prepared remarks I would like to advice everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder, Camden's complete fourth quarter 2007 earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at camdenliving.com, and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which may be discussed on this call. Joining me today are Rick Campo, Camden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Keith Oden, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I will turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Rick Campo: Thank, Kim. Good morning. We started 2008 with an award-winning team, great platform, and a strong balance sheet in complicated and uncertain markets. Here is how we see 2008 unfolding. On one hand, the fundamentals of our business are reasonably good. Demographics are strong for the growing echo boom population and continued positive immigration trends. New multi-family supply is manageable based on my conversations with the largest U.S. developers at the recent National Multi Housing Council Annual Meeting. Starts are predicted to fall 25 to 30% this year setting 2008 up for the lowest year for multi-family starts in 10 or 15 years. Multi-family affordability is the best it has been since 2000. Single family home purchases are down significantly with tighter credit standards and it will take time to change the negative sentiment towards home ownership. Home ownership rates have drop to 150 basis points since peak, creating more than 1.5 million in rentals, while some economist think the rate could drop another 200 basis points before it's over. On the other hand, job growth continues to slow in 2007 509,000 jobs were created in our market. With 2008 projected to decline about 50% to 265,000 jobs created, but the real wild card here is that the shadow of supply of single-family homes and what effect they will have on multi-family demand, the answer to that question will unfold during 2008. Our business plan for 2008 is based on same store net operating income of 2.25% to 3.25%. We'll be a net seller of assets this year, and during the last seven months we’ve acquired 4.3 million shares of Camden stock totaling $230 million. Our Board has authorized an additional 250 million of stock buybacks. We believe there is a significant discount between the public and private value of multi-family assets and will continue to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities as long as it lasts. We continue to create significant value in our development business with expected yields of 7% in the completed and under construction projects. Our 2008 will be the peak year in our development pipeline ramp up following in the Summit merger. The 2008 FFO includes $13 million to $15 million of development dilution, an increase of approximately $7 million over 2007. The tradeoff between the value creation from development and negative effect of lower short term FFO is a price we are paying in long run for the value creation on the development side. We filed an 8-K last night, announcing the first closing of the Camden value added fund. The fund will be our exclusive acquisition vehicle; it will also contribute select developments to the fund as well. We expect the fund to ultimately acquire and/or develop $1 billion in properties. The fund is an excellent structure to expand our joint venture business which allows us to leverage our platform and higher returns on invested equity. Camden will own 20% of the fund. I will turn the call over to Keith Oden now, for an update on our markets.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. As with past years, I will given my annual preview of the market conditions for 2008 in our largest market. Beginning with our top rated markets, I will give our view of current market condition, expressed as a letter grade, and also provide our view of the outlook for each market through year end 2008, as improving, stable or declining. Second, I will provide some additional details of same property guidance for 2008. Starting with the overview of the Camden's market conditions, Denver has made a tremendous turnaround year-over-year, moving from the bottom of last years list to ending 2007 as one of Camden's top performers. We rate current conditions as an A with a stable outlook. Job growth is expected to decline slightly, but a tight housing market will be driver in this market throughout 2008. The premium of buying versus renting absorption levels and population growth will also improve performance. Occupancy levels are anticipated to remain at or above 95% for the full year, which will keep this market as a top performer for rent growth. In Austin, we rate current condition as an A, with a stable outlook. As with the rest of the nation, employment growth is expected to slow, however Austin still anticipates adding more than 23,000 new jobs in 2008. Population growth due to an expanding student base, domestic migration and immigration will increase the demand for housing. Forecasts show 2008 to be another year of rising home prices, therefore widening the spread between renting and buying. In addition, the lack of new supply will foster another solid year of rental rate increases and good NOI growth. In Dallas, we rate current conditions as an A-minus, with an improving outlook. Dallas experienced an economic rebound in 2007 that is projected to hold over through 2008. Employment growth is forecasted to remain above the national average, adding an additional 37,000 new jobs to the market. Demand is expected to exceed deliveries, keeping occupancy levels high and rent growth strong. Camden anticipates Dallas to be a top performance in 2008, which will enhance our NOI growth. We rate Houston's market conditions as an A-minus, with a stable outlook. This market has experienced remarkable growth as result of the booming energy sector. While $100 barrel oil is bad for the national economy, it is a very good thing for Houston. Continued employment and population gains will create sufficient demand, to absorb new supply coming online in 2008. While Camden has a number of new development communities in this market, most of them are inside a 6-10 loop, which is an area in high demand among young professionals who choose to live near work and entertainment. When occupancy reaches capacity inside the loop, another sought after sub-market is the West Chase or Energy Corridor, where Camden also has a large supply of apartment homes. These factors will sustain Houston as a strong market for same property and align rent growth in 2008. In Raleigh, we rate current condition as a B-plus with a stable outlook. Employment growth is expected to increase by 1% or roughly 8,000 jobs in 2008, with most of the growth coming from highly compensated sectors such as research and technology. ING Research recently announced plans to quadruple its presence, adding 1100 jobs to the area. In addition to local job growth, net migration is forecasted to increase 14%, assisting with demand for rental housing. Absorption has been steady and it's forecasted to match new supplies throughout 2008. Rising home prices, solid job growth, and a balance supply versus demand fundamentals will lead to another solid year. In Charlotte, we rate conditions as a B with a stable outlook. The fundamentals of this market remains solid, healthy employment growth across all sectors, increasing home prices and sizeable population increases have added an average of 20, 000 people per year to Charlotte's metro area. However, pressure will be put on occupancy levels as a large amount of new suppliers anticipated to come on line in 2008. Occupancy should hold steady at 95%, but with less rent growth than in prior years. We rate Atlanta's current conditions as a B with a stable outlook. Even with softening economic conditions this market remains healthy and projections show that overall employment levels are strong with growth expected in nearly all sectors throughout 2008. INVESCO recently announced that it will relocate its headquarters from London to Atlanta. High occupancy rates and a limited number of completions compared to demand with allow rental rate increases across this market and keep Atlanta as one of Camden's top performers in 2008 for NOI growth. In the Washington DC metro area, we rate the current conditions as a B with a stable outlook. Historically election years have been positive for the housing industry in Washington DC. While employment growth is anticipated to drop from 2007 levels, conditions still look favorable with approximately 30, 000 new jobs being created this year. In addition, the opening of National Harbor, a mixed-use project that includes five new hotels, will generate thousand of jobs. High housing costs and restrictive single-family lending practices will benefit multi-family operators in 2008. Completions will track absorption for 2008 and the combination of all these factors will assist Camden achieving modest rent growth and a forecasted market wide occupancy rate of 95%. Next in Orange County, we rate current conditions as a B-minus with a stable outlook. The subprime fall out certainly impacted this market last year and forecast show employment will actually shrink by approximately 7000 jobs in 2008. Single-family housing affordability and uncertainty in the housing market will push some potential buyers to remain rentals during 2008, population levels will also help the rental market as one in 100 Americans now call Orange County home. These dynamics will allow for moderate growth in rents and NOI. In San Diego, we rate current conditions as a B minus with a stable outlook, our conditions have deteriorated slightly in this market and continued job growth, high housing cost and little new supply will prove positive in '08. Most of the employment growth will come in the leisure and hospitality sectors, aiding rental demand. Occupancy levels have remained steady in this market, and our San Diego communities are forecasting a 1% increase in occupancy during 2008. In Las Vegas, we rate current conditions as a B-minus for the declining outlook. For the first time in seven years Vegas may experience negative employment growth in 2008. This market has been a shining star for many years, but will feel effects of fewer new jobs and a glut of single family rentals. Beyond 2008, continued population growth, growth in new supply and increased tourism terrific will allow for a resumption in strong performance. The leisure and hospitality sector will be the saving grace for Las Vegas as casinos and new hotels come online in late 2008 and 2009. The usual hotel staff to room ratio is 3:1 and typically these individuals have a propensity to rent. NOI should remain slightly positive in 2008. We rate south Florida's current conditions as a B-minus with a stable outlook. This market had the largest excess supply of condominiums in 2007 and the effects of forecast to linger throughout 2008. However, the lack of new apartments coming online will alleviate some of the excess supply. Employment growth is expected to be about the same as 2007, a lack of affordable housing will keep many residents in the area renters, which will b well for Camden's NOI growth and allow for moderate rental increases. In Phoenix, we rate current conditions as a B-minus with a declining outlook. Sub-market conditions in Phoenix were very diverse last year, and submarkets that were top performers in '06 ended the year at the bottom of the pack in 2007. Conditions are predicted to be volatile again, making this market a little uncertain for the first half of 2008. However, job growth is forecasted to decline by 2% or about 30,000 jobs. Multifamily properties will be challenged by the housing correction that is occurring in the market, due to a record number of foreclosures, excess inventory of single family homes and condos. The decline in multifamily completions with continued population and employment growth will allow for very moderate NOI growth in 2008. Tampa we rate current conditions as a C, with a stable outlook. Tourism is expected to boost job growth in the leisure and hospitality sectors in '08, adding almost 15,000 new jobs before the year. Companies with communities centrally located such as Camden will fair better than the suburban areas this year. Occupancy levels are expected to increase, which will be the main driver behind a very modest NOI growth. Lastly, in Orlando, we rate current condition as a C, with a stable outlook. While job growth is projected to add approximately 22,000 new jobs, the excess supply of single family and condominium inventories will keep rent growth to a minimum in this market. Population growth from domestic migration will be largest demand driver to the region. Given these obstacles during 2008, Camden expects NOI growth in Orlando to be flat. In comparing our 2008 outlook to our 2007 outlook, the following statistics are worth noting. If you compare market-by-market to 2007, 11 markets have lower rating than they did in 2007, three are higher and one was flat. And if you take the weighted average letter grade for the portfolio for 2008 versus 2007, it moved down roughly one full letter grade from the A-minus, B-plus range into the B to B-minus range. The outlook condition for the portfolio moved, from slightly improving in 2007 to a stable outlook in 2008. These changes are consistent with our NOI growth forecast for 2008 of 2.75%versus last year's original guidance of 6.5% growth. A few great comments on 2007 fourth quarter results. With 11 of our 15 markets receiving lower rating than in 2007, it's not surprising that our fourth quarter sequential revenues were down in most of our markets. In every market, except San Diego, our average occupancy fell from the third quarter, while overall rental rates were relatively flat. For the fourth quarter, our portfolio averaged 93.6% occupied, which is 30 basis points less than our 10 year average for fourth quarter occupancy of 93.9%. The decline from third quarter occupancy of 90 basis points is 35 basis points more than the 10 year average decline between the quarters of 55 basis points due to seasonality. Rental rate increases will be very modest in the first half of 2008, as we move our occupancy rates back into the 95% range. Overall, our traffic for 2007 was down 8% from the prior year and the fourth quarter was down 3% versus the prior year. Our largest decline in traffic year-over-year occurred in Phoenix down 18%; Orlando down 16%; Las Vegas down 15%; and Tampa down 12%. It's no coincidence that these markets have been the hardest hit by the fallout from the subprime meltdown, clearly a significant  percentage of our multifamily prospects or finding housing alternatives mostly likely in single family rentals. Consistent with our expectations, the percentage of moveouts to purchase homes fell to 15% for the quarter, down from 17% in the third quarter and one of the lowest numbers we have ever reported. Turning to our NOI guidance for 2008, we have provided you with revenue and expense estimates in two ways. One includes the other income from our cable TV trash collection, and utility billing amounts in both revenue and expenses as we are required to report them in our financial statement. Based on this methodology, our revenue should increase by 3.5% to 4.5% expenses would be up 5.5 to 6.75%. From comparability to our peers, we have also provided revenue and expense growth excluding those other income items. Using this methodology we expect revenue growth to be 2% to 3%, expenses will grow 2.5% to 3.75%. In either case our projected same-property NOI growth for 2008 is 2.25 to 3.25 or 2.75 at the midpoint. Our long-term average annual same store NOI growth rate in the multifamily is 3% to 4%. We closed out 2007 with same store NOI growth of just over 5%. So from a historical perspective, that would normally be a really good year. But it sure didn’t feel like it as we missed our original guidance of 6.5% increase. Our 2008 forecast 2.75% same store growth is below the long-term trend by roughly 1%. But again, because of an uncertain outlook for the broad housing market, feels worse than that. Our market should continue to outperform the national picture in population and employment growth, even though the jobs picture will likely be much softer than last year. Combined with favorable demographics and reduction in new housing completions for both single and multifamily in 2008; the elements for above trend performance beyond 2008 looks promising. Finally in a year, where good news was hard to come by at Camden, we recently received two extraordinary pieces of good news. First for the third straight year Camden Property Trust was name as one of the best places to work in Texas with our highest ranking yet at number seven. Second, Camden was named to Fortune Magazines List of the 100 Best Companies to work for with the ranking of number 50. This recognition is the gold standard of company awards for employee satisfaction and maintaining a great workplace. The award was made possible by our 1800 employees, who passionately share our commitment to making Camden a great place to work. We strongly feel that Camden's inclusion on the list has much broader implications. We are the first REIT ever to make the list and just as the once, who was the first REIT to be included in the S&P 500, there are undoubtedly will be others from among the excellent companies in the REIT sector. We believe this recognition is the next important step in the direction of investors viewing our company and other REITs as great franchises not just collections of great assets. This distinction is all too often overlooked by a myopic focused on the net asset value of REITs. We offer special thank you to Camden's employees, who made this next step possible. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dennis Steen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Dennis Steen: Thanks, Keith. I'll start my comments this morning with a review of our fourth quarter results. Camden reported FFO for the fourth quarter $57.1 million or $0.94 per diluted share slightly higher than the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.91 to $0.96 per share and $0.01 above the first call mean estimates. The slightly better than expected performance is primarily due to property net operating income exceeding our forecast by $1.7 million and un-forecasted land sale gains of approximately $700,000. These two were partially offset by a $1.4 million impairment loss on lands. The $1.7 million favorable variance in property NOI is the result of our favorable variance of $3.2 million in property expenses in the fourth quarter due to a 1.6 million decline in real estate tax expense from the prior quarter primarily due to lower than expected 2007 tax rates in our Florida and Texas markets. With the remaining 1.6 million favorable variance in property expenses, primarily due to lower than anticipated property and casualty losses, employee benefit cost and incentive compensation. The favorable variances in property expenses were partially offset by a $1.5 million shortfall in property revenues due to the slightly lower than anticipated occupancy rates in our stabilized portfolio. Total non-property income and total other expenses were generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. On the transaction front during the fourth quarter, we sold seven of the nine operating assets held for sale resulted in a gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $75.3 million during the quarter. This brings our year-to-date disposition volume to approximately 3,000 units generating a $170 million in proceeds. We have exited our Midwest and Greensboro markets and continue to reduce our portfolio of 20 plus year old assets. The average cap rate on our 2007 dispositions was 6.1% using 2007 annualized NOI and actual CapEx per unit of $630. Of the two remaining assets held for sale, Camden Ridgeview in Austin, Texas is currently under contract and expected to close in the first quarter of 2008 and Camden Pinnacle in Denver Colorado is still being marketed with an expected sale in the second quarter of. Additionally during the quarter, we sold undeveloped land in the Brickell area of Downtown Miami, generating proceeds of $6.1 million resulted in a gain of approximately $700,000 on the sales. Our development pipeline is continuing to progress nicely. In the fourth quarter, we completed construction at Camden Monument Place in Fairfax, Virginia and Camden City Centre in Houston, Texas, which was 72% and 58% leased respectively. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we began construction at Camden Amber Oaks, a 348 unit, $40 million development in Austin, Texas. For the four completed communities in lease up and the seven communities under construction as detailed on Page 16 of our supplemental package; total projected costs are slightly below budgeted amounts and in aggregate, they have a combined deals in line with our original expectations. [When] on them I would like to note regarding our future development pipeline. During the fourth quarter, we decided not to go forward with the development of a third phase at our Farmers Market development in downtown Valley. In conjunction with our decision, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.4 million to write-down previously recorded carrying costs related to the development of a third phase. Our balance sheet metrics continued to be strong. During the quarter, we use proceeds from asset sales and our $500 million five year unsecured term loans to reduce balances outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and to fund our share repurchase activity. At year end, we had approximately $470 million available under our $600 million line of credit. We are very manageable debt maturities over the next several years with approximately $200 million in scheduled payments in both 2008 and 2009. Our 2008 maturities consist entirely of maturing mortgage debt with a $176 million of the maturities occurring in the fourth quarter. With ample liquidity, we do not currently forecast tapping the capital markets in 2008. Our coverage ratios also remained strong. Our full year 2007 interest expense covered ratio and total fixed charge ratio of 3.0 times and 2.2 times EBITDA respectively are well in line for our investment grade ratings. Moving on to 2008 guidance, we expect 2008 projected FFO per diluted share to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.80. Please refer to Page 25 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2008 financial outlook. Keith has previously walked you through the growth rate assumptions for the 43,000 units in our same store portfolio. For the 3500 units in our repositioning portfolio redevelopment activities will be substantially complete by the second quarter of 2008 and we are projecting 2008 NOI growth of 8.5% to 9% for this portfolio of assets. We are projecting between a 175 million and 380 million of operating asset dispositions as we continue to recycle older assets to fund our development pipelines and share repurchase activities. Non-property income net which includes fee and asset management income, net of expenses and interest in other income is expected to be between $10 and $14 million in 2008 in line with the 2007 total of 12.5 million. As higher fee income related to joint venture activities is being offset by lower interest income on our mezzanine loan portfolio. Although, we are anticipating sales of land on process currently held for sale, we have not included any potential gains in our 2008 guidance. G&A and property management expenses are expected to total between $50 and $54 million, which at the midpoint represents a 2% growth rate over 2007 actuals. For the first quarter of 2008, we expected projected FFO per diluted share within the range of $0.87 to $0.91, with a midpoint of $0.89 per share, representing a $0.05 per share from the fourth quarter of 2007. This $0.05 per share decline is primarily the result of the following items. First, lower first quarter same store net operating income of approximately $1 million or $0.02 per share. The decline in same store NOI results from the modest increase in sequential revenues, which are more than offset by higher operating expenses resulting primarily from the fourth quarter favorable variances and real estate taxes, property and casualty loses and employee benefit cost which I mentioned earlier. Secondly; we will incur additional dilution in the first quarter of 2008 from our development pipeline of $1.6 million or $0.03 per share. This is due to the significant number of units completed during the fourth quarter and units to be completed in the first quarter of 2008 at communities under lease-up in both our on balance sheet and joint venture pipelines. As a reminder, we begin to expense all operating and interest cost related to completed units regardless of lease status. Please refer to pages 16 and 17 of our supplemental package for the construction of lease-up status for properties in our pipelines. Also of note in reconciling FFO per share from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008, the reduced share count benefit for shares we repurchased during the fourth quarter and thus far in 2008 equates to approximately $0.04 per share in FFO. This benefit is entirely offset by increased interest expense and loss NOI from operating asset sales, as we funded our repurchases with assets sales and incremental borrowings. At this time, I would like to open the call up to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Biffert at Goldman Sachs.
Mark Biffert: Hey guys, question for you on the fund. When you look at your acquisition volume that you've projected for '08 as well as the development, will all 800 million if you take the top end of the range come or be a part of that joint venture or that fund that you set up?
Rick Campo: If you look at page 25, I believe it shows what we have balance sheet and joint venture, and you can see from an acquisition perspective, we have zero budgeted for 100% owned or on balance sheet. So, the $200 million to $400 million is definitely in the joint venture category, and then on development, we show between a $100 million and $500 million in total. And we are likely to have a couple of developments on balance sheet but not many. Fundamentally the fund and our joint ventures are set up to leverage our return on capital, and today it makes a lot of more sense we think to buy stock as opposed to invest directly into acquisitions or development.
Mark Biffert: Okay. And then looking at your dispositions for the year, you have $1 billion investment cap on the fund, would you move any existing assets that you own into that as well?
Rick Campo: No, not likely. Typically what we are projecting to do is just sell assets, improve the quality of the portfolio over the long-term as opposed to doing joint ventures at this point.
Mark Biffert: Okay, and then looking at the assets that you sold during the quarter, what was the cap rate on those assets specifically?
Dennis Steen: Specific in the quarter or year-to-date?
Mark Biffert: On the quarter, you gave the year-to-date, I think its 6.1, I was just curious because these were sold sort after the credit issues and I'm just wondering how much they may have moved out since the prior year once, early in the year once?
Dennis Steen: I don't have the specific number, it actually moved down just briefly. But if you would like to, after the call, we can provide you the break-out between the three assets that we have acquired through this last portfolio sale. Generally speaking though, we got pretty much what we expected and I don't think they were significantly negatively impacted by the credit markets really. We found that when we looked at cap rates overall, we are in the sort of nominal cap rates or probably somewhere in 5.9 up to maybe 7 and some change perhaps. And then we looked after 650 in CapEx and this is on 2007 annualized number, so sort of backward looking cap rates, they are below six.
Mark Biffert: That's great. Looking at, and I guess going to operations, looking at the occupancy dip in the quarter, I mean looking at yield start, typically you guys say, it's going to be focused more around at 95% occupancy. Did you guys just decide to come off it to maintain rents where they were or what was the reason behind the occupancy dip?
Keith Oden: Yield start is calibrated till they get to 95% and also there is a trade off between what you have to do on current rents in order to get that occupancy. With the premium on, certainly there is a heavy cost that it puts on the vacancy, but it also looks at what you would have to do on your existing rent. But again historically if you look at our portfolio over the last 10 years, we ended fourth quarter '07 within 30 basis points or what our 10 year average is on occupancy. We do have seasonality in our portfolio, probably more so than most of our peers do, and from a historical perspective it wasn't a big change. Looking at the change quarter-to-quarter, third to fourth, we were down 90 basis points, but again the historical seasonality would have implied 55 basis points down. So we are 35% basis points worse quarter-to-quarter than our 10 year average, and clearly that is a result of weakening market conditions in our markets where we've got the biggest supply issues from single-family housing.
Mark Biffert: So where do you, where were you able to get the cost savings on your expense side, I mean you saw significant decreases across your entire portfolio. Previously Rick you had talked about that there were some programs you guys were running that you let your staff run, but you thought that you would ultimately cut back if markets got worse. Is that what happened?
Rick Campo: Ultimately as I mentioned earlier the actual decreases in costs for the fourth quarter were primarily due to final adjustments of tax rates in Florida and in Texas, and some reserve adjustments for insurance, both property casualty and employee benefit.
Mark Biffert: Okay.
Rick Campo: Which declined from third to fourth.
Mark Biffert: Alright, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Kim at Credit Suisse.
Steven Kim: Hi this is Steven Kim. Another question regarding your markets, how divergent are the operations in terms of your A market and your B market?
Keith Oden: I am sorry. Can you repeat the question, it was breaking up.
Steven Kim: What is the divergent in rental growth between your A market and your B market?
Keith Oden: If you are asking in terms of the spread on projection for rental growth next year.
Steven Kim: Right, that's right.
Keith Oden: Yeah, the high end of the rental growth in our models would be in the 4% range, the low end would be flat, so you got a pretty good distribution between 4 at the top end and dead flat in Orlando.
Steven Kim: Got you. And in strength of your development pipeline, how have you been kind of meeting the pro forma projections.
Rick Campo: We have, as a matter of fact, the last sort of 4 or 5 that have come in that we closed out last year, we actually came in better than original pro forma both on cost and on total returns. The portfolio that has just been completed and is in lease-up and that is under construction. With sort of softening of the construction market over all and the construction cost increases slowing, we feel pretty good about our cost side of our equation on all those projects. The ones in lease-up now are doing fine from a lease-up perspective. We have seen a little bit of slowness in terms of velocity of leasing, but it hasn’t been significant enough to make us worry about not [hitting] our targets.
Steven Kim: So the slow leasing in Old Creek and Royal Oaks is not that significant
Rick Campo: Royal Oaks is an age restricted property and we've talked about it a couple of times on the calls and even though we are in good shape on our total returns, it has been a slower at lease-up because age restricted customers very - the sale cycle or closing cycle is a lot longer than your typical pharma projects. So while we believe that our returns going to be really good there, it's just taking longer to lease it up. Old Creek, you had some significant sort of challenges there. We were one canyon away from the big fire in Southern California. We had to evacuate the project a number of times, during this past year because of those issues. And so, that clearly had an impact on leasing up. People can't even stay there and your office can't be opened, it's hard to lease it. So, we had a little bit of slowness, as a result of that.
Steven Kim: All right. Thanks and congrats on the work.
Keith Oden: Pardon me.
Steven Kim: Congratulations on the work and for you guys.
Keith Oden: Well thanks
Dennis Steen: Thank you.
Keith Oden: Absolutely.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christine O'Connor, Morgan Stanely.
Christine O'Connor: Hi, good morning. If you guys have any way of quantify the amount of competition you are seeing from single family homes, are you tracking the number of people that move out to rentals, is there anyway of just to get an idea of how much suppliers out there, that's competing directly with your apartments?
Dennis Steen: Yeah. I'm going to give you two answers; the first is on your second question on moveouts to rentals. We do track that and we did have an increase over the prior quarter. In the third quarter, we're at about 1% and that jumped up to about 2% in the fourth quarter. So, if we do track it, roughly 1% of that we can attribute now. That its not clear that we are still capturing when someone says, I'm leaving, why are you leaving, I'm going to a home -- to a house, it's just not clear to me that we've got a great way of determining is that to rent the house or to own even though our folks are now asking that questions directly, but we had some impact from that. The other impact, the only by extrapolation, I think you can get a little bit of a sense in the markets, where we know we've a significant issue with homes that are unsold and trying to find some kind of a place in the occupied housing market. It's going to be rentals to a large extent and if the five markets that we've the most impact, we also saw the biggest decrease in traffic year-over-year. So sort of by extrapolation to, if people are looking at rental homes as an option before they show up at one of our communities and that's going to show up in decreased traffic. So, I think that by extrapolation, you can say that the markets that I mentioned where we had decreased traffic that is by and large, probably attributable to more competition from single family homes. But I got to tell you there is the data on single family homes the aggregated data is very hard to come by. And we've a lot of anecdotal evidence. We've a lot of conservations with our regional and on site staffs. But at the end of the day, the best we can do is sort to extrapolate that we are seeing an impact because those are the markets, where we are having the biggest decline in traffic year-over-year.
Keith Oden: [Let's] put out some numbers that talk about 1 million excess housing units, 750,000 homes and 250,000 condos and a lot of people think about the condos are the problem and it's not really the condos. The 250,000 excess condos in America is very small supply and the demographics really support people downsizing and baby boomers getting older and that kind of thing for condos So, and ultimately, if you sort of look at that number, the million excess units then they are going to be located clearly in the markets that [everybody] talks about. The interesting thing about that is one of the bigger issues, I think, is when do people start buying homes and when do you start working down the supply, the two components of new supply coming to the markets is definitely selling dramatically with homebuilders slashing the production dramatically. And then the second part is going to be when people start buying and until you have sort of a homeowner psychology that's where there is a tipping point, where they think that it's time to buy and the home prices aren't going to fall anymore. That's when you start seeing some of the effects of supply go out. When you look at the total numbers in the global scheme of America they are not that huge and they can be worked off over probably a twelve to eighteen month timeframe without much trouble. The question is when do you start working them off?
Christine O'Connor: Right.
Keith Oden: That's a psychological issue that I think have to be dealt within the next year or so.
Christine O'Connor: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Keith Oden: Thank you.
Dennis Steen: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Litt at Citigroup.
Craig Melcher: Hi, it's Craig Melcher here with Jon. The 2.4% same store revenue growth, does that include the cable in there?
Dennis Steen: That does not include cable.
Craig Melcher: Okay.
Dennis Steen: That is the net number. If you include the cable numbers it ends up in the 4% range.
Craig Melcher: Okay. So, looking, if you would.
Keith Oden: Craig, that's not just cable. That's cable plus Valet Waste plus the pickup and billing of our utility or water rebilling. It's all three that we are netting out when we give you the two sets of guidance.
Craig Melcher: Okay. So, with the 2.4, that compares to the guidance of the 2% to 3% revenue growth ex the cable and the other Keith just mentioned.
Dennis Steen: That is correct, right.
Craig Melcher: And so basically assuming things do not get, the condition we see now say similar as we go in to '08. But it just seems like the gap of the markets spread does that kind of -- do you expect it to narrow like you expect the Florida's to not get be quite as bad and from your stronger markets the growth to come down in terms of the divergence in the markets this year versus in '07?
Rick Campo: Well the divergence is pretty mark when you break it down in to the markets that are kind of on everybody's radar screen and certainly ours from the impact of single family homes. If you stratify our portfolio and you take, I’m going to take the five markets that everybody is most concerned about and that we've concerns about from the single family home perspective it would be Las Vegas, Phoenix, Orlando, Southeast Florida and Tampa. Just to put that in perspective Craig that represents about 36% of our NOI from those five markets. If you take our projected net effective rent growth in those markets that math works out to about 1%. So, yeah 36% projecting a 1% and then the balance of the portfolio and its distributed above that up to a top of Denver of roughly 4. But the divergence it's pretty clear in terms of our projection for '08 versus those markets that we know that have the bigger issues with single family supply. I think the other thing you've to look at too is that we are projecting these markets to be worse in 2008 than they were in 2007 and just taking example of Tampa in 2007 we had 2.6% rent growth, 1.5% expense growth for a total 3.4% same store NOI growth. What's going to happen this year is we're basically projecting it flat. So, what that means is that it's definitely not as good as '08 and it's definitely or as '07 and there is a divergence from the markets like Houston and Dallas and Austin and the markets that don't have the same kind of problems.
Craig Melcher: Okay. And on repurchase activities for this year, do you assume any additional activity in your guidance ranges?
Dennis Steen: We do not, the fundamental question of asset sales and buyback activity it's hard to project. The key is going to be if we depending on what the stock does and what we can sell assets forward are lead to be flat, creative or dilutive and I think most likely to be flat to accretive. But it's hard to project that kind of situation. I don't and we thought it was imprudent to try to improved guidance that related to things that we don't really have a lot of control over stock. It goes up dramatically, we won't have the opportunity to make the arbitrage and it's hard to pick that.
Craig Melcher: But if you at the midpoint of your disposition guidance and based on your development spending. Would you have any capital to do buybacks and then you mentioned you won't kind of go back to the capital market?
Dennis Steen: Yes, absolutely.
Craig Melcher: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb, UBS.
Alex Goldfarb: Good morning.
Dennis Steen: Good morning.
Keith Oden: Good morning, Alex.
Alex Goldfarb: Just want to follow-up on the buying back of stock. I realized that it's not in your guidance, but is there any sense that while there is still a spread between where your stocks trading, what the assets are worth. And while there is still capital for people to finance departments that you are probably maybe inclined to get more aggressive, sell more earlier buyback stock more earlier as long as that arbitrage exists today?
Dennis Steen: Yes.
Alex Goldfarb: Or you comfortable sort of going over the year with your regular game plans?
Dennis Steen: I think the answer to your first question, is yes. We are going to continue to be aggressive acquirers of the stock, as we sell assets. So, that's why we've a broad range of asset sales in the guidance and if we exceed that, if the market continues to be favorable both from an asset sales perspective and a weak stock price, where, we can say the arbitrage, we will continue to do that aggressively.
Alex Goldfarb: And what are the implications, how many assets can you sell before having to deal with tax gains, and then also dealing with the rating agency concerns and then as far as, will you keep the balance sheet neutral or you may look to increase leverage?
Rick Campo: We've always said in our buyback strategy that we would do it, leverage neutral and publish neutral, and we think it's important to do it that way as opposed to leverage up the company and put us in a position where we have to go raise capital or something. So for sure it's a leverage neutral type of transaction. So, the answer to the question of how can we sell from a gaining perspective? That number is around $300 million plus or minus, that depends on the assets that are sold and the gains related to those assets and what have you bet. But we don't look at that as a cap, because we would clearly look at, if the arbitrage made sense, we would clearly look at special dividends to expand that program.
Alex Goldfarb: Okay. And that's 300 million gross or 300 million of gains?
Rick Campo: Gross.
Alex Goldfarb: Okay. Next question is on the guidance. First of all have you factored in and maybe you said the MD&A and I missed it, but have you factored in a recession into your guidance range? And then also, if you can just go back over the sort of step up from the first quarter to the rest of the year for FFO, and then whether or not there is any impairments for any like [med]-loans and then how that tax insurance through-ups that you mentioned in the fourth quarter how those work out?
Rick Campo: Just in terms of the guidance we have not tried to include a recession scenario in here. Our numbers are predicated on 265,000 job growth in our markets, which is substantially less than last year. It's about half of what '07 was and it's about a third of what '06 was. So it's clearly very weak growth in those markets, but not a recession scenario. There has been a fair amount of discussion about what a recession would look like now and would it be worst than the last recession or the 2001 recession or the early 90's recession. I think it would be interesting to sort of talk about three different major factors that are different in terms of where we were in 2000 and 2001 versus where we are now. First, from a supply perspective, just pure multifamily supply, we are about 25% less supply coming to the market than we were in 2000, leading in to that recession. Second, housing affordability leading or multifamily affordability leading in to the 2001 recession was at its lowest level in about seven or eight years. Today we are at the highest affordability level in the last seven or eight year's. And then second the, obviously third the obvious issue in the last recession was we lost a lot of people to homes, I don't think that's going to happen this time around other than maybe rental homes, but clearly not buying homes. So, I think a fair number of people in the industry think that even in a recession scenario, it's not a very difficult time for multifamily because rental alternatives make a lot of sense in a recession scenario this time around. Dennis, you want to go through the.
Dennis Steen: Yeah I think I had a couple of your questions. First of all on impairment charges, no we do not anticipate any impairment charges for the balance of the year, as it relates to your progression across the quarters. I think what you will see is an increase in revenue scenario from the first sect to the second and third, and then it's always kind of moderating in the fourth. And on the expense side, you will just see slight increases in expenses, first to second and second to third as we normally have increases in operating expenses during those two quarters, and then trailing off in the fourth quarter as we normally do. Also as far as development dilution, the development dilution we have forecasted in the first quarter is going to probably be the highest quarter for the year, and it will tailing off toward the end of the year as we start to lease-up at a number of our large communities. I hope we've answered you questions, if you have anything more specific that you'd like me to address I will.
Alex Goldfarb: No, no, no, that's fine. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lou Taylor, Deutsche Banc.
Lou Taylor: Thanks. Rick, sorry to come back to you on the share repurchase [program] just a little bit differently. In terms of your dispositions this year, how much do you need to set aside to repay debt versus buying back stock, or fund development?
Rick Campo: To do that on a leverage neutral basis, basically you sell $2 for the real estate, pay down $1 worth of debt, and buyback $1 worth of stock. In this scenario here we probably have when you take out development funding, which is about $150 million to $200 million. We would have probably $100 million plus or minus. If we hit the high end of our guidance here in terms of dispositions, to expand that we will have to increase dispositions.
Lou Taylor: Okay, and if you were to theoretically expand dispositions, how far could you go before you would get into special dividend constraints?
Rick Campo: Well we have a total of $300 million, we could do this year, okay. So if on that math if we had a $100 million after the 350 we would have to do a special dividend after the $300 million of disposition. So, that would sort of give us a $100 million to buy stock plus or minus and then we'd have to do a special dividend of some sort.
Lou Taylor: Okay. And then for Keith, in terms of the development leasing, I know you'd mentioned earlier it was going generally okay. But just, maybe to get some specific on a Camden Royal Oaks in Austin. The project's been done for a while, yet the leasing is still sub 80%. Is that leasing [going] by pace or is there anything unusual about that pace?
Keith Oden: Yes, it's definitely slower than what one of our typical garden apartments would be and it really has to do with the demographic, that’s a 55 and older community Lou. And the experience of trying to close that particular demographic is kind of interesting. It turns into many times five, six property tours with children and parents and brothers and sisters, and just a very long sales cycle. At the end of the day, we're getting rents that are better than what we'd originally forecast, the lease-up is definitely taking longer, but on all in yield basis, we're in really good shape.
Lou Taylor: Great. Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.
Rich Anderson: Hi, everybody, good afternoon, good morning. Keith have you ever rated market D or F?
Keith Oden: Ever is a long time, I think I actually had a D, three years ago. I don’t think I've ever had it now. We exit F markets that's why we don’t have them. I am not sure, what an F market would probably be, down 15% NOI forecast for the year and fortunately we've never had to deal with that. I suspect that in other propriety types, you might get into an F from time-to-time, but multifamily is pretty tough to do that. And the year when we had total portfolio decline of 5% NOI which is kind of, its [bad, a year as we've seen in the last 20, there probably would have been two or three D markets in that crowd.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Clearly you guys are a great organization and congratulations on the ranking again, that's here. But I do have a sort of a cynical question about that, is there any sort of benefit that you have of getting in there one year and then sort of, having an advantage getting ranked, the second, third and subsequent years, sort of like, if you win the Gold Glove in baseball you sort of almost certainly get it the next year unless you really screw up?
Keith Oden: First of all, Rich, you don't have to apologize for cynical questions or you'd have to get out of the business. But the answer is, because two-thirds of the score is based on a random survey of 400 of your employees that go out and get send directly to the organization that does all the scoring. Once you get to a point, where your internal surveys qualify you, which is that you're in pretty rarified air up there with the Microsofts and the Googles of the world, once you get into that or your surveys are that high, relative to all the other competitors, that gets back too as long as you continue to do what you did in the first place in terms of taking care of your people and your workplace. There is certainly an expectation that our surveys in '08 will look a lot our surveys in '07 did. The wildcard which is the one-third of the score that comes from all other components, benefits, diversity and a whole host of other very interesting qualitative factors that they look at. Once you have achieved a score on those that combine with your survey kind of get you in. There is an expectation that unless something dramatic changes within your workplace you would be in next year. So, this is our second year that we applied. It's a very detailed kind of process that you've to go through in the first year that we applied we did not get in. But you don't know where you finished, they don't tell you. You only find out if you've made the list. And we went from off the list to number 50 this year, primarily on the strength of our survey results. Our survey results were extraordinary compared to the other hundred companies that won this year.
Rich Anderson: I thought this was your third year. I guess I got that mixed.
Keith Oden: Well, it's third in Texas. We were in the best top 50 in Texas for three years. But it’s the first year for a Fortune Magazine on a national basis.
Rich Anderson: Very well, congratulations to that. And then the last question is you mentioned you miss you same store number, your guidance at the beginning of 2007. You started off with 6.5 and you got 5. What is it you think about this year does that same type of miss won't happen this time around. Why do you feel like that you've got that covered?
Dennis Steen: Well, the interesting thing is Rich is that the miss if you think about last -- if you remember go back last year to this conference call we had and there was about a three month period where the only thing that, let's say the primary thing people were focused on as a risk to our numbers was condomania and we talked about that in length. And we thought that we had factored in what impact that was going to be. But at the same time, we always said that we thought that was going to be a very minor part of the story in '07 from the standpoint of performance and not only in our portfolio, but everybody else's. We just never believed that would be a headline number some at the end of the year 2007 But clearly the subprime melt down, which didn't happen even began happening or get on to anybody's radar screen until May June of '07 ended up being hugely more impeccable to our portfolio than the condominium issue otherwise. And I don't think that's any different in '08. I just don't, in South Florida there is still probably a lot of discussion about condos because there is so much being build down there. But the nature of that product and the price point is such that I still don't see it being a big issue in our portfolio. But the single family, the single family component and the difficulty of getting your arms around what that competition is where it comes from and when it goes away, I think that's certainly a risk to anyone's forecast that operates in the markets that have significant exposure. What gives me a little bit better feeling about our numbers going forward primarily is that we've very modest rental income growth in those markets across those five markets. Our net effective rent growth for '08 and our plan is about 1% could it be worse than that. I suppose it can, but it also maybe a little bit better than that. I think it's a kind of coin toss in those five markets to see whether it's better or worse than the 1%. The rest of our markets, I think they'll perform in line with what everybody else has seen with our peers where they had exposure there. And I think what gives me a little bit more comfort is that we've had two months of dealing, two quarters are really straight up dealing with this single family overhang and I think that the current trend is that if job growth stays in place is that the problem will get less bad as '08 goes on. So, I think that it's possible that we are passed the worst of it. We certainly been dealing with it for two quarters in these markets and I think we've got a little better handle on it. That’s the way too long of an answer to that question. But that’s kind of my view right now.
Rich Anderson: Sounds good, thank you.
Dennis Steen: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paula Poskon from Robert Baird.
Paula Poskon: Good afternoon. Can you comment a little bit on the trends that you might be seeing for reasons for moveouts other than the home ownership things like, are you seeing any changes for job lost or job transfer?
Keith Oden: In the fourth quarter, our moveouts rate was dead flat with the fourth quarter of '06. So, year-over-year we saw no change at all in the turn overrate for I mean, quarter-over-quarter. So, I think we're back to kind of a more normal situation on our turn rate, '07 turnover was clearly higher than '06. And there is not other than the home purchases, there wasn’t anything that stood out that would be meaningful. It was just the difference in home purchases and clearly we're seeing a complete reversal of that trend and it will be interesting to see how that plays out over '08. We had I think I mentioned in my comments, we're at 15% moveouts to home purchases in the quarter and that's a historically low number for us.
Paula Poskon: Thanks. And just one last question, what's happening at Potomac Yard. Are you seeing a lot of the traffic there, what's the response from the people kind of coming in?
Dennis Steen: The response has been good. The initial sort of startup of the project was a little difficult because we had all of our amenities on the top floor, our pool, our club houses and clubhouse and gym. And because of the way the building was completed, we couldn’t get access to that early. And then we sort of had some issues with signage or the neighborhood and the city didn’t want us to put a forward lease, kind of big sign on the building. We've got that dealt with and its had a very good traffic since we've finished the [many] components and have got a little bit better signage.
Paula Poskon: Thanks very much.
Rick Campo: Sure
Operator: Our last question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets
Michael Salinsky: Hi, Good morning guys, quick question with the fee income you are projecting for 2008, as it relates to the fund. Can you kind of let us out or kind of provide a description of how that plays out on a quarterly basis?
Rick Campo: I am sorry I missed the first part of the question.
Michael Salinsky: In terms of your fee income interest assuming in 2008, can you provide us a detail of how that plays out on a quarterly basis just because of the timing of the fund there?
Keith Oden: Yeah I think our fee income related to joint venture activities this year will be about $4 million, and it's going to be pretty evenly weighted between all four quarters. We'll have some in each of the quarters and which should [average] about $1 million dollars.
Michael Salinsky: There is no financing fee even with that that comes in it at one time during any other quarters?
Keith Oden: There are some fees that are all lumpy but they actually average out to about $1 million a quarter.
Michael Salinsky: Okay. And then can you touch on the January performance of some of the markets that are concerning, you mentioned may be, Phoenix, Tampa, Orlando and/or Las Vegas?
Keith Oden: January results were a little bit better, slightly better than our plan across the board, but a big part of that was, it looked like we had a little bit better month on expenses than we forecast, so nothing so far in the quarter that would be alarming. Our current occupancy rate is 90 -- on the last report it was 93.7, which was about a 40 basis point move up over the prior week. So I think we are headed in the right direction and we're on track with the plan that we laid out.
Michael Salinsky: Thanks guys
Keith Oden: You bet
Operator: Our last question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Green Street Advisors
Haendel St. Juste: Good morning, guys
Rick Campo: Good morning Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I had two small ones here. The land that you have helped for sale on your, at your balance sheet what do you estimate the market value for that in [sterling].
Keith Oden: We have not included gains on sales in our guidance on those. We do expect that the market value is probably $4 million to $5 million higher than that. Okay. Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors And the two assets, the one in Denver and Austin?
Keith Oden: The two assets that we have held for sale? Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors Yeah.
Dennis Steen: Operating assets.
Keith Oden: Operating assets.
Dennis Steen: Yeah. The two assets we have [Reggio] and [Pinnacle].
Rick Campo: Right now as you can see on Page 25 our disposition volume is between $25 million and $30 million. Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors So that probably [explains].
Keith Oden: That would be, what we expect to get from any of the proceeds on those sales. Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors And just one quick follow-up to that. You mentioned, I guess Keith in your outlook for the year that Austin and Denver are at the top of your expected performance list. Why sell those assets in those markets?
Keith Oden: A great time to be selling those assets. Those markets have a great story and they are both the average age of those two assets is 22 years. So it's perfect timing. Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors Got you. Okay, thank you.
Keith Oden: Thank you.
Rick Campo: Great. Well we appreciate your time and we will talk to you on the next call. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you for attending today's conference. The presentation has ended. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Camden Property Trust ThirdQuarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in alisten-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formalpresentation (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is beingrecorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. KimCallahan, Vice President of Investor Relations for Camden Property Trust. Thankyou. You may begin.
Kim Callahan: Good morning and thank you for joining Camden's thirdquarter 2007 earnings conference call. We hope you enjoyed the music thismorning, which featured several songs by our in-house band, the Camden Birds.Before we begin our prepared remarks I would like to advice everyone that wewill be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations andbeliefs. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involverisks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materiallyfrom expectations. Further information about these risks can be found in ourfilings with the SEC and we encourage you to review them. As a reminder,Camden's complete third quarter 2007 earnings release is available in theInvestor Relations section of our Web site at camdenliving.com, and it includesreconciliation’s to non-GAAP financial measures, which may be discussed on thiscall. Joining me today are Richard Campo, Camden's Chairman andChief Executive Officer, Keith Oden, President and Chief Operating Officer, andDennis Steen, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Rick Campo.
Rick Campo: Good morning. I’d like to thank the Camden Birds as well forproviding our pre-conference call music. And for the part they play insupporting Camden's culture. As many of you know, having fun is one of Camden'score values. With the uncertainties and challenges that our business facestoday, it is more important than ever for people to have fun. Without smiles onthe faces of our Camden team members, it is impossible to provide livingexcellence to our customers. Overall, earnings growth for the quarter were in line withour expectations. Same property revenue and net operating income growth werenot. Pricing power declined across many of our markets, primarily as a result ofincreased competition from single-family home rentals, while the magnitude ofthe oversupply in the single-family rental markets is hard to get your armsaround and varies by market. We know that apartment demand is being muted byincreased rental home competition. How long this situation lasts is amuch-debated topic. I will talk about that going forward on the call. At this point, I would like to call on Keith Oden tocontinue this discussion.
Keith Oden: Thanks, Rick. I want to address three areas in my remarkstoday. First, I’ll provide my thoughts on the overall market conditions, andhow they're being reflected in our fourth quarter guidance. Second, I’llprovide some additional details of our third quarter and year-to-dateperformance, and finally, I will address the recent SEC ruling regardingexclusive access agreements. Let's start with the current market conditions. For the lasttwo quarters we have experienced decelerating revenue growth and we had said weexpected that to continue throughout 2007, so nothing new there. What is new inCamden's world is that our fourth quarter re-forecasts, which were completed aspart of our 2008 budget process, indicates that the slowdowns will likelyaccelerate in the fourth quarter. What makes the forecast slowdown significant is that it isbeing felt in all six of our geographically diversified operating regions. As apoint of reference, in the first quarter, all six of our regions exceededbudgeted NOI In the second quarter; two regions fell short of plan. For thethird quarter, five were short of plan, and in the most recent re-forecast, allsix operating regions are projecting fourth quarter NOI to fall short of ouroriginal budget for the fourth quarter. Some of the misses are relatively minor but in Camden'scompensation structure, a miss is as good as a mile. The deceleration in thefourth quarter forecast is sufficiently widespread that its explanation must gowell beyond condo-mania, which we believe has had some impact in markets suchas Orlando, Tampa, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C. We believe that there are two major culprits, one, thecontinued deterioration in the single-family home market, which is bringingmore home rentals into competition with apartments. And oversupply of unsold single-familyhomes is a condition that exists in all 15 of Camden's core markets. This condition will continue as a headwind for multi-familyuntil the inventory of unsold homes begins shrinking. Based on the most recentprojections of new home completions versus sales, the inflection point willlikely occur in the middle of 2008. The second culprit is the declining employment growthforecast. From last quarter the employment growth numbers were revised downwardfor 2008, in 14 out of 15 of Camden's markets, with Raleigh as the only upwardrevision. In the aggregate, the employment growth forecast forCamden's markets was revised downward by 143,000 jobs, or about 25%, leavingthe revised job growth forecast for Camden's markets at around 375,000 for2008. This represents about a 25% slowdown from the 2007 job growth rate. Notbad, but than anticipated. Based on today's better-than-expected jobs number, we couldsee an upward revision to the 2008 forecast, which would certainly be welcome.Two interesting data points for the quarter are that our a percentage ofmove-outs to purchase homes actually sell to 17% in the third quarter, thelowest level we've seen in three years, and we also began tracking thepercentage of move-outs to home or condo rentals in the second quarter, and forthe third quarter, this category accounted for less than 1% of our totalmove-out. If you combine this with the fact that our overall trafficwas down 9% over the prior year, you get some statistical data that supportsthe anecdotal evidence from our operations group that a meaningful amount ofwould-be renters are bypassing the multifamily options in favor of otheroptions, most probably single family rentals. So, how does all this square upwith Camden's results? Well, this is my take. First of all, recall that Camden is the only publiclyreporting multi-family company that has applied a revenue management tool sincethe beginning of this current rent growth cycle, which began in the firstquarter of 2005. The Yield Start system attempts to provide the best possiblefit between underlying market conditions and the market-clearing price for ourrental inventory at any point in time. In order to accomplish this, it is verymuch a forward-looking system, and at any time, any given time is attempting toanticipate market conditions five to six months out and make minor mid-courseadjustments well in advance of forecast horizons, attempting to avoid pricevolatility in the future. In a purely theoretical sense, the results we would expectto see from this tool applied to our communities is as follows. As marketsbegin to recover, and pricing power improves, the forward-looking nature of thepricing engine would raise rents sooner than our competitors. At some point out in the future, as evidenced of the marketimprovement as apparent, the competition will respond and raise rents as well.When market conditions begin to deteriorate, the reverse will happen. Ourforward-looking model will begin moderating rent increases prior to our competitors. Interestingly, the facts seem to support the theory.Beginning in the third quarter of 2005 Camden's revenue growth was at the topof the sector and this continued through the first quarter of 2007. In factfrom the first quarter of '05 through the second quarter of 2007, Camden'scumulative revenue increase was second highest of all publicly reportingmulti-family companies. So we achieved larger rental increases and we got themsooner than our competitors. Beginning in the third quarter of this year our revenueslowed to our peers, which is consistent with a revenue management tool that isattempting to get ahead of the curve of a slowing market. So, it willinteresting to see what happens in the next two quarters regarding the revenuegrowth rate of us, and our competitors. If they do not begin to experience the slowdown that we arecurrently pricing into our rents, then we will seek other remedies for ourrelative underperformance. Moving on to third quarter results, during the quarter, revenuegrowth was positive in all markets except Orlando, where we have clearly seen anegative impact from both condo-mania and the single family inventory overhang. For the quarter our best revenue growth was in Austin, 8.9%,Denver at 7.8%, Raleigh 6.9%, and Charlotte at 8.9%. Sequentially, we saw samestore revenue declines in three markets, Tampa, Orlando, and Phoenix. Weexperienced sequential NOI declines in most markets due to seasonally higheroperating expenses in the third quarter. Year-to-date, our operating expenses are up 3.8%. However,it is important to note that excluding the expense component of our bulk cableand valet waste initiatives our year to date increase in operating expenseswould be about 2%. Moving through our year-to-date same store results, bestrevenue growth year-to-date is in Austin at 8.8%, Raleigh 7.7%, Charlotte 7.2%,Denver 6.3%, and Phoenix 6.2%. NOI growth was positive in all markets exceptOrlando, which was essentially flat. The best NOI growth was in Austin with 17.6%, Denver at9.3%, Charlotte at 9.0%, Houston at 8.8%, and Dallas at 8.4%. Overall, ouroccupancy was down 40 basis points from the second quarter, 94.9 to 94.5 andcurrently stands at about 94.3. Our turnover rates were up sequentially fromthe second quarter but were in line with the 2006 results. Finally, I would like to give you our take on this week'sSEC ruling. Based on our discussions at the SEC's meeting and press conferenceon October 21, 2007, and the written statements of the SEC commissioners andtheir news release, we understand the following. The SEC ruled that existing and future exclusivearrangements for video services and agreements between apartment owners andcable companies are unenforceable. The ban is limited to exclusive access,which is defined as a grant of rights provided through an easement or licenseto a video service provider to exclusively provide cable services, utilize thecable system and a market service to residents in the community. Camden is a party to three such agreements, and this rulingwill actually allow us to pursue more favorable agreements on those threecommunities. Bulk service arrangements such as Camden's Perfect Connections arenot in any way affected by the ruling. In fact, one commissioner expressed substantial support forbulk service arrangements. Exclusive marketing agreements were also notaffected by the ruling, although the SEC did indicate that it would seekcomment in the future on whether it should take any action on bulk or exclusivemarketing arrangements. Camden's Perfect Connection is consumer friendly as itprovides cable service to our residents at a discount to the market forindividual subscribers of the incumbent provider. In summary, the immediate impact of the ruling is a slightpositive to us, and we believe that there is minimal risk to our cable revenuein the foreseeable future. Next up, we have Dennis Steen, Camden's ChiefFinancial Officer.
Dennis Steen: Thanks, Keith. I will begin this morning with a review ofour third quarter results. Camden reported FFO for the quarter of $56.3million, or $0.91 per diluted share, at the midpoint of our prior guidance of$0.89 to $0.93 per share. We achieved the midpoint of our third quarter FFO guidanceas moderating revenue growth in our market as Keith just discussed produced a$1.1 million, or 0.9% unfavorable variance to our same store revenueexpectations for the third quarter. This unfavorable variance was completely offset by favorablevariances in other income, property management expense and property operatingexpense. One additional item of note on our operating results,interest expense for the third quarter totaled $27.7 million, in line with ourexpectations, but down $1.5 million from the second quarter of 2007. Thedecline from the second quarter is the result of the reversal of interestaccruals, totaling $2.5 million in the year to date period, relating to taxpositions we inherited in the Summit merger. The reversal more than offset the increase in interest expenseon higher debt balances incurred in the third quarter to fund our increase inreal estate assets and share repurchases. On the transaction front, we completed no acquisitions ordispositions during the third quarter. Nine assets classified as held for saleat quarter end, the two Fort Worth communities, Camden Terrace and Ridge, weresold in October for $24.2 million in line with our expectations. Six communities, Camden Ridgeview in Austin, CamdenEastchase in Timber Creek in Charlotte, Camden Glenn in Landover, our twoassets in Greensboro and Camden Isles in Tampa are all currently under contractand expected to close during the fourth quarter. Camden Pinnacle, the last of the nine in Denver, iscurrently being marketed but not expected to close until 2008. Assuming thefourth quarter closing on the six assets currently under contract, our 2007disposition volume will be approximately $180 million of 20-plus-year-oldcommunities as we continue to exit non-core markets and trim our exposure to older,more capital-intensive assets in our core markets. Taking a look at our debt structure as detailed on page 22of our supplemental package, unsecured debt increased $133 million during thequarter, as we used our line of credit and other short-term borrowings to fundour increase in real estate assets and our share repurchases during thequarter. Total outstandings under our line of credit and othershort-term borrowings were $548 million at September 30. On October 4, weentered into a $500 million unsecured term loan facility, using the proceeds torepay all short-term borrowings and reducing the balance under our $600 millionline of credit to less than $100 million. With over $500 million available under our line of credit,we have ample capacity to meet our funding needs over the next severalquarters. The $500 million term loan is a five-year term after extensionoptions. It is priced at LIBOR plus 50 basis points and we fixed our LIBOR ratethrough an interest rate swap for the entire term at 4.74%, resulting in aneffective interest rate of 5.24% for the five years. Moving on to earnings guidance, we expect fourth quarter FFOof $0.91 to $0.96 per diluted share, resulting in full-year 2007 FFO of $3.62to $3.67 per share. The midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance of $0.935 centsrepresents a $0.025 per share improvement from the third quarter, resultingprimarily from the following. A $0.02 per share increase in same-store net operatingincome, as same-store revenues are expected to be relatively flat, and propertyexpenses declined as seasonally expected in the fourth quarter. Full-year 2007 same property NOI growth is now projected tobe between 4.5% to 5%, with revenue growth between 4% and 4.5% and expensegrowth between 3.4% and 3.8%. We also will have a $0.01 per share increase innon-same store NOI as the increasing contribution from development communitiesand lease-up more than offset NOI loss on expected dispositions. A $0.03 per share increase in non-property income related tofees and other income from third party development and construction activities.These three positives will be partially offset by a $0.04 increase in interestexpense, primarily due to the interest accrual reversals recorded in the thirdquarter that I previously mentioned. At this point, we'll now open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be now conducting aquestion-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Our first question is fromJonathan Litt with Citigroup. Please state your question.
Craig Melcher - Citigroup: Hi, it is Craig Melcher here with Jon. I just wanted to geta little more color on the 4Q cautionary statements, and how has October shapedup? Has that been softer than the 3Q average or is this purely on what you'reexpecting based on the lease numbers?
Keith Oden: Craig, the results in October are consistent with ourreforecast, which was a basis for us moving our guidance on same store NOIresults. So yes, the October results are consistent with that. We don't havefinal results, but we have enough insight into the revenue expense componentsto know that it is consistent with our forecast.
Craig Melcher - Citigroup: And how is YieldStar incorporating the renting out of thesingle family homes into the numbers which would be causing the rents comingdown a bit more than you're seeing, the competitors?
Keith Oden: It is a good question, Craig. There is really not any, thereis no direct comping that we can do as we can do with our multifamilycompetitors, but where it shows up in is in reduced traffic and reduced overalldemand at our communities and our competitor's communities. So while there is no direct link in the model, clearly thatis part of the background of what is going on from on the supply side of theequation, and it shows up in the model through reduced traffic numbers, andthen also weaker results at our communities and our competitors.
Craig Melcher - Citigroup: The last question is just on the development pipeline. Doesthis revision impact your views on any development activity or developmentstarts going forward?
Dennis Steen: Craig, our investment committee reviews all of ourdevelopments on a periodic basis, and pretty much every couple of weeks ormonths, in terms of where we are on the various starts. And at the end of the day, each project is evaluated and weevaluate it given its current marketing conditions if it hasn't started alreadyand I can tell you, we have delayed a couple of projects, based on currentmarket conditions in Florida and we may delay some more. But it just depends on sort of what is happening in themarkets, and the answer is yes, we're reviewing our developments on an ongoingbasis, and we are dealing with them appropriately.
Craig Melcher - Citigroup: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Alex Goldfarb with UBS.Please state your question.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Good morning.
Richard Campo: Good morning Alex.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Maybe I missed it in the opening discussion, but could youjust give us your thoughts on cap rates? A number of your peers have commented,essentially it has been maybe a 25 basis points shift plus or minus, dependingon location and quality but just curious on your thoughts.
Richard Campo: Right. I think we're in that same camp, I mean we have -- weare active in the market with all of our folks and in our various regions,looking at properties, and trying to, ferret out value out there. And you really haven't seen any major moves in cap rates. Ithink that most people are talking, 25 bits plus or minus and I think we havesort of evidence based on some sales we just completed, the two properties thatsold in Fort Worth actually closed in the last week or so. They were originally put under contract in August, wentthrough their due diligence period. This is a small example, but the originalprice under contract was around 24.7 or 24.8, something like that, and weultimately took a reduction in the price of $600,000. Closed the deal at a $24.2 million number, which effectivelyincreased the return by about 18 basis points to the investor, and theyfinanced the project with a Freddie Mac 77% loan to value mortgage, so there isfinancing out there, it was closed. And the effective cap rate was in the sort of mid sixes, ifyou use sort of standard underwriting, which is 250 a door and 3% managementfees. If you put actual CapEx that we were experiencing, the cap rate was 5.4,5.5, something like that, so we have seen actual deals close. But yes, the cap rates have gone up slightly, but again inthat particular example, that was in the range of our target from our low toour high, in terms of what we thought the property would trade for. So we were happy to get the deal done at an 18-debt increasein cap rate. It was within our tolerance zone of where we thought the propertyshould trade at.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Okay. The second question is just your thoughts on where --on the term market, term loan market, versus the unsecured market, just want toget your sense of what you see as a tradeoff between rates and covenants, andthen also, are you seeing any openings in the unsecured debt market that youmay be willing to -- to go back to issuing unsecured in the near term?
Dennis Steen: Well, first, as it relates to covenants, the covenants underour term note are identical to the covenants that we actually have under ourline of credit. So we were already operating under those covenants, so there isreally no impact to us. As it relates to the term loan market itself, when we closedthe transaction, it was probably 60 to 70 basis points inside of what we coulddo in an unsecured bond offering. That probably has narrowed a little bit,probably more in the 50 to 60 basis points difference. So there still is a premium that the unsecured bond marketis getting over the term loan market itself.
Keith Oden: I think at the end of the day, the term loan just shows thatthere are additional pockets of liquidity out there for well-run companies togo tap and it is because of the issues in the other part of the unsecuredmarket, it just was more -- cheaper to go out and deal with the term loan asopposed to going to the unsecured market. The other thing that is out there for multifamily that isvery different than other commercial real estate is Freddie and Fanny. I meanthey are a tremendous fours in the multifamily market and they are out therefinancing lots of different borrowers currently.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: So you're not inclined to back to the unsecured market inthe near term.
Dennis Steen: Only through our joint ventures, but we are very happy towork with Freddy, and fanny on our joint ventures and we will continue to dothat. We will not put secured financing on Camden's balance sheet, but we willthrough our joint ventures.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: But unsecured, the unsecured debt market.
Dennis Steen: Oh, I'm sorry, absolutely, we will be back in the unsecureddebt market when it makes sense to go back in there. I think at the end of theday, I think it’s come back some from the sort of -- some of the uncertainty inthe summer and after Labor Day. But, when you can execute a transaction like our financialteam did on the term loan, there is no reason to go into the unsecured market.So we will go -- we will be an unsecured borrower, we will issue bonds in thefuture. And when the market settles down, and you can have lessuncertainty in that marketplace, and less volatility, we will be back. But itis sort of the -- at the end of the day, it’s all about where you can get thebest pricing for your financing, and the term loan was a much better option todo.
Alex Goldfarb - UBS: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Habermann with GoldmanSachs. Please state your question.
Mark Biffertok - Goldman Sachs: Hey guys its Mark Biffertok. First question I guess over thefew years, the talk is been about the gap between the cost rankers is own inthe market. And given that you're now saying that housing is becoming much morecompetitive, can you just talk a little bit about where that spread iscurrently? And you know, are people willing to pay more to be in a house if itis a smaller gap?
Keith Oden: Yes. The gap is still -- I mean the numbers that we look at,which Ron Witten employs and I think most people look at them that way, the gapfrom rent to own is still significantly, from an historical standpoint, abenefit, to the benefit of renting. Now the gap has narrowed, there is no question about it. Andthat’s primarily come from the decline in single-family home prices. Butoffsetting that in the last six months has been the increase in the interestrates that people have to pay. So there has been some narrowing. But from the standpoint ofcompetitiveness, the rent to buy issue with regard to single-family homepurchases is still a significant advantage. The difference and the distinctionis what’s going on, on the single-family rental side of the equation. And the fact that people -- that the underlying rents onvacant single-family homes did not necessarily bear any relation to what thecost of a homeowner to own that home would be. It would be is sort of whateverthe market-clearing price is in that rental. So, the change of the competitive balance in our portfoliohas been primarily the result of the influx of rental inventory of single-familyhomes. Not necessarily a narrowing of the rent to own spread for single-familyhousing.
Richard Campo: We've seen the percentage of people moving out to buy homesgo to a very low level, 17% during the quarter, compared to 20s two or three orfour quarters ago. So it’s not about people wanting to go buy a home, but whenyou have inventory when you can rent a home relatively cheap because somebodyis not covering their mortgage payment and they really don't care about, thatthey're just trying to get the best amount of cash flow they can, that’s wherethe competition is. It is not the psychology changing from people to go buyhomes again.
Keith Oden: And Mark, also, one of the things that is very differentwith regard to the single-family home situation that we are seeing right now,is that it is also an issue for qualifying. What was going on previously wasn'tso much about the competitive pricing and can someone, can they affordultimately the payment on the mortgage that they took out. But all of the -- the fallout from the sub prime borrowing,and the no doc loans, et cetera, that piece of the puzzle is where we weregetting hit the hardest with regard to move-out and home purchases out of ourrental inventory. And that, regardless of what happens on home prices in thefuture, I think for the most part, that era is behind us, at least until thenext time.
Mark Biffertok - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And the unit types that were hit the hardest, is thatyour three and two bedroom?
Keith Oden: Yes, absolutely. Three bedrooms, those are always going tofeel the impact first, but most of -- we don't have a large percentage of threebedrooms in our inventory, somewhere around 5% in the total portfolio. But we definitely are seeing the impact. And if you look atthe vacancy and you stratify it, we have a much higher percentage of twobedrooms vacant right now than what you would typically see. So I think that’s consistent with the underlying theory thata lot of these folks are ending up in a rental home.
Mark Biffertok - Goldman Sachs: Okay. So if you look at the fourth quarter guidance that youguys have given, what puts you had the top end of that range versus the lowend? Are there any land sale gains or things that would potentially coming inthe fourth quarter that would push it to the high end or is it simply a matterof maintaining occupancy?
Keith Oden: I don't think there is anything unusual in the fourthquarter so hitting our occupancy number is the key driver for the fourthquarter.
Mark Biffertok - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from David Bragg with Merrill Lynch.Please go ahead with your question.
David Bragg - Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning. Just want to follow up on Alex's questionearlier, and touch on the assets that are under contract right now. Where mightwe see cap rates come out there versus your expectations of a few months ago?Would it be in line with that 25 basis point move?
Dennis Steen: Well, actually the projects that are contract right now werenegotiated post summer. So, we put the properties on the market during thesummer, and then had a very widely marketed situation, and the pricing forthose that came in where we fix those or sign those contracts about maybe lessthan a month ago, we're negotiating the current market. So, we didn't expect a lot of changes from where we were inthese particular assets, because the market was the market. By the time theywere sold. Or they were put under contract. So what we did get, pretty much inthe middle of the zone of where we thought we would get pricing on theseproperties, when we put them out for sale at the beginning of, sort of themiddle of the summer. So, we haven't, at the end of the day, we still feel reallygood about the pricing on those properties, and are hitting right in the middleof the range of our expectations.
David Bragg - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then after closing on those, just as we lookdispositions going forward, where might we see just market-wise that activitycoming from? Is there any change to your thinking on what markets to sell in?And then also given that, could you just provide your updated thoughts onbuying back the stock at these levels?
Keith Oden: Our dispositions, once the kind of non-core markets havebeen dealt with and included in these asset packages of transactions inGreensboro, which cleans up the non-core, markets. Our disposition strategy will continue to be looking at theassets that are scheduled and slated in our world to have the lowestyear-over-year change in return on invested capital, and those are almostalways going to be the assets that tend to be older, that have more CapExrequirements, and then the second consideration is always maintaining ourmarket balance. So, where we have a significant development pipeline, a newsupply coming, we're always looking at those markets for recycling capital, butat the end of the day, our disposition strategy absent the core markets andexiting the non-core markets is driven by our expectations of future changes inreturn on invested capital.
Dennis Steen: As far as the stock buyback, we will continue to be in themarket on a selective basis. At the end of the day, it is about where we canmake the best return on our investment. And today, with the current sort of uncertainty in the stockmarket, and financial stocks, and REIT stocks in general, and oursspecifically, we think that the stock at this level is a good value relative towhat properties sell on Main Street for, and as evidenced by sort of ourdetermination in the last sort of cycle where we had this happen, in the sortof '98, '99 time frame, where we bought back nearly 20% of the outstandingshares. So far, we bought back 86 or $87 million. We have a $200million authorization from our board. As long as we can continue to sell assetson Main Street for a dollar, buy them back from Wall Street for a discount onthat dollar, and maintain our balance sheet flexibility, and our sort ofleveraged neutral situation with buying the stock, we will continue to do that.
David Bragg - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Just the last question for you, at your investor day,you touched on your efforts targeting foreclosed homeowners, but what othermarketing activities are you looking into? For example we noticed a couple of weeks ago on your websiteyou were highlighting a deal of the century in Tampa offering no fees. Whattype of activities such as those are you pursuing and how are those beingreceived so far?
Keith Oden: Well, the one that you mentioned is kind of interestingbecause it started as an initiative here in Houston, the Deal of the Century,and that's something that we, as we develop national marketing programs withour marketing group here, we make them available to our regional operators, anddepending on what their needs are, they will either access them or not, butthat is one in particular that we've had great success with. We are a marketing-driven company. And we are heavilyoriented towards outreach marketing. It is a requirement of all of our on-sitemarketing professionals, that they engage in systematic outreach marketing tothe businesses in the communities that we serve, and so that is never going tochange. Now, as the market changes, different opportunities willpresent themselves. The one that you mentioned about marketing specifically tothose unfortunate homeowners who are facing a foreclosure, that's going to bean issue in more and more of our markets. If our view of what is going on inthe single family housing markets continues to unfold. Right now, that program is actively engaged in Las Vegas andTampa, which are probably two of the more challenged markets with regard tosingle family inventory, but I would expect that over as the foreclosures pileup in some of these other markets, it is going to be an initiative that we'regoing to utilize there as well. We are constantly seeking ways to make sure that we are atthe forefront of marketing our communities and now more than ever is theappropriate time to be doing those kinds of things so we will continue alongthose lines.
David Bragg - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: The next question is from Matt Ostrower with Morgan Stanley.Please go ahead with your question.
Matt Ostrower - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Just, can you guys comment on the degree thatthis, it is very hard to quantify the rental market from the single familyperspective, but can you talk about the degree to which that is being affectedby price point in your communities? Are you finding that the lower rent part of your communitiesare somehow less affected by this than some of the higher rent communities?
Keith Oden: I don't really, as you look at the results in ourre-forecast for the fourth quarter, I would have to tell you that it is acrossthe board. Because while you might be intuitive to say well, if you stratifiedyour portfolio, and you had a price point of X, and Y market, the problem withdoing that is the price point for the entry level to the rental market is verydifferent market to market. And you know, southern California is a totallydifferent experience than Denver, which is completely different than Orlando. But I can just tell you that the anecdotal evidence from ouron-site staff and that is kind of supported by the top-down macro view is thatthis is probably the largest, and we think the largest culprit in the weakdemand, and then second to that would be the moderating job growth. But it is -- I think it is across the board and clearlythere is probably a little bit of bias towards if are you in a Tampa, maybethere is a bias towards the higher end of our portfolio, but as I look at ourmove-outs to home purchases, across our entire portfolio, in the last quarter,it ranged from a high of 27% in Charlotte, to a low of 8% in L.A. So there isquite a bit of variation in those numbers, but overall, I think the trend ispretty intransigent.
Richard Campo: I would add, though, that even though it is hard to get yourarms around some of this data about people moving out for home, the demandbeing siphoned off the top for home, we do have a higher vacancy in our twobedrooms than our one bedrooms and that would indicate that price point isdefinitely an issue, the two bedrooms are going to be more expensive than theone bedroom, so you have people who are in the one bedrooms, and the lowerprice point product that where we have our best occupancy. So, I think that when you look at the components of wherewe're struggling, it is definitely in the more expensive apartments by virtueof them being bigger. So I think that you could draw some inference to that beingthat the lower price point folks are not moving into houses as much as thehigher price point people, and then the higher price point people perhaps arefolks that require extra space, and then get pushed even further into a singlefamily home option because they want more space for a lower price, if you will.
Matt Ostrower - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks. And then on the timing that you talked about,you talked about potentially the starting to abate in mid '08. It just seems tome that a lot of the forecasts out there really aren't calling, that a lot ofthese sort of recovery numbers are being pushed way out, right? Especially given all of the re-sets that start to happennext year. Why would you be saying '08 instead of '09 or even 2010.
Keith Oden: My mention of '08 in my comments is strictly the inflectionpoint of the difference between the addition to new, the incremental additionof new homes to the inventory, through completions, and the projectedsingle-family home sales rate. That is not a resolution of the plus or minus $1.5 millionto $2 million unsold homes that are out there. It is simply saying we thinkthat is probably the peak of the unsold inventory.
Dennis Steen: The other thing I think you add to that too is that when yougo market-by-market-by-market, you look at Las Vegas as an example, I mean theyclearly are one of the poster markets for foreclosed homes and excess and allof that. And the complication in Las Vegas, however, is that thetiming of new casinos coming online, it just so happens that there is not a lotof new casinos this year, but there are a bunch under construction that opennext year, so the job outlook for Las Vegas, which has fallen off from - LasVegas for the last 15 years, has been in the top two or three markets on apercentage basis for job growth, this year it has had very anemic job growthbecause there haven't been any new hotels opening; they are in the pipeline,but they haven't been opening and next year the Las Vegas job growth isprojected to be a lot better than this year. So, along with sort of a moderating, sort of a peaking ofthe home inventory, you are also having a pick-up in jobs. The same thing canbe argued about Orlando as well. Even though it looks like Orlando has sort ofperhaps turned the corner and maybe should improve sort of towards the secondand third quarter of 2008 and it is definitely job related. And so you have to sort of take both the inventory numbers,the single-family home overhang and then what is going to happen to the jobmarket. Again, that is really the driver.
Matt Ostrower - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the timing of yourre-forecast, did you do that re-forecast before or after your investor meeting?
Dennis Steen: After.
Matt Ostrower - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Dennis Steen: We also did one before the conference as well, but everyquarter, we re-forecast, so it is not like we re-forecasted because we wereworried about the world. We just re-forecast as a general rule.
Operator: The next question is from John Stewart with Credit SuisseGroup. Please state your question.
John Stewart - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Rick, can you give us a sense for how much of theportfolio that you think, what's kind of non-core that you would expect to movethrough in 2008?
Richard Campo: The question is non-core?
John Stewart - Credit Suisse: Yes. In other words, I'm trying to get a sense for whatlevel of dispositions we might look for next year?
Richard Campo: Our level of dispositions, generally, are going to runanywhere from if we just in a perfect world, they're going to run anywhere from200 to $300 million.
John Stewart - Credit Suisse: Okay. And can you kind of speak briefly to your investmentphilosophy going forward? I guess that particularly given your comments aboutthe leverage neutral share buyback any additional share repurchases wouldprobably be funded with proceeds from asset sales, but you're obviously kind ofpulling in the reins on development a little bit. How do you think about where you might be inquisitive givenwhere you see cap rates going forward? And to what extent do you think you needto keep your powder dry in this environment?
Richard Campo: I think keeping your powder dry sort of right now is a goodthing to do. And just given the uncertainty of cap rates and those kinds ofissues, so we are not a very aggressive buyer of properties or acquisitions atthis point. We are being definitely more selective on our developmentside. I think at the end of the day, it really will be -- we will just have tosee how it plays out and if the arbitrage between the private market and thepublic market continues and we see the opportunity to sell more assets and buystock, we will do that. On the other hand, you always have to be in the market,we're in the business of buying, selling and developing real estate, and whenit makes sense to buy, we will buy, and when it makes sense to develop, we willdevelop and when it makes sense to do nothing, we will do nothing. And that issort of the philosophy. It is hard for me to imagine the value in terms of beingable to its my investment decision is buying the stock at these levels, orbuying an asset from Main Street at a dollar, I just can't see us doing that.Now, that doesn't necessarily mean we wouldn't do a joint venture or wewouldn't have a structured type of transaction, maybe we will be in themezzanine business again. And there is a lot of opportunity out there in thisdislocation. With the lower leverage that is required in this currentmarketplace, there are definitely, when there are dislocations, there areopportunities for people with the powder dry.
John Stewart - Credit Suisse: Okay. That's helpful, thank you. Keith, you mentioned thatyou guys are the only publicly traded multi-family REIT that has had a revenuemanagement system really through the cycle. What are you doing to stay ahead ofthe curve, tracking the single-family shadow market?
Keith Oden: Well, the single-family shadow market, as we talked about, alittle bit, is very hard to get your hands around. But what you can do, though,is you can look at market-by-market and you can look at the historical levelsof kind of the normal level of unsold inventory and then you sort of comparethat to what excess inventory is in the markets today, relative to historicalnorms and if you just go down the list, there is not a; I think we have onemarket of ours that currently has less single-family home inventory than whatthe historical norm is. And that happens to be Raleigh, which interestingly enoughis only market that had a positive forecast in the fourth quarter. So, the factis, is that the unsold inventory well above historical levels, we know thatthat is going to find a home, whether it is a single-family home sale, kind ofat a fire sale price or where people are going to hang on and put them in somekind of a rental mode. What percentage of that falls into which camp, that is areally hard one to tell, but I can just tell that you the anecdotal evidencefrom our on-site staff is pretty compelling that when they're losing, peoplegive their notice of non-renewal and our community managers as part of ourdiscipline call them up and say what's the deal and more and more, they'rehearing, we have an opportunity to rent a really great home. And the pricing of those rental homes has become very, verycompetitive in the markets that we operate in. So, it’s hard to quantify it.What we know, though, is when we see our traffic rates down and we see theanecdotal evidence from our community managers that that is in fact occurring,you just put two and two together and the conclusion is kind of self evident,but I think it will be interesting to see how it plays out in the next coupleof quarters.
John Stewart - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Paoli with ABP Investments.Please state your question.
Richard Paoli - ABP Investments: Hi, guys. I'm curious to recall the treatment of concessionsthrough the Yield Star system, I think that you basically do upfront rightpricing and not really a lot of concessions and contrast that with what youused to do in the past before this. Is it just that we're maybe seeing, the real effects of sortof softening rents faster because they're up front versus sort of kind ofburning down concessions, building up concessions over time and amortizingthat?
Keith Oden: Rich, the short answer to your question on revenuemanagement is, is that we do it completely on net effective pricing. So, in ourworld today, if were you to look at it, the amount of concessions and it only wouldbe fee concessions and those type things is trivial, so the answer is yes, wedo net pricing. It is a very interesting point you raised though and it is withregard to what behavior would have been among our regional staffs and ouron-site community managers in the old world and by the order world, I meanabsent revenue management. In the old scenario, without the discipline of a revenuemanagement system, where people make decisions, pretty much on an emotionalbasis and are almost always driven by what their current occupancy or forecast,60-day out occupancy is, the bad behavior that comes from that, which isimpossible to administer in any kind of disciplined way, the bad behavior thatcomes from that is, if you see that your projected NOI is might fall below whatis in your budget, then there are all kinds of things and machinations andhoops that people will jump through in order to maintain currently above NOI orbudgeted NOI, because there are great incentives built into our process and ourculture and our bonus structure, with regard to making your monthly NOI number. So, the bad behavior of the old days, which is make in orderto maintain occupancy at all costs, is you see heavy discounting of rents orconcessioning. And in a revenue management world, that is not possible. It is amarket-clearing rent. But it leads to me that conversation leads to the next one,which is there is unquestionable, in my mind, that what many of our competitorsare doing right now, and I'm not necessarily talking about the publiccompanies, I'm just talking, it is a very small percentage of the overalluniverse, I'm talking about the world out there, and the lowest commondenominator. There is no question in my mind that what they're doing isexactly the bad old behavior from the bad old days, which is heavilydiscounting units that don't need to be discounted in order to plug a hole inan occupancy which only creates a bigger problem six and 12 months out. So in a revenue management world, yes, you're going to seethe impact of that slowdown sooner, but you're going to maintain a disciplinethat will allow you to maintain the integrity of your overall rental structureso that when things do turn around, and stop declining, then we will be in aposition with a well-positioned rent role to take advantage of that. So that is also in my mind part of the explanation for whyyou kind of look at the competitive set today, and their NER performance versusours I think that is part of the answer and really the next six months willtell.
Richard Paoli - ABP Investments: So if we as onlookers need to get a little more accustomedto I guess both reported rent volatility on both the down side and the up sidebecause of the smoothing nature of the concessions. 
Keith Oden: What I think you should be looking for, as more people takeon revenue management, you should look for a closer fit to the underlyingmarket conditions. So, whatever if there is a real hard up-tick, as we saw in2005. You should see a hard up-tick in revenues. If there is areally hard downtick, the revenue management system will recognize that andrespond accordingly. But what you also can expect is that over the period of acycle, both up and down, that the total revenues will be maximized. 
Richard Paoli - ABP Investments: Right.
Keith Oden: You may get there in a really different way than what yousaw in the past, which is this lagging behavior, as people try to figure out ifthe market was really getting better, and then this incredibly lagging behavioras people hung on to last month's pricing in the face of a declining market.
Richard Paoli - ABP Investments: My only other question is, and forgive me if I missed this,on the sequential operating expense increase, I know seasonality played a bigfactor but I think just in my own mind's eye the number looks a little largerthan normal. Is there any sort of unusual items that drove that?
Keith Oden: Yes, we had some big tax adjustments in the quarter, Rich,which is other than the seasonality that we normally see, because of the turncosts in the quarter, and some higher utility costs, it is all explained bysome relatively significant tax adjustments in the quarter. And again, I would caution and guide people back to the yearto date expenses, which are year to dates 3.8 and if you strip out the utilitycomponent of the expense items that we have to run through for our PerfectConnection and Valet Waste, it is closer to 2% year-over-year and that's thenumber that we're very happy with.
Richard Paoli - ABP Investments: Does the higher and I know you're not officially getting '08and haven't probably finished the budget but the higher tax adjustments portenda little higher level of expense growth next year?
Keith Oden: Rich, I don't think so. We have in the past three or fouryears, when the dust all settles on revaluations and rates and our protests andlawsuits, we consistently come in around the 3% year-over-year expenseadjustment. And I don't think that our '08 budgets will be materially differentfrom that. But it is a fight every year. And you start out withvaluations that always scare everybody around here, and then we work throughthe process, and somehow or another, it always ends up at about a 3% expenseincrease on the taxes.
Richard Paoli - ABP Investments: I see. So this was -- these are sort of new tax bills comingin for the future year, and not necessarily a win or a loss on stuff that youare fighting on this year?
Keith Oden: It is a combination of both.
Richard Paoli - ABP Investments: Okay.
Keith Oden: It is a combination of both. But I think when it is all saidand done this year on tax, we had some adjustments earlier in the year that wetook a positive adjustments, and we had some give-back in this quarter, butoverall, to plan, taxes are not going to be a big part of the problem.
Richard Paoli - ABP Investments: Great. Thank you.
Keith Oden: You bet, Rich.
Operator: The next question is from Haendel St. Juste from GreenStreet Advisors. Please state your question.
Haendel St. Juste - Green Street Advisors: Thanks, guys. Actually, my questions have been asked. But Ithink Craig has a question.
Craig Leupold - Green Street Advisors: Yes, Keith, just from your prepared remarks and yourcomments about an accelerating slowdown in the fourth quarter, I kind of workedthrough your numbers for full-year guidance versus year to date, and it lookslike you're kind of implying a fourth quarter year-over-year revenue growthnumber in the low 3% range. And I know you guys haven't provided guidance for '08, but Imean that is a pretty negative trend coming from 3.6 in the third quarter whereyou guys were in the first half of the year. Do you think that carries out tofurther deceleration in '08 or is there some level of seasonality in thatfourth quarter number? And I'm trying to sort of contrast where you guys are andsort of your negative comments versus the only other two companies that areproviding guidance for '08 at all on a revenue side are kind of in the high 3%to low 4% range for next year.
Keith Oden: First of all, you're very quick with your math, althoughthere is a way to move, when you're using the midpoint of the guidance, I thinkwhat we will end up with at our midpoint of our guidance is about a 3.4%revenue growth versus the 3 that your numbers indicated. So I don't think that the deceleration is quite what you hadin mind. But as you look out into 2008, we're going to go through our process,and we're in the midst of that right now. And with regard to kind of thinkingthrough where '08, puts us, we will just have to see, and we will provide youwith real detailed guidance on that when we have it. But I think that the fourth quarter will be interesting. Notonly for us, but also some of our other competitors, and I think as you look atthe fourth quarter of '07, and out into the first quarter of '08, I think theywill be real instructive for what the direction of the market is.
Craig Leupold - Green Street Advisors: How much of that, though, might reflect seasonality? Or isthis really kind of more market trend as opposed to….
Keith Oden: Craig, there is always seasonality in the fourth quarter,but we also budget for seasonality in the fourth quarter, so what is -- thething that has got our attention that is very unusual for us is to have all sixoperating regions with a reforecast that is below fourth quarter originalbudgets. I mean that is just -- I can't tell you -- I mean I've beendoing this for 15 years and I don't think I've ever seen that happen before.Except in the year where we -- I think we had one year where we revisedguidance and everybody missed, but heck, that was evident by the second quarterthat everybody was going to miss. So that is a little bit unusual for us. And so yes, there issome seasonality in it. But we also -- we plan for some seasonality. So it issomething different than that.
Craig Leupold - Green Street Advisors: Okay. Thanks.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: The next question is from Karin Ford with KeyBanc CapitalMarkets. Please state your question.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. If I'm looking at my numbers correctly, Ithink sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter last year, you guyslost about 90 basis points of occupancy. Do you think you could see the sametype of sequential decline in occupancy sequentially again this year? Or do you think that because you're starting from a lowerbase, that number won't be quite so dramatic?
Keith Oden: Yes, I don't think we will see that kind of decline, Karen.We ended the third quarter was 94.5 on average and we're slightly below that aswe stand here today. But the decline last year was really the unusual part ofthat was the third quarter occupancy number. So I don't think we will see anything like that. I think wewill see some -- potentially see some moderation from the 94.5, but I don't seeit anything like it was in the third and fourth quarter and last year.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Second question, I wanted to ask you about your comments onthe SEC. I think you said the commission viewed your bulk purchase arrangementin Perfect Connection positively. But just given the rationale behind the ruling was to giverenters more choices and to provide more competition among the providers, I'mcurious as to whether or not you think the commission at some point would wantto modify the sort of the forced purchase of the requirement that residentspurchase cable in Perfect Connection in the future.
Keith Oden: The only specific comments, and these were in conversationsthat Greg McDonald, who heads up all of our cable initiatives, and deals withall of the regulatory matters, he actually had a conversation with one of thecommissioners, and in the course of the conversation, there were some publiclyreported positive comments about bulk agreements. But the rationale behind the positive view on bulkagreements is simply what you just said which is, the commission, at least thisone commissioner, viewed that, that is a way for consumers to aggregate theirpurchasing power and actually get a better bargain with the cable companies. Because, if you think about the Perfect Connection, in themarkets where we are operate, in every case, we are offering our residents alower monthly cable rate than what they could get individually as subscribers. So the SEC's view of that is I think, ultimately it is aconsumer friendly arrangement as long as we are passing on what in effect is abulk discount and some portion of that to our consumers. So I think there is atotally different political question or concept with regard to the bulkagreements. With regard to the exclusive access, the reality is, is thatour agreements right now do not preclude, and would not in the future precludeAT&T or Verizon or some one who has the technology to transmit cableprogramming over a phone line from doing so. In fact that is no different than the situation we haveright now with regard to satellite dishes. We still, believe it or not, westill have quite a few people in our portfolio, we have fewer, which is a goodthing, but we still have quite a few who have a satellite dish attached totheir railing outside their apartment. But they're making the choice to say, yes, they're going topay for not only Perfect Connection, but they want to pay for whateverprogramming they're getting from a dish that they can't get through theincumbent provider. And most cases, there are a lot of foreign language channelsthat aren't available through the incumbent providers. But the point is that isthe reality that we have right now with regard to satellite dishes. And peoplecan choose to do that. Now, the question of saying, yes, but you're requiring thebulk arrangement, well, that's true, we're requiring the bulk arrangement,because that's the only way that business model works and that's the only waywe can guarantee the discount to our existing customers.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay.
Keith Oden: But I think it is a different thing than what they've tryingto get at right now, which is the exclusive access agreements that there reallyanti-competitive, and we've seen said that and we've been screaming at foryears and we have three agreements that we would love to get rid of. So anyway,I think it is a different set of facts.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: SEC aside, given the direction the market looks to beheading, do you think that could affect your ability to have people acceptthings like the Perfect Connection in the future?
Keith Oden: That's not even, I could tell you it is not even on theradar screens of the questions that we are having right now with our, andconversations we're having with our on-site staff. It really has not been anissue with regard to rolling it out. We continue to roll it out in new markets. We just kicked offLas Vegas here about three months ago. And we're way ahead on our penetrationrates of what we expected in every case. So, I think people, that's a value proposition, cablepenetration rates on most of our communities are in the 80, 90% range. People arepaying for it now, with Perfect Connection, they get it, they pay less.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks.
Keith Oden: You bet.
Operator: The next question is from Rich Anderson with BMO CapitalMarkets. Please state your question.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Hi, good morning still for you guys. I guess, the firstquestion is I listen to this and it is like Yield Star has been around for twoyears, has two years of history, and we're really hanging our hat on somethingthat doesn't have the history that you guys have, as real estate professionals. So, I mean is there a chance that it could be wrong?
Richard Campo: Rich, that is a very interesting question.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: I'm picturing you guys going to work every morning and likekneeling in front of the Yield Star terminal and bowing to it or something.
Richard Campo: No, look, Yield Star is a tool, okay? It has to be managedby people. And people have to ask the question every day, on-site manager, yourdistrict managers and we have Yield Star pricing specialists that deal withissues that come up, and so it is in fact a tool, not a panacea. It is not on autopilot. It is managed every single day by thepeople running their properties. The different in the past was you didn't havean ability to forecast and you didn't have an ability to run all of the numbersthat Yield Star runs. What it does simply is forecast and figure out all of thepermutations that you need to understand as you're marketing, as you're runninga property. Now, I will tell that you, we have had a lot of discussionin-house about okay, what about Yield Star, we question it all the time, weanalyze it, we have people running numbers, on what it is doing and when it isdoing it and how it is doing it. And so it is not just on autopilot and we run our businessand don't look at what it is doing every day. The issue you get is you have toremember that in the past, and what a lot of people are still doing today thatdon't use yield management is they're using their emotions to drive theirdecisions. And when a manager gets to 93 or 94% occupied and they'remissing their budgets, it is easy for them to discount units. And you have to thinkabout the math on discounting units. If you drive occupancy up 100 basis points by giving a monthor two free and then amortize in that month or two free over the life of thatlease, you are much better off letting your occupancy drop and having a lowerrental rate to make that deal as opposed to giving two months away that affectsyour cash flow stream over a much longer period.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: I understand that it is not, as you described. I mean thereis a lot of thought that goes into it, but I think it was Keith who sort ofsaid we're the only company that are using revenue management over an X periodof time and you think that that is the reason, why you guys are seeing it andother people aren't seeing it.
Richard Campo: I think that's right, because our people aren't giving twomonths free and jacking their occupancy up.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: But what happens next quarter, or the quarter after that,your peers aren't seeing this single-family rental, in fact, could we thenconclude that this is just a Camden thing?
Richard Campo: I think that is a very good question, because that’s thequestion that we debate in-house. Because we obviously look at all of themarket data, we look at all of the competitors with that information and wecompare it to our properties and we go, let's scratch our head, what's going onand when you start looking at the net effect of rents and you also haveconference calls with all of our regional people. And when regional people tell us that their competitorsacross the street are giving a month free or two months free and we're not, weknow what is going on and when you start looking at the net effect of rents andyou also have conference calls with all of our regional people and whenregional people tell us that their competitors across the street are giving amonth free or two months free and we're not, we know what is going on. And so I would say that if we see that Camden is underperforming over the next two or three quarters compared to our competitors thenwe have to say, well we have something else going on other than the marketfalling apart or the market being weak because of home sales or something likethat. But if you take key sort of went through these numbers andwe don't want to say, well, look at last year when we under performed thisyear, but if you take the rental rates that people are charging at thebeginning of 2006, and you take the rental growth in the markets and put a topset together of the same markets to our competitors. Our average rent per apartment is higher now than ourcompetitors if you take rent to rent from 2006 to where it is today. Now, wegot a lot of our growth in 2006, and our growth moderated in 2007, but the absoluterent that we're collecting on our properties is higher today than ourcompetitors. Now the issue you have now, however is that our rentalrevenues are moderating. And if our rental rates or rental revenues continue tomoderate and our competitors don't, then we have a bigger discussion and abigger question to ask. But a quarter or two doesn't make a trend. We will seewhat happens. 
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: To your point it will be interesting.
Richard Campo: It will be very interesting and we absolutely believe thatrevenue management is something that helps our people operate their businessesa lot more effectively than the emotional roller coaster that they're onwithout any kind of help.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. The second question is, on buying back stock, if youknew that your stock was going to be unaffected in sort of the next year or so,from a buyback program, you knew it was going to go down, or somehow, you hadthe foresight would you still buy back stock? The question is, are you buying back stock to support yourstock price or are you buying back stock because you think it is the rightinvestment?
Richard Campo: We are not buying back stock to support the stock price.There is no way you can buy enough stock with the current rules that you haveand when you can buy…
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Send a signal.
Richard Campo: To support your stock price in any way. So our investmentdecision, on buying stock, has nothing to do with our ability to affect thestock price. It is a real simple calculation. Basically, whether you think thatreasonable investments at that price relative to the alternative investmentsthat you have.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Understood. I just wanted to send some strong signals aboutbuying back stock, and so are others, and it clearly is probably the rightinvestment, but, you are eating up dry powder in the process, and it is notgetting anywhere in the stock.
Richard Campo: Well, as long as a disconnect exists on Main Street and wecan buy stock at good prices and sell it cheaper than we can assets and thenmake sense.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Thanks, guys.
Richard Campo: You bet.
Operator: The next question is Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital.Please state your question.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Good morning, guys. With your reduction in NOI and revenuegrowth expectations, have you seen any movement in development yields or havecost moderations basically, specifically on the garden side, products, helpedoffset this? I know you had mentioned pushing back a couple of projects inFlorida.
Richard Campo: From a development perspective, our current pipeline, wehaven't seen any real erosion of our yields and our current pipeline that isunder construction today an I think you're exactly right and less pressure oncosts and we're not having big cost overruns now which is a good thing. Obviously, and I think where the pressure is, and from adevelopment perspective, is the pipeline that hasn't started today, and yes, wehave delayed a couple of projects, as a result of pressure in the markets thatwe didn't anticipate. So we don't need to start projects tomorrow. We're not we'redriven by total return on our projects, and at the end of the day, we willevaluate them as the market goes, and if they don't make sense, we won't buildthem.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Secondly, with regard to the land parcels that have you forsale, have you seen any moderation in land prices to date?
Richard Campo: We have seen some moderation in land prices. No question.The homebuilders and condo buyers that were running land prices are up clearlynot doing that now and they're marking to market some of their land portfolios.We as a matter of fact have had a number of land parcels under contract, fornew development pipelines that we have renegotiated and dropped or cut priceson and what have you. So yes, land prices have moderated. And the properties we'reholding for sale have moderated some. But we have pretty big profits built intothese land sales so we don't have any diminution of any land on our balancesheet or anything like that.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay then final question, at your investor day, you hadmentioned that you had sent out some pamphlets to some of the peopleessentially that are under pressure, the single-family markets. Have you seenany change in credit quality or have you seen any demand pickup or positiveresults from that? 
Richard Campo: We haven't seen any diminution of credit quality. The keypoint to the marketing program is that we are still underwriting credit, and aslong as the people, if they have a foreclosure, getting ready to be foreclosed,we will ignore that as part of the credit, but we will not ignore bad credit. So if the people were not paying their credit card bills, orpaying their phone bills or whatever, then they're still not going to be ableto lease a Camden apartment. If they just have happen to be the unfortunate oneand didn't read fine print on the mortgage and it went up and doubled and can'tmake that payment. We're okay. Or we have seen leases in Las Vegas and I thinkin Tampa with the program. And it is working. How much, we just started a fewmonths ago, so we haven't been able to get a big fix on how many actual leaseswe're getting but we know we are getting leases.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks, guys.
Richard Campo: Absolutely.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue. I would like toturn the call back over to Mr. Campo for closing remarks.
Richard Campo: Great. We appreciate the time everyone spent on the calltoday and we look forward to seeing a lot of you at NAREIT in a couple ofweeks. So thank you very much and we'll talk to you next quarter, and see youat NAREIT.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnectyour lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
